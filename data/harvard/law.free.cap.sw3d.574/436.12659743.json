We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For medical-fee disputes proceeding to a SOAH hearing provided for by the Legislature, as here, the SOAH hearing is to be \"a de novo contested-case hearing on the reimbursement or refund claim.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vista Med.

Similarly, it is the provider's claim to a certain amount of reimbursement refused by a carrier that initiates the MFDR process, an inherent part of which is the SOAH hearing. By invoking the MFDR process, the provider is seeking to change the status quo-the status quo being that the carrier has refused to pay a reimbursement claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the provider is the party seeking \"affirmative relief\" (in the form of reimbursement) throughout the entire review process under the workers' compensation regime, despite a carrier's challenging a reimbursement award at any given stage within the MFDR context.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manbeck v.

It follows that the provider is the party \"seeking relief\" on its reimbursement claim from the Division and, by extension of the Division's exclusive jurisdiction and delegation to SOAH, from that tribunal as well. Thus, the provider carries the burden of proof in de novo contested-case hearings at SOAH conducted on the provider's claim to reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Yet, the ALJ explicitly placed the burden of proof on Carrier when he concluded that \"Carrier failed to carry its burden that Provider is not entitled to $20,495.78 in additional reimbursement.\" Carrier was, therefore, required to prove a negative, and the result of its failure to prove that negative means that Provider is unequivocally entitled to the same amount awarded by the MDRO-$20,495.78-without\n   having to bring forth any evidence supporting that amount, apart from the MDRO's decision itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such legal and procedural error prejudiced Carrier's substantial rights because, as a result thereof, Carrier was ordered by the Division to pay Provider a sum of money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, the ALJ's improper burden-shifting rendered the Legislature's grant of a contested-case hearing to Carrier useless; if an ALJ may simply uphold the decision of the MDRO on the basis of the MDRO's decision itself, there is a lack of any meaningful review, despite the Legislature's express provision for a SOAH hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Columbia Med.

A dissatisfied party's subsequent filing of a petition for judicial review-after the lack of any meaningful review at SOAH-would only magnify the error and constitute yet another layer of meaningless review. After all, how would\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   administrative record\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   contain substantial evidence to support an ALJ's conclusion that a carrier\n   <em>\n    failed\n   </em>\n   to prove a negative, especially when a provider presented no relevant evidence? The ALJ's legal and procedural error requires reversal and remand for a new contested-case hearing in accordance with this opinion, in which Provider has the burden of proving the amount of reimbursement to which it claims it is entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, we sustain Carrier's fifth issue and hold that the trial court erred in affirming the SOAH Order.
