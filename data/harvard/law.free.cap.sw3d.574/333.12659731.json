Dowd, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Mississippi Lime Company (\"Employer\") appeals the decision of the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission (the \"Commission\") awarding David Hogenmiller workers' compensation benefits based on a finding that Hogenmiller sustained a five-percent permanent partial disability of the body as a whole as a direct result of work-related tinnitus. Employer contends that the Commission erred by finding that Hogenmiller's expert, Dr. David Mason, an audiologist with a Ph.D. in hearing science, was qualified to testify regarding the nature, extent, and cause of Hogenmiller's tinnitus. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Employer owns and operates a manufacturing plant where Hogenmiller worked for 41 years. Hogenmiller testified that he worked around loud machinery for over 20 years at the plant and for many years he was required to wear hearing protection due to workplace noise. Hogenmiller, who had military experience, testified that he would not have been able to hear an M14 rifle discharge over the sound of the machinery he worked around. Also, he testified that the motorcycles he owned and rode were quieter than the noise at the plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In his workers' compensation claim, Hogenmiller asserted that he suffers from tinnitus as a result of his work for Employer. The Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") received testimony from Hogenmiller's expert Dr. Mason and Employer's expert Dr. Mikulec, a medical doctor with a specialization in otolaryngology. Dr. Mason testified that Hogenmiller suffered a five-percent permanent partial disability of the body as a whole as a direct result of his work-related tinnitus. Dr. Mikulec testified that Hogenmiller suffered no disability related to his employment and that Hogenmiller's tinnitus was caused by aging, not his exposure to noise at the plant. Employer objected as to the admissibility of Dr. Mason's testimony, claiming Dr. Mason was unqualified to offer expert testimony\n   on the nature, extent, and cause of Hogenmiller's tinnitus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The ALJ overruled Employer's objections and found Dr. Mason's testimony to be admissible and credible and awarded Hogenmiller benefits representing five-percent of the body as a whole. The Commission affirmed the ALJ's award. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Our standard for reviewing decisions of the Commission in workers' compensation cases is found in Article V, \u00a7 18 of the Missouri Constitution and \u00a7 287.495.1\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   .

Specifically, Employer argues that because Dr. Mason did not review any medical records, and because his opinion that Hogenmiller suffered from work-related tinnitus was based solely on Hogenmiller's subjective reports, Dr. Mason lacked any superior knowledge regarding the relevant subject matter that might assist the trier of fact and thus his testimony was inadmissible under \u00a7 490.065. Employer also claims that Dr. Mason's report was inadmissible because it was not based on reliable data as required by \u00a7 490.065.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Applicable principles of Missouri law regarding expert medical testimony.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 490.065\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.

Dr. Mason conceded that a claimant may attempt to manipulate the responses to the questionnaire and during the sound-matching procedure. However, he then testified that through his many years of experience he developed methods to distinguish between the credible and the less-than-credible responses. Specifically, Dr. Mason stated that there are certain responses to the questionnaire and during the sound-matching procedure that are strongly indicative that a patient has tinnitus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Employer argues that Dr. Mason's training and practice as an audiologist do not qualify him to render opinions on the cause of tinnitus or the extent of disability caused by tinnitus. In finding Dr. Mason qualified to testify as an expert on tinnitus, the Commission relied upon,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Mason's familiarity with the practice of audiology through his decades of experience as an audiologist from 1983 to 2003 and his many professional roles for various institutions. While we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the admissibility of an expert's opinion because that involves the interpretation of \u00a7 490.065,\n   <em>\n    Kivland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320641\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/331/299/#p310\">\n    331 S.W.3d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the extent of an expert's training or experience goes to the weight of the testimony and does not render the testimony incompetent.\n   <em>\n    Whitnell v.

App. E.D. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We reject Employer's argument that Dr. Mason was unqualified to testify about tinnitus because he has focused his practice on the field of audiology and not on tinnitus. Given Dr. Mason's background and experience in audiology, alongside his multitude of other credentials, and considering that he has developed informed techniques to measure a claimant's tinnitus, we find that the Commission did not err in finding that Dr. Mason was qualified to testify as an expert on tinnitus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We also find for the same reasons that Dr. Mason's report is admissible. Dr. Mason's report consists of Hogenmiller's subjective responses to the questionnaire and the results from the sound-matching procedure, which we have held to be sufficient to support Dr. Mason's opinion in this case. Consequently, the Commission did not err in finding that Dr. Mason's report was admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we affirm the Commission's award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Sherri B.
