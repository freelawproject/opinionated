HARRISON, Judge\n   Eagle Bank &amp; Trust Company appeals a $ 66,569.58 judgment entered against it in the Faulkner County Circuit Court. The bank argues that Arkansas Code Annotated section 4-4-303 -a provision in the Uniform Commercial Code for banking-gives a bank like it a \"reasonable time\" to comply with a writ of garnishment. The circuit court decided that the statute did not apply. Although the bank presents a novel argument, we hold that the circuit court did not err in finding that the bank is liable to Raynor Manufacturing Company. The statutory \"reasonable time\" period conflicts with specific garnishment statutes and Arkansas Supreme Court case law that has held a garnishee's potential liability starts when the writ of garnishment is served.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.B.

(doing business as BCI Management Company). On 1 August 2017, Raynor obtained a default judgment against Bid Central for $ 102,905 in the Faulkner County Circuit Court. On August 3 at approximately 2:20 p.m., Raynor served Eagle Bank with a writ of garnishment, by certified mail, to the office of Eagle Bank's registered agent in Little Rock. The writ directed the bank to lien on all money belonging to Bid Central. The writ contained five interrogatories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the bank held no money belonging to Bid Central when the writ was served on August 3. This was because on 31 July 2017, the day before the default judgment was entered against Bid Central, Eagle Bank had guaranteed a cashier's check. The cashier's check was for 100 percent of the account balance. Consequently, on August 3, Bid Central's deposit account at the bank was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 4 at approximately 8:45 a.m., an agent for Bid Central deposited the cashier's check ($ 66,569.58) at an Eagle Bank branch in Vilonia, Arkansas. The teller deposited the check into Bid Central's closed deposit account. The deposit reopened the account. In less than two hours, however, the money was wired out of the account and to a creditor, minus a $ 15 transaction fee. The deposit account was then closed, again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 10, Michelle Garth, an Eagle Bank customer-service manager, filed an unsworn written statement in the circuit court responding to the writ's five interrogatories. On September 5, Raynor filed more interrogatories and requests for document production in the circuit court; one month later the bank filed responses to Raynor's requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Raynor moved for judgment against the bank in November 2017. The circuit court convened a hearing in May 2018 on Raynor's motion. The sole witness was Michelle Schrodt, an Eagle Bank employee and twenty-seven-year banking veteran who runs all the bank's branches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Schrodt explained that when the bank receives a writ of garnishment it checks whether a relevant account exists and then places a \"hold\" on the account. She explained that there is a \"two-day research period\" in the garnishment training and testified that \"the State said there's two days\" to see if there are any federal benefits\n   in the account that cannot be garnished because those benefits are \"protected funds.\" When asked if safeguards were in place to ensure that nonprotected funds are captured if the accountholder makes a deposit during the two-day research period, Schrodt replied \"yes.\" She said that the account would be flagged, signifying that a writ had been received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Schrodt said that the writ in this case was delivered after 2:00 p.m. on August 3 and the bank closed at 5:00 p.m., including the Shackleford branch in Little Rock. According to Schrodt, after the bank received the writ it started a review to see if there was a relevant open account. The review revealed that Bid Central's account was closed July 31. So on the date the writ was served on the bank, Bid Central's deposit account was closed. Schrodt agreed that the bank had no process in place to flag a closed account. Only open and active accounts are flagged. Schrodt said that it was not a routine or frequent occurrence for a former account holder to reopen an account after it had been closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Schrodt conceded that the bank possessed $ 66,569.58 that belonged to Bid Central for a two-hour window of time, or until approximately 10:47 a.m. on August 4. When the account reopened no steps were taken to assess whether there was a pending garnishment on the reopened account. Schrodt said it is not the bank's standard practice to inquire whether a garnishment issue existed on a closed account. The transaction was discovered when Michelle Garth pulled up the account the afternoon of August 4 while preparing to answer the writ's interrogatories. No other account activity occurred after the single deposit and wire transfer occurred on August 4. Schrodt conceded that Garth's August 10 answers to the interrogatories were not sworn or notarized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On cross-examination, Schrodt said that she has worked for six or seven different banks and that it is not usual practice for a bank to put a hold on a closed account. She also explained that in all the places she had worked, it is typical for a bank's employees, not an attorney, to answer a writ of garnishment and the associated interrogatories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The circuit court asked Schrodt some questions, too. She confirmed to the court that if a defendant/customer has an open account then the bank's central office can immediately notify all branches that it has received a writ of garnishment. The circuit court understood the process to be that the garnishment would be sent from Eagle Bank's mailroom to an office at the Shackleford location that handles garnishments for the bank; then after some data entry, the account is \"flagged.\" Schrodt did not specifically state how long that process would take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 18 June 2018, the circuit court entered an \"order on plaintiff's denial of garnishee's answer and default judgment.\" It found that Raynor \"met its burden under Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a7 16-110-405(a)\" and established that Eagle Bank's answer was \"insufficient because the answer is not in affidavit format\" under section 16-110-127(a) (Repl. 2016). As we mentioned earlier, the court also found that \"Ark[ansas] Code Annotated \u00a7 4-4-303 is inapplicable to the facts in this case.\" Recounting Schrodt's testimony, the court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   [f]or its failure to impound proceeds belonging to the Defendant, the Garnishee's liability to the Plaintiff is for the same amount that the Garnishee had in its possession during the pendency of the writ.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Garnishee's response to the writ is insufficient in that the answer is not in affidavit format.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Garnishee's response should be and is hereby deemed a nullity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-24\">\n   After service of the writ on the Garnishee, the Garnishee had in its possession for approximately two hours the sum of $ 66,569.58 that otherwise belonged to the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    The Garnishee failed to impound the sum of $ 66,569.58 that it had in its possession.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    The Garnishee is liable to the Plaintiff in the same amount the Garnishee had in its possession.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    Pursuant to [Ark.

Immediately, in other words.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Here, Eagle Bank argues that it should not be liable for the amount transferred from Bid Central's account on August 4 because section 4-4-303 gives banks a reasonable time to comply with legal process, garnishments are included in the \"legal process\" category, and the bank did not have a reasonable time to prevent the wire transfer. According to the bank, the circuit court erred when it deemed the section \"not applicable\" and declined to determine whether the bank had a reasonable time to comply with the writ. The bank points to cases from other states' courts that have rejected the view that a writ of garnishment is immediately effective upon service because the Uniform Commercial Code provides banks a reasonable time after receiving a writ of garnishment to process it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Harbor Bank of Maryland v.

Raynor maintains that the circuit court's \"spot-on interpretation and application of the law in light of the facts of this case\" should be affirmed because Arkansas law has long required the bank to have immediately impounded the funds Bid Central deposited into its open-then-closed-then-reopened account on August 4; and because the bank failed to do so, the judgment is legally justified.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Eagle Bank's reliance on cases from Maryland and Connecticut, for example, is understandable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    3A Norman J.
