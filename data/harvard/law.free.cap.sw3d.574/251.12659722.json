(collectively \"Franklin\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Universal Underwriters Insurance Company and Zurich American Insurance Company (collectively \"Universal\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Lewellen appeals: (1) the judgment denying insurance coverage on her claim that Franklin committed fraudulent misrepresentation in the sale of a vehicle; (2) the summary judgment in favor of Universal on her claims concerning a civil conspiracy to commit a fraudulent transfer and violations of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act (\"MMPA\"); and (3) the summary judgment in favor of Universal on her claim for tortious interference with a business expectancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Universal cross-appeals the judgment granting insurance coverage for actual and punitive damages on Lewellen's MMPA claim. Franklin's cross-appeal alleges a series of procedural and evidentiary errors that he contends resulted from the improper striking of his pleadings after several alleged discovery violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For reasons explained herein, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October of 2007, Lewellen purchased a vehicle at Franklin's car dealership during the \"Drive for Life\" promotion. Based on the promotion, a sales representative told Lewellen that she could purchase a vehicle and make payments of $49.00 a month for one year, at which time she could return the car and pick a new vehicle under the same payment arrangement. Lewellen signed loan documents stating that she would be responsible for making market-rate payments for the vehicle; however, she was reassured by the sales representative that, pursuant to the promotion, Franklin would send her monthly checks to offset the difference between the $49.00 promotional price and the market rate. After the purchase, Lewellen received the offset payments from Franklin for approximately six months. She was unable to make the market-rate payments once the offset payments stopped, and her vehicle was repossessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2008, Franklin became a party to several lawsuits alleging a variety of claims and damages relating to the \"Drive for Life\" promotion. During this time, Franklin was insured by Universal. Universal denied defense and coverage for the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 21, 2008, Chad and CFS Enterprises, Inc. filed suit against Universal alleging wrongful denial of their insurance defense. In December 2009, Chad and Chad Franklin National Auto Sales North filed a second lawsuit against Universal alleging bad faith. Tiffany Franklin, who at the time was Chad's wife, was also a named insured on the Universal policy and was added as a party to both lawsuits. David Mayer of the law firm Monsees, Miller, Presley, &amp; Amick, P.C. represented all plaintiffs in these lawsuits against Universal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 31, 2010, Universal, Franklin, and Tiffany Franklin agreed to a settlement that disposed of the bad faith claims against Universal. As part of the settlement, Universal agreed to make a payment of $900,000 to Chad and Tiffany Franklin. These funds were disbursed as follows: $250,000 to Fifth Third Bank, $266,370.41 to Tiffany Franklin, and $383,629.59 to Mayer's law firm. The distribution to Fifth Third Bank, a secured creditor of Franklin's car dealership operation, was made pursuant to a garnishment filed against Universal. This $900,000 settlement agreement is the transfer that Lewellen would later allege was fraudulently made between Universal and Franklin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 15, 2010, Lewellen filed suit against Franklin alleging fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of the MMPA. In June 2012, Lewellen was awarded $25,000 in actual damages and $1 million in punitive damages against Chad individually for his fraudulent misrepresentation, and $25,000 in actual damages and $500,000 in punitive damages against Chad Franklin National Auto Sales North, LLC for a violation of the MMPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lewellen was also awarded attorneys' fees totaling $82,810.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In April 2013, Lewellen filed the instant action against Universal and Franklin. In Counts I and II of her third amended petition, Lewellen asserted equitable garnishment and declaratory judgment claims against Universal seeking insurance coverage for the judgment against Chad and Chad Franklin National Auto Sales North on her fraudulent misrepresentation and MMPA claims. In Counts III through VII, Lewellen asserted claims of fraudulent transfer, MMPA violations, civil conspiracy, joint venture/joint enterprise, and a bill in equity against Universal and Franklin based upon their August 2010 settlement agreement. In Count VIII, Lewellen asserted a claim of tortious interference with a business expectation against Universal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court held a bench trial on Counts I and II of Lewellen's third amended petition. Count I alleged an equitable garnishment claim against Universal in which she sought coverage for the judgment against Chad and Chad Franklin National Auto Sales North on her fraudulent misrepresentation and MMPA claims. Count II requested a judgment declaring that Franklin's insurance policy with Universal applied to Lewellen's judgment and damages. The court declined to reach Count II and entered judgment on Count I finding that Lewellen's fraudulent misrepresentation claim was not entitled to coverage, but that her MMPA claim was covered under Franklin's policy with Universal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In March 2017, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Universal on Counts III through VIII. Discovery proceeded on Lewellen's claims against Franklin. After Chad failed to appear for his deposition, the court struck Franklin's responsive pleadings and entered a default judgment in Lewellen's favor on the fraudulent transfer and MMPA claims. During a subsequent trial on damages, the jury awarded Lewellen $266,370.41 in actual damages and $450,000 in punitive damages on each of her two claims. The punitive damages were divided among the defendants: Chad was assessed $250,000 ($500,000 total) individually, while Chad Franklin National Auto Sales North and CFS Enterprises were each assessed $100,000 ($200,000 total). The court merged the actual damages on the two claims but granted the total amount of punitive damages and awarded Lewellen $189,060 in attorneys' fees. Lewellen appeals. Franklin and Universal cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Equitable Garnishment Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both Lewellen and Universal challenge the equitable garnishment judgment in several of their points on appeal. Lewellen contends the court erred in denying insurance coverage for the damages awarded on her fraudulent misrepresentation claim, while Universal contends the court erred in allowing coverage for the damages awarded to Lewellen on her MMPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In determining whether Universal's policy affords coverage for the damages awarded Lewellen, we interpret the insurance policy\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swadley v.

Thus, we will affirm the circuit court's judgment \"unless there is no substantial evidence to support it or unless it is against the weight of the evidence, it erroneously declares the law, or it erroneously applies the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmitz v.

Coverage for Fraudulent Misrepresentation Claim\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    i. The fraud and dishonest act exclusion is not ambiguous.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In Point I, Lewellen contends the circuit court erred in denying insurance coverage for the damages awarded to her and against Franklin on her claim of fraudulent misrepresentation. She asserts that the insurance policy exclusion concerning dishonest and fraudulent acts is ambiguous and should be construed against the insurer, Universal, to provide coverage for the damages award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The exclusion at issue states: \"This insurance does not apply to: (a) INJURY, EMPLOYMENT RELATED DEFENSE, COVERED POLLUTION DAMAGES, CUSTOMER COMPLAINT DEFENSE, or STATUTE AND TITLE E&amp;O, if caused by any dishonest, fraudulent or criminal acts committed by any INSURED.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lewellen alleges that the words \"dishonest\" and \"fraudulent\" create an ambiguity because the terms serve to include several forms of conduct, some intentional and others unintentional. The policy does not confer any special definition to these terms; therefore, we may look to the dictionary definition of the terms to illuminate our path.\n   <em>\n    Strader v. Progressive Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8352033\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/230/621/#p624\">\n    230 S.W.3d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 624 (Mo. App. 2007). \"Dishonest\" is defined as \"characterized by lack of truth, honesty, probity, or untrustworthiness, or by an inclination to mislead, lie, cheat, or defraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Dishonest\n   </em>\n   , WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 650 (1993). \"Fraudulent\" is defined as \"belonging to or characterized by fraud[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Fraudulent\n   </em>\n   , WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY at 904, with \"fraud\" defined as \"an instance or an act of trickery or deceit esp[ecially] when involving misrepresentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Fraud\n   </em>\n   , WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY at 904.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Applying dictionary definitions of the terms \"dishonest\" and \"fraudulent\" to the language of the exclusion, we find no ambiguity. An ordinary person of average understanding would clearly understand that purchasing this policy would not protect against acts that were designed to mislead, perpetrate a fraud, or those involving trickery, deceit, or misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seeck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8332744\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/212/129/#p132\">\n    212 S.W.3d at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lewellen attempts to create an ambiguity where none exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lewellen's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Dean Johnson\n   </em>\n   , to demonstrate that the fraud exclusion is ambiguous is similarly misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Dean Johnson\n   </em>\n   , we reviewed a grant of summary judgment for the insurer concerning the relationship between two policy clauses-one that set forth the insurer's duty to defend the insured, and another that the insurer said removed that same obligation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013997\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/905/529/#p533\">\n    905 S.W.2d at 533-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We found the fraud exclusion in that case, which is similar to the one at issue in this case, to be ambiguous with respect to the insurer's duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013997\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/905/529/#p533\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013997\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/905/529/#p533\">\n    at 534-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We did not find that the fraud exclusion was ambiguous in its exclusion of coverage for damages assessed against an insured, however.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013997\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/905/529/#p533\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, we specifically stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-33\">\n   A more reasonable interpretation, and one which gives effect to both the exclusion and the provisions for defense costs for Legal Damages and for Product Related Damages, is that the\n   <em>\n    exclusion simply excluded coverage for damages actually awarded against the insured for acts proved to be intentionally dishonest or fraudulent.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013997\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/905/529/#p533\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Lewellen's Point I is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The definition of \"occurrence\" does not provide insurance coverage for damages on Lewellen's fraudulent misrepresentation claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In Point II, Lewellen further contends the circuit court erred in denying insurance coverage for the damages awarded against Franklin on her claim of fraudulent misrepresentation. In this point, she makes a series of arguments in an attempt to demonstrate that the previously-discussed fraud exclusion, and a different exclusion for acts committed with the intent to cause harm, do not apply to Franklin's conduct. Before reaching the fraud and intent exclusions, however, we must first decide whether the definition of \"occurrence\" contained in the insuring agreement provides coverage for the damages awarded on Lewellen's fraudulent misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a threshold matter, both parties allege that the other has the burden to demonstrate the applicability of the \"occurrence\" clause of the policy to the instant conduct. Because the operation of the \"occurrence\" language and its applicability to the conduct at issue presents a question of coverage, and not one of exclusion, it is well-settled that the party seeking coverage-here, Lewellen-has the burden to prove that Franklin's conduct is covered under the \"occurrence\" clause contained within the policy.\n   <em>\n    Universal Reins. Corp. v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greenleaf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9963279\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/824/80/#p83\">\n    824 S.W.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 (Mo. App. 1992). If we must reach the policy exclusions, however, it is an equally well-settled proposition that the burden of demonstrating that an exclusion applies to bar coverage is one carried by the insurer.\n   <em>\n    Manner v.

Even if we were to accept Lewellen's argument that she pleaded both intentional and negligent versions of this tort and the judgment left both open for use, she has plainly chosen to advance the theory of an intentional act. During the underlying trial, Lewellen offered punitive damage instructions that were modeled off of Missouri Approved Instruction (\"MAI\") 10.01-the instruction charging punitive damages for\n   <em>\n    intentional torts. See\n   </em>\n   Notes on Use [2008 Revision] to MAI 10.01 (\"Where the claim for actual damages is submitted on negligence as opposed to an intentional tort, MAI 10.01 is not applicable; use MAI 10.02 or MAI 10.07, whichever is appropriate.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sharp v.

Further, Universal provided the court with evidence supporting its contention that Lewellen had argued, in the underlying trial, that Franklin\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to defraud her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the interlocutory entry of default took the question of liability from the jury and, therefore, limited what facts were necessary to the jury's finding, the court's judgment concerning liability and Lewellen's subsequent litigation strategy during the damages portion made Franklin's intentionality a material and necessary fact to the judgment. It was only during the equitable garnishment proceeding, when it became clear that asserting an intentional tort would harm her interests, that Lewellen reasserted her negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As an occurrence is an accident, defined as an injury caused by the negligence of the insured that was neither intended nor expected, and we have determined that Franklin acted intentionally, we find that the insurance policy does not provide coverage for Lewellen's fraudulent misrepresentation claim. \"When an intentional act results in injuries which are the natural and probable consequences of the act, the injuries as well as the act are intentional.\"\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9928552\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/642/113/#p116\">\n    642 S.W.2d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When Franklin intentionally completed the fraudulent misrepresentation, it was a natural and probable consequence that Lewellen would suffer the type of injury that ultimately occurred. Because we have found that the fraudulent misrepresentation claim is categorically denied coverage because it is not an \"occurrence,\" we need not reach Lewellen's arguments concerning the applicability of other exclusions. Lewellen's Point II is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Coverage for MMPA Claim / Concurrent Proximate Cause Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In Universal's Points I and II, Universal contends the circuit court erred in finding Franklin's policy covers Lewellen's MMPA claim. Universal asserts that the fraud exception should prevent coverage under Coverage Part 500 and the policy definition of occurrence should prevent coverage under Coverage Parts 970 and 980. In Point III, Lewellen asserts that, not only does Franklin's policy afford coverage to her MMPA claim, but the coverage of that claim triggers the concurrent proximate cause rule granting coverage to\n   her extinguished fraudulent misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Coverage Part 970 and 980 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-50\">\n   WE will pay for LOSS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Coverage Part, in excess of\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (a) coverage provided in any UNDERLYING INSURANCE;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (b) coverage provided to an INSURED in any other insurance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (c) in the absence of (a) or (b) the retention shown in the declarations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Loss is defined as \"all sums the INSURED legally must pay as DAMAGES because of INJURY to which this insurance applies caused by an OCCURRENCE.\" The definition of occurrence applicable to Lewellen's claims is the same definition as the one contained in Coverage Part 500. Further, the conduct underlying the fraudulent misrepresentation and MMPA claim is the same conduct. As we have previously found Franklin's actions were intentional and, therefore, not occurrences, we find the same for the MMPA claims. No coverage is extended under Coverage Parts 970 and 980. Universal's Point II is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   That does not end the inquiry, however. It is unclear whether Lewellen seeks coverage for her MMPA claim under the clause for \"customer complaint defense\" or \"statute and title E&amp;O\" contained in Coverage Part 500. Coverage Part 500 defines \"customer complaint defense\" as \"any SUIT filed against YOU during the Coverage Part period by or on behalf of a customer arising out of the sale, lease, rental, service or repair of YOUR PRODUCT, other than as a direct result of an OCCURRENCE or as defined in STATUTE AND TITLE E&amp;O.\" As for Statute and Title E&amp;O, Coverage Part 500 states, in pertinent part: \"WE will pay all sums the INSURED legally must pay as DAMAGES (including punitive DAMAGES where insurable by law) because of STATUTE AND TITLE E&amp;O when such insurance is included in the declarations.\" Statute and Title E&amp;O is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    We will refer to Chad Franklin and the related corporate auto sales entities collectively as \"Franklin,\" as their interests are, for purposes of this case, singular.

However, this case does not involve a failure to plead facts that demonstrate entitlement to relief. Lewellen pled that she was entitled to relief on her claims of equitable garnishment because the insurance policy issued by Universal extended coverage to her claims. Ambiguity is a legal argument among the panoply of issues presented within such a claim; therefore, Rule 55.05 does not act to exclude any evidence of ambiguity. Moreover, the ambiguity argument was raised in response to Universal's claim that an exclusion to the policy justified the denial of coverage.

Regardless of which section ultimately applies, the claim is still governed by the exceptions to the policy that we have discussed\n    <em>\n     supra.\n    </em>\n    As we previously determined that Franklin engaged in an intentional, fraudulent tort, we now find that this conduct is specifically contemplated by Exclusion (a), which states \"This insurance does not apply to: (a) INJURY, EMPLOYMENT RELATED DEFENSE, COVERED POLLUTION DAMAGES, CUSTOMER COMPLAINT DEFENSE, or STATUTE AND TITLE E&amp;O, if caused by any dishonest, fraudulent or criminal acts committed by any\n    INSURED.\" Therefore, no coverage is extended to Lewellen's MMPA claim.

Lewellen asserts that the award of punitive damages demonstrates that we adopted legal remedies for this claim implicitly following Colorado's expansive interpretation.

In\n    <em>\n     8000 Maryland\n    </em>\n    , Huntleigh Financial Services, Inc.

The holding of\n    <em>\n     8000 Maryland\n    </em>\n    does not support Lewellen's contention that the UFTA expanded the\n    available remedies to include legal damages and the creation of an action for civil conspiracy against a third party. Longrow was not a third-party participant in the transfer but, instead, was the transferee in receipt of the fraudulently transferred funds.\n    <em>\n     8000 Maryland\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300126\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/292/439/#p451\">\n     292 S.W.3d at 444\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The UFTA specifically allows a court to enter a judgment for monetary damages against transferees for the value of the asset transferred.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    \u00a7 428.044.2. Money damages awarded under that section are not predicated on a separate cause of action; rather, money damages are a single remedy amongst many from which the circuit court can choose. Lewellen asks that we hold that the UFTA creates a new cause of action against a third party. We decline to create that remedy absent the necessary statutory authority.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Mark VII\n    </em>\n    holding stands, and we now explicitly join the majority of jurisdictions in finding that, absent a proper lien, a claim of civil conspiracy against a third party cannot be maintained under the UFTA. The UFTA prescribes a suite of equitable remedies, and the circuit court is afforded substantial discretion in fashioning those remedies to each situation before it. Those remedies do not include Lewellen's suit as currently constructed against Universal. Out of an abundance of caution and for the sake of clarity, we reiterate that the discussion,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , applies only to a claim of\n    <em>\n     civil conspiracy\n    </em>\n    to commit a fraudulent transfer. There are undoubtedly several ways in which Lewellen could have structured her claim to warrant the award of monetary damages or to cause the voidance of the transfer between Universal and the Franklins if the transfer, was in fact, fraudulent. These potential statutory remedies prescribed by the UFTA are not limited by our holding in this point. Instead, we find that the issue presented by Lewellen on this point is one of cause of action and remedy mismatch. Put another way, Lewellen sought a remedy precluded by her cause of action\n    <em>\n     unless and until she was able to present evidence of a valid lien.\n    </em>\n    As she did not present evidence of a lien, she did not carry her burden as to the civil conspiracy action and is, therefore, unable to receive the benefit of the remedy she sought before the circuit court. Lewellen's Point IV is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Because of our holding on this point, we need not address Lewellen's additional allegations of error concerning the entry of summary judgment on her civil conspiracy claim that she raises in her Points V and VI.

The court entered an order requiring Chad to appear in both his personal and corporate representative capacities at a deposition date of Lewellen's choosing. Franklin's counsel was warned that a failure to comply with this order would result in sanctions, up to and including the striking of pleadings and the entry of an interlocutory judgment of default. Chad failed to appear at the scheduled deposition, and Lewellen moved for sanctions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    On March 29, 2016, the circuit court heard evidence and argument on Lewellen's motion for sanctions. During that hearing, Franklin's counsel asserted that, upon returning to his office after the previous motion to compel, he received a voicemail from Chad's mother informing him that Chad had checked into Yellowstone Recovery, a rehabilitation center for substance abuse issues in Costa Mesa, California, that did not allow patients to receive communications from the outside world. She further informed counsel that the center would not allow her to reach her son and that she was unsure how long he would be isolated within the center's care. Counsel was unable to confirm that Chad was indeed receiving treatment, informing the court that his attempts to contact the rehabilitation center had resulted in the cryptic message that the center \"cannot confirm or deny that he is here, but we'll do something with your message.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    At the hearing, Larry Anthony, the parole officer assigned to supervise Chad, testified that, on January 21, 2016, Chad was asked to submit to a random urinalysis test as a condition of his supervised release. Prior to the sample being tested, Chad admitted to Anthony that the sample would return a positive result. On February 4, 2016, Chad informed Anthony that he had secured entry into Yellowstone Recovery starting on February 11, 2016. Anthony testified that Chad had reported in person to Anthony on February 11, 2016, at which point Anthony issued Chad a travel permit authorizing him to leave Missouri to enter rehabilitation. Anthony testified that he had not spoken with Chad since issuing the travel permit and was under the belief that his obligations to report would be halted until he exited the rehabilitation center.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    After hearing this testimony and argument from both parties, the circuit court struck the pleadings of Franklin and entered an interlocutory judgment by default for Lewellen against the three parties. On April 19, 2016, Franklin's counsel provided notice to Lewellen that Chad would be produced for deposition by his own counsel on April 27, 2016. Lewellen filed a motion to quash the subpoena that Chad issued to himself, and Franklin filed a corresponding motion asking the circuit court to reconsider its order granting Lewellen's request for sanctions. On April 26, 2016, the circuit court held a hearing, at which Franklin's counsel stated that Chad had contacted him as he was traveling back from the rehabilitation center in California and had expressed his willingness to sit for a deposition. The court granted Lewellen's motion to quash the subpoena and denied Franklin's motion for reconsideration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Franklin argues that the circuit court did not have the authority to strike his pleadings based on these facts and, instead, improperly considered his previous discovery violations in unrelated cases. While it is true that the circuit court took judicial notice of previous cases, those previous cases can hardly be characterized as \"unrelated.\" The circuit court took judicial notice of Franklin's conduct in previous cases heard in the Seventh Judicial Circuit-namely, the case underlying the instant action and the two cases that had been merged with Lewellen's for discovery purposes. Franklin has not cited any authority that circumscribes the court's ability to consider cases such as these.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    In two of those cases, Chad failed to appear for his deposition. In the other case, Chad appeared but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination over 200 times throughout the course of his testimony. We cannot say that the circuit court abused its discretion in determining that this behavior, combined with Chad's failure to appear at the properly noticed deposition in the instant action, was evidence of contumacious and deliberate disregard for the authority of the trial court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Nothing in the record supports Chad's assertion that he was surprised by this entry of default. He was well aware of the lengthy and ongoing litigation process before he choose to enter rehabilitation without speaking to his attorney. Chad is no stranger to the legal system; therefore, he either knew or should have known that disappearing in the middle of pretrial proceedings without the courtesy of even the slightest notice could result in potentially dire consequences. \"If a party neglects to look after the course of the proceeding in which he is involved, he should have no cause to complain about the court's action.\"\n    <em>\n     Golden v. Euge\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9938973\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/612/362/#p363\">\n     612 S.W.2d 362\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 363 (Mo. App. 1980).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Nevertheless, our review also requires a finding that the circuit court did not abuse\n    its discretion in determining that Lewellen was prejudiced by Franklin's contumacious and deliberate disregard of the court's authority.\n    <em>\n     Frontenac Bank\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386155\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/381/#p390\">\n     528 S.W.3d at 390\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Chad attempts to frame the situation before the circuit court as one with a fixed end date. More precisely, he argues that his failure to appear at the deposition only resulted in a delay of approximately forty-four days, and his reappearance nearly fourteen months prior to the scheduled start of trial provided ample opportunity with which the court could cure any prejudice to Lewellen.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    These circumstances were not known to the circuit court at the time it imposed the sanctions, however. At the time Franklin's pleadings were struck and the interlocutory order of default was entered, the date of Chad's return was far from certain. In fact, his counsel, mother, and parole officer were all unable to provide the court with any information concerning even\n    <em>\n     a possible\n    </em>\n    return date. Chad's failure to appear at the scheduled deposition impeded Lewellen's ability to gather the information that would ultimately be necessary to prove and defend her claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Karolat\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9172690\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/151/852/#p857\">\n     151 S.W.3d at 857-58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that his indefinite, voluntary absence prejudiced Lewellen's ability to engage in discovery. The fact that Chad returned after forty-four days is immaterial, as we review the circuit court's ruling for an abuse of discretion under the circumstances before the court at the time it entered its ruling.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cox\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6835702\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/107/#p114\">\n     473 S.W.3d at 114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Franklin contends the circuit court committed instructional error by providing the jury with a damage instruction and verdict director that removed the requirement for the jury to make the threshold finding that Franklin's conduct was outrageous due to his evil motive or reckless indifference to Lewellen's rights before awarding punitive damages. Further, Franklin argues that the court erred in excluding evidence that explained why the distribution of settlement funds at issue in the fraudulent transfer claim did not merit an award of punitive damages. Franklin asserts that these errors violated his due process rights because they stripped the proceedings of adequate safeguards to prevent an arbitrary punitive damages award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Allegations of instructional error present questions of law, which we review\n    <em>\n     de novo.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Edgerton v.

At trial, Franklin attempted to have Mayer testify about the $900,000 confidential settlement brokered by his law firm between Universal and the Franklins for a claim of bad faith. Mayer was allowed to testify about the amount of the settlement and the existence of distributions to Fifth Third Bank and Mayer's law firm, but he was not allowed to explain why the settlement or the distributions occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    During the subsequent offer of proof, Mayer testified that Tiffany Franklin was added to the lawsuit on the advice of counsel after Mayer determined that, as a named insured, she had \"substantial\" legal rights which were being harmed by Universal's alleged bad faith. Further, Mayer testified that, at the time of settlement, Chad and Tiffany Franklin were married but were engaged in the process of litigating a divorce. Mayer continued, testifying that the confidential nature of the settlement was not unusual and the nature of the $250,000 distribution to Fifth Third Bank was that of a partial satisfaction of a judgment lien against Chad.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    Franklin alleges that this information was essential to the jury's determination of punitive damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    Franklin's presentation of this evidence would have allowed him to argue that his actions were either not reprehensible or were only slightly reprehensible and, therefore, did not support a large punitive damages award. This opportunity is important because \"[t]he reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct is a key factor in determining the amount of punitive damages to which a plaintiff is entitled.\"\n    <em>\n     Estate of Overbey v.

Further, for Lewellen to present a submissible case for punitive damages under normal circumstances, she would need to demonstrate \"clear and convincing proof of a culpable mental state, either from a wanton, willful, or outrageous act, or from reckless disregard for an act's consequences such that an evil motive may be inferred.\"\n    <em>\n     Drury v. Mo.

App. 2008).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    This case presents a novel issue in which the circuit court entered an interlocutory judgment of default that had the effect of finding Lewellen had adequately demonstrated clear and convincing proof of a culpable mental state that justified the jury's consideration of a punitive damage award. As the trial progressed, however, the effect of the default expanded to swallow the ability of the jury to determine the comparative level of reprehensibility in Franklin's actions. To borrow language from MAI 10.01, the circuit court's ruling informed the jury that Franklin's conduct was outrageous, but then prevented Franklin from presenting relevant information about the degree of outrageousness.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    Lewellen's repeated attempts to characterize testimony explaining why the settlement occurred the way it did as an attack on liability is misplaced. Evidence concerning liability would potentially be subject to a number of meritorious objections, but \"evidence which is inadmissible for one purpose may be admissible for another.\"\n    <em>\n     Danbury v.

On both counts, the jury was instructed:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n    In addition to any actual damages to which you found Plaintiff Lillian Lewellen entitled under Instruction Number 7,\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    you may award Plaintiff Lillian Lewellen an additional amount as punitive damages in such sum as you believe will serve to punish Defendants Chad Franklin, Chad Franklin National Auto Sales North, LLC, and CFS Enterprises, Inc[.] and to deter Defendants Chad Franklin, Chad Franklin National Auto Sales North, LLC, and CFS Enterprises, Inc[.] and others from like conduct[.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n    You may consider harm to others in determining whether Defendants Chad Franklin's, Chad Franklin National Auto Sales North, LLC's, and CFS Enterprises, Inc[.]'s conduct was outrageous[.] However, in determining the amount of any punitive damages award, you must not include damages for harm to others who are not parties to this case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    This instruction was an amalgamation of modified versions of MAI 31.07(A) and MAI 10.01. This degree of modification was unnecessary and improper.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    Where an applicable MAI exists, its use is mandatory.\n    <em>\n     Abbott v. Mo.

App. 2012). If the MAI must be modified to accurately and fairly submit the issue to the jury, \"such modifications or such instructions shall be simple, brief, impartial, free from argument, and shall not submit to the jury or require findings of detailed evidentiary facts.\" Rule 70.02(b). MAI 10.01 states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n    If you find the issues in favor of plaintiff, and if you believe the conduct of defendant as submitted in Instruction Number (here insert number of plaintiff's verdict directing instruction) was outrageous because of defendant's evil motive or reckless indifference to the rights of others, then in addition to any damages to which you find plaintiff entitled under Instruction Number (here insert number of plaintiff's damages instruction), you may award plaintiff an additional amount as punitive damages in such sum as you believe will serve to punish defendant and to deter defendant and others from like conduct.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n    [You may consider harm to others in determining whether defendant's conduct was outrageous.

The modification, however, also deletes the section informing the jury that they must find Franklin's conduct was \"outrageous because of defendant's evil motive or reckless indifference to the rights of others.\" \"The test of a modified MAI ... is whether it follows the substantive law and can be readily understood by the jury.\"\n    <em>\n     Lashmet v.

App. 1997). As discussed at length,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the default did not remove this required finding from the jury's determination; therefore, this modified instruction misstates the substantive law and the jury's concomitant obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    To reverse, however, we must also find that this instructional error prejudiced Franklin. Prejudice sufficient for reversal due to instructional error occurs where an error \"materially affected the merits and outcome of the case[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Blunkall v. Heavy &amp; Specialized Haulers, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093796\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/398/534/#p544\">\n     398 S.W.3d 534\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 544-45 (Mo. App. 2013). The modification of 10.01 removing the requirement that the jury find that Franklin's conduct was outrageous materially affected the merits and the outcome of the case. Lewellen urges that no prejudice exists because the jury was properly instructed after the default. That is incorrect. For the sake of clarity, we are not stating that the circuit court is prohibited from fashioning a sanction that finds the existence of, or liability for, punitive damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    However, because the circuit court allowed the determination of damages to proceed to an empaneled jury, it was required to abide by the Due Process principles contemplated by the Supreme Court and MAI 10.01. Those principles require the court to allow the parties to present evidence that enables the jury to make properly informed decisions about the comparative reprehensibility of the defendant's actions. To do otherwise invites arbitrary or capricious awards of punitive damages by the members of the jury. Therefore, Franklin's Point II is granted. We reverse the jury's award of punitive damages and remand for a new determination of damages consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    In Point III, Franklin alleges that circuit court erred by presenting verdict forms to the jury that did not require them to make specific line-item findings as to Franklin's liability for punitive damages. Franklin cites no support for this specific proposition. It is true that a jury must find that a defendant's conduct was \"outrageous because of defendant's evil motive or reckless indifference to the rights of others,\" but there is no obligation for the jury to enter a line-item on the verdict form stating this. MAI 10.01;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    MAI 36.11; MAI 36.12. Further, Franklin's proffered verdict forms inappropriately attempt to confuse the issues concerning his liability, which had already been determined, and punitive damages by using the phrase \"liable for punitive damages\" in the verdict form.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 70.02.

This challenge mischaracterizes what burdens Lewellen still faced at trial. Prior to trial, the circuit court properly struck Franklin's pleadings and entered an interlocutory judgment of default for Lewellen on her MMPA claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 61.01. This took the issue from the jury and allowed the circuit court to enter a judgment admitting the traversable elements of the MMPA claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beckmann\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11095182\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/45/533/#p541\">\n     45 S.W.3d at 541\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This point is another attempt by Franklin to collaterally attack the entry of default for discovery violations. At the time the MMPA claim was presented to the jury to determine damages, it had already been decided, by virtue of the default, that Lewellen had made a submissible claim on every element other than damages. As Franklin does not challenge Lewellen's presentation of damages evidence, this point is without merit. Franklin's Point V is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    <strong>\n     D.
