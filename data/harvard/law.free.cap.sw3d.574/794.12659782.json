The parties were granted joint legal and joint physical custody of their two children, and Gunter was ordered to pay child support to Brock. Gunter filed a Motion to Modify, seeking to reduce his child support obligation. The circuit court denied the motion. Gunter appeals. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties with an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
