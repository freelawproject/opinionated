In each case, the county had not approved the liquor-by-the-drink sales, but the city had approved such sales. The Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Revenue, who collects taxes on all liquor-by-the-drink sales, distributed tax proceeds to the defendant cities in accordance with the liquor-by-the-drink tax distribution statute, Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-306. The statute required the recipient cities to then distribute half of their proceeds \"in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed.\" Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 57-4-306(a)(2)(A) (2013). In each case, the recipient city distributed half of its tax proceeds to its own city school system and did not share the proceeds with the county. The counties sued the cities, claiming that the statute required the cities to distribute the tax proceeds as the counties distribute the county property tax for schools, which is pro rata among all schools in the county based on average daily attendance. In the instant case, the trial court granted summary judgment against the county and in favor of the two defendant cities. The county also raised an alternative claim for reimbursement of past liquor-by-the-drink tax proceeds that it had received from private club sales and shared with the cities; the county argued that, if cities were not required to share their tax proceeds, then counties should not be required to do so. The trial court rejected this claim as well and held that the statute required counties to distribute their liquor-by-the-drink tax proceeds pro rata among all schools in the county, even though it did not require the same of cities. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Discerning no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issues in this case are better understood with some knowledge of the development of the pertinent liquor-by-the-drink statutes.

The distribution statute said that half of those proceeds would go to the general fund of the county, city, or town in which the taxes were generated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 57-4-306(a)(2)(B).

Interpretation of this provision is the issue presented to us in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Blount County\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The underlying facts in this case are essentially undisputed. The Cities of Alcoa and Maryville (collectively, \"the Cities\") are located in Blount County. The Cities have at all relevant times had their own municipal school systems separate from the Blount County school system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 1996, citizens of Maryville passed a referendum authorizing LBD sales within its city limits. In 2004, citizens of Alcoa did the same. Blount County has never approved LBD sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prior to the referendums, both of the Cities had received LBD tax proceeds from lawful LBD sales at private clubs within their respective city limits. After the Cities approved LBD sales by referendum, the Cities received LBD tax proceeds from both private club sales and sales at other establishments within their corporate limits. The Cities have never distributed any of their LBD tax proceeds to the County school system or to any other school system in the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because it never approved LBD sales, the County has received LBD tax proceeds\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   from lawful LBD sales in private clubs located in unincorporated areas of the County. Unlike the Cities, the County distributed half of its tax proceeds among all of the school systems in the County-just as it distributes County property taxes for schools-pro rata to all local education agencies in the County in accordance with average daily attendance maintained by each.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-3-315\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-3-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 23, 2014, the Blount County Board of Education (\"the Board\") filed this lawsuit against the Cities, seeking a declaratory judgment as to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning LBD tax proceeds. The Board also requested damages from the Cities for its alleged pro rata share of LBD tax proceeds distributed to the Cities \"at least back to 1980 for the City of Alcoa, and back to 1996 for the City of Maryville.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board asserted that the distribution statute required the Commissioner to distribute half of local political subdivision's share of the tax proceeds directly \"to the Blount County Trustee to be distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is\n   expended and distributed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It claimed that this was necessary \"to insure that students across the county are not discriminated against in terms of funding of their education based on their residence within or without the incorporated municipalities.\" Because the Commissioner had erroneously paid this portion of the proceeds directly to the Cities, the Board argued, the Cities should be required to remit those funds to the Blount County Board of Education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Cities each filed a separate answer. Both argued that the distribution statute does not require the Cities to remit any portion of their LBD tax proceeds to the Board, to Blount County, or to any other local school system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In November 2014, the Board filed a motion to amend the complaint to add Blount County as a plaintiff. The Cities objected to the addition of Blount County and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In June 2015, the trial court entered an order denying the Cities' motion to dismiss and granting the Board's motion to add Blount County as a plaintiff. As a result, we hereinafter refer to the Blount County Board of Education and Blount County collectively as \"the County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In August 2015, the County filed a second motion to amend, this one to add an alternative claim for relief. The County asserted that, if the trial court ruled in favor of the Cities on the County's original claim and determined that the Cities were not required to share their LBD tax proceeds pro rata, then the County should be entitled to reimbursement of LBD tax proceeds (from LBD sales at private clubs in the County) that it had shared pro rata with the Cities between November 1992 and August 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court granted the motion to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After that, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the County's primary claim against the Cities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In December 2015, the trial court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of the Cities and dismissing the County's amended complaint. Explaining its reasoning, the trial court noted that the distribution statute contains a provision that specifically requires municipalities that\n   <em>\n    do not\n   </em>\n   operate their own school system to remit the education portion of the LBD tax proceeds to the county school fund. Applying the maxim\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   (the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of all things not expressly mentioned) to interpret the distribution statute, the trial court determined that municipalities that\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   operate their own school system are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   required to remit any tax proceeds to the county school fund; rather, they are directed to keep the education portion of the LBD tax proceeds for their own school system. The trial court further found the distribution statute to be ambiguous, and it held that consideration of the statute's history and purpose led to the same conclusion. Under this construction of the statute, the trial court dismissed the County's primary\n   claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Subsequent motions for summary judgment raised the question of the County's alternative request for relief in which the County asserted that, if the trial court ruled in favor of the City on the primary issue, the County was entitled to reimbursement of LBD tax proceeds on private club LBD sales that it had shared pro rata with the Cities. The trial court entered an order rejecting the County's alternative claim, granting summary judgment in favor of the Cities, and dismissing the County's lawsuit in its entirety. The trial court allowed that the distribution statute \"is not a model of clarity,\" but it interpreted the statute to require the County to distribute its LBD tax proceeds to all schools in the County pro rata in the same way that it distributes the County property tax for schools. The County filed a timely appeal from the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Around the same time, three other cases involving the same issue regarding the distribution statute were appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eastern Section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bradley Cnty.

May 8, 2019) (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Coffee Cnty.\n   </em>\n   \"). After fulsome analysis, we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   that the local education provision in the distribution statute \"required a municipality with its own school system to expend and distribute half of its LBD tax proceeds in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed within the municipality, which is for the benefit of the municipality's own school system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 849. In that case, because the City of Tullahoma had its own school system, we held that the city \"was not required to share its LBD tax proceeds with the [c]ounty\" during the relevant time period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 849.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The primary issue in the instant case is substantively indistinguishable from the issue decided in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on our holding in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   , we hold that the distribution statute did not require the Commissioner to pay half of the Cities' LBD tax proceeds directly to the County trustee, and that the Cities were not required to distribute half of their LBD tax proceeds pro rata among the County school system and the other school systems in the County. Rather, the local education provision directed the Cities to expend and distribute the education portion of their LBD tax proceeds in support of their own municipal school systems. For this reason, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Cities on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We also conclude that the County is not entitled to relief on its alternative argument. As we have explained, the County argues that, if this Court concludes that the Cities were not required to share their LBD tax proceeds under the distribution statute, then it must also conclude that the County was not required to share its LBD tax proceeds (from LBD sales at private clubs) with the Cities. It argues: \"The Cities cannot take one position on the interpretation of the statute when it benefits them and take another position on the interpretation of the statute when it does not benefit them.\" Based on this rationale, the County argues, it is entitled to a refund from the Cities for all LBD tax proceeds it shared with the Cites up until this lawsuit was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We cannot agree. The County's alternative argument is inconsistent with our interpretation of the distribution statute in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   . In that opinion, we interpreted the distribution statute to mean that half of all LBD tax proceeds paid to a city must be expended in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended\n   <em>\n    within the city.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 848-49. The same would apply to LBD tax proceeds received by a county. In other words, a county that receives LBD tax proceeds from private club LBD sales must expend and distribute half of their LBD tax proceeds \"in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed\"\n   <em>\n    by the county\n   </em>\n   , which is pro rata among all of the local school systems in the county.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 848-49 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-306\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 57-4-306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) ). Thus, the distribution statute required the County to distribute its LBD tax proceeds pro rata among the local school systems, even though it did not require the Cities to do the same. As the trial court below recognized, this disparity is understandable because \"the citizens of [the Cities] are necessarily also citizens of [the County]. But the reverse is not true at all. [The] citizens of [the County] that live outside [the Cities] are not citizens of [the Cities].\" This decision was within the Legislature's prerogative to make.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Cities on the County's alternative claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Cities on the County's primary claim for a share of the Cities' LBD tax proceeds and also on its alternative claim for reimbursement of\n   LBD tax proceeds.

We note this difference in the framing of the argument but conclude that our analysis in\n    <em>\n     Coffee County\n    </em>\n    nevertheless applies and resolves the issue the same way, which is in favor of the Cities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    As we noted in\n    <em>\n     Coffee County\n    </em>\n    , our interpretation of the distribution statute cannot be based on the perceived \"fairness\" of that statute.\n    <em>\n     Coffee Cnty.\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12659792\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/574/832/#p848\">\n     574 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    849 n.29.
