GLADWIN, Judge\n   Stanley Banks and Barbara Banks were divorced in the Dallas County Circuit Court by decree filed April 23, 2018. Stanley appeals, arguing that the trial court clearly erred by (1) granting an unequal division of property; (2) failing to cite its reasons for the unequal division; and (3) awarding alimony to Barbara. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Bankses were married June 3, 1995, and separated October 28, 2015. Barbara filed for divorce on October 11, 2017, alleging eighteen months' separation. When the parties could not reach an agreement on the division of marital property and debt or alimony, a final hearing was held on April 16, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Barbara testified that she works for the Arkansas Department of Human Services and had worked for the State of Arkansas for twenty-four years. Her sole retirement account is with the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System (APERS), and she did not know how much it is worth. She said that Stanley had worked for Shippers, Georgia Pacific, and Union Pacific during their marriage, and he had a retirement account worth $ 102,000 and another account worth $ 12,000. She said that there was no debt on their house, worth $ 39,500, and she asked that she be awarded the house and her vehicle, a Cadillac CTS on which she owed $ 14,172.56. She said that the household furnishings were worth $ 1500. Barbara listed several vehicles owned by the couple, including her Cadillac CTS and Stanley's Cadillac DTS. She also said that Stanley had a Hayabusa motorcycle worth $ 5470 with no debt, and they had a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix, a 1994 Grand Am, a 1997 GMC truck, a 1999 GMC truck, and a 2008 GMC Denali.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Barbara said that it was Stanley's habit to keep cash both in his vehicle's glove box and in his briefcase. She said that she found $ 6000 in his car in July before their separation, and she believed he kept that much or more in his briefcase. She estimated that he had $ 10,000 cash when they separated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Barbara said that she had accumulated debt in her name during the marriage. She owed money to Capital One; the IRS; JCPenney; Best Buy; a collection agency; TJ Maxx; RCA; Fordyce Bank &amp; Trust; Discover; Exxon; Avenue; the Children's Place; Credit One; Midland Funding; her doctor; and Jefferson Regional Medical Center. Barbara said that she had paid off one marital debt-Midland Funding in the amount of $ 2,095.32-and she admitted on cross-examination that the Fordyce Bank &amp; Trust loan was used in part to pay the Midland Funding debt. She also listed her vehicle debt of $ 14,172.56, which she accrued after the parties' separation, and Stanley's vehicle debt of $ 10,000. Barbara proposed that she be responsible for all the debt except for the $ 10,000 owed by Stanley on his vehicle-leaving her with $ 29,710.76 in debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Barbara alleged that Stanley's income is $ 6,148.84 a month and requested $ 1000 a\n   month in alimony, which she claimed would give her $ 304 each month after expenses and leave Stanley with $ 467 a month after expenses. She said on cross-examination that his monthly income included employer-paid per diem allowance for travel.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Stanley testified that they owned one truck, a 2000 GMC, and that the GMC Denali is a 2005 model.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    Stanley testified that his tax returns are the best reflection of his income and that his income varies, leaving him without a specific biweekly amount. He asked that the trial court use his tax returns to determine his income. Stanley also introduced exhibits that listed both his credit card and IRS debts totaling more than $ 4000. He said that he owes $ 13,255.11 on his vehicle and claimed that his monthly net pay is $ 3,544.50. His affidavit of financial means reflected that his expenses are $ 5,045.96 a month.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The trial court issued its decree on April 23, 2018, and it states as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n    4.

Defendant shall pay the amount of $ 500.00 per month for a period of forty-eight (48) months at which time the support shall cease.

He also testified that by the time the parties had separated in October 2015, he had spent all the money in the glove box, which he had kept there because of Barbara's \"spending problems.\" Stanley argues that neither party presented credible testimony that he possessed a significant amount of cash at the time of their separation or divorce. Further, he contends that Barbara was not entitled to reimbursement for any nonconsensual transfer of marital funds made by him in the absence of proof of an intent to defraud.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wainwright v.

Thus, Stanley argues that the trial court committed reversible error by including the \"hypothetical cash amount\" in its division of property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Stanley argues that his net property distribution equals $ 22,648 if the $6000 attributed to him is included in his award. He claims that Barbara's net distribution of property is $ 38,002.44. Thus, he contends that he was awarded far less.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    He also contends that the trial court's debt division did not state that the debt distribution was made in accordance with the property division. He argues that Barbara was ordered to pay the Midland Funding debt, despite her having stated that the debt had been paid with proceeds from the Fordyce Bank &amp; Trust loan. Therefore, he claims that the amount of debt attributed to Barbara is higher than the actual amount of her marital debt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Stanley also complains that even though the divorce decree provides that he should be responsible for IRS taxes owed from 2014 through 2017, he owes an additional amount of $ 3,614.57-$ 1,914.57 for 2014-16 and $ 1700 for 2017. Stanley argues that much of Barbara's debt was accrued after the separation, and the resulting property related to the debt remained in her possession. He contends that given the amounts of his debt not listed and the allocation of marital debt to each party, Barbara received a larger property share than he did.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Stanley contends that the trial court allocated to each party his and her own debt and did not state how the allocation of marital debt factored into the court's award of marital assets. Accordingly, Stanley argues that the division of assets should be considered at face value. He contends that neither party requested an unequal division of marital assets or mentioned the factors to be considered in an unequal division of property. He argues that if the court intended to divide the assets equally, it erred in its calculations. If the court intended to make an unequal division, then it erred by awarding Barbara a larger share without sufficient evidence to support such a division. He asks that we reverse and remand to ensure an equal share of the marital assets for each party.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Barbara argues that the trial court did not err in dividing the marital property. We agree. Even though section 9-12-315 states that marital property \"shall\" be distributed equally, it is also true that the statute enables the trial court to make a division of property that is fair and equitable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hoover v.

As set forth above, it is not improper to consider both assets and debts when dividing marital property.\n    <em>\n     See Williams, supra.\n    </em>\n    Further, mathematical precision is not required.\n    <em>\n     See Coatney,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7121635\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/377/381/\">\n      supra.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Stanley argues that if the court had intended for the debt distributions to justify an unequal division of the property, then section 9-12-315 required listing the existence and amounts of the parties' liabilities as a justification for an unequal distribution. This argument ignores the trial court's obligation to consider the debts in the context of the distribution of all of the parties' property.

Because we have determined that the trial court did not make an unequal distribution, a statement by the trial court for doing so is not required.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Alimony\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Stanley contends that the alimony award to Barbara of $ 500 a month for four years was based on\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    the financial circumstances of the parties; the financial needs and obligations of both; the couple's past standard of living; the amount and nature of the income, both current and anticipated, of both husband and wife; the extent and nature of the resources and assets of each of the parties; the amount of income of each that is spendable, the amounts which, after entry of the decree, will be available to each of the parties for the payment of living expenses; the earning ability and capacity of both husband and wife; property awarded or given to one of the parties, either by the court or the other party; the disposition of the homestead or jointly owned property; the relative fault of the parties and their conduct, both before and after separation, in relation to the marital status, to each other and to the property of one or the other or both; and the duration of the marriage.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Stanley claims that the divorce decree did not mention the need to rectify any economic imbalance or the primary factors of the ability to pay and the need for support. He also contends that the trial court erroneously considered the fault of the parties. The ground alleged was eighteen months' separation, and only Stanley asserted fault by stating that Barbara had a spending problem and a drinking problem. Thus, Stanley argues that Barbara presented no evidence that his conduct related to her \"need for support or ability to pay.\" He contends that it was clearly erroneous for the trial court to rely on this factor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Further, he alleges that the trial court's failure to include the primary factors of \"need\" and \"ability to pay\" amounts to reversible error. He claims that the award of alimony was clearly a mistake of fact, as the evidence did not support those factors. He contends that including his per diem allowance in his disposable income was not supported by the testimony and evidence because his per diem is used to offset his expenses. Further, he argues that his monthly debt service should have been considered in the calculation of his ability to pay alimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Stanley contends that Barbara was in a much better position when she left the marriage than when she entered it. She maintained the same job; however, she left with a residence paid in full. He contends that the decree does not contain any finding regarding his monthly income or expenses. He claims that Barbara argued that his per diem awards should be classified as income and that his monthly income is $ 6,148.84. He contends that his income does not include the per diem award and that he averaged $ 3,544.50 a month without considering his per diem allowance. He argues that under either scenario, he does not have the ability to pay $ 500 a month after payment of his monthly expenses and debt totaling $ 5,857.27, \"much less have any extra income to establish a savings of any sort, or to accumulate property.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Barbara contends that the trial court's consideration of the financial circumstances of both parties and the financial needs and obligations of both parties is the same as the \"ability to pay\" and recognition that she has a \"need.\" We agree. Stanley's ability to pay was evidenced by his 2017 pay stub that reflected earnings of $ 6,148.84 a month for the first eight months of 2017. Stanley testified that the expenses not reimbursed by his per diem payments were $ 3945 a month, rather than $ 5,045.86. The trial court considered eleven factors in deciding that alimony was warranted, and the $ 500 awarded to Barbara was half of what she had asked for. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding alimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Murphy and Brown, JJ., agree.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-74\">\n     This court later discussed the distribution of property in\n     <em>\n      Hoover\n     </em>\n     as follows:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n     A close reading of\n     <em>\n      Hoover\n     </em>\n     shows that we based our reversal not on the percentage distributed to each party but instead on the erroneous calculation of the value of an asset assigned to the appellant. Therefore,\n     <em>\n      Hoover\n     </em>\n     does not stand for the proposition that the marital debt must be subtracted from the marital assets to determine the \"net\" value of the total award made to each party in all divorce cases. Although the chancellor in\n     <em>\n      Hoover\n     </em>\n     used this method, and we followed his methodology, the methodology itself was not in issue.
