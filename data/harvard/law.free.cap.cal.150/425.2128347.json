Subsequently petitioners herein gave notice of intention to move for a new trial, and moved therefor, presenting for settlement a bill of exceptions to be used on said motion. The court refused to settle the bill and petitioners applied for mandate. In <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>93 Cal. 614, [29 Pac. 235], this identical question came before the court, and it was there decided that a motion for a new trial was not a proper procedure after an order for a family allowance had been <em>made; </em>that it is the duty of the court <em>ex parte </em>and without petition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>make such orders. What is there said-is decisive of the question under this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">It is, however, urged by petitioners that the bill should be settled as a bill of exceptions to be used upon their appeal from the order. If the circumstances permitted, this court would so hold, as was done in <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>93 Cal. 614, [29 Pac. 235], But, treating the proposed bill of exceptions in this case as a bill of exceptions to be used on appeal from the order, its presentation was entirely too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The application for mandate is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Angellotti, J., McFarland, J., Sloss, J., Shaw, J., and Lorigan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
