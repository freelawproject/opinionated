In denying the application, it is proper to say that the sickness of a party to an action, preventing his attendance on the court, does not <em>ipso facto </em>require the court to grant an application for a continuance, made on his behalf. It is for the trial court in all cases, except where otherwise expressly provided by statute, to determine whether or not the circumstances shown upon an application for a continuance are such as to make it proper that a continuance should be granted, and its conclusion thereon will not be disturbed unless there has been a plain abuse of discretion. We make this statement in view of the fact that it is alleged in the petition that in granting continuances heretofore made, the court said that it was of the opinion that it is not a matter of discretion with the court to refuse a continuance, where it is made to appear that the defendant is unable by reason of sickness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>appear. There is no decision of this court which can be properly construed as denying the discretion of the trial court in such eases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
