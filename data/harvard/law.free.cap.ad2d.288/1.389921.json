Were we to review this claim, we would find that these discussions with the complainant, who had become a reluctant witness, were appropriate under the circumstances and were not intimidating <em>(compare, People v Moore, </em>194 AD2d 695, <em>lv denied </em>82 NY2d 807, <em>with People v Shapiro, </em>50 NY2d 747, 761-762). The complainant ultimately refused to testify at trial. In any event, she had fully inculpated defendant before the Grand Jury, and defendant\u2019s present claim that she might have provided favorable testimony and that such testimony might have affected the verdict rests entirely on speculation.
