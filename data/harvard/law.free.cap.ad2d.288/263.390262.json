Clipper failed to make an appropriate factual showing of \u201cunreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other prejudice\u201d (CPLR 3103 [a]; <em>see, Willis v Cassia, </em>255 AD2d 800, 801; <em>State of New York v General Elec. Co., </em>215 AD2d 928, 929; <em>Brignola v PeiFei Lee, M.D., P. C., </em>192 AD2d 1008, 1009). The records requested by the plaintiffs in their notice for discovery and inspection may be relevant on the issue of whether Clipper\u2019s vehicle was involved in the subject accident <em>(see, Williams v Hunt Transp. Servs., </em>162 AD2d 524). Furthermore, the examination before trial of Clipper, which was initially adjourned to be held before a judge, should continue until completion <em>(see, Tardibuono v County of Nassau, </em>181 AD2d 879, 881; <em>Ferraro v New York Tel. Co., </em>94 AD2d 784, 785; <em>Freedco Prods, v New York Tel. Co., </em>47 AD2d 654). Santucci, J. P., Florio, H. Miller and Cozier, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
