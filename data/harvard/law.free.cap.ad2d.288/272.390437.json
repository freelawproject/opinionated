Goldberg, J.), dated June 19, 2000, as granted the motion of the third-party defendants for summary judgment dismissing the third-party complaint.</p><p id=\"b314-3\">Ordered that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.</p><p id=\"b314-4\">\u201cIt is well settled that an out-of-possession owner or lessor is not liable for injuries that occur on the premises unless that entity retained control of the premises or is contractually obligated to repair the unsafe condition\u201d <em>(Carvano v Morgan, </em>270 AD2d 222, 223; <em>see also, Bolden v New Mark &amp; Co., </em>270 AD2d 221; <em>Stark v Port Auth., </em>224 AD2d 681). Under the terms of the lease in this case, the appellant landlords were responsible for \u201call major repairs\u201d and the tenants were only responsible for \u201cminor repairs.\u201d At his deposition, the defendant Leonard Flaum, one of the landlords, stated that a repair such as replacing \u201ca concrete block of a sidewalk\u201d would be considered \u201cmajor\u201d and was thus his obligation. Accordingly, it is clear from the record that any repair designed to address the allegedly substantial defect upon which the plaintiff\u2019s decedent fell was the obligation of the landlords under the lease. Since the tenants established their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, and the landlords failed to raise a triable issue of fact, summary judgment dismissing the third-party complaint was properly granted in favor of the tenants. Santucci, J. P., Altman, Townes and Crane, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
