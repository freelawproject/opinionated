Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s failure to charge the jury that the codefendant was an interested witness as a matter of law does not warrant reversal <em>(see, People v Inniss, </em>83 NY2d 653; <em>People v Cruz, </em>262 AD2d 579). We note that the testimony of the complainants and an eyewitness to the crime independently and overwhelmingly established the defendant\u2019s guilt <em>(see, People v Odiot, </em>242 AD2d 308; <em>People v Martin, </em>169 AD2d 784). Altman, J. P., Krausman, Goldstein and Crane, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
