Nevertheless, Edic agreed with Brown, the deputy collector, that if Brown would make no effort to collect the tax from the members personally \u2014 a course which the officers rightly feared would disrupt the club \u2014 the club itself would collect them. The evidence of that agreement was substantially uncontradicted, and the judge was right to overrule the referee\u2019s finding to the contrary. The so-called \u201cWaiver\u201d did not indeed embody such an agreement, and it is hard to see why it was thought useful, unless for its avowed purpose \u2014 to cut off any claim for refund \u2014 but it by no means comprised all that the parties had agreed to.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-22\">The only question open is whether this agreement was ever ratified or accepted by the proper authorities of the bankrupt. Edic said that the president and treasurer approved it at the time when they signed the \u201cWaiver\u201d: he had then explained the whole matter to them. He said further that it was the board of governors who directed him to make the payments, though perhaps by this he again meant only the president, the treasurer and the secretary. \u25a0However that may be, he later said that \u201cit\u201d (which probably meant the \u201cWaiver\u201d) \u201cwas brought\u201d (up?) \u201cat a number of meetings time and time again\u201d, at which were present \u201cthe Board and officers and Mr. Wickes\u201d. When Edic told \u201cthem\u201d that the members would be sued, \u201cthe officers of the club didn\u2019t want that to happen * * * and they said they would go ahead and collect the tax for the government\u201d. Though all this is somewhat vague, it constituted prima facie an authorization not only by the bankrupt\u2019s officers, but by the whole board; and that was enough until something was introduced to meet it. The parties have stipulated that the minute books of the club contained nothing authorizing the board or any officer \u201cto have the bankrupt assume payment of the tax;\u201d but it is of course irrelevant to the validity of a corporate act, duly authorized, that no record of it is made in the corporate books. Handley v. Stutz, 139 U.S. 417, 422, 11 S.Ct. 530, 35 L.Ed. 227; Moss v. Averill, 10 N.Y. 449, 454. Nor is the absence of any mention of the contract enough, merely as evidence, to meet Edic\u2019s testimony. It is not in the least surprising that such a transaction should not be recorded; it was of no great moment anyway, and was a disagreeable necessity whose commemoration the board would probably not care to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>perpetuate. The referee made no finding upon it and the judge was right to make his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
