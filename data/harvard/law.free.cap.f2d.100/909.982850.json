The case was ordered remanded to the state court for a trial on the merits, as to which we expressed no opinion. A modification or clarification of the opinion in this respect is unnecessary, and the motion to this effect is overruled. Also, the petition for a rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
