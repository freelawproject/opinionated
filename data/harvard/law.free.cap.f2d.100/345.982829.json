They showed that Mrs. Griffin, having become quite heavily indebted to appellee, was induced to mortgage the barge to it. That being out of active use it was tied up at appellant\u2019s wharf under an agreement between Mrs. Griffin and appellant that he would look after it for $25 a month. That a considerable bill having been run up for this service, she and appellant agreed that he would make the necessary repairs on the barge and fit it for service, and when repaired would use it at a rental of $150 per month, the rental to be applied on the indebtedness. That appellant knew of the existence of appellee\u2019s mortgage, but he had not read it .and did not know that it contained the clause on which appellee here relies. That the repairs were necessary and that the sums charged by appellant therefor were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On findings' of fact substantially to this effect the District Judge concluded; that libellant had a maritime lien as caretaker, for the $188.33 sued for, and that he had such a lien for $3794.98 for the repairs on the barge; that the lien as caretaker primed appellee\u2019s mortgage, because these services were for the benefit of all persons interested in her, including intervenor, and the intervenor knew that libellant was in possession of the barge; but that because libellant knew of the mortgage, and by the slightest inquiry could have found what its provisions were, it would be inequitable to permit his lien for repairs to prime .the mortgage. This appeal is from his decree subordinating the maritime lieii for repairs to appellee\u2019s non-maritime mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Here appellant insisting that a maritime lien primes existing mortgages except those registered under the Ship Mortgage Act; that appellee\u2019s is not such a mortgage, and that his lien was wrongfully.subordinated to it, urges a reversal of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Appellee, contending rather feebly that the Oriole is not a vessel within Sec. 971, 46 U.S.C.A., and more vigorously that if it is, the facts show a waiver of lien, places its main reliance upon the finding of the District Judge, that upon equitable considerations appellant\u2019s lien for repairs must be subordinated to appellee\u2019s prior mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">We think that appellant has the right of it. It is not claimed that appellant\u2019s mortgage comes under or is protected by the Ship Mortgage Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This being so, if, as the District Judge found, appellant has a maritime lien for repairs, it cannot be subordinated to the mortgage, upon any considerations, equitable or otherwise. I R. C.L. Sec. 58, p. 459; The Buckhannon, 2 Cir., 299 F. 519; The J. E. Rumbell, 148 U.S. 1, 13 S.Ct. 498, 37 L.Ed. 345; The Easby, D.C., 201 F. 585; The Bergen, 9 Cir., 64 F.2d 877; Porobilo v. Taliancich, 5 Cir;, 89 F.2d 341; Morse Drydock &amp; Repair Co. v. Northern Star, 271 U.S. 552, 46 S.Ct. 589, 70 L.Ed. 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">That the District Judge was right in concluding that appellant had a maritime lien for repairs, does not, we think, admit of question. The evidence is unContradicted; that the repairs were furnished to the barge on the authority of the owner; that they were necessary and that the charges therefor were reasonable. Nothing in the mortgage prevents, or purports to prevent, the mortgagor from making necessary repairs upon the barge. Nothing in it prevents or purports to prevent, a shipbuilder or repairer, from obtaining a lien for necessary repairs. If the provision has any effect, it is that alone of a personal covenant between mortgagor and mortgagee, for the breach of which the mortgagee might have an action against the mortgagor. Certainly the clause does not operate at all to convert a mortgage lien into ownership. A mortgage in Texas, no matter what the form of the papers by which it is given, only gives a lien, conveys no title. In Texas once a mortgage, always a mortgage. The provision in the mortgage was not intended to deprive the mortgagor of title. If it had been so intended, it could not have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">In awarding appellant a maritime lien the decree was right. In postponing it to appellee\u2019s mortgage lien, it was wrong. It will be reformed to award appellant priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">Reformed and affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-14\"> Sec. 30, Merchant Marine Act of 1020, Chap. 25, Title 46, 'U.S.C.A. \u00a7 911 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
