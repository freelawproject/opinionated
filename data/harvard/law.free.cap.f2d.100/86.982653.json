Appellants moved to dismiss the action upon three grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-23\">(1) That they had been released and discharged of all liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-24\">(2) That appellee\u2019s claims against them had been adjudicated in a prior suit; and</p>\n<p id=\"b142-25\">(3) That before the commencement of her suit she had been adjudged a person of unsound mind and a committee of her person and estate had been appointed arid was still acting and that neither this committee nor any next friend of appellee were parties plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-26\">This appeal is from an order denying the motion to dismiss, and we are without jurisdiction to entertain it. In this character of case, we are limited to a review of a final decision only. Title 28, Sec. 225(a) U.S.C., 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 225(a); Ex parte Tiffany, 252 U.S. 32, 34, 40 S.Ct. 239, 240, 64 L.Ed. 443; Heike v. U. S., 217 U.S. 423, 429, 30 S.Ct. 539, 54 L.Ed. 821. A final decision is one which disposes of the whole case on its merits; or, put in another way, which determines all points in litigation between the parties. Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff, 106 U.S. 3, 1 S.Ct. 15, 27 L.Ed. 73; Dainese v. Kendall, 119 U.S. 53, 7 S.Ct. 65, 30 L.Ed. 305; Maas v. Lonstorf, 6 Cir., 166 F. 41, 43; Cunningham v. Rodgers, 9 Cir., 171 F. 835; Sheppy v. Stevens, 2 Cir., 200 F. 946; Morgan v. Thompson, 8 Cir., 124 F. 203; France &amp; Canada S. S. Corp. v. French Republic, 2 Cir., 285 F. 290, 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-29\">Tested by the authorities, it is manifest that there was no final judgment. There was no judgment at all as to the defendants who did not join in the motion; and as to appellants who did, there was no adjudication except the denial of the motion. Cases almost directly in point are: Robinson v. Belt, 8 Cir., 56 F. 328; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Winn, 5 Cir., 227 F. 50; and Crooker v. Knudsen, 9 Cir., 232 F. 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-30\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
