No suit will lie against the Collector alone. The Collector is a subordinate official of the Treasury Department and the Secretary of the Treasury is an indispensable party defendant. The bill was dismissed on the merits after denial of a motion for a temporary injunction. The decree is reversed with directions to dismiss the bill for lack of the necessary party defendant.
