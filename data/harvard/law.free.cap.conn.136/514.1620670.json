After corrections of the finding, as claimed by both parties, are made to the extent we find these claims supported by the' record before us, the following facts appear: The plaintiff was employed by the defendant employer as an assembly worker in the so-called \u201croll feed\u201d department. There, as a consequence of his exposure to oil, he contracted an industrial dermatitis of the hands and arms. Compensation for total incapacity was paid until May 24, 1948, under a voluntary agreement and thereafter, until July 19, 1948, under a finding and award which directed the plaintiff to take another job, at the same pay, which was offered by the defendant and which the plaintiff could do without being subject to conditions that might bring about a recurrence of the dermatitis. The plaintiff worked at this job, referred to as the \u201cshed job\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>or \u201cdry job,\u201d until February 21, 1949, when his services were terminated owing to lack of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Under the seniority provisions of an agreement, dated August 10, 1948, between the defendant and the union representing the plaintiff, length of service would govern in all cases of layoff, rehiring, transfers or promotions, provided that the skill and industry of the employees were relatively equal. It was stated: \u201cWhen there is the necessity of layoff in any one department . . . employees will be transferred to some other department if the Company finds it practicable .to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The plaintiff had seniority under this contract entitling him to transfer to his old job, At that time no vacancy existed in the old job. The plaintiff .asserts that his seniority entitled him to have his old job made available to him even if another employee had to be discharged to create a vacancy. He asserts further that the employer refused him his old job because his susceptibility to dermatitis made him \u201cphysically unsuited\u201d for this work. The commissioner found that the plaintiff was without employment, not because of a compensable injury, but because of business conditions, and denied further compensation. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court was sustained and-a judgment was entered directing an award of compensation for total incapacity,- from which the defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">We have said that the words \u201ctotal incapacity to work\u201d in General Statutes, \u00a7 7430, do not mean \u201cthe employee\u2019s inability to work at his customary calling, but the destruction of his capacity to earn in that or any other occupation which he can reasonably pursue.\u201d <em>Osterlund </em>v. <em>State, </em>135 Conn. 498, 505, 66 A. 2d 363; see <em>Ferrara </em>v. <em>Clifton Wright Hat Co., </em>125 Conn. 140, 141, 3 A. 2d 842; <em>Reilley </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>110 Conn. 282, 286, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>147 A. 818. \u201cWe cannot accept a claim of the plaintiff that his incapacity to work [in a particular occupation] would of itself show that he is totally disabled.\u201d <em>Osterlund </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The plaintiff points out that the old or so-called \u201croll feed job\u201d should be available to him under the seniority rights of the union contract. That contract states that \u201cemployees will be transferred to some other department if the Company finds it practicable to do so.\u201d It can hardly be said to be practicable to transfer the plaintiff to his old job where, it is not disputed, there would be a recurrence of the dermatitis. Then, too, his return to the old job would have required the laying off of another employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The plaintiff did return to work in another job after the dermatitis had disappeared. The commissioner has found that his \u201cearning capacity is the same as the one he enjoyed prior to his contracting the dermatitis.\u201d This finding the Superior Court did not and could not properly correct. After working for seven months on the job, the plaintiff was laid off owing to business conditions. Loss of employment or inability to secure work due to economic or general business conditions, even though one is incapacitated, furnishes no basis for an award of compensation. <em>Reilley </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>supra, 286; <em>Ferrara </em>v. <em>Clifton Wright Hat Co., </em>supra, 143; <em>Manley\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 38, 184 N. E. 372; <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Auclair, </em>86 N. H. 303, 167 A. 275; <em>Matter of Jordan </em>v. <em>Decorative Co., </em>230 N. Y. 522, 525, 130 N. E. 634; <em>Roller </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>98 Vt. 514, 518, 129 A. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The test of incapacity is not the employee\u2019s ability or disability because of his injury to do his old job but whether he could do another job and earn as much money. <em>Osterlund </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 505. It does not appear that the failure of the plaintiff to find other work which he is capable of doing is due to any inca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>pacity resulting from his injury. To require an employer to pay compensation for incapacity to do a specific job when the employee is capable of doing other work which he, cannot get, not because of his incapacity due to injury but because of slackness of business conditions, would be going into the field of employment insurance rather than workmen\u2019s compensation. <em>Ferrara </em>v. <em>Clifton Wright Hat Co., </em>supra, 143. The union contract cannot determine the plaintiff\u2019s capacity or lack of capacity to work.- It can only secure his old job for him provided he is not incapacitated to do that job. If he has equal earning capacity in other work, but there is no other work because of business conditions, he is not totally incapacitated within the meaning of our statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the Superior Court with direction to dismiss the appeal from the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
