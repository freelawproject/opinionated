Both decisions relate to the Secretary\u2019s handling of administrative appeals brought by post-secondary schools seeking to maintain their eligibility to participate in federal student loan programs. In <em>Atlanta College of Medical &amp; Dental Careers, Inc. v. Alexander, </em>792 F.Supp. 114 (D.D.C.1992), the flagship appeal, the district court vacated the Secretary\u2019s determination that two post-secondary schools were no longer eligible to participate in the loan programs. The court found that the Secretary had acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, by making a successful appeal of the initial ineligibility determination dependent upon producing information to which the schools had no access. In <em>Wilfred American Educational Corp v. Alexander, </em>No. 92-1384, 1992 WL 464232 (D.D.C. July 7, 1992), the district court, relying on <em>Atlanta College, </em>preliminarily enjoined the Secretary from implementing his ineligibility determinations in the case of two other schools. We affirm both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">A. <em>Statutory and Regulatory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">Under the Federal Family Education Loan (\u201cFFEL\u201d) program (formerly known as the Guaranteed Student Loan program), post-secondary students obtain loans from private lenders to pay for tuition, fees, and living expenses at eligible educational institutions. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.100-.101. Guaranty agencies \u2014 private nonprofit or state-run organizations \u2014 insure repayment of these loans. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1078(b)-(c). The Department of Education (\u201cDOE\u201d), in turn, provides reinsurance to the guaranty agencies. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1078(c); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.404.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-17\">The loan guaranty program works as follows: For Stafford Loans,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a student generally begins paying interest, principal, or both on a loan after a six month grace period running from the last date of full- or half-time attendance at a post-secondary institution. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1078(b)(1)(E); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.209(a)(2)(h). If a student is delinquent in repaying her loan, DOE regulations require lenders to engage in due diligence or \u201cservicing\u201d activities \u2014 pressuring the borrower for repayment \u2014 for a 180 day period starting from the later of (1) the day after the borrower misses a payment or (2) 30 days after the borrower enters the repayment period. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.-411(a)-(f). If the borrower does not update overdue payments within the 180 days, the loan goes into default, and the lender submits a claim to the guaranty agency. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.411(f). The guaranty agency then reviews the lender\u2019s records to assure that the lender has met its servicing obligations before paying the claim. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.406(a)(1) (conditioning payment from DOE to the guaranty agency on the lender\u2019s fulfillment of due diligence obligations). If the guaranty agency pays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the claim, it must embark upon its own collection or servicing activities. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.410(b)(4). Should those efforts fail, the guaranty agency may seek reimbursement from DOE.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Because, under this scheme, DOE was forced to ante up increasing amounts of money on defaulted loans, Congress passed the Student Loan Default Prevention Initiative Act (\u201cSLDPIA\u201d) in 1990. That law sought to reduce the cost of the FFEL program by promptly eliminating from the program schools whose students had chronically high rates of default. The SLDPIA amended the Higher Education Act (\u201cHEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1070 <em>et seq., </em>so that a school loses its eligibility of its \u201ccohort default rate\u201d (\u201cCDR\u201d) for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available exceeds a certain percentage. <em>See 20 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(a)(3)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A school\u2019s CDR for any fiscal year is essentially the percentage of current and former students entering the repayment period during that fiscal year who default by the end of the next fiscal year. <em>See </em>,20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(m)(l)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary gets the information necessary to calculate this percentage from the \u201ctape dump,\u201d a collection of student loan data provided by the guaranty agencies. The statute also requires that the Secretary, in making the CDR calculation, \u201cshall ... exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(m)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">When the Secretary determines that a school\u2019s CDR is above the statutory percentage, the school may appeal the Secretary\u2019s decision on only two grounds: the school can attempt to \u201cdemonstrate[ ] to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the Secretary\u2019s calculation of its cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce its cohort default rate for any of the three fiscal years below the threshold percentage\u201d or the school can endeavor to show \u201cexceptional mitigating circumstances\u201d that would make its loss of eligibility \u201cinequitable.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(a)(3)(A)(i)-(ii).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If, as in these cases, a school desires to appeal on the first ground, <em>i.e., </em>the inaccuracy of the calculation, it must, within 30 days of notification of ineligibility, submit specific relevant data to the guaranty agencies. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(a)(3)(A); 56 Fed.Reg. 33332, 33336-7 (1991); <em>id. </em>at 33340 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 668.15(g)(3)). After the guaranty agencies respond, the school must forward the entire package of information to the Secretary, who has 45 days in which to decide the appeal. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(a)(3)(A); 56 Fed.Reg. at 33340 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 668.15(g)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">B. <em>Facts of Phillips Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXt\">On July 15, 1991, DOE notified Atlanta College of Medical and Dental Careers and Louisville College of Medical and Dental Careers (collectively, the \u201cPhillips schools\u201d), that their CDRs exceeded the 35% statutory threshold for fiscal years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>1987, 1988, and 1989, and that, accordingly, they were ineligible to participate further in the FFEL program. The Phillips schools\u2019 rates exceeded the statutory benchmark by less than 1% \u2014 Atlanta College\u2019s 1987 rate was 35.0% and Louisville College\u2019s 1988 rate was 35.7%. Accordingly, both schools appealed, claiming that the Secretary\u2019s calculation of their CDRs was inaccurate. Because \u00a7 1085(m)(l)(B) requires that the Secretary exclude any loans from the CDR which \u201cdue to improper servicing or calculation, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation,\u201d the Phillips schools sent off a series of letters to DOE asking how they could demonstrate in their appeals that loans should have been excluded on the basis of improper servicing. Those letters went unanswered.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The Phillips schools also retained the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand (\u201cCoopers\u201d) to aid their appeal. From the schools\u2019 own records, Coopers determined each student\u2019s last date of attendance and, by adding the six month grace period required for Stafford loans, computed the date on which the student\u2019s loan presumably would have entered repayment. Coopers then compared each of those projected dates of repayment with the date listed in the tape dump data relied on by DOE. Using this methodology, Coopers reported hundreds of suspected errors in DOE\u2019s information on the Phillips schools\u2019 students. These errors were of several types. \u201cError 1\u201d cases were student accounts for which the repayment date as computed by Coopers fell in a different fiscal year than the one listed in the tape dump (if the tape dump put the repayment date in the wrong fiscal year, DOE would have placed the loan in the wrong cohort default period). \u201cError 2\u201d and \u201cError 3\u201d cases were student accounts that Coopers had reason to believe received grace periods either shorter or longer than the prescribed period, <em>i.e., </em>where the time between the student\u2019s last date of attendance listed in the school\u2019s records and the repayment date listed in the tape dump was either more or less than six months. The Phillips schools asserted that lenders\u2019 use of incorrect grace periods constituted improper servicing causing defaults and that, under \u00a7 1085(m), those loans should be excluded from the schools\u2019 CDRs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In accordance with DOE regulations, the schools sent the information compiled by Coopers to the guaranty agencies for \u201cverification.\u201d The guaranty agencies confirmed a few errors, rejected the rest largely without explanation, and recommended that the schools take up any remaining issues with DOE. The Phillips schools then submitted the guaranty agencies\u2019 responses, along with the Coopers report, to DOE. On January 3, 1992, DOE responded that each school\u2019s appeal was denied \u201c[bjased on the information confirmed by the guarantee agency or agencies\u201d and that the school was no longer eligible to participate in the FFEL program. DOE\u2019s responses indicated that it accepted only the few errors confirmed by the guaranty agencies; all other allegations were denied without any specific explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Dissatisfied with DOE's responses, the Phillips schools filed suit in district court asserting that DOE had violated the Administrative Procedure Act in eliminating them from the FFEL program. After the district court opined that the January 3 letters provided scant explanation for DOE\u2019s actions, DOE issued supplemental letters on March 4, 1992. Those letters explained that DOE rejected the Phillips schools\u2019 allegations <em>en masse </em>because the methodology employed in the Coopers report was \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d According to DOE, Coopers\u2019 technique of calculating the date a loan entered repayment by adding six months to the student\u2019s last date of attendance at the Phillips schools did not control for other factors that might affect the repayment date. Specifically, DOE argued that (1) a student may have received a deferment of repayment because she en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>tered another school during the six month grace period; (2) the lender may have used month-specific, and not day-specific, repayment calculations; or (3) the school may not have notified the lender that the student had left school, resulting in the repayment date being calculated from the projected date of graduation, rather than the actual last date of attendance. Information about such factors, DOE claimed, \u201cis essential to the proper determination of a student\u2019s \u2018date entered repayment\u2019 ... but is not reflected in the school files used by and referred to by [Coopers] and your school in your appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">On June 7, 1992, the district court vacated DOE\u2019s decisions and remanded the case to DOE. The court first found that the agency did not provide sufficient explanation for its decision to expel the Phillips schools from the program and that the explanation it did provide indicated that DOE had simply accepted the findings of the guaranty agencies, and had not engaged in any independent review of the whole record. Further, DOE\u2019s March 4 supplemental decision letters rendered the appeal procedure arbitrary and capricious by relying on hypothetical considerations that might make the Coopers results inaccurate. These additional considerations placed the schools in a \u201ccatch-22\u201d situation: the schools did not have the necessary material in their own records to exclude the hypothetical possibilities and so could not possibly rebut DOE\u2019s presumptive reliance on the guaranty agency data about student accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">C. <em>Facts of Wilfred Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXy\">In June 1991, the Secretary notified the Wilfred Academy of Hair and Beauty Culture in Manhattan and the Wilfred Academy of Hair and Beauty Culture in the Bronx (collectively, the \u201cWilfred schools\u201d), that they would no longer be eligible to participate in the FFEL program because their CDRs exceeded the 35% statutory threshold. Both schools appealed their termination on the ground that the Secretary had inaccurately calculated the schools\u2019 CDRs. Like the Phillips schools, the Wilfred schools based their appeals in part on the Secretary\u2019s failure to exclude loans that defaulted due to \u201cimproper servicing\u201d by lenders. But, unlike the Phillips schools\u2019 Error 2 and Error 3 claims alleging improper grace periods, the Wilfred schools sought directly to contest the lender\u2019s performance of its due diligence obligation to call and write borrowers during the 180 day period after the loan became delinquent. While the Phillips schools\u2019 servicing claims based on grace periods could be pursued by comparing the tape dump data with school data, the Wilfred schools\u2019 servicing claims could only be pursued through direct access to the lender\u2019s servicing records, which are in the possession of the guaranty agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Accordingly, to back their claim, the Wilfred schools were forced to request servicing information from the guaranty agencies. They did just that, and also wrote letters to DOE seeking help in obtaining the necessary material. The guaranty agencies refused to provide the data, and DOE never responded to the Wilfred schools\u2019 inquiries. The schools also compiled information on other alleged calculation inaccuracies (specifically, that some additional loans should have been included in the 1988 CDR calculation), which they submitted first to the guaranty agencies and ultimately to the Secretary. Although the Secretary accepted some of these allegations \u2014 resulting in the Manhattan school\u2019s 1988 CDR being reduced to 35.0% \u2014 he ultimately denied both schools\u2019 appeals without addressing their request for the loan servicing data.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Wilfred then filed suit in the district court. That court, agreeing with the <em>Atlanta </em>court that DOE arbitrarily required the schools to produce loan servicing data that was not available to them, granted Wilfred\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">A. <em>The Secretary\u2019s Interpretation of the Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The Secretary appeals both district court decisions. His primary contention on appeal is that, in both cases, the district court proceeded from the false premise that \u201cimproper servicing\u201d is a defense to an ineligibility determination based on a school\u2019s CDR.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the Secretary, he need not, and in fact does not, recognize such a defense, and thus he has done nothing improper in disposing of the schools\u2019 servicing claims without allowing the schools access to information necessary to make out the \u201cphantom\u201d servicing defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In making this argument, the Secretary stresses that the statute explicitly requires only that schools be able to contest their loss of FFEL program eligibility on the grounds that the \u201cSecretary\u2019s calculation of [the] cohort default rate is not accurate\u201d or that \u201cexceptional mitigating circumstances\u201d would make ineligibility inequitable. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(a)(3)(A)(i)-(ii). According to the Secretary, since \u201cimproper servicing\u201d is not among the explicitly enumerated defenses to ineligibility, we must defer to his reasonable conclusion that the HEA, a statute whose enforcement Congress has delegated to his agency, does not include such a defense. More specifically, he argues that it is at best ambiguous whether an appeal based on the Secretary\u2019s inaccurate \u201ccalculation\u201d under \u00a7 1085(a)(3)(A)(i) is meant to encompass servicing complaints. As a result, the Secretary contends, we must accept as reasonable his reading of the term \u201ccalculation\u201d as only encompassing appeals based on inaccuracies in the tape dump data and not appeals based on alleged servicing errors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, while the Secretary acknowledges that the statute says that \u201cthe Secretary shall ... in calculating the cohort default rate, exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(m)(l)(B), he insists that he need not implement that command through allowance of appeals based on improper servicing. Rather, he asserts, he may satisfy the statute\u2019s mandate through rigorous \u201cfront end\u201d prophylactic procedures such as auditing lenders and requiring them to certify that they have met servicing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">In assessing the Secretary\u2019s argument, we must of course follow the analytic framework announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Following that well-trodden path, we first determine if the statute\u2019s text speaks directly to the question at hand; \u201c[i]f the statute is clear and unambiguous, \u2018that is the end of the matter, for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System v. Dimension Financial Corp., </em>474 U.S. 361, 368, 106 S.Ct. 681, 685, 88 L.Ed.2d 691 (1986) (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781); <em>see also Public Employees Retirement System v. Betts, </em>492 U.S. 158, 171, 109 S.Ct. 2854, 2863, 106 L.Ed.2d 134 (1989) (\u201c[N]o deference is due to agency interpretations at odds with the plain language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the statute itself.\u201d). Only if we find that the statute is silent or ambiguous as to the issue presented do we consider whether the agency\u2019s construction is reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2782.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In this case, we find that the statute\u2019s text forecloses the Secretary's contention'that improper servicing arguments can be walled off completely from the appeals process, and so we accord no deference to his interpretation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The statute plainly contemplates appeals arguing that the \u201cSecretary\u2019s calculation of [the] cohort default rate is not accurate.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(a)(3)(A)(i). And, in defining a cohort default rate, the statute specifically states: \u201c[T]he Secretary shall ... in <em>calculating </em>the cohort default rate, exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(m)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Reading these provisions in tandem, two things seem indisputable. First, a school must be able to allege in an appeal that the Secretary\u2019s CDR \u201ccalculation\u201d is \u201cnot accurate.\u201d Second, the Secretary, <em>in calculating the CDR, </em>is required to ex-elude loans that \u201cdue to improper servicing or collection\u201d would render the calculation \u201cinaccurate\u201d or \u201cincomplete.\u201d Putting these two givens together, it becomes clear that the Secretary must entertain appeals alleging that he has failed to exclude from his calculation of the CDR loans that due to improper servicing make that calculation inaccurate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this regard, \u00a7 1085(m) reflects a not surprising congressional recognition that the actions of lenders \u2014 a group that because of the presence of the indirect federal guaranty has no direct economic incentive to engage in thorough servicing\u2014 may have a critical impact upon the accuracy of the Secretary\u2019s calculation of student default rates. That recognition, coupled with Congress\u2019 earlier decision to allow appeals asserting inaccurate calculations, necessarily sanctions the type of administrative appeal the appellee schools seek to bring here. Put another way, when the statute declares that the handling of a particular part of the calculation may affect the accuracy of the calculation, the Secretary may not exclude consideration of that factor from an appeal that, under the provisions of the same statute, may be based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the alleged inaccuracy of the calculation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The Secretary\u2019s alternative interpretation of the statute ignores key elements of its text. In asserting that the word \u201ccalculation\u201d in \u00a7 1085(a)(3) is ambiguous and may reasonably be interpreted only to allow appeals based on tape dump inaccuracies, the Secretary overlooks the fact that the statute explicitly makes it part of the Secretary\u2019s calculation chore to exclude loans that \u201cdue to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.\u201d Under \u00a7 1085(m), the Secretary is directed to exclude such loans \u201cin calculating the cohort default rate.\u201d Thus, whether or not the term \u201ccalculation\u201d is ambiguous in any other respect, under \u00a7 1085(m), that term must encompass the task of excluding loans that as a result of improper servicing would \u201cresult in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.\u201d Similarly, in arguing that the Secretary\u2019s statutory duty to exclude such loans is satisfied by his \u201cfront end\u201d procedures, the Secretary does not come to terms with the same statutory command: notwithstanding any other procedures he undertakes to assure the lenders\u2019 fulfillment of their servicing obligations, \u00a7 1085(m) requires the Secretary to exclude loans that defaulted due to improper servicing \u201cin calculating the cohort default rate\u201d at the \u201cback end\u201d of the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">B. <em>The Secretary\u2019s Administrative Concerns</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">We decide only that schools must be allowed to argue in an appeal that the Secretary\u2019s CDR calculation is inaccurate because the Secretary failed to \u201cexclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(m)(l)(B). We do not, however, attempt to delineate precisely what that quoted phrase means or how the Secretary must administer appeals relying on that directive.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We stress this point because the Secretary argues that litigation on the servicing of each loan at issue would result in time-consuming investigations by guaranty agencies and schools and complex and burdensome evaluations by DOE. We sympathize with the Secretary\u2019s distaste for such a prospect. Moreover, and more importantly, the short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>time period provided by the statute for the disposition of these appeals \u2014 30 days for the schools to complete their appeal and 45 days for the Secretary to rule on a complete appeal \u2014 may indeed indicate that Congress, in enacting the SLDPIA, was also concerned with expedited processing of schools\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">But the Secretary\u2019s understandable concerns along these lines cannot trump a clear statutory injunction. And, in any case, we do not think our decision is at loggerheads with the Secretary\u2019s desire for expeditious decertification of schools that truly have impermissibly high CDRs. The Secretary can avail himself of many options in processing appeals based on \u201cimproper servicing.\u201d For example, under the statute, not all improperly serviced loans are to be excluded from the CDR calculation; rather, only loans that <em>\u201cdue to </em>improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate\u201d need be excluded. This causal connection could be difficult to demonstrate: How does a school show that an added phone call or a month tacked on to a grace period would have prevented a loan\u2019s default? And must the school show \u201cbut for\u201d causation, proximate causation or merely some reasonable causal link? The statute itself provides no answers to these riddles; accordingly, under Chevron's second step, we would defer to any reasonable interpretation of the \u201cdue to\u201d language that the Secretary proffered. <em>See also </em>Jerry Mashaw, <em>A Comment on Causation, Law Reform, and Guerrilla Warfare, </em>73 Geo.L.Rev. 1393, 1396 (1985) (identifying the \u201ccause\u201d of something necessarily implicates a policy choice). And, under the circumstances, it would seem quite reasonable for the Secretary to adopt regulations or even adjudicatory presumptions \u2014 bright-line rules \u2014 as to what a school must show to demonstrate that the calculation is inaccurate \u201cdue to\u201d improper servicing. <em>See American Hospital Association v. NLRB, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 111 S.Ct. 1539, 1543, 113 L.Ed.2d 675 (1991) (prior Supreme Court decisions \u201cconfirm that, even if a statutory scheme requires individualized determinations, the decision-maker has the authority to rely on rule-making to resolve certain issues of general applicability\u201d unless Congress expressly withholds that authority); <em>Heckler v. Campbell, </em>461 U.S. 458, 467, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 1957, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983) (same); <em>New England Coalition on Nuclear Pollution v. NRC, </em>727 F.2d 1127, 1129 (D.C.Cir.1984) (Scalia, J.) (even where statutory mandate requires an agency to consider a specific issue, that \u201cdoes not preclude the adoption of appropriate generalized criteria that would render some case-by-case evaluations unnecessary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Such a course may alleviate some of the litigation burden that the Secretary fears. If it does not go far enough, the Secretary may be forced to petition Congress for authority to create a more manageable system.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The Secretary raises an additional argument relevant only to the <em>Atlanta College </em>appeal. He alleges that the district court, in requiring the Secretary to rebut the allegations in the Coopers report, improperly flipped the statutory burden of proof. We are unpersuaded. While the Secretary is correct in noting that the schools have the burden of demonstrating errors in the CDR calculation \u201cto the satisfaction of the Secretary,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(a)(3)(A)(i), the district court\u2019s decision did not contravene that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">The district court found that the Secretary could not deny a claim on the ground that the schools had not excluded possible scenarios that could affect the accuracy of the schools\u2019 submissions when those scenarios could only be eliminated with information unavailable to the schools. We believe the district court was correct in this conclusion. The statutorily granted right to appeal would be meaningless if the Secretary could reject for \u201chypothetical\u201d reasons a school\u2019s showing of a mistaken calculation backed up by all the information to which the schools had access. <em>See </em>792 F.Supp. at 122 (\u201cBy requiring the schools to produce data that is not available to them before it will even consider errors</p>\n<p id=\"AMu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>alleged by them, the Department has transformed its initial reliance on the guarantee agencies\u2019 data into an irrebuttable presumption, and has therefore rendered the appeals process ... arbitrary and capricious.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 119 &amp; n. 11 (with the exception of information related to student attendance in another institution before expiration of the grace period, DOE does not deny that schools have used all information available to them); Affidavit of Marilyn Coleman, Student Loan Officer for Phillips Colleges, Inc., at \u00b6 3 (guaranty agencies and DOE will not share relevant information with Phillips); DOE Brief at 33 (\u201c[School] records have no official status in regard to students\u2019 [loans] and ... have little relevance to the issue of whether the borrower is or is not in default during a particular period of time.\u201d); Reply Brief at 10 (asserting that more important than the specific inadequacies in the schools\u2019 documentation is the fact that the schools\u2019 data is \u201cirrelevant\u201d because it is the lender\u2019s data that is official).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While the Secretary remains free to be terse and informal in his response to the schools, <em>see, e.g., Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 143, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 1244, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973) <em>(per curiam), </em>the schools have \u201cgone about as far as they can go\u201d when they present specific allegations supported by all the information available to them and when that information is sufficient, if undisputed, to require the Secretary to reverse his eligibility determination. <em>See Geddes v. Benefits Review Bd., </em>735 F.2d 1412, 1418 (D.C.Cir. 1984) (burden of bringing forward evidence generally shifts when the defendant has greater access to information on a particular issue). Of course, such a requirement does not place the ultimate burden of proof on the Secretary; rather, it places a burden on him only to <em>produce </em>countervailing evidence or a reason, not based on the insufficiency of the school\u2019s showing, that explains why the school\u2019s allegations have not been accepted. <em>Cf. Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093-94, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (while intermediate evidentiary burdens under Title VII shift, the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact remains at all times with the plaintiff). Such a requirement is minimally necessary to assure that the statutory promise of an appeal is not broken in practice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">The plain language of the statute bars DOE\u2019s contention that it need not consider loan servicing arguments in its appeals process. Additionally, the Secretary may not reject an appeal on a basis that would render the appeals process a nullity. Thus, he may not reject without justification an allegation which if proven true would sustain a school\u2019s eligibility claim and which is supported by all the evidence within a school\u2019s access. Accordingly, the <em>Atlanta </em>court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Also, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>cause we reject the Secretary\u2019s lone objection to the preliminary injunction in the <em>Wilfred </em>case \u2014 the assertion that the statute does not mandate an improper servicing defense \u2014 that injunction is affirmed and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\">. The FFEL includes the Stafford Loan program, the Supplemental Loans for Students (\u201cSLS\") program, the PLUS Loan program, and the Federal Consolidated Loan program. Only the grace period for the Stafford program is relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-5\">. That threshold was 35% for the years relevant to these appeals, but shrinks to 30% for default rate calculations made in 1993 and 25% thereafter. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(a)(3)(B); Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102-325, 106 Stat. 448, 549 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\">. Section 1085(m) (as reorganized by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102-325, 106 Stat. 448, 550 (1992)) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">(1) IN GENERAL \u2014 (A) ... [T]he term \"cohort default rate\" means, for any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former students at the institution enter repayment on loans under section 428 or 428(A) received for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment on such loans received for attendance at that institution in that fiscal year who default before the end of the following fiscal year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">(B) In determining the number of students who default before the end of such fiscal year, the Secretary shall include only loans for which the Secretary or a guaranty agency has paid claims for insurance, and, in calculating the cohort default rate, exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-12\">.The Secretary has defined by regulation what constitutes \"exceptional mitigating circumstances.\" <em>See </em>56 Fed.Reg. 33332, 33339-40 (1991) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 668.-15(g)(l)(ii)-(iii)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b185-5\">. Their causation theory was that if a student is given too short a grace period, she may not have obtained work yet, and thus could not begin repayment and, conversely, that if a student is given too long a grace period, the lender may lose track of her whereabouts, and thus would be unable to exert the necessary pressure for repayment. <em>See </em>Atlanta College Brief at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\">. In the <em>Wilfred </em>case, in contrast to the <em>Atlanta </em>decision, the court found that DOE had engaged in an independent review of default rate data <em>not </em>related to servicing, and thus, at least in that regard, avoided any problem of irrebuttable re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>liance on guaranty agency data to which the schools had no access.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\">. The government's contests the <em>Wilfred </em>court\u2019s injunction solely on the basis of this legal claim; it does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination as to any of the other factors relevant to granting injunctive relief. <em>See, e.g., Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 </em>F.2d 669, 673-74 (D.C.Cir. 1985) (listing the relevant considerations).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\">. Even if the Secretary were correct that the statute does not require him to consider an improper servicing appeal, that would not affect the Phillips schools\u2019 Error 1 claims. Recall that those claims allege that the Secretary put student accounts in the wrong cohort default period because he relied on tape dump data that miscalculated the accounts\u2019 date entering repayment. Later on, we reject the only argument that the Secretary raises, <em>i.e., </em>an alleged reversal of the statutory burden of proof, that would affect the district court\u2019s determination on the Error 1 claims. <em>See infra </em>Part III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b187-14\">.Indeed, the Secretary asserts that we would have to uphold as reasonable an interpretation of \u201ccalculation\u201d as including only appeals based on purely mathematical errors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\">. There is a second reason militating against deference to the interpretation proffered by the Secretary here. Although for purposes of our statutory analysis we accept the government\u2019s attribution of this interpretation to the \"Secretary,\" there is in fact scant evidence that the Secretary or responsible policymakers at DOE\u2014 rather than the attorneys who have litigated this case \u2014 subscribe to this reading of the statutory language. As best we can tell, this interpretation was not articulated by the agency in any of its decision letters. Nor was such an interpretation raised by DOE\u2019s lawyers before the district court in the <em>Atlanta </em>litigation, (a fact which by itself would normally preclude our addressing that argument in the <em>Atlanta </em>portion of this appeal, <em>see District of Columbia v. Air Florida, Inc., </em>750 F.2d 1077, 1084-85 (D.C.Cir.1984)). Finally, there is evidence that at least some agency policymakers take a different view of this issue. <em>See infra </em>note 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The familiar rule is that we do not defer to an interpretative position that is not articulated by the agency itself. <em>See, e.g., Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 628, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 1097-98, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971). We have recognized that this rule might be inapplicable when there is no risk that counsel may have acted as \"mavericks, disembodied from the agency that they represent,\" <em>Church of Scientology v. IRS, </em>792 F.2d 153, 165 (D.C.Cir.1986) <em>(en banc) </em>(Silberman, J., concurring), <em>aff'd, </em>484 U.S. 9, 108 S.Ct. 271, 98 L.Ed.2d 228 (1987), and when there is no danger that the position was adopted in haste without an opportunity for presentation of alternative views. <em>See FLRA v. Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service, </em>884 F.2d 1446, 1455-56 (D.C.Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1055, 110 S.Ct. 863-64, 107 L.Ed.2d 947-48 (1990). Because of the facts noted above, however, we cannot confidently exclude those risks in this case. Thus, the requirements for invoking such an exception have not been met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\">. In fact, DOE\u2019s own Director of Student Assistance Programs seems to have reached a similar conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">Q. So your view is that improper servicing or collecting was not a basis for appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">A. Improper servicing or collecting can yield incorrect data. And the incorrect data is definitely a basis for appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Deposition of William Moran, <em>CBM Education Center v. Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corp., </em>No. 92-2012-M (Bankr.S.D.Tex.) (quoted in Brief for Amicus Curiae Career College Association at 6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b189-5\">. The legislative history of the relevant provisions provides no sure answer to the precise question raised by this case. <em>See Independent Community Bankers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </em>820 F.2d 428, 434 (D.C.Cir.1987) (clear meaning of a statute can be overridden only by a clearly contrary legislative intent), <em>cert, denied, </em>484 U.S. 1004, 108 S.Ct. 695, 98 L.Ed.2d 647 (1988). There is, however, a great deal of evidence that Congress was aware that lenders had often been remiss in fulfilling their servicing obligations. <em>See, e.g., Abuses in Federal Student Aid Programs: Hearings Before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, </em>101st Cong., 2d Sess., Part 3 at 165, 170 (Sept. 25-26, 1990) <em>(\"Abuses Hearings\") </em>(staff statement) (\"Despite the possible loss of the federal guarantee, there is evidence suggesting that many lenders fail to comply with due diligence requirements.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 283, 302-07 (statement of Garry D. Hays, President of Higher Education Assistance Foundation (guaranty agency)) (describing systematic servicing deficiencies by a lender). In fact, Congress added the relevant part of \u00a7 1085(m) as a \u201ctechnical amendment\u201d to the Student Right-to-know and Campus Security Act because DOE sought explicit authority to recalculate CDRs that were too <em>low </em>because of lenders' errors. <em>See Abuses Hearings, </em>Part 4, at 141, 245 (Letter from Ted Sanders, Deputy Secretary of Education, to Senator Sam Nunn). Thus, the disputed language resulted from DOE\u2019s own recognition that, despite its \"front end\u201d mechanisms, the calculation of CDRs may be rendered inaccurate by improper servicing.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">The Secretary points to the fact that Senator Kennedy, in introducing the amendment to \u00a7 1085(m), said that the provision \"allows\u201d the Secretary to exclude improperly serviced loans, <em>see </em>136 Cong.Rec. S13129 (daily ed. Sept. 13, 1990), as evidence that this authority is discretionary. This interpretation, aside from being based on a single, ambiguous statement of a lone legislator, conflicts with the ordinary meaning of the requirement that the Secretary \"shall\u201d exclude such loans. <em>See, e.g., Escoe v. Zerbst, </em>295 U.S. 490, 493, 55 S.Ct. 818, 819, 79 L.Ed. 1566 (1935) (\"shall\u201d is the \u201clanguage of command\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\">. There is one caveat to this broad statement. We do find, <em>see infra </em>Part III, that the Secretary may not administer the appeals process in a way that requires schools to proffer information that they cannot obtain in order to maintain a successful appeal, whether that appeal is based on improper servicing or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>. </em>Since the Secretary does not allege that the schools in fact could have obtained the relevant information through more diligent efforts, we need not decide what amount of effort a school must exert to obtain the necessary information in order to shift the burden of production. We do note, however, that given the Secretary\u2019s broad discretion in structuring the appeals process, we would be bound to defer to any reasonable standard that he devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We also do not decide whether there may be situations where the Secretary could deny the schools access to data in order to further another policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">. The Secretary also alleges that the district court improperly shifted the burden of proof on a different issue. In a footnote, the district court noted that the Secretary had moved students who the Secretary admitted were improperly placed in the 1988 CDR period into the 1987 CDR period and stated that it was unclear whether the Secretary could shift loans in that manner or whether he had to exclude those loans entirely. <em>See </em>792 F.Supp. at 118 n. 10. The court found that it was impossible to tell whether the Secretary had the authority to shift the loans because the Secretary\u2019s conclusory findings did not explain why the errors were acknowledged in the first place \u2014 if the Secretary acknowledged a mere accounting error then the defaulted loan could likely be shifted to a new period, but if the error involved \u201cservicing,\u201d the statute would seem to require outright \"exclusion\u201d from all CDR calculations. <em>See id. </em>(citing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085(m)). We agree with the district court that, absent some explanation for the Secretary\u2019s original decision to accept the errors, a court cannot determine whether the Secretary\u2019s shifting of errors to another cohort default period is permissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b192-5\">D.H. GINSBURG, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4i\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">I concur in the judgment of ,the court. Because the Congress did not in the Higher Education Act speak unambiguously to the precise question here at issue, and because the construction of the Act now advanced by the Department of Education is an afterthought and hence cannot support an administrative decision based upon another ground, the judgment of the district court must be affirmed. For the same reasons, however, we need not and should not purport authoritatively to construe the Act today.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The Department argues to this court that a school may not challenge its disqualification from the Federal Family Education Loan program on the ground that its student loan default rate has been miscalculated due to errors made by lenders in servicing the loans. As the court notes, however, there is \u201cscant evidence that the Secretary or responsible policymakers at DOE\u2014 rather than the attorneys who have litigated this case \u2014 subscribe to this reading of the statutory language.\u201d Ct.Op. at 164 n. 10. Indeed, the scant evidence is all contra.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">In his decision letters to the schools the Secretary clearly proceeded from the premise that improper servicing is indeed a permissible ground for appeal. For example, in a decision letter written to Phillips College even after the commencement of this litigation the Secretary said that the study that the College had submitted in order to substantiate its claim that its default rate was fatally high only because of servicing errors was \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d in its methodology and therefore did \u201cnot support [the] school\u2019s claim of improper servicing.\u201d [JA 358], In that letter the Secretary also noted that the Department did \u201cnot have any information indicating that the guarantee agencies mentioned in [the school\u2019s] appeal have paid default claims on loans to [its] students that were not serviced in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\u201d Clearly the Secretary believed that such information would be relevant to his ruling upon the school's claim. That position is flatly inconsistent, however, with the argument that the Department\u2019s counsel now advances to this court, <em>viz. </em>that improper servicing is not a permissible ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Of course, were we able to determine under <em>Chevron </em>Step I that the Congress specifically intended in the Act to bar servicing errors as a ground for appeal, then the Department\u2019s inconstancy would be of no moment. An agency order compelled by the one true reading of a statute cannot be arbitrary and capricious. <em>See H. Friendly, Chenery Revisited: Reflections on Reversal and Remand of Administrative Orders, </em>1969 Duke L.J. 199, 210 (1969). The Act is not unambiguous, however, as is shown in the opinion of the court, above at page 164, note 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The Department now urges us to uphold the Secretary\u2019s action under <em>Chevron </em>Step II upon the basis of an interpretation of the Act clearly not contemplated by the Secretary. In this circumstance, we do well to recall what Judge Silberman noted elsewhere: \u201cCourts have rejected as inadequate agency counsel\u2019s articulation of a statutory interpretation when that interpretation has been inconsistent with a prior administrative construction ... [; or] when1 the .record evidence before the court demonstrates no link between counsel\u2019s interpretation and administrative practice ...; or when agency counsel\u2019s interpretation is revealed as no more than a \u2018current litigating position.\u2019 \u201d <em>Church of Scientology of Cal. v. I.R.S., </em>792 F.2d 153, 165 (D.C.Cir. 1986) (Silberman, J. concurring) (citations omitted). The first two conditions clearly obtain here and the third may as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Because the Secretary did not rely upon the interpretation of the Act now being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>advanced, counsel\u2019s new interpretation cannot ward off the claim that the Secretary\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious. \u201c[A]n order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.\u201d <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 88, 95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459-60, 462, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we cannot sustain the Secretary\u2019s appeal from the decisions of the district court. I therefore concur in my colleagues\u2019 determination that those decisions must be affirmed, and express no opinion, because it is unnecessary to do so in order to decide this case, upon the question whether improper servicing is a valid ground of objection to a school\u2019s exclusion from the FFEL program. The Department\u2019s lawyers advance a serious argument that, having imposed prophylactic measures upon the lenders and guarantee agencies, the Secretary may, in calculating the cohort default rate, rely upon the data they produce. If that is indeed the Secretary\u2019s position, then he should be free to adhere to that position first in some future administrative proceeding and to defend it in court, unhampered by a premature decision to the contrary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
