The rejected claims read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-22\">\u201c15. A gas filtering element consisting of corrugated wire in strand form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-23\">\u201c16. A filtering medium consisting of a .mass of corrugated wire in strand form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-24\">\u201c17. A filtering medium consisting of corrugated wire in strand form arranged in a mass to define a maze of tortuous gas filtering passages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-25\">Appellant, in his specification and drawings, discloses a filter cell having a frame work with screens. In the interior of the cell there is a space adapted to be filled with corrugated wire. The figure illustrative of the wire shows a strand crimped to form small corrugations, the strand so crimped being again crimped in a manner to superimpose larger corrugations upon the smaller. In other words, the strand is doubly crimped, or corrugated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-26\">The brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office states that rejection was based \u201con grounds involving res adjudicata and want of patentability over the prior art.\u201d The prior art reference cited is a patent to Lucien C. Cruyt, 1,450,951, April 10, 1923. This patent relates to a wet-filter screen having a frame filled with a smooth nonporous material tangled into a spongiform mass. The specification of the patent teaches: \u201cSome suitable materials for this purpose [forming the spongiform mass] are metal wire, round or ovalized, metal ribbons and glass or celluloid filaments or ribbons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-27\">A figure of the patent drawings discloses the wire in looped form.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-28\">In view of the grounds of- rejection, a brief recital of the history of the prosecution of the application is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-29\">The record does not contain all the actions affecting the application. It is deducible from it, however, that the application was filed June 30, 1926, many claims being presented; that all the claims were rejected by the examiner; that appeal was-taken to the Board of Appeals from the rejectiqn of claims, numbered 6 to 14, inclusive, and that the board affirmed the decision of the examiner as to claims 6 to.-12, inclusive, but reversed as to claims 13. and 14. The decision of the examiner from, which that appeal was taken does not appear in the record. The decision of the board, rendered December 29, 1931, is in the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>record. The record contains nothing respecting any further action in the case until March 20, 1936. The brief on behalf of appellant, however, supplies the following information which it is deemed permissible to quote: \u201cAfter the Board\u2019s first decision, suit was filed against the Commissioner of Patents in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to compel the issuance of a patent containing the rejected claims. This suit was dismissed in May, 1935, and thereafter, the rejected claims [1-12] were cancelled, and the application allowed, forfeited, and finally, on March 20, 1936, renewed with new claims 15-17 inclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The \u201cfirst decision,\u201d so referred to, is that of December 29, 1931. In that decision, claim 6 was rejected as being \u201cso broad that it does not properly define appellant\u2019s invention.\u201d No issue respecting that claim or the relation of the ground of its rejection to the claims on appeal is involved here. So, it need not be further regarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The board\u2019s discussion of the remainder of the claims rejected in that decision (7-12, inclusive) reads: \u201cClaims 7 and 8 rperely call for a strand of wire adapted to be employed as a filtering medium and in our opinion the structure of a strand of wire having a certain crimping or corrugation does not properly define appellant\u2019s invention. We also believe that in a broad sense the loops of Cruyt may be regarded as crimps. For the last stated reason we consider that claims 9, 10 and 11 do not properly distinguish over Cruyt. Claim 12 does not call for a tangled mass and might involve nothing more than a mass of woven wire screens and it is clear that the wire of these screens would be corrugated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In the statement of the examiner following the appeal to' the board respecting the claims here involved, claims 7-12, inclusive, were quoted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">\u201c7. A strand of wire having a multitude of short small crimps and adapted to be crinkled into a mass for use as a filtering medium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">\u201c8. A strand of wire having a multitude of small corrugations and adapted to be bent upon itself to form a filter medium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">\u201c9. A filter medium comprising a mass of crimped wire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">\u201c10. A filter medium comprising wire preformed with small crimps and arranged in a tangled mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">\u201c11. A filter medium comprising wire preformed with small crimps and crinkled into a mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">\u201c12. A filter medium comprising a mass of corrugated wire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">The examiner\u2019s statement then quoted the above excerpt from the board\u2019s decision of December 29, 1931, and continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">Since claims 15, 16, and 17 were not deemed to distinguish patentably over claims 7-11 previously rejected by the Board, they were rejected finally for the reasons given by the Board ,in the above quoted paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">\u201cClaim 15 is closely similar to old claims 7 and 8. Its language is almost identical to that of claim 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-17\">\u201cOld claims 9-11 recited a mass of crimped wire. Claim 10 specified that the crimped wire was arranged in a tangled mass. New claims 16 and 17 call for a mass of corrugated wire in strand form. Cruyt\u2019s wire clearly is in strand form and the Board held that in a broad sense his loops may be regarded as crimps. They therefore similarly may be regarded as corrugations for the terms, at least as applied to wire, appear to be synonymous. Cruyt\u2019s metal wool is \u2018tangled into a spongi-form mass.\u2019 Page 1, line 85.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-18\">\u201cClaims 16 and 17 also are closely similarly to old claim 12, claim 16 adding to the old claim only the statement that the wire is \u2018in strand form.\u2019 The Board stated that the structure of claim 12 \u2018might involve nothing more than a mass of woven wire screens and it is clear that the wire of these screens would be corrugated.\u2019 It also seems clear that the wire of these screens would be in 'strand form,\u2019 the insertion to the specification to the contrary notwithstanding. It also will \u2018define a maze of tortuous passages\u2019 as added in claim 17.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-19\">The board, passing upon the here appealed claims, said: \u201cFor reasons analogous to those stated by us in the other decision [December 29, 1931], we believe that all of the appealed claims do not define appellant\u2019s invention because they \u00e1re so broad as to read upon a corrugated strand of wire woven into a fabric and the fabric employed as a filter. Claims 16 and 17, of course, would require a plurality of fabrics assembled together to form a mass. We believe, therefore, that none of the appealed claims properly defines appellant\u2019s contribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>We are of the opinion that the claims on appeal here are not patentably distinguishable from the subject matter of claims <em>7 </em>to 12 finally rejected and cancelled from the application, as has been recited. Also, we are of the opinion that when the claims are broadly construed under the general rqle that, as stated in the brief for appellant, \u201c * * * each claim should be given the broadest meaning which can be imposed upon it without violence to the language used in it,\u201d the claims are not patentable over,the cited art.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">As we interpret the brief for appellant, this is virtually conceded, but appellant argues, in substance, that the purpose of this general rule is to prevent indefiniteness in the meaning of claims; that definiteness is insured in this case by a special definition, which, it is urged, was set forth in an amendment to his specification at the time of his renewal of the application; that this definition avoids the application of the general rule which is not inflexible; that the board should have invoked exception to the general rule, and, lastly, that \u201cClaiming Difficulty Merits Exception to General Rule.\u201d No authorities are cited by appellant in support of the foregoing contention, it being said that no \u201cauthority has been discovered which either directly supports or refutes\u201d the position taken as to the avoidance of the general rule by specific definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The amendment to appellant\u2019s specification alluded to above reads: \u201cIt is to be further understood that tbe term \u2018corrugated wire in strand form\u2019 is intended to denote free strands of wire as distinguished from strands which are woven or knitted together, in screen or like form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Whatever of limitation there may be in this definition, such limitation does not appear in the appealed claims and it is well settled that, while claims are to be read in the light of the specification, limitations not in the claim need not be considered even though the application disclosure would support such limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">So far as appellant\u2019s application is concerned, no question is raised as to it supporting the claims at issue. The difficulty is that their breadth brings them in conflict with the prior art. The allowed claims contain certain limitations which the board held rendered them patentable, even before appellant had inserted the defining amendment in the specification. In the case of In re Buckwalter, 75 F.2d 515, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1031, we said (page 516) : \u201cAs has been so often said, the claim is the measure of the invention, and, if appellant\u2019s claims were so broadly drawn as to read upon the prior art, we know of no rule which would authorize the tribunals of the Patent Office, or the courts to read limitations, based upon extraneous arguments, into them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AoY\">Appellant\u2019s argument respecting \u201cclaiming difficulty\u201d is to the effect that the nature of his invention renders difficult the formulation of claims which clearly define the invention and set it apart from the prior art and that this should be taken into consideration and an exception made to the general rule. As stated, no authority was cited in support of this position and we have found none. The statute (R.S. \u00a7 4888, 35 U.S.C.A., \u00a7 33) requires that an inventor \u201c * * * shall particularly point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement, or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">As to the allowed claims in this case, appellant obviously was able to comply with the statutory requirement. One can appreciate the difficulty which appellant had in trying to draw broad claims which would not read on the prior art, the difficulty being that when broad, at least as here expressed, they do conflict with that art.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">In oral argument appellant discussed the matter of non-analogous art, seeking to distinguish from the Cruyt patent upon that basis. By permission of the court, a supplemental memorandum was filed, citing authorities upon this question. These authorities we have examined with interest, but, in our view, there is not a remoteness between the art of the application and the art of the patent which renders them applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">In view of our conclusion as to the claims being anticipated by the prior art, it is unnecessary to consider the question of res adjudicata suggested in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
