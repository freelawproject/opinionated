No. 4. The bond of Noble\u2019s Milk Company filed in the District Court will remain in full force, conditioned as required by law, but shall be void provided Noble\u2019s Milk Company shall pay into the Registry of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts all sums now due and hereafter to become due from it under the provisions of said Order No. 4, excepting the payments due and to become due the Market Administrator under Sec. 1 of Article X of Order No. 4.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
