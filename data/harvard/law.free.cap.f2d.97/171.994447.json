Appellant is therefore the senior party, and the burden was upon appellee to establish priority of invention by a preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-29\">The issue embraces one count, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-30\">\u201cA tube coupling comprising a body having means for attachment to a part to which a tube is to be connected, said body having a shoulder formed therein as an abutment for the end of a tube and having a flaring mouth leading to said shoulder, a sleeve having an annular part with an edge sufficiently hard to cut into the tube, and means to force said sleeve into said flaring mouth and longitudinally of the tube thereby to contract said annular part and cause said edge to shear the outer surface of the tube and form a ridge of appreciable size thereon without appreciably deforming the internal surface of the tube.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-31\">Said count originated in appellant\u2019s application and was suggested to appellee by the Primary Examiner. Appellee copied the same for the purposes of interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-32\">The invention is concisely described in appellee\u2019s brief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-33\">\u201cThe count defines the invention as residing in a tube coupling <em>per se. </em>The tube <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>coupling consists of three parts; \u2014 a body, a gripping sleeve and a cap nut having threaded connection with the body portion. The body portion is defined as having a <em>shoulder </em>formed as an abutment for the end of the tube and a <em>flaring mouth </em>leading to said shoulder. The gripping sleeve is defined as having an annular part with an edge sufficiently hard to cut into the tube. The cap nut is defined as a means for forcing the sleeve into the flaring mouth and longitudinally of the tube so as to cause the annular part of the sleeve to contract and shear the outer surface of the tube to form a ridge of appreciable size <em>without appreciably deforming </em>the internal surface of the tube.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The interference was declared as of April 29, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Appellant in his preliminary statement alleged conception of the invention \u201con or about August-, 1-931,\u201d disclosure to others \u201con or about October, 1931,\u201d and reduction to practice in Germany on November 30, 1932; that said invention was first introduced into the United States on or about October 25, 1933, and that a patent for said invention was applied -for by appellant in Germany on November 26, 1932; that applications for patent for said invention were applied for in Great Britain on May 16, 1933, and in other countries at subsequent dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">On December 14, 1935, appellant gave notice that he would rely upon the filing .of his German application on November 28, 1932, as a constructive reduction to practice of the invention. Said application appears in the record and is dated November 28, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Appellee in, his- preliminary statement alleged conception and disclosure to others on or about the 1st day of July, 1926; with respect to reduction to practice the statement alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\u201c* * * that he first embodied his invention in a full-size device which was completed on or about the 1st day of July, 1926, and that the device was successfully used in the laboratories of The Parker Appliance Company, at Cleveland, Ohio; that several other couplings embodying the subject-matter of the count of the Interference were made on or about September 1, 1934; that he has never put the coupling into production and sold the same publicly; that he began to be active in adapting and perfecting the invention on or about the 1st day of July, 1926.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">It will be observed that no date is alleged by appellee for reduction to practice of the invention.' However, inasmuch as appellant\u2019s reasons for appeal assign no eriror in not confining appellee\u2019s reduction to practice to the filing date of his application, it is unnecessary for us to consider the question of whether appellee, under his preliminary statement, should have been confined to the filing date of his application for conception and reduction to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Appellant took no t\u00e9stimony, but relied upon his United States application, and also, for conception and reduction to practice, relied upon the date of his German application, November 28, 1932,</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">Appellee took testimony to establish priority of invention, and contended that the evidence showed a reduction to practice in 1926 and a second reduction to practice in 1932 or early in 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Both the Examiner of Interferences and the Board of Appeals held that appellee had not established reduction to practice of the invention in 1926, arid before us appellee stated that he accepted these concurring decisions of the Patent Office tribunals and would rely upon reduction to practice of the invention in 1932 or early in 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">Both the Examiner of Interferences and the Board of Appeals held that appellant was restricted to the filing date of his United States application, October 25, 1933, for conception and constructive reduction to practice of the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">The Examiner of Interferences further held that appellee\u2019s Exhibits 2 and 3, upon which he relies for reduction to practice, do not support the count in that the internal surface of the tube in each of the exhibits is \u201cappreciably\u201d deformed; said examiner also held that it had not been' satisfactorily established that said Exhibits 2 and 3 were made prior to Novernber, 1933, and that, assuming that they were made prior to said time, the evidence did not establish that said exhibits were sufficiently tested to constitute a reduction to practice. He therefore awarded priority of invention to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">The Board of Appeals agreed with the Examiner of Interferences that appellant was not entitled to the date of the filing of his German application for conception and reduction to practice- of the invention, but held that appellee\u2019s Exhibits 2 - and 3 support the count, that they were sue-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>cessfully tested prior to any date that can be accorded to appellant, and therefore reversed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences and awarded priority of invention to appellee. From such decision this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">We will first consider appellant\u2019s contention that he is entitled to the date of his German application for conception and reduction to practice of the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">It will be observed that the count calls for a \u201cbody having a shoulder formed therein as an abutment for the end of a tube and having a flaring mouth leading to said shoulder.\u201d Both of the Patent Office tribunals held that appellant\u2019s German application did not disclose a shoulder as required by the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Upon this point the Board of Appeals in its decision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201cIn the German application referred to, the conically tapered portion of one coupling element by which constriction of the cutting sleeve is effected is continuous from end to end. A portion of this tapered surface may be utilized to prevent longitudinal movement of a tube with which the coupling is used but we agree with the Examiner of Interferences that a construction of this sort does not fairly satisfy the limitation in question, especially as the domestic application clearly shows a construction which does satisfy it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The Examiner of Interferences upon the same point stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">\u201cIt is not believed that the count, as thus construed, is readable on Kreidel\u2019s German application. The shoulder, which is a vital element, is recited as distinct from the flaring mouth. In attempting to read the count on the German application, it is not possible, until the tube is inserted, to tell where the shoulder ends and the flaring mouth begins. It is thought that the count requires that - the shoulder and mouth be distinct parts and not arbitrary divisions of a single element. Kreidel will accordingly be restricted to his date of filing in this country \u2014 October 25, 1933.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">We are in accord with the view of the Examiner of Interferences that the count requires that the shoulder and flaring mouth be distinct parts, and not arbitrary divisions of a single element.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">While it is true that the count should receive the broadest interpretation that its \u00a1terms will reasonably permit, we are of the opinion that we would not be warranted in holding that a part of the flaring mouth of the device disclosed in the German 'application constituted a shoulder as required by the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">As hereinbefore noted, the filing date of appellant\u2019s United States application is October 25, 1933. Therefore, in view of the above holding, if appellee conceived and reduced to practice the invention prior to said date, or if he conceived prior thereto and was diligent from immediately prior to October 25, 1933, until he reduced to practice, the Board of Appeals did not err in awarding priority of invention to appel-lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">As hereinbefore observed, the Examiner of Interferences held that appellee had not established that said Exhibits 2 and 3 were made prior to appellant\u2019s United States filing date; or, if made prior to said date, it did not appear that, assuming that they support the count, they had been sufficiently tested to constitute a reduction to practice. He further held that said exhibits do not support the count by reason of a ridge formed upon the inner surface of the tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">Upon this branch of the case we will first consider whether said exhibits support the count. Each of the exhibits shows a deformation upon the inner surface of the tube, discernible to the eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">Upon this point the Examiner of Interferences stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-17\">\u201cFinally, it is not believed that .exhibits 2 and 3 support the count, which calls for the formation of a ridge of \u2018appreciable size\u2019 without \u2018appreciably deforming the internal surface of the tube.\u2019 In accordance with the usual meaning, an appreciable change is one which can be detected by the senses and such\u2019 a change has obviously been made in the inner surface of the tube of each of these exhibits. Further, while the sleeve has cut into the tube to a rather large extent, the actual ridge formed above the surface of the tube is very slight. Accordingly, if this ridge is appreciable, that term must include very small amounts and is thus applicable to the deformation of the inner surface. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-18\">The Board of Appeals expressed the view that the Examiner of Interferences had given too narrow a construction to the word \u201cappreciably\u2019 in the count, and held that said exhibits 2 and 3 support the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>It appears to us that, in construing the terms \u201cappreciable\u201d and \u201cappreciably\u201d as used in the count, consideration must be given to the connection in which such terms are used. The Examiner of- Interferences held that if the ridge produced on these exhibits is appreciable, \u201cthat term must include very small amounts and is thus applicable to the deformation of the inner surface.\u201d We are not in agreement -with this view of the Examiner of Interferences. In appellant\u2019s brief the purpose of the ridge upon the outside of the tube called for by the count is described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">\u201c* * * The ridge serves as a continuous annular barb (somewhat like a ring of fish hooks) to prevent undesired withdrawal of the tube from the body portion. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">With respect to the absence of deformation upon the inner surface of the tube, appellant\u2019s written specification does' not mention this feature. However, his drawings do not show any such deformation, although one of, the drawings of his German application does show slight deformation of the inner surface of the pipe, as do ap-pellee\u2019s Exhibits 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">This is significant only because the language of appellant\u2019s United States application, describing the means by which the ridge on the outside of the tube is formed, is practically identical with the language of his German application upon that point. It would therefore seem that if the device disclosed in appellant\u2019s German application produces some deformation upon the inner surface of the tub?, the same device disclosed in his United States .application would also produce such deformation. However, this is important only in determining the meaning of the word \u201cappreciably\u201d^ as used in the count. We think both appellant and appellee had in mind that their respective devices would not produce such deformation upon the inner surface of the tube as to appreciably restrict the flow of liquid or gas there-through.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In this view the word \u201cappreciable,\u201d as applied to the ridge upon the outer surface of the tube, should be given a much more restricted construction than the word \u201cappreciably\u201d as applied to deformations upon the inner surface of the tube. A very small ridge thrown up by the cutting or shearing operation of the sleeve would prevent longitudinal movement of the tube, while a like deformation upon the inner surface of the tube would not, except in a very minor degree, affect the flow of liquid or gas through the tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">We are therefore in accord with the view of the Board of Appeals that Exhibits 2 and 3 support the involved count.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">\u2022 We now come to a consideration of ap-pellee\u2019s evidence respecting conception and reduction to practice of the involved invention. Both Patent Office tribunals held that a certain drawing, appellee\u2019s Exhibit 4, dated January 19, 1933, disclosing the invention, was made on said date; that it was disclosed to others on said date, and that appellee is entitled to said date for conception of the invention. As hereinbe-fore stated, the Examiner of Interferences held that appellee\u2019s proofs did not establish actual reduction to practice of the invention prior to the filing date of his application. He further held that appellee was not diligent in reducing it to practice from immediately prior to' appellant\u2019s filing date, October 25, 1933, to appellee\u2019s filing date, November 6, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">While, before the Patent Office tribunals, appellee contended that his evidence established conception and reduction to practice of the invention in 1926, both tribunals held to the contrary, and, as here-inbefore noted, appellee in this appeal accepts such finding and here makes no contention of conception and reduction to practice prior to the latter part of 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">Appellee, doing business under the name of the Parker Appliance Company, for many years has been engaged in the manufacture and sale of tube couplings, valves, and other associated products at Cleveland, Ohio. He testified that he conceived the involved invention in 1926 and embodied the same in a full-sized device, it being used upon a compressor in his establishment. The device so used was introduced in evidence as Exhibit 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Both tribunals of the Patent Office held that, assuming that said Exhibit 1 supported the count, there was not sufficient evidence to establish successful reduction to practice of the invention based upon said Exhibit 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Appellee further testified that he anticipated that there would be a basic objection to a coupling of the character here involved, having the ordinary steel sleeve, because of the corrosion problem, but that, with the advent of the use of stainless steel in his plant, he late in 1932 revived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>his interest in a steel sleeve coupling. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">\u201c* * * <em>Along in 1932 or about 1932, late, we revived our interest in a steel sleeve coupling </em>of this general character and built numerous different couplings and worked on the idea of stamping out the sleeve from tubing which necessitated a considerable investment in dies, as well as locating a suitable source for stainless steel tubing of relatively thin wall, that is, within the ordinary proportions of the tubing we used, and also with a special outside diameter. The production difficulties there required quite a bit of time to analyze. <em>We built quite am extensive number of samples of couplings with stainless steel sleeves of the cutting edge really founded on this same basic principle.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Appellee further stated that it was his usual practice to test couplings on assembly. He further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cQ. 41. Can you produce any of these couplings to which you have just referred to with the stainless steel sleeve? A. Yes, sir. There is two couplings of that style.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">\u201cQ. 42. About when, Mr. Parker, did you start in making these couplings with the stainless steel \u201e sleeve ? A. As near as I can determine along late in 1932, early \u201933, we spent considerable time on numerous styles, sizes and samples.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">\u201c* * * We have a hydrostatic pump capable of pressures up to more than 10,000 pounds. We usually test couplings of that type to destruction, that is, run the pressure to a high degree frequently, even blow them off, or break the tube, to determine their ability to withstand high pressure and then after testing, pressure testing, there are nearly always sample sections, in this manner, so that we can see just what takes place in any coupling, what the internal factors are. By observing a section of this kind you can readily see just how the metal acts under pressure and what the character of the joint may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">\u201cQ. 44. State whether or not, Mr. Parker, you followed your usual procedure with these couplings, tested them? A. Yes, sir; they were tested in the usual manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">\u201cQ. 45. Were they successful? A. Very satisfactory. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">\u201cQ. 46. Was any drawing made on this particular coupling with the stainless steel which you have produced? A. Was there .any what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">\u201cQ. 47. Was there any drawing made of it? A. Yes; there was a drawing made at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>48. Can you produce the drawing? A. Yes; I have the drawing that was made for the purpose of a patent application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-16\">\u201cQ. 49. Was this drawing made under your direction? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-17\">\u201cQ. 50. By whom? A. By L. H. Schmohl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-18\">\u201cQ. 51. He is a draftsman regularly employed by you for that purpose? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-19\">\u201cQ. 52. Does he do something more than drafting work ? A. He frequently follows up new jobs and watches the test work and reports to me, when I am too busy to get out and see the results of the tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-20\">\u201cQ. 53. He is with you now, is he? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-21\">\u201cQ. 54. Who had charge of the manufacturing work at the time when these two couplings, which- you have just produced, were made? A. Mr. Birtch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-22\">\u201cQ. 55. Do you know who made these couplings? A. I believe that Martin Binder made them. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-23\">\u201cQ. 56. Mr. Parker, what are your instructions to your draftsman about dating drawings, anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-24\">\u201cMr. Wupper: I object to the question as irrelevant and immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-25\">\u201cA.- We have a fixed practice for a very considerable time past of dating our drawings so that it indicates the date when the drawing was made. Our numerical system indicates the day of the month and the year and the sequence of drawings for that particular day identify the time when drawings are made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-26\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>57. Were these two couplings you produced made prior to the making of this drawing, do you know? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-27\">\u201cQ. 58. Has this coupling with the stainless steel sleeve been put out commercially by you? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-28\">\u201cQ. 59. Have you made quite a number of developments, Mr. Parker, for which you have taken out patents? A. Yes, sir; I have numerous patents. It is our policy to carry on continual development work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-29\">\u201cQ. 60. And to cover it by patent when there is novelty included, as a rule ? A. <em>As soon as we cam, schedule the patent work </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>md prepare the information for the attorney, patents are applied for.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The couplings testified to were introduced in evidence as Exhibits 2 and 3, and the drawing referred to was introduced in evidence as Exhibit 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Exhibit 4 contains five figures, numbered 1 to 5, inclusive, and three figures not numbered. Figure 4 of the drawing does not support the count before us. At the bottom of the drawing there is certain data. Under the head of \u201cCompression Fittings\u201d are the initials L. H. S., and under the abbreviations (Pat. Drg) appear the figures 1-19-33. Also in the lower right hand corner appear, opposite the abbreviations \u201cDrg. No.\u201d the figures 1 \u2014 1933\u2014 S, and in the upper left hand-corner are the figures 1-1933-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">' Figures 1 and 2 of said Exhibit 4 conform quite closely to the drawings of ap-pellee\u2019s application, but differ in some respects from Exhibits 2 and 3. These differences- will be hereinafter discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Appellee further testified, upon cross-examination, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">\u201cQ. 102. Now, throughout this period from 1926 to date you knew there was a demand for a low priced coupling in which it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to flare the end of the tube, did you not? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">H. E. Birtch, a witness on behalf of ap-pellee, testified that he was superintendent of appellee\u2019s plant; that Exhibits 2 and 3 were made, as nearly as the witness could recall, in 1930. He further testified as follows, referring to Exhibits 2 and 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>225. Do you know who made these couplings? A. Yes; a man by the name of Binder made some of them and we had two or three lathe hands there at the time that are not with us any more that probably worked on some of the parts. <em>We made several of them and at different times.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">\u201cQ. 228. Do you know whether or not these couplings that you have just referred to, Parker Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3, were completed and tested? A. Oh, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">\u201cQ. 229. Were they successful? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-13\">\u201cMr. Wupper: That is objected to as a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-14\">\u201cQ. 230. When do you usually cut the coupling through to show what the condition is? A. After our tests are completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-16\">Upon cross-examination the witness testified : n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-17\">\u201cQ. 233. Now, you said that your Parker Exhibit Nos. 2 and 3 were made within a month prior to the drawing I show you. A. I didn\u2019t say that. I said they were made, as near as I can recollect, several months prior to any drawings being made, to my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-18\">\u201cQ. 234. <em>Is this the drazving to zvhich you refer, showing the witness Parker Exhibit No. 4? A. No, sir. </em>(Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-19\">\u201cQ. 235. If Mr. Parker has testified, 'as I believe he has, that Parker Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3 were made the latter part of 1932 or the early part of 1933, would you say that he was entirely mistaken? A. No; I wouldn\u2019t. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-20\">\u201cQ. 236. They may have been made in the early part of 1933, as far as you can state? A. That is possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-21\">The witness Schmohl was a draftsman employed by appellee. He testified that he made the drawing, Exhibit 4, on January 19, 1933; that the initials upon the drawing are his. He further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-22\">\u201cQ. 248. Then you made this drawing, I understand, and completed it on January 19th, 1933? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-23\">\u201cQ. 249. What did you have to make the drawing from? A. We had a sample coupler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-24\">\u201cQ. 250. I call your attention to Parker Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3 and ask you if you recognize either one. of these couplings? A. Yes; I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-25\">\u201cQ. 251. What do you recall about \u2022them? A. They were couplings we made the drawings from, samples we made in the shop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-26\">\u201cQ. 252. Did you see couplings of this kind being tested ? A. No; I can\u2019t say as I saw them tested. I saw them right after they were tested and I had them to make the drawings from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-27\">\u201cQ. 253. Who turned the couplings over to .you to make the drawing? A. Mr. Parker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-28\">\u201cQ. 254. Was this drawing made for any particular purpose? A. Well, it is made for a patent drawing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-29\">\u201cQ. 255. And you had couplings, did you, from which you made these drawings ? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u201cQ. 256. They were completed couplings? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">\u201cQ. 257. Cut through like these samples <em>we </em>have here? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201cQ. 258. Do you think it is one of these samples? A. It was one of the samples; yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">\u201cQ. 259. That is one of these Parker exhibits, either No. 2 or No. 3? A. No. 2 or No. 3; yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Upon cross-examination the witness testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">\u201cQ. 265. Is there any way you can positively identify these two samples, Parker Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3, as the identical samples from which you made the drawing, Parker Exhibit No. 4? \u00c1. Well, I know they are samples we made up. I don\u2019t know whether there is any real, possible means of stating definitely, but I know they are samples I used in making the drawings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">\u201cQ. 266. But you can\u2019t identify them as being the exact, particular samples which you had before you at the time you made this drawing, Parker Exhibit No. 4? You couldn\u2019t swear to that? A. Well, sure. I am sure of it. Yes, I can swear to it, that I had those samples. <em>It is really hard, to say. </em>(Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">\u201cQ. 267. Are there any marks on these samples? A. No; there are no marks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">\u201cQ. 268. Referring to Parker Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3 by which you can identify them? A. No identification, except they are the samples we used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">\u201cQ. 269. These are similar to them; is that correct? A. I don\u2019t know. There is the samples I used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">\u201cQ. 270. Now, did you have a sample of the construction illustrated in Figure 4 of this drawing, Parker. Exhibit No. 4? A. I believe there was such a sample.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-14\">\u201cQ. 271. What happened to that? A. Maybe that was \u2014 no: that was just another application of this same principle we had in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-15\">\u201cQ. 272. Are you sure you didn\u2019t make a sample of that? A. No; there was no sample made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-16\">\u201cQ. 273. You are positive there wasn\u2019t any sample made? A. There are applications of that same principle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-17\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-18\">\u201cQ. 275. Now, in these samples, Parker Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3, the shoulder formed in the body and against which the ends of the tubes abut, these shoulders are not made in accordance with the drawing, of course, are they? A. In just what point do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-20\">\u201cQ. 276. The shoulder against which the ends of the tube abut, they do not correspond with the showing of the shoulders in the drawing, Parker Exhibit No. 4, do they? A. No; they do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-21\">\u201cQ. 277. Well, then, these drawings were not exactly copied from the samples, Parker Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3, were they? A. Yes. This shoulder, here, this was merely added there for extra precaution on the drawing after we had made the samples.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-22\">\u201cQ. 278. Was that your idea to have the undercut shoulder? A. No. I believe it was Mr. Parker\u2019s idea.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-23\">We would observe that, while the witness stated that the modification of the drawing from Exhibits 2 and 3 was made according to appellee\u2019s idea, appellee gave no testimony upon that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-24\">Martin Binder, a witness for appellee, testified that he made Exhibits 2 and 3, but was unable to recall when they were made. Upon this point he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-25\">\u201cQ. 326. Did you usually test the coupling after you made it, or did you turn it over to somebody else? A. I don\u2019t exactly test them. I make it up and give it to \u2014 turn it in to the superintendent, or whoever is over me, and he takes it in to Parker and then when Parker comes out he says \u2014 well, he comes out again and \u2018Now,\u2019 he says, \u2018test that.\u2019 Generally the foreman and I we test them things together, or the superintendent, whoever is there at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-26\">\u201cQ. 327. Were these samples like Parker Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3 tested out? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-27\">\u201cQ. 328. Were they all right? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-28\">\u201cMr. Wupper: The question is objected to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-29\">\u201cQ. 329. You put them under considerable air pressure? A. About 35 to 50 pounds; that is what we tried them out at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-30\">\u201cQ. 330. You have no way of fixing the date when you made these, have you? A. No. You see, I worked on many things; every day something new and different, so many kinds, I couldn\u2019t tell the date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-31\">It appears from the record that appellee had secured a large number of patents upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>various inventions. With reference to certain of these patents appellee testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">\u201cQ. 84. Now, Patents Nos. 1,982,533, 1,977,241, 1,977,240, 1,894,700 1,893,442 1,893,441 and 1,835,179 were all. for tube couplings for the same general purpose as those exemplified in Parker Exhibits Nos. 1, 2 and 3; is that correct? A. Except that those series of patents were couplings of the type for the more exacting services in which field, we are more active than in the other division of less costly couplings and more moderate service and with the possible exception of No. 1,894,700 which is of a basically different type.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201cQ. 85. All of these couplings shown in the patents which I enumerated in the last preceding question could have been used in place of the coupling embodied in Parker Exhibit No. 1; could they not? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">It appears that patents Nos. 1,977,240 and 1,977,241 were issued to appellee on October 16, 1934, upon applications filed April 29, 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Upon his cross examination appellee testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201cQ. 73. When 'did you request your patent attorney to prepare an application upon this invention as-shown in your drawing, Parker Exhibit No. 4? A. I don\u2019t recall that exact date. It was shortly after the preparing of this patent, I believe, or this drawing, rather; shortly after the preparation of this drawing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Appellee, also testified' that on September 11, 1934, he instructed his patent attorney to prepare the application involved in this interference. He further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">\u201cQ. 92. What' was it that caused you on September 11th, 1934, to request your patent attorneys to prepare the patent application involved in this interference ? A. No special reason, only it had been in the file for action as soon as I thought best to release it. I hold the file developments to release for patent work and, as rapidly as I can see my way to release them to go through the patent work I do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">\u2022It will be observed that,' although ap-pellee. testified that he requested his patent attorney to prepare a patent application based upon Exhibit '4 shortly after the date the drawing bears, it. was -in fact more than T9 months after the date of said drawing that such request was made. Moreover, appellee testified upon his direct examination that it was his policy, when he had made a useful invention, to cause an application for patent to be filed as soon as the patent work could be scheduled and information prepared for the attorney. Ap-' pellee gave no reason for his departure from his usual policy in the instant case, and gave no reason why the application was not earlier prepared if the invention had been in fact reduced to practice prior to January 19, 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">Of course, if the invention had been reduced to practice, there was no duty of diligence resting upon appellee in filing his application, and we refer to the time of filing, in connection with appellee\u2019s testimony, only as a circumstance bearing upon the question of whether Exhibits 2 and 3 were made and tested prior to appellant\u2019s filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">Another circumstance which seems to us significant is that appellee in his preliminary statement alleged that he embodied his invention in a full-sized device which was completed on or about the first day of July, 1926, and that several other couplings embodying the invention were made on or about September 1, 1934. He also alleged that he made drawings of the invention on or about January 19, 1933. \u2018 This allegation no doubt refers to Exhibit 4 in evidence. It appears strange to us that if Exhibits 2 and 3 were made and tested shortly before January 19, 1933, the dat\u00e9 of said drawing, appellee would not have remembered that fact and alleged it in his preliminary statement. , If, on the other hand, said exhibits were made and tested in 1934, shortly before he instructed his patent attorney to prepare an application for patent, this would be in accord with appellee\u2019s preliminary statement. Appellee in his testimony made no reference to making any of the devices in 1934. Appellee\u2019s counsel states that, of course, it would have availed appellee nothing to have proved a construction and testing of the devices in 1934, which would be after appellant\u2019s constructive reduction to practice on October 25, 1933. Nevertheless, it seems strange that appellee should have remembered, at the time his testimony was taken, making devices embodying the invention in 1926 and in 1933, and yet at the time of making his preliminary statement he apparently failed to remember making the devices in either 1932 or 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>It is also a significant circumstance that if the drawing, Exhibit 4, was made from Exhibit 2 or Exhibit 3 for the purpose of filing a patent application, neither of said Exhibits 2 and 3 was marked in any way so that it could be subsequently identified. The evidence indicates that many couplings embodying the involved invention were made at different times, and we find no satisfactory evidence in the record identifying Exhibits 2 and 3 as couplings that were made and tested prior to October 25, 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The only positive evidence upon this point is to the effect that the drawing, Exhibit 4, was made from Exhibit 2 or Exhibit 3, but we are not satisfied that this is a fact. The draftsman Schmohl, after testifying positively upon cross examination that Exhibit 4 was made from either.Exhibit 2 or Exhibit 3, concluded his answer by stating that \u201cIt is really hard to say.\u201d He also admitted that the drawing was not exactly copied from either of said exhibits in that a certain shoulder appears in the drawing that is absent from said exhibits. This shoulder, the witness thought, was placed upon the drawing at the suggestion of appellee, but appellee did not so state.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The witness Schmohl also testified that Figure 4 of the drawing, Exhibit 4, was not made from any coupling before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The witness Binder testified that he made Exhibits 2 and 3, but had no recollection respecting when they were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Appellee was a prolific inventor, and we are unable to understand why, if events occurred in the order and at the times that he claims, no record was made of them other than the drawing Exhibit 4, and -why he should not have included in his preliminary statement his claimed reduction to practice of the invention in 1932 or 1933. Nor are we able to understand why in said statement he should have alleged that he made couplings embodying the invention in 1934, but did not allege that he made such couplings in 1932 or 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">We do not intimate that either appellee or any of his witnesses testified falsely, intentionally or otherwise, in the case, but the burden of proof was upon appellee to establish priority of invention, and we agree with the Examiner of Interferences that the evidence does not satisfactorily establish such priority, for there are too many circumstances indicating that appel-lee and his witnesses may have been mistaken in their recollection of important dates, and the sequence of events with respect to the making of Exhibits 2 and 3 and said drawing, Exhibit 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Had the Patent Office tribunals concurred in finding that appellee had reduced the invention to practice prior to October 25, 1933, we might not hold that they were manifestly wrong in so holding; but such tribunals did not agree upon this point, and it is our duty in those circumstances to exercise our independent judgment as to the weight of the evidence upon this issue. \u2019 i</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Both tribunals held that appellee was the first to conceive the invention, but the Examiner of Interferences held that there was lack of diligence on the part of appellee in reducing the invention to practice. This is clearly true, for there is no evidence establishing diligence by appellee in reducing the invention to practice between just prior to October 25, 1933, appellant\u2019s filing date, and appellee\u2019s constructive reduction to practice on November 6, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">For the reasons hereinbefore given, we are of the opinion that the decision of the Examiner of Interferences awarding priority of invention to appellant should have been affirmed, and the decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
