The case was tried to a jury. At the close of all the evidence, appellant moved for a directed verdict in its favor. The motion was denied, and appellant excepted. There was a verdict in appellee\u2019s favor for $5,274.80, plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees. From the judgment thereon, this appeal is prosecuted. The sole question presented is whether the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">The evidence establishes the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">The policy was issued November 13, 1935, for the term of one year commencing on that date. Thereby, subject to the conditions and limitations therein set forth, appellant insured appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-19\">\u201cAgainst loss from liability imposed by law upon the Assured * * * on account of bodily injuries * * * accidentally suffered or alleged to have been suffered by any person * * * caused by or through the ownership, maintenance or operation of any Automobile described in the Schedule<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and used for the purposes named therein. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-20\">The policy contained the following provisions, therein referred to as \u201cinsuring agreements</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-21\">\u201cII. The insurance provided by this Policy is hereby made available, in the same manner and under the same conditions as it is available to [appellee], to any person operating * * * any of the Automobiles described in the 'Schedule, provided the use and operation thereof are lawful and with the permission of [appel-lee] * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-22\">\u201cHI. * * * [Appellant] will investigate all accidents and claims covered hereunder, and defend in the name and on behalf of the Assured all suits thereon, even if groundless.* * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-23\">Other provisions of the policy, therein referred to as \u201cconditions,\u201d were as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-24\">\u201cA. The unqualified term \u2018Assured\u2019 wherever used in this Policy shall include * * * any person * * * entitled to insurance under the provisions and conditions of Insuring Agreement II hereof. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-27\">\u201cB. * * * [The] Assured * * * shall at all times render to [appellant] all reasonable cooperation and assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-29\">At all, times while the policy was in force, appellee\u2019s son, Jack Lopopolo, had appellee\u2019s permission to operate appellee\u2019s automobile. Therefore, when the automobile was so operated by Jack Lopopolo, the insurance provided in the policy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>available to him in the same manner and under the same conditions as it was to appellee, and Jack Lopopolo was at all such times an \u201cassured,\u201d within the meaning of the policy. Royal Indemnity Co. v. Morris, <em>9 </em>Cir., 37 F.2d 90; Snyder v. National Union Indemnity Co., 10 Cir., 65 F.2d 844; Storer v. Ocean Accident &amp; Guarantee Corporation, 6 Cir., 80 F.2d 470; Rochon v. Preferred Accident Ins. Co., 114 Conn. 313, 158 A. 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">On December 27, 1935, in a collision between appellee\u2019s automobile and an automobile operated by George Donato, Donato suffered bodily injuries. Thereafter, in a State court of California, Donato sued appellee and Jack Lopopolo for damages on account of said injuries, alleging that, at the time of the collision, appellee\u2019s automobile was being operated by Jack Lopopolo, with appellee\u2019s permission, and that the collision was caused by Jack Lo-popolo\u2019s negligence. Appellant was notified and, as required by the policy, defended the suit in the name and on behalf of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">There was, in the Donato case, a conflict of evidence as to whether, at the time of the collision, appellee\u2019s automobile was being operated by Jack Lopopolo, as claimed by Donato,'or whether, as claimed by appellant, it was being operated by Jack\u2019s younger brother, Dan Lopopolo, who, it is conceded, never had appellee\u2019s permission to operate the automobile. This conflict was, by the jury\u2019s verdict, -resolved in Donato\u2019s favor. Judgment on the verdict, for $5,000 and costs, was entered against both defendants and, on appeal, was affirmed. Donato v. Lopopolo, 20 Cal.App.2d 409, 66 P.2d 1256. Thereafter appellee brought this action on the policy, .seeking thereby to recover of appellant the amount for which Donato had obtained judgment against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was on three grounds. The first was that Jack Lopopolo had breached condition \u201cB\u201d of the policy by failing to render to appellant \u201call reasonable cooperation and assistance.\u201d Whether Jack Lopopolo did or did not render such cooperation and \u2022 assistance, is immaterial. He is not a party to this action. His failure, if he did fail, to cooperate with and assist appellant do\u00e9s not affect appellee\u2019s rights<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">In the brief filed by appellant\u2019s counsel, and again in his oral argument, four cases<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were cited as holding that, under this type of policy, recovery by the named assured (in this case, appellee) is defeated by failure of an unnamed assured (in this case, Jack Lopopolo) to cooperate with and assist the insurer. These cases do not, nor does any one of them, hold- any such thing. They should not have been cited as so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The second ground of appellant\u2019s motion was that no suit had been brought nor any judgment obtained against appellee upon the theory or claim that Dan Lopopolo was operating appellee\u2019s automobile at the time of the collision, and that, if Dan Lopopolo was operating appellee\u2019s automobile, he was operating it. without appellee\u2019s permission- \u2014 -all .of which is quite true and quite immaterial. Donato brought suit and obtained'judgment against appellee upon the theory or claim that Jack Lopopolo was operating appellee\u2019s automobile at the time- of the collision. That judgment is now final and conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The third ground of appellant\u2019s motion was that Jack Lopopolo was appellee\u2019s agent and, as such agent, made wilfully false statements to ..appellant concerning the accident in which Donato was injured. There was no evidence of any such agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">Appellant\u2019s motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">\u2022Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-30\"> Only one automobile was described in the schedule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> Appellant\u2019s answer charged that appellee also had breached condition \u201cB\u201d, but the motion for a directed verdict was not made on that ground, it being conceded that, on that ipsue, the evidence was conflicting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-14\"> Royal Indemnity Co. v.
