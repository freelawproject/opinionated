There were 14 lawyers defending various defendants on this indictment which charged a conspiracy and other substantive counts for violation of the narcotic laws. With so many defendants on trial, represented by different counsel, it was agreed among them that on each day one attorney would act as spokesman for the group except as to matters affecting the individual client; one would object for all, and appellant says he was so representing all at the time herein referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">A government agent was testifying on direct examination when the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-22\">\u201cMr. Martin; I will offer Government\u2019s Exhibit 7-A to be received in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-23\">\u201cMr. Landes: If the record will show, your Honor, that this is only being accepted as against that one particular defendant, not against the others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-24\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled as to Ignaro and excluded as to all the other defendants on trial. * * * (fols. 36, 37)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-25\">\u201cMr. Landes: Might I interrupt here, your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-26\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-27\">\u201cMr. Landes: I would like counsel \u2014 in describing the package we do not seem to get the last name.

(fols. 47-55)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-38\">Title 28, U.S.C.A. \u00a7 385, provides: \u201cThe said Courts shall have power * * * .to punish, by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of the court, contempts of their authority. Such power to punish contempts shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehavior of any person in their presence, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, the misbehavior of any of the officers of said courts in their official transactions, and the disobedience or resistance by any such officer * * * or other person to any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the said courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-39\">Before appellant was cited for contempt, the court with judicial dignity and learning passed upon the appellant\u2019s objections made to the admission of evidence but the appellant persistently continued until his acts and words became, as found by the judge, a misbehavior in the presence of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-40\">When a contempt is committed directly under the eye'or within view of the court, the judge may proceed upon his own knowledge of the facts and punish the offender without further proof and without issue or trial in any form. Ex parte Terry, 128 U.S. 289, 9 S.Ct. 77, 32 L.Ed. 405; compare Cooke v. U. S. 267 U.S. 517, 45 S.Ct 390, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>69 L.Ed. 767. What occurred when the appellant was ordered to take his seat was an open threat to the orderly procedure of the court and a defiance of the person and presence of the judge before the public there present. If the judge did not act instantly to suppress and punish, a demoralization of the court\u2019s authority would follow. The court said in Cooke v. United States, supra (page 395) : \u201cPunishment without issue or trial was so contrary to the usual and ordinarily indispensable hearing before judgment constituting due process that the assumption that the court saw everything that went on in open court was required to justify the exception; but the need for immediate penal vindication of the dignity of the court created it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The power to punish is inherent in the courts. If order in judicial proceedings is to be preserved with due dignity, the full enforcement of the power to punish must be accorded a judge for it is necessarily a part of the due administration of justice. Ex parte Terry, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\"> A trial counsel, however zealous in his client\u2019s behalf, has a paramount obligation to the due administration of justice. Both the court and counsel should be engaged in its due and orderly administration and in maintaining the authority and dignity of the court. Counsel should never try to injure its authority or attempt defiance thereof. Like the judge, he should banish all impulses to reprisal either by act or repartee. Like the minister of justice, before whom he pleads, he should, without flinching from his duty, control his demeanor and display his learning without personal criticism or an attack upon the judge. This is not impractical, for calm and poise of counsel go far in the course of the true administration of justice and always captxxre their reward. Counsel should always remember that the controversy with its attendant exasperations is his client\u2019s cause. Its aspirations, its irritations, its impulses, its interests, are not the lawyer's to visit upon the judge. The lawyer must not carry these through the portals of the court of justice for in doing so the case has the elements that retard justice and bring the practice and procedure into disrepute. Counsel should not obtrude upon the coxirt the passion, the prejudice, or the unreason of his client. These must be left outside the courtroom door. The controversy that crosses the threshold should be a controversy sifted by the intelligence and shaped by the conscience of the lawyer, not the turmoil of personal dispute. The disesteem and contempt a lawyer has for a judge is inseparable from pride. It is hardly possible for counsel to over-value himself by undervaluating the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"> Thus the lawyer, an officer of the court, while entitled to the fullest protection, is subject to the power of the court to compel him to behave with propriety in his conduct before the court. When he oversteps the bounds of good behavior, he may become guilty of contempt and is subject to punishment. A determination of guilt is a fact to be found by the judge and the punishment therefor is within the sound discretion of the court. Creekmore v. United States, 8 Cir., 237 F. 743, L.R.A.1917C, 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">On this record, we will not reverse the determination below of the charge of misbehavior resulting in an adjudication of contempt and the imposition of a fine as punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
