Wenban Estate v. Hewlett, 193 Cal. 675, 696, 697, 227 P. 723; Minifie v. Rowley, 187 Cal. 481, 487, 202 P. 673; Hollywood Cleaning &amp; P.

Co., 8 Cal.2d 61, 68, 63 P.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Measured by these standards, the fact that the company was Sterling\u2019s alter ego does not require the court to disregard its separate entity, inasmuch as there was no fraud or injustice in Bernstein\u2019s dealing with it as a separate entity in purchasing the percents from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Petition for rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
