The insured, William M. Coffey, was inducted into military service of the United States on May 20, 1918, and was discharged therefrom on March 21, 1919. His contract of war risk term insurance expired on July 1, 1919, unless the insured became permanently and totally disabled prior thereto, as was alleged in plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>No claim for permanent total disability benefits under the insurance contract was filed prior to the insured\u2019s death on August 7, 1928. On May 17, 1929, Alice Coffey, mother of the insured and the designated beneficiary, filed a claim with the United States Veterans\u2019 Bureau. This claim was denied on November 7, 1931. Thereafter Alice Coffey was appointed administratrix of the estate of the deceased insured, and on May 31, 1932, she began this suit in both her individual capacity as beneficiary and in her representative capacity as administra-trix.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Alice Coffey died on March 7, 1936, and on December 17, 1936, William W. Coffey, as executor of the will of Alice Coffey and as her successor administrator of the estate of the insured, moved to be substituted as plaintiff in each capacity. The government objected to the motion for substitution of William W. Coffey as plaintiff in the capacity of administrator of the estate of William M. Coffey, the deceased insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The District Court overruled the government\u2019s objection and ordered the substitution of William W. Coffey as plaintiff in the capacity of administrator of the estate of William M. Coffey.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The case went to trial and at the close of all the evidence each party moved for finding of facts and judgment in his favor. The court made a finding of facts, stated its conclusions of law thereon, and entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The foregoing objection of the government to the substitution of William W. Coffey; administrator of the estate of the insured, depends for its validity upon the construction of certain language in Section 19 of the World War Veterans\u2019 Act of 1924, as amended July 3, 1930.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is the government\u2019s contention that Section 19 requires, as a jurisdictional prerequisite, that there he a claim filed with the United States Veterans\u2019 Bureau and a disagreement thereon; and it is the further contention of the government that, for jurisdictional purposes, the claim and disagreement thereon inure only to the claimant who actually files the claim. As applied to the facts of the instant case, the contention of the government is that the only claim filed which was the basis of a disagreement was the claim of Alice Coffey as beneficiary; and that, since no claim was ever filed for permanent total disability benefits by the insured or by anyone on behalf of his estate, Alice Coffey, as administratrix, could not be joined with Alice Coffey as beneficiary, and, consequently, William W. Coffey, as successor administrator, could not he substituted as plaintiff for Alice Coffey, administratrix. And this latter contention is made despite the express declaration in Section 19 that \u201call persons <em>having </em>or <em>claiming </em>to have an interest in <em>such insurance </em>may be made parties to such suit.\u201d (our italics)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">The government\u2019s Contention presupposes that the \u201cclaim\u201d which Section 19 contemplates is a <em>legal demand, an assertion of right, </em>which is required for the purpose of fixing the interests which can be litigated, in case of disagreement, and to designate the persons who may be parties to any litigation. But the term \u201cclaim\u201d is defined in simple, untechnical language which prevents its being construed to be a legal demand in a technical sense. A \u201cclaim\u201d may be \u201cany writting\u201d which alleges \u201cpermanent and total disability at a time when the contract of insurance was in force,\u201d or which \u201cuses words showing an intention to claim insurance benefits.\u201d The term \u201cclaim,\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>thus defined, is merely the physical writing which furnishes the desired information and not an assertion of a legal right.</p>\n<p id=\"Aau\">We quote' with approval the following comment upon the purpose and effect of a \u201cclaim\u201d<em>.</em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe only purpose of requiring the filing of claim as a prerequisite to suit is to give notice to the government that claim is being made under the policy so that it may make investigation and pay any amount due claimant without being subjected to the trouble and expense of litigation; and any claim showing \u2018intention to claim insurance benefits\u2019 answ\u00e9rs the purpose. Congress doubtless realized that many claims would be made by illiterate claimants without the advice and assistance of counsel, and intended that a claim either calling attention to total and permanent disability or showing an \u2018intention to claim insurance benefits\u2019 should be sufficient. It was no doubt to avoid such technical rulings as we are asked to make in this case that Congress embodied in the statute the broad provision which we have quoted.\u201d And we agree with the further statement from the above quoted opinion that \u201cit would be carrying technicality to a ridiculous extreme to deny recovery - because of the difference between the claim as filed and the claim sued on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">In the instant case Alice Coffey filed a \u201cclaim\u201d as beneficiary and after \u201cdisagreement\u201d she commenced this action to recover \u2022insurance benefits both in her individual capacity as beneficiary and in her capacity as administratrix of the estate of the deceased insured. We are of the opinion that the right of recovery was not limited to insurance benefits of the beneficiary but included all insurance benefits under the contract of insurance; and Alice Coffey, administratrix, was a proper party to the suit even though the \u201cclaim\u201d did not specify that Alice Coffey intended to claim <em>estate </em>insurance benefits. Since all that the Act requires as a \u201cclaim,\u201d in the first instance, is a writing which uses words that show \u201can intention to claim insurance benefits\u201d we cannot justify limiting the scope of \u201can action on the claim\u201d to the right to recover insurance benefits for the beneficiary .only.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The first sentence in Section 19 does not state that \u201can action on the claim\u201d can be brought only by the person who has filed the claim. And no language in Section 19 purports expressly to limit the right to commence an action to the person filing the claim, or to that person in the capacity in which he files'the claim. But granting that one who has not filed a claim cannot commence an independent action on the claim, we cannot disregard the plain and unambiguous declaration that \u201call persons having or claiming to have an interest in such insurance may be made parties to such suit.\u201d The clear import of the foregoing language is that all persons who <em>have </em>an interest, whether they are claiming it or not, may be parties; and the <em>interest </em>which a party may have, or claim, is not limited to an interest which was specified in the \u201cclaim,\u201d but it need only be \u201can interest in such insurance.\u201d The language cannot be restricted to mean that only persons who have filed claims, which have been denied, and-who have, or claim to have an interest in such claims \u201cmay be made parties to such suit.\u201d There is no justification for a forced and technical construction of the language of Sec. 19, when it is perfectly obvious from an inspection of the language throughout the Act that Congress has avoided the use of words which ordinarily would be susceptible to a technical construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Our construction and application of the pertinent provisions of Section 19 are in harmony with the recent decision in the case of United States v. Powell.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that case the plaintiff had recovered in his capacity as administrator of the soldier and of the soldier\u2019s mother and father. It was contended on appeal that no recovery should have been allowed him as administrator of the father and mother (1) because no claim was filed in that capacity; and (2) because he was not joined as plaintiff in that capacity until the right to sue had been barred by the statute of limitations. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decided adversely to the contention. We quote the following from the opinion in the Powell Case, page 791:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">\u201cWe express no opinion as to the rule applicable where an amendment sought would bring in persons not beneficially interested either in the claim or in the suit which has been filed; but, where claim has been filed in behalf of the persons in whose interest suit has been brought, and where the only effect of the amendment is to change the capacity in which plaintiff sues in their behalf, and that only as to a part of the recovery sought, we feel that it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>an undue straining at technicality to hold that such amendment should be denied and that the portion o\u00a3 the claim which it covers be held barred by the statute of limitations. Certainly such a ruling would be out of harmony with the spirit of modern procedure. We adhere to our decision in the Lopez Case [Lopez v. U. S., 4 Cir., 82 F.2d 982] ; and we think that it fully covers the situation here presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">We hold that the District Court did not err in overruling the objections of the defendant to the motion for substitution as plaintiff of William W. Coffey, Administrator of the estate of William M. Coffey.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Also we are of the opinion that there was substantial evidence to support a finding of fact that the insured became totally and permanently disabled during the life of the insurance policy. Defendant concedes that \u201cit is fairly to be inferred that the insured was afflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis during the period of insurance protection;\u201d but insists that \u201cit could hardly have been advanced beyond the incipient stage because it was uncontradicted that he had no lung trouble when he entered the Army; that his only illness during service was a six-day spell of influenza in February, 1919.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The insured was susceptible to colds before he entered military service and was suffering from a nose and throat affection when he entered the service. A short time before his discharge he was in the hospital with the \u201cflu\u201d and was confined to bed for two weeks; and was not well after that. When he returned home in March, 1919, he was pale, hollow-eyed, and was suffering from a \u201cvery noticeable dry, hacking cough.\u201d Two weeks after his return home \u201che took sick and was down,\u201d and \u201cat that time he had a cough, headache, raised color, and had night sweats and pleurisy.\u201d He continued to have night sweats whenever h.e had a spell, which was about once a month, and when he had these spells he would be \u201claid up.\u201d When he tried to do only light work \u201che couldn\u2019t hold up under it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">In July or August of 1919 the insured underwent an operation for sinus trouble, and the doctor who performed the operation testified that at the time of the operation the insured was coughing and spitting up blood which \u201cwas not coming from his nose or sinus;\u201d and that he suspected tuberculosis because of \u201cthe cough and the spitting up of blood and the labored breathing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">From the summer of 1919 to February, 1921, the insured consulted different doctors but his physical condition gradually grew worse; and after February, 1921, he made no effort to do any work. Fie slept in a fresh-air cottage from May, 1921, to January, 1922, when he entered a hospital. In May, 1921, a specialist found him suffering from \u201cactive tuberculosis.\u201d The specialist was of the opinion that his condition had existed for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Prior to February, 1921, he did chores around the farm; but when he tried to do heavy work \u201che would have one of those bad spells and get worse.\u201d The evidence supports an inference of fact that from the time of his discharge in March, 1919, the insured was physically unable to perform the ordinary work about the farm and that any substantial physical exertion caused a collapse. There can be no doubt that for some indefinite period prior to February, 1921, the insured was totally and permanently disabled and that this condition continued until death. And we believe that there was substantial evidence respecting the insured\u2019s physical condition from the time that he suffered an attack of \u201cflu\u201d in February, 1919, to support the conclusion that he became totally and permanently disabled prior to March, 1919, and during the life of the insurance policy, and continued in such condition until his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">The District Court did not err either in overruling the government\u2019s objection to the substitution of William W. Coffey, Administrator of the Estate of William M. Coffey, deceased, or in overruling its motion for judgment at the close of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\"> Title 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The pertinent provisions of the Act are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-10\">(1) \u201cIn the event of disagreement as to claim, including claim for refund of premiums, under a contract of insurance between the Veterans\u2019 Administration and any person or persons claiming thereunder an action on the claim may be brought against the United States * * *.
