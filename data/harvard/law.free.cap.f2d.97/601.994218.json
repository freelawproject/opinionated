As illustrative, we quote claims 19 \u00e1nd 22:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">\u201c19. A food product which comprises the natural extracted juice of an onion the free acids of which have been neutralized, whereby the product has a pH value of 6.8 to 7.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">\u201c22. That method of preparing a food product which comprises extracting the natural juice from onions, forthwith neutralizing the free acids in the juice to impart to the juice a pH value of 6.8 to 7, and adding a preservative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">Claim 23 specifies \u201cadding a base to the juice in an amount to impart to the juice a pH value of 6.8 to 7.\u201d Claim 24 names calcium hydroxide for such base; claim 25 names sodium chloride. Each of the claims, except No. 19, specifies use of a preservative, the nature of which is not described.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">The references upon which the claims stand finally rejected are the following.patients :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">Blogg (Br.), 1,312,' March 16, 1905.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-14\">Barron (Br.), 14,835, November 20,1916.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-15\">Ellis, 1,002,506, September 5, 1911.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">Specifically, the rejection was based upon the patent to Ellis in view of the patents to Barron and Blogg. The examiner\u2019s description of the disclosures of the references and of appellant\u2019s method of preparation and preservation, given in connection with his reasons of rejection, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-17\">\u201c * * * The product of the Ellis patent is a solid seasoning material composed of dried onion juice, salt, \"calcium carbonate, and starch. Ellis expresses the juice from onions and combines the clear juice with salt. This mixture is then dried and to it is added the other two components of the product, namely, calcium carbonate and starch. On page 1, lines 78 to 80, it is stated that \u2018Carbonate of lime, in particular, tends to preserve the neutrality of the composition.\u2019 On page 2, lines 23 to 24, there is the statement, \u2018Carbonate of lime may serve as antacid material.\u2019 The calcium hydroxide specified by applicant in claim 24 is deemed to be but a chemical equivalent for the calcium carbonate disclosed by Ellis, since both are alkaline materials. It is held that the calcium carbonate in the Ellis composition is soluble enough and alkaline enough, and that the product and the atmosphere contain enough moisture to permit a correction in the pH value from 5 or 5.4 to 6.8 or 7, such a correction requiring a comparatively small amount of alkaline' material. Applicant\u2019s product is alleged to be unoxidized and fully preserved; Ellis\u2019 product contains \u2018onion material solely in a substantially unoxidized or undecomposed state\u2019 (page 2, lines 27 to 29).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-18\">\u201cBarron ,et al. teach the preparation of an onion essence with rectified spirits of wine. The product is definitely a liquid onion extract. The use of salt in an onion flavoring composition is also mentioned (page 2, line 1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-19\">\u201cBlogg shows the use of alcohol to preserve essential oils, the alcohol serving to protect the oil from oxidation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-20\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s product is thus prepared by expressing the juice of onions, adding salt and a basic substance, as taught by Ellis, and then adding a preservative, as taught by each of Barron et al. and Blogg. The seasoning <em>composition may be </em>liquid, as shown by Barron et al. and Blogg; calcium hydroxide \u2018may serve as antacid material\u2019 instead of calcium carbonate, since it is an obvious equivalent alkaline substance. Applicant\u2019s product is unoxidized; so, too, is Ellis\u2019 (see claims 1 to 4). Variations in the proportions of salt and alcohol may be practiced; the pH of the product may be specified. However, patentability may not be predicated upon specific limitations in the proportions of a composition when no different product is obtained. In re Lilienfeld, 67 F.2d 920, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 792, and decisions cited therein. Nor may patentabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ity be predicated upon specific characteristics ascribed to an old product or process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7F\">The brief on behalf of appellant, inter alia, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201c * * * Applicant, of course, does not claim any novelty in the addition of a preservative per se to any substance so no detailed consideration of these references is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cThis therefore narrows the consideration of this case down to the one proposition as to whether or not the Ellis patent No. 1002506 teaches applicant\u2019s method or discloses applicant\u2019s final product.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">At the hearing before us, appellant did not present oral argument, but submitted on brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In the brief a comparison was made between appellant\u2019s application and the Ellis patent, in parallel columns, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">Method.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">The Applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-17\">Ellis</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">\n<em>Onion Bulbs.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-18\"><em>Onion </em>Bulbs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">a.

Add starch <em>or </em>carbonate of lime (CaCC&gt;3) to keep the ground salt dry and free flowing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-27\">Product</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-28\">Applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-30\">Ellis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-29\">A clear onion juice retained in liquid form, having the important property of being free of acid reactions and thereby capable of retaining its natural color and flavor for an indefinite period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-31\">\"*~A dry salt of light green color having an onion flavor in which the salt is the predominating ingredient and which salt contains dry starch <em>or </em>dry carbonate of lime, as a <em>non-hy-droscopic </em>agent to keep the salt free flowing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-32\">It is noted that the comparison quoted is not confined to the exact phraseology of either the claims of the application, or of the Ellis patent. It seems to be appellant\u2019s interpretation of t\u2019he meaning of the terms respectively used.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-33\">Subsequent to the hearing, the court requested counsel for appellant to elucidate certain questions not fully understood from the first brief, and counsel responded with a statement, the pertinent portions of which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-35\">\u201cThe expression pH value as used by applicant in the claims on appeal may be interpreted in practical language as a symbol of a system or scale used for expressing the measurement of acidity or alkalinity of the onion juice constituting the final new product of applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-36\">\u201cTechnical definitions of pH are to be found in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, Unabridged; and in General Chemistry, by Leon B. Richardson, Revised Edition, page 240.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-37\">, \u201cThe relation of the use of the expression in the claims on appeal to the contentions of applicant is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-38\">\u201cRichardson, supra, states that a <em>neutral </em>solution is one in which the pH value is 7; an <em>acid </em>solution is one having pH value <em>less </em>than that number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-39\">\u201cNatural onion juice when first extracted is extremely acid; i. e., according to applicant\u2019s disclosure has a pH value of 5 to 5A * * * The acids in the natural onion juice are what cause quick oxidation and deterioration of the same both in color and flavor, and this cannot be arrested, even if a preservative is added, to the natural juice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-40\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s invention * * * is comprised in the fact that he conceived of immediately substantially neutralizing the onion juice solution by adding calcium hydroxide thereto. This neutralization produced therefore a product having a pH value of from 6.8 to 7, or substantially acid free. The applicant then determined that when a preservative was added to this neutral solution (one having a pH value of 6.8 to 7) that thereafter deterioration of flavor or color would not occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-42\">\u201cThe original juice being an acid <em>solution, </em>and the invention consisting primarily in converting such <em>acid </em>juice into a substantially neutral juice and then fixing it to remain in its latter condition, the applicant uses the chemical expression pH value of 6.8 to 7 to indicate that the new solution is neutral instead of acid as it was when first extracted from the onions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-43\">One point suggested by appellant is that his product is in liquid form, while that of Ellis is in the form of a dry salt. As to this, the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\u201c * * . * The appealed claims themselves do not appear to be expressly limited to a product which is in liquid form. They seem merely to relate to onion juice and the patent to Ellis clearly points out that his product is such as \u201cto hold the onion juice imprisoned * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We are of the opinion that a fair interpretation of the claims is that appellant\u2019s product is in liquid form, but it does not follow that this of itself would render them patentable. The Solicitor for the Patent Office suggests that \u201cthere is no particular patentable difference between a composition which is in dry form and one which is the same composition with the addition of water,\u201d citing the cases of In re Matthew Green and Elmer M. Jones, 48 F.2d 933, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1247, and In re Bates, 88 F.2d 486, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents 998. Those cases are the reverse of this in that the respective parties were claiming compositions in dried form, whereas the references showed compositions in liquid form. The principle there followed, however, is deemed to be applicable in this case. So, the mere matter of liquid form, if the respective compositions are substantially the same, cannot be regarded as lending patentability to appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">It will be noted from that part of-the statement of the examiner quoted, supra, that he expressly held that the calcium carbonate used by Ellis \u201cis soluble enough and alkaline enough, and that the product and the atmosphere contain enough moisture to permit a correction in the pH value from 5 or 5.4 [the value which appellant\u2019s disclosure teaches is in natural onion juice when first extracted] to 6.8 or 7, such a correction requiring a comparatively small amount of alkaline material.\u201d Also, the examiner held that it did not constitute invention to substitute calcium hydroxide [named specifically only in appellant\u2019s claim 24] for the calcium carbonate used by Ellis. These holdings the board approved, and we are not convinced by anything appearing in the record, nor by appellant\u2019s argument, both of which have been carefully studied, that such -holdings are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The claims contain no limitation defining any particular amount of whatever neutralizing agent may be used, so no step critical as to amount is defined over the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
