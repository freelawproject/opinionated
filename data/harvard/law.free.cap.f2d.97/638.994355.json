A thermal seal of a rubber hydrochloride.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-28\">\u201c33. In a package and as a part of the packaging material thereof, an air-tight, moisture-proof, flexible enclosure of a rubber hydrochloride film overlapping portions of which are united by an air-tight moisture-proof bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-29\">\u201c38. The method of packaging an article which comprises enclosing it in a transparent film of a non-tacky rubber hydrochloride and coalescing overlapping portions of the film by applying heat and pressure thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-30\">The references cited in the decision of the board are Bradley et al., 1,519,659, December 16, 1924; Becker et al., 1,756,919, April 29, 1930; Calvert, 1,989,632, January 29, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-31\">The patent to <em>Calvert is appellant\u2019s patent, </em>and the application therefor and appellant\u2019s involved application were copending in the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-32\">The appealed claims were rejected by the tribunals of the Patent Office as being un-patentable over claims 6 and 8 of appellant\u2019s patent, the holding of those tribunals being, in effect, that to grant appellant a patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>for the invention defined in the appealed claims would amount to double patenting. The Primary Examiner also apparently rejected the appealed claims on the patents to Bradley et al. and Becker et al. in view of claims 6 and 8 of appellant\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The latter ground of rejection was held unwarranted by the Board of Appeals in its denial of appellant\u2019s \u201crequest for reconsideration\u201d of its decision, the board saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aft\">\u201cA request for reconsideration has been filed. In our prior decision we held that the appealed claims are not patentable because, (1) they are not patentable over what is claimed in claims 6 and 8 of applicant\u2019s prior patent No. 1,989,632, and (2), they are not patentable over other prior art cited. We have carefully considered applicant\u2019s brief and believe that the rejection on the second ground above is not tenable and is withdrawn. The examiner indefinitely referred to the other prior art besides applicant\u2019s patent but apparently did not reject the claims on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">\u00edj\u00ed i{C $ #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">\u201cWe accordingly withdraw our rejection of the claims over the prior art which does not include applicant\u2019s prior patent. We are still of the view that the claims are unpat-entable over claims 6 and 8 of applicant\u2019s prior patent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">In denying appellant\u2019s \u201cRenewed Request for Reconsideration\u201d of its decision, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">\u201cWe affirmed the decision of the examiner in his rejection of all the claims on the ground of double patenting and nothing has been presented which changes our views.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Accordingly, the sole issue before us is that of double patenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">Disregarding for the moment claims 6 and 8 of appellant\u2019s patent on which the appealed claims were rejected, claim 3 of the patent may be used here as illustrative of the invention disclosed and claimed therein. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\">\u201c3. As a new article of manufacture, a homogeneous, thin sheet material or film composed of a partially saturated rubber hydrochloride <em>and a substance of such character and in such an amount as to retard photochemical disintegration of the rubber hydrochloride, </em>said sheet or film being characterized by transparency, flexibility, extensibility and inherent resistance to the passage of moisture vapors, which last-named characteristic is not appreciably affected by creasing or folding.\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">It will be observed that, among other things, claim 3 calls for a film of rubber hydrochloride having \u201ca substance of such character and in such an amount as to retard photochemical disintegration of the rubber hydrochloride.\u201d Claims 1, 5, and 7 of appellant\u2019s patent contain similar broad language; whereas, claims 2, 4, 9, 10, and 11 of his patent are somewhat narrower in scope. Claim 2, for example, recites that the composition therein claimed includes \u201ca rubber hydrochloride and hexamethylene tetramine in such an amount as to retard photochemical disintegration of the rubber hydrochloride.\u201d Claims 9 and 10 are somewhat broader than claim 2 in that they, respectively, define a composition of material which includes \u201crubber hydrohalide and a saturated secondary amine\u201d and \u201crubber hy-rohalide and a substituted dimethylamine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">Appellant\u2019s involved application relates generally to a \u201crubber hydrochloride having thermoplastic seals.\u201d It appears from the record that such material disintegrates when exposed to light over a protracted period of time, and consequently is limited to uses where it is protected from the light or where it is employed for wrapping articles for immediate use. To remedy that defect, appellant added certain substances, such as \u201chexamethylene tetramine,\u201d to his rubber hydrochloride composition, and photochemical disintegration was thereby greatly retarded. On December 22, 1933, approximately four months after the filing of the involved application, appellant filed his application No. 703,557 in the United States Patent Office for a patent for his improved rubber hydrochloride composition, and patent No. 1,989,632 issued thereon on January 29, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">The holding of the tribunals of the Patent Office is to the effect that appellant claimed both inventions in his patent No. 1,989,632, and, therefore, is not entitled to another patent for one of those inventions.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">Counsel for appellant contend that all of the claims in appellant\u2019s patent No. 1,989,-632 are limited to a rubber hydrochloride material or film containing a substance for retarding photochemical disintegration of the rubber hydrochloride; that claims 6 and 8, which the Board of Appeals held were not so limited, do, in fact, contain that limitation; and that, therefore, the appealed claims, which do not contain that limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>tion, are patentably different from claims 6 and 8 of appellant\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">In view of the fact that claims 6 and 8 of the patent are substantially the same so far as the issues here are concerned, we deem it sufficient to quote claim 6 only. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201c6. As a new article of manufacture a homogeneous, cast thin sheet material or film suitable for use as a wrapping material composed essentially of a chlorine-containing rubber derivative and being characterized by flexibility, transparency, extensibility with no more than a low degree of elasticity, and inherent resistance to the passage of moisture vapor, which last-named characteristic is not appreciably affected by creasing or folding, and <em>further character-ised by resistance to photochemical disintegration over a prolonged period of time </em>and being thermoplastic whereby overlapping portions become fused to one another when subjected to heat and pressure.\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">It will be observed that quoted claim 6 contains the statement that the rubber hydrochloride sheet is \u201cfurther characterized by resistance to photochemical disintegra-, tion over a prolonged period of time.\u201d It would seem to be clear that if the wrapping material defined in that claim is \u201ccharacterized by resistance to photochemical disintegration over a prolonged period of time,\u201d it must, in view of the teaching of the patent, contain a \u201cphotochemical inhibitor\u201d which gives it the characteristic of being resistant to photochemical disintegration.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">It is true, as stated by the Board of Appeals, that claims 6 and 8 are broad and somewhat indefinite. The same may be said of quoted claim 3 and claims 1, 5, and 7 of appellant\u2019s patent. However, we are unable to concur in the view expressed by the board that claims 6 and 8 are \u201ctoo indefinite to be construed as requiring the presence of a photo-chemical retarder.\u201d On the contrary, we think those claims were intended to 'be, and are, in fact, limited to a rubber hydrochloride composition containing a photochemical inhibitor which gives it the characteristic of being resistant to photochemical disintegration.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">We think it is clear from what has been said that the appealed claims are distinguishable from claims 6 and 8, as well as the other claims of appellant\u2019s patent, in that they cover the broad generic invention which comprises a \u201crubber hydrochloride,\u201d <em>not resistant </em>to photochemical disintegration, \u201chaving thermoplastic seals,\u201d rather than appellant\u2019s improved composition defined in claims 6 and 8 of his patent, <em>which is resistant </em>to photochemical disintegration.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">In view of the fact that, as we understand its decision, the board rejected each of the appealed claims solely upon the theory that claims 6 and 8 of appellant\u2019s patent were <em>not </em>limited to a composition containing a \u201cphotochemical inhibitor,\u201d and as we are of opinion that those claims are so limited, we must hold that the appealed.claims differ in subject matter and scope from claims 6 and 8 of appellant\u2019s patent and are patent-ably distinguishable therefrom, and that the board erred in rejecting them on the ground of double patenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">The decision of the Board of -Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
