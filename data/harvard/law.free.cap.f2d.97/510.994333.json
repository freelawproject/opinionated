HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b565-16\">These are appeals from two decrees, dismissing libels of information against a book and certain copies of a magazine, all of which \u201crepresent\u201d that articles described in them can be used to prevent conception (\u00a7 211, Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334), and give information \u201cwhere, how, or of whom\u201d such articles \u201cmay be obtained\u201d (\u00a7 245, Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 396). The publications came from abroad through the mails and were stopped at the Port of New York. The book was addressed to the claimant, Nicholas, about whom nothing appeared except that he was not a physician; the magazines were addressed to the claimant, Himes, who is the American editor of the magazine which is published in India. The Collector of the Port of New York after examination seized the publications as contraband and the District Attorney filed two libels to confiscate them under \u00a7 593(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1593(b). When these came on for hearing the judge held that \u00a7 615 of the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1615, did not shift the burden of proof to the claimant, unless the publications were seized under some law \u201crelating to the collection of duties on imports\u201d, which was not the case because no duties were payable upon them, their importation being forbidden. The libellant therefore failed, because it had not proved the scien-ter necessary under \u00a7 593(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-18\">. We shall assume arguendo that that section covers any merchandise imported \u201ccontrary to law\u201d, even though the \u201claw\u201d is not part of the Tariff Act itself. We shall also assume arguendo, contrary to the judge below, that \u00a7 615 is not limited to cases in which the proposed forfeiture is for the violation of a law designed to protect the revenue of the United States, but that the phrase, \u201claw relating to the collection of duties\u201d, is satisfied by any prosecution under \u00a7 593(b). We can make both these assumptions, because we think that \u00a7 593(b) does not cover contraconceptive publications for the following reasons. It does not define unlawful importation, but incorporates by reference such other statutes as do. In the case at bar only two statutes might answer \u2014 \u00a7 211 and \u00a7 245 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 334, 396 \u2014 but we think that neither will. The Joint Regulations of the Treasury and the Post-Office govern the disposal of matter coming through the mail from abroad: Article 2(a) requires a customs officer to be present when mails are distributed, and to segregate all \u201cprinted matter\u201d. Articles whose importation is prohibited must be \u201ctaken and held by customs officers for appropriate treatment under the customs laws\u201d. Article 20(c). By \u00a7 2204(2) of the Post-Office regulations prohibited matter from abroad must be withdrawn from the mails and dealt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>with under \u00a7 725, which requires it to be sent to the Dead Letter Office. Second and third class mail must be so wrapped that \u201cthe contents of the package can be easily examined\u201d. Art. 581(a). Thus it appears that prohibited printed matter arriving by mail from abroad must inevitably be examined at the border and detained, and from this it seems to us to follow that it has not yet been imported or brought into the United States within \u00a7 593(b), 19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1593(b). If the sender has not actually invited the examination, at least he has in fact facilitated it, unlike the importer in United States v. Ritterman, 273 U.S. 261, 47 S.Ct. 371, 71 L.Ed. 636, who contrived and set in execution a plan, surreptitiously to introduce the goods, which would have succeeded if it had not been uncovered. We hold therefore that \u00a7 593(b) of the Tariff Act did not apply. This conclusion is confirmed by \u00a7 305 of the same act, 19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1305, which provided for the seizure among other things of contraconceptive drugs \u2014 but not of publications about them\u2014 upon their \u201cappearance * * * at any customs office\u201d where they shall be \u201cheld by the collector to await the judgment of the district court\u201d. Thus there are two statutes dealing with contraconceptive drugs; one which forfeits them on their \u201cappearance\u201d at the customs and the other when they are imported. It seems to us unlikely that \u00a7 305, 19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1305, should be wholly superseded, as it would be, if \u201cappearance\u201d and seizure were \u201cimportation\u201d; and if \u00a7 593 (b), 19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1593(b), does not include contraconceptive drugs stopped at the border, certainly the \u201cappearance at a customs office\u201d of contraconceptive books and pamphlets is not importation, for the same words cannot mean one thing as to one kind of goods and another as to another. It is probably true that the omission from \u00a7 305 was unintentional, but we are not free to supply the defect, or to twist \u00a7 593 (b) out of its meaning. Hence it seems to us that the judge was right in refusing to forfeit the res in either suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">It does not follow that the publications should be delivered to the addressees. It is one thing to say that they may not be confiscated, and another that the Post-Office must forward them to the addressees in the teeth of \u00a7\u00a7 211 and 245 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 334, 396. Certainly that would have been unlawful, if the importation had been absolutely prohibited, or the mails absolutely denied to them. We have hitherto assumed that that was true, but it is not. We have twice decided that contraconceptive articles may have lawful uses and that statutes prohibiting them should be read as forbidding them only when unlawfully employed. Youngs Rubber Corporation v. C. I. Lee &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 45 F.2d 103; United States v. One Package, 2 Cir., 86 F.2d 737. See, also, Davis v. United States, 6 Cir., 62 F.2d 473. Contraconceptive books and pamphlets are of the same class and those at bar were therefore lawful in the hands of those who would not abuse the information they contained. This excuses the magazines, addressed as they were to their local editor; being lawful in the hands of physici.ans, scientists and the like, the claimant at bar was their most appropriate distributor. True, he might misuse his privilege, but that chance does not cancel it; if he does, he will then be subject to punishment, but he is not so subject yet, nor can he now be deprived of his property. Hence we conclude that the decree was right as to the magazines. The same reasoning does not apply to the book for the addressee may, or may not, be one of those in whose hands it would be lawful. The regulations, as we have seen, require prohibited matter to be detained, and while theoretically it would be possible to require the officials to prove that the addressee was not privileged in order to detain it, that would effectively frustrate the statute. Only the addressee can prove whether he is among the privileged classes; he ought at least to go forward with the evidence, even if the burden of proof is not eventually upon him. For these reasons we think that although the book may not be confiscated, it should not be delivered. It must go to the Dead Letter Office and its eventual disposition is not before us; but the decree will be without prejudice to any rights of the sender to recover his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Decree in United States v.
