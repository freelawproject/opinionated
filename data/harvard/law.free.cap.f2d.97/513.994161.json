However, not to enjoin the individual respondents so far as the corporation is enjoined would falsify the whole theory of the Supreme Court, which reversed us for not including them pari passu with the corporation. By abandoning the appeal from the tenth paragraph all that was meant was that the conduct therein specified which we had absolved might remain absolved; not that the general appeal from our release of the individual respondents should except that part of the corporation\u2019s conduct which both the Commission and we had condemned in that paragraph. It is true that a lower court must not undertake to change by one jot the decision of the court above; but for that very reason it should try to understand it, and to adhere to a purely verbal construction which will defeat its obvious intent is not a way to do so. For these reasons we have signed the Commission\u2019s order, and denied the respondents\u2019 motion for resettlement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
