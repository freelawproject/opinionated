They read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">\u201c6. In an asbestos cement shingle a body having an exposable surface formed of ridges and intervening furrows, said ridges and furrows being irregular in height and irregular in depth, the shingle being of greater density in the portions underlying the furrows than in the portions underlying the ridges, the undersurface of said shingle being arranged in substantially the same plane.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201c21. In an asbestos cement strip, a body portion of substantial thickness, a relatively plane undersurface and a top surface with exposable portion thereof provided with irregularly arranged ridges and intervening irregularly arranged furrows predominantly longitudinally disposed, thereby providing an exposed surface simulating a weather aged appearance.\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The references relied upon by the tribunals of the Patent Office, \u00e1re.: Scharwath et al., 1,404,483, Jan. 24, 1922; Perry, 1,451,369, Apr. 10, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">It will be observed from' the appealed claims that appellant\u2019s shingle has a relatively plane undersurface, and a top surface provided with \u201cirregularly arranged ridges and intervening irregularly arranged furrows predominantly longitudinally disposed.\u201d The exposed surface of the shingle simulates a weather-aged appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Appellant stated in his application that, due to efflorescence, the free lime in asbestos cement shingles rises to the surface and causes discoloration; that by breaking up the surface of the. shingle into irregular ridges and longitudinal grooves, such discoloration is greatly counteracted; that, due to the \u201cirregular heights and depth of the ridges and furrows, * * * shadows of different intensities\u201d are created, giving the shingle a \u201cweather aged effect\u201d; that the free lime tends to gather in the longitudinal grooves, leaving the ridges or elevations substantially free from such deposits ; and that the shadows caused by the ridges appear in the valleys, preventing, to some extent, the visibility of the lime deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Appellant\u2019s shingles are made by subjecting smooth-surface shingle blanks to a die press, whereby the density of the material in the recessed portions is increased. In other words, the shingles are so made that the depressed or recessed portions have \u201cdensified reinforcing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">The patent to Scharwath et al. discloses a press-molded asbestos cement shingle having its exposed upper surface \u201cribbed or corrugated.\u201d The patentees stated that the exposed upper surface of their shingle'was \u201cbroken by a plurality of substantially parallel longitudinally extending ridges * * * and by substantially transversely extending parallel curved intersecting ridges * * *, of 'comparatively small height * * * merely * * * sufficient to make pronounced markings or roughening of the surface,\u201d and that one of the objects of their invention was to prevent glare, ordinarily present in roofs composed of \u201cartificial shingles.\u201d This patent does not teach that the recessed portion\u2019s in the patentees\u2019 shingles should be reinforced by making them more dense.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Both of the references relied upon in this case were before us in the case of In re Smolak and McQuade, 88 F.2d 838, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1132. We there described the patent to Perry as follows (page 840).:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">\u201cThe patent to Perry relates -to a strip shingle in which a substantially homogeneous material is used. In his specification the patentee states that \u2018the impressions are in the main or body portion of the construction strips, which has distributed there-through the fibrous material, and which is of a homogeneous material capable of receiving and permanently retaining impressions of the desired sort and not merely in any superficial coating on such strips\u2019; that the depressions or grooves may be either straight or curved, and may be of any desired shape, depth, or width; that, \u2018It is, of course, to be understood that in the articles which are the object of my invention the depressions are deep enough to provide of and by themselves the desired appe\u00e1rance of separate unit shingles or tiles without in any way relying on the use of pigmenting or similar materials of various classes to produce the desired effect.\u2019 After giving various examples, the patentee states that \u2018Any other desired form of groove or depression may be used\u2019; -that they may \u2018be <em>made by pressing the strip between rolls having projections corresponding to the depressions desired,\u2019 </em>or they may \u2018be made by hand or in any other feasible manner\u2019; <em>and that the depressed or corrugated portions, being of increased density due to their having been compressed, act as mechanical strengthening members.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Italics not quoted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The patent to Perry teaches the advisability of reinforcing the sections beneath the depressions or corrugations by increasing their density precisely as does appellant. Furthermore, the patentee suggested that any form of groove or depression might be used, and that they might be formed by <em>pressing the strip or shingle between rolls having proper projections and corresponding depressions. </em>The patentee further stated that the depressions or grooves might be either straight or curved, and of any desired shape, depth, or width.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Neither of the references, however, shows the precise design called for in the appealed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">It is argued by counsel for appellant that the \u201csubstantially transversely extending parallel curved intersecting ridges,\u201d disclosed in the Scharwath et al. patent would prevent proper drainage, and that discoloration of the patentees\u2019 shingles would result.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The Primary Examiner stated in his decision that the. longitudinal grooves in appellant\u2019s shingle \u201care discontinuous with each other and in most instances surrounded. by ridges.\u201d The examiner was evidently of opinion that there was no great difference, so far as the matter of drainage is concerned, between the Scharwath et al. shingle and appellant\u2019s shingle, although he stated that \u201cIn spite of the advantages of appearance, drainage, and lime collecting applicant alleges his shingle obtains over the art, his claimed structure is not believed to be patentable.\u201d The examiner further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">\u201cAppearance may be changed at will without invention. <em>Drainage does not appear to be a material problem, </em>especially as shingles are always laid at an angle to the horizontal, and applicant\u2019s grooves do not appear to be especially designed to create drainage channels but merely perform that function incidentally. The lime collecting feature would exist in any grooves, for example, those of Scharwath, and applicant\u2019s design thereover merely produces irregular grooves. To produce an irregular appearance so as to conceal defects, etc. is considered but design skill and not mechanical improvement.\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">It is obvious from an examination of the drawings in appellant\u2019s application that the longitudinal grooves in his shingle are frequently interrupted by ridges. Those ridges must necessarily tend to prevent rather than promote proper drainage. It may be that they do not interfere with the free flow of water to the same degree and extent as do the transverse ridges in the Scharwath et al. shingle; nevertheless, as hereinbefore noted, the patent to Perry plainly states that a shingle of the type there disclosed might have corrugations of any desired shape, depth, or width. Furthermore, although counsel for appellant argues that the longitudinal grooves in appellant\u2019s shingle tend to promote drainage and that appellant\u2019s shingle has utility in that respect, and although a similar view is expressed in the affidavit of one Harold W. Greider (a research chemist, engaged in research work in connection with asbestos-cement, and asphalt, roofing materials), no such claim is made in appellant\u2019s application. It is further argued by counsel for appellant that the patent to Perry is from' a nonanalo-gous art, and that, therefore, it can not be combined with the patent to Scharwath et al. for the purpose of negativing patenta-bility of the appealed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">If the patent to Perry is from a non-analogous art, the contentions made by counsel for appellant in that regard are sound. In re Reichel, 84 F.2d 221, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">It is true, as argued by counsel for appellant, that Perry\u2019s shingle was made of a base consisting of roofing felt or similar material saturated with waterproofing substances, coated with asphalt or its equivalent, and then given a surface coating of a crushed mineral substance, such as slate, mica, or sand; whereas, appellant\u2019s application calls for shingles made of asbestos fiber and cement; nevertheless, the patent to Perry relates to the art of making shingles, and specifically teaches that any homogeneous material <em>\u201ccapable of receiving and permanently retaining impressions of the desired sort\u201d </em>might be used. (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Accordingly, we are of opinion that the Perry patent is not from a nonanalogous art, and that, upon reading that patent, it would be obvious to one skilled in the art that corrugations and ridges of any desired shape or depth might bfe formed, by compression, in a shingle composed of asbestos fiber and cement, and that the density of the material in the recessed portions could be increased by such compression. See In re Christian L. Schneider, 47 F.2d 970, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1114; In re Ra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>leigh, 62 F.2d 200, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 751. In so holding, we are not unmindful of the fact that so-called \u201casphalt roofing\u201d and \u201casbestos-cement roofing\u201d are made by different processes and on different machines, and that manufacturers of those two types of roofing are confronted with different problems with regard to \u201cresisting weather conditions,\u201d as stated in the affidavit of Harold W- Greider.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In the Smolak and McQuade Case, supra, this court considered the patentability of a shingle, which was defined in one of the claims there involved' as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201c21. A preformed non-inflammable structural unit, adapted for use as a siding slab, shingle, and the like, consisting chiefly of asbestos fibers and Portland cement and including, on the face thereof, elevated portions extending in irregularly longitudinal manner and to irregularly varying elevations, depressed portions alternating with the elevated portions and extending in irregularly longitudinal manner and to irregularly varying depths, and intermediate portions of irregularly sloping surfaces defined between the said elevated and depressed portions, whereby the unit is adapted to reflect light in diffuse manner\u201d and held,, in view of the references (particularly the patent to Perry) here involved, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201cIt being old to make press molded fireproof shingles by combining asbestos fibers and cement, the exposed surfaces of the shingles having indentations, corrugations, or grooves, thereby preventing the glare ordinarily present in roofs composed of artificial shingles, and it being old, as taught by the Perry disclosure, to make strip shingles of homogeneous material, and to form corrugations therein of <em>any desired shape or depth by compression, </em>we are of opinion, as was each of the Patent Office tribunals, that the appealed claims are not patentable over the prior art.\u201d (Italics not quoted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The similarity between claim 21 involved in the Smolak and McQuade Case, supra, and the claims now before us is obvious. We are of opinion that the involved claims are not patentable over the references, and that the tribunals of the Patent Office reached the right conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
