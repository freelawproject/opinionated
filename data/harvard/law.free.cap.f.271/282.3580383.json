The Locust Company went into bankruptcy, and Epstein as its president was summoned, or appeared, to testify in respect of the \u201cacts, conduct, and property\u201d of the bankrupt before a special commissioner of the District Court for the Eastern District, pursuant to section 21a of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St. \u00a7 9605a). His testimony before such commissioner resulted in an indictment for perjury (United States Criminal Code, \u00a7 125 [Comp. St. \u00a7 10205]), wherein he was charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-19\">In count 1, mat he'had willfully, etc., deposed before said commissioner that the Locust Company was forced to permit the foreclosure of a certain mortgage on property owned by it, because said Locust Company could not use any of the money received from the raising of certain mortgages, viz. $17,500, because the mortgagee did not pay to Epstein any money, but said mortgagee itself paid certain bills with said money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-20\">In count 2, that he in like manner deposed on a subsequent day of hearing that Locust Company had sold to Beta Company certain property belonging to the former, and that said Beta Company bad paid to Locust Company, as part of the consideration for such sale, $10,000 in cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-21\">No complaint is made of the formal parts of the indictment, which in due form charged the matters required by the statute above rererred to. After a protracted trial the jury returned Epstein guilty as charged, whereupon he took this writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Austin &amp; McKown, of New York City (Thomas D.

The is misused. Duplicity in an indictment consists in the joinder of two or more distinct offenses in one count (Bishop, New Grim. Proc. vol. 1, \u00a7 432); and since the two perjuries here alleged are plainly describable as \u201ctwo or more acts or transactions connected together,\u201d the joinder of counts is explicitly permitted by Revised Statutes, \u00a7 1024 (Comp. St. \u00a7 1690).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is with equal vigor said that it was error to deny defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or direct at the close of the government\u2019s case. What the trial court did was to \u201creserve decision\u201d on the motion. Whatever this may have been thought to mean, it was in effect a denial of the motion; but the exception is not available, because the defendant proceeded, adduced evidence,' and so went into the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">It is elementary that any defendant or accused who desires to rest upon his motion to dismiss or direct at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case or that of the prosecution must himself rest; otherwise he must renew his motion at Lhe close of all the evidence. The motion was renewed in this instance, but by the time all the evidence was in it is sufficient to say that there was a case for the jury. , '</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> By common law, as well as by the words of the statute, per-j ury is committed (so far as it is here necessary to define it) by stating \u201cany material matter which fthe accused] does not believe to be true.\u201d It is in like maimer fundamental that the false statement be made with a corrupt intent; but this question is one solely for the jury. United States v. Smith, 1 Sawy. 277, Fed. Cas. No. 16341. When the evidence was all in, Epstein had admitted that he made the statement which is the subject-matter of the first count. The verdict establishes that he made it corruptly; but it remained for the prosecution to show that the statement, however made, was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">\u201cMateriality\u201d is a word to be measured by surrounding circumstances. The object of the examination wherein Epstein committed this falsity was to procure information in respect of the \u201cacts, conduct, and property\u201d of the Locust Building Company, Incorporated, a bankrupt. It was therefore material to know what that company had done, what it had, and what had become of its belongings. We are wholly unable to perceive how or why Epstein\u2019s reason for permitting the foreclosure of a mortgage (so far as we know of unquestioned validity) was or could be a \u201cmaterial matter\u201d upon this inquiry. Therefore we are of opinion that the prosecution failed to prove the first count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>In like manner the untruthfulness of the statement set forth in the second count in the indictment was admitted after it had been fully proven. Without going into the details of evidence we may admit (as claimed by plaintiff in error) that the evidence amounted to this: That Locust Company agreed to exchange a piece of its realty for certain other lots of land owned by Wagner Bros., but that the latter, instead of conveying as agreed to Locust Company, conveyed to Beta Company; but Beta Company, through Epstein as the president of both Beta and Locust, provided $10,000 for the use of Locust Company, as to which $10,000 Epstein testified, \u201cI paid the creditors with it.\u201d Whether he did anything of the kind was the ultimate issue litigated before the jury in this case, and the verdict is against Epstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> We are of opinion that the statement charged in the second count was most material to the matter to be investigated under Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 21a. The false answer was calculated to delude and injure the creditors of Locust Company, and the explanation or excuse, viz. that in substance and effect the creditors of.Lcicust Company got the $10,000, did not, if true, mend the matter, except1 as it might show to the jury absence of corrupt intent. If false, the attempted excuse was an aggravation of the original falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">As to tire second count we think there was enough to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Some exceptions were taken to the charge of the court, but the charge must be considered as a whole, and upon the whole it was more favorable to the plaintiff in error than he had any right to expect, inasmuch as the trial judge (as we read the charge) left the jury with the impression that, if -the bankruptcy as a whole was an honest one, they ought not to convict Epstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Judgment on the second count is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
