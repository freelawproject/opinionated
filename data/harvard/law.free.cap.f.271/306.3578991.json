Judge Mayer entered a decree for $95.20, from 'which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-20\">We think these clauses divide, all shipments into two classes:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\">A. Where the shipper upon shipment has not declared the value of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>B. Where he has declared their value upon shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The first of the above clauses (A) completely regulates the first class of shipments,'and under it the owner has agreed that he may in no case recover more than \u00bf20 per package, or, if the value is less, only that value.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">(B) covers: (a) The second clause, arrived goods, as to which the owner shall recover in case of total or partial damage the declared or invoice value, whichever shall be least, (h) The third clause applies to goods not arrived, and as to them the owner shall recover their market value on the day of the ship\u2019s entry at custom house, less charges saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">This seems to us a consistent and reasonable construction of the three clauses. When the owner declares no.value, and pays a minimum rate of freight, he should not recover more than the value agreed upon in the bill of lading; that is, not in excess of \u00bf20 per package, or the real value, if less than that} sum, the rate of freight being adjusted upon that agreed value. When he has declared the value of the goods on shipment, and they are delivered,, he will ordinarily be made whole for any loss if he receive the value which he has declared, or for which he has invoiced them, whichever is least.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">But when the carrier fails to deliver at all it should put the owner in the position he would have been in had the shipment been delivered in good order, viz. their market value at destination, which is ordinarily more than their value at port of shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">For these reasons the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
