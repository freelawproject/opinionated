There was answer, replication, jury regularly waived, and the court, after hearing the proof on both sides, made these special findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b826-15\">\u201c1. That at all times mentioned herein the plaintiff was and now is a eor.poration organized and existing under and by virtue of the National Bank Act of the United States, and the amendments to each thereof, and engaged in the banking business in the City of Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon, and is a citizen, inhabitant and resident of the State of Oregon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b826-16\">\u201c2.

That there was no contract or agreement entered into between this plaintiff and the P. C. Barnes Company, lliat this plaintiff would not be responsible for the failure of the defendant to remit the moneys so collected, as above found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b827-7\">\u201c10. That upon the payment to this defendant by the said Lars Mikkelson of the sum of 82,450.18, as above found, the defendant, on November 22, 1916, prepared and placed in the United States mail a draft in said amount in favor of the Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank, and addressed to them at Portland, Oregon; fhat later, through the effect and at the request of this defendant, said draft was intercepted at Portland, Oregon, and returned to this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b827-8\">\u201c11. That prior to paying to the defendant here the amount of the draft drawn on him by the P. O. Barnes Company, Lars Mikkelson made request of the Railway Company for permission to make inspection of the fish, and was given certain cans of the fish, as directed by him for that purpose, and the defendant received payment of the draft without any understanding ns to further inspection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b827-9\">\u201c12. That the defendant Bank never at any time advised either this plaintiff or the F. O. Barnes Company, nor did either of them have any knowledge until after January 3, 1919, that the draft in question had in fact been paid by Mikkelson, and the bill of lading delivered to him; that on the contrary the defendant, on November 27, 1917, advised this plaintiff that said draft had been refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b827-10\">\u201c13. That in January, 3917, the said Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank, believing that the said draft had not been paid, and that the said bill of lading had not, been taken up, and that the salmon covered by the bill of lading had not been received or paid for by the said Lars Mikkelson, arranged with the said defendant Bank for the storage of llie salmon in question, and paid the said defendant Bank, on or about the 8th day of February, 1917, the sum of 8342.85. the freight on the said salmon from Portland, Oregon, to Fargo, North Dakota, and the sum of 863.50. the premium upon insurance obtained upon said salmon by the said defendant bank, and the said plaintiff bank became obligated in the sum of 8525.55 on account of attorney\u2019s fees and cash expenses incurred in an action heretofore brought in this court against the said Scandinavian-American Bank, and the Union Transfer Company, to recover the full value of the said salmon, such action having been instituted, and such expenses having been incurred without any knowledge on the part of the said Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank or this plaintiff that the said draft had been paid, and the said bill of lading delivered as above set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b827-11\">\u201c14. That on or about 12th day of January, 1937, the Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank charged the account of F. C. Barnes Company the face of the draft in question, 82,450.18, and eighty days\u2019 interest, to-wit, 835.93. That said charge was made in the belief that the draft had been dishonored and without any knowledge that it in fact had been paid, and the bill of lading delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b827-12\">\u201c15. That the Barnes Company has, and has had, full knowledge of the bringing of this action, and consented to and approved the bringing of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>\u201c16. That on or about the 15th day of September, 1917, the Lumbermen\u2019s \u25a0 National Bank of Portland, sold, assigned and transferred unto the plaintiff all of its assets, including all of its rights, claims and demands against the 'defendant herein, and the plaintiff is now the owner and holder thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATq\">\u201c17. I find that the action commenced in this court against this defendant, and the Union Transfer Company, and everything done by plaintiff, or the Barnes Company, subsequent to November 16, 1916, in connection with the fish in question, was done under the mistaken belief that the draft in question had not been paid, or the bill of lading delivered to Mikkelson, and that the same had been dishonored and not taken up; that the belief was created and existed because of the negligence and misconduct on the part of the defendant Bank and its failure to notify the Portland Bank of the fact, as heretofore found in that regard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b828-5\">\u201c18. I do further find that neither the plaintiff nor the Barnes Company have received from the defendant Bank the sum of $2,450.18 collected fromMikkelson, or any part thereof, nor have they received anything for the fish in question, from anybody, although due demand has been made upon this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b828-6\">\u201c19. That prior to October 16, 1916, F. C. Barnes Company, of Portland, Oregon, sold to one' Lars Mikkelson six hundred cases of canned salmon, by sample, and agreed that said Mikkelson should have the right to examine and inspect said canned salmon at Fargo, North Dakota.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b828-7\">\u201c20. That said shipment of canned salmon was not according to sample and contract, but was inferior and cheaper; and that said Mikkelson, after he had made an examination and inspection of the canned salmon, which revealed that fact to him, sought to reject said salmon, and so wrote Barnes <em>&amp; </em>Company; that said Barnes &amp; Company, by its answering letter, indicated an acquiescence in Mikkelson\u2019s refusal to accept the salmon, and consented to Mikkelson\u2019s refusal to accept the shipment, and consented to a mutual rescission of the sale, all of which was done without knowledge of the fact of the collection of the draft by the defendant bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b828-8\">\u201c21. That the defendant at all times held and retained the warehouse receipt which it obtained from the Union Transfer Company, and the insurance policy, as- directed by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b828-9\">\u201c22. That on or about the 4th day of June, 1918, the plaintiff, the successor of said Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank, and as the assignee of said Barnes Company, the owner of said shipment of canned salmon, commenced an action in this court, against the defendant herein, the Scandinavian-American Bank, and said warehouseman, the Union Transfer Company, its alleged cause of action being based upon the ownership of said fish by said Barnes Company, and its right of possession thereof, and alleging that said Union Transfer Company, and the defendant in this action, without authority from said Barnes Company, or said Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank, unlawfully converted said fish to their own use and benefit, after the same were stored in said warehouse, and said warehouse receipt had been issued. That at the time of the commencement of this present suit said suit against said Union Transfer Company and the defendant therein was, and still is, pending and undetermined in this court and on the calendar for trial at the present term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b828-10\">\u201c23. That said Barnes Company did not make a formal demand of plaintiff that it reimburse them for the money charged to their account, as found by the court and did not formally advise the plaintiff bank that Barnes Company expected to hold the plaintiff for the payment of the same, but Barnes Company upon ascertaining that the draft had actually been paid at Fargo, to the Scandinavian-American Bank, went with such information to the officers of the United States National Bank, and was sent by that Bank to its attorneys, who instituted this action. The fair inference from the conduct of the Barnes Company, and the bank, is that there was a mutual recognition of obligation by the bank towards Barnes &amp; Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b828-11\">\u201c24. That on or about January 29, 1917, plaintiff instructed defendant to take a warehouse receipt for said salmon in the name of F. C. Barnes .Company, and to insure said salmon, and to reimburse said Mikkelson for the amount of the freight on said shipment which had been p\u00e1id by him, and to hold said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>warehouse receipt and insurance policy for the plaintiff\u2019s account, all under the mistaken belief that the draft had not been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b829-4\">\u201cConclusions of Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b829-5\">\u201c1. That the plaintiff have and recover from the defendant the sum of $2,450.18, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from November 22, 3910, and the further sum of $406.85, with interest at tlie rate of 6% per annum from February 8, 1917, together with its costs and disbursements to be taxed by the clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b829-6\">\"2. That the plaintiff is not entitled to recover the sum of $525, or any sum, in this action, as attorney\u2019s fees, and expenses incurred in the case of United States National Bank v. Scandinavian-American Bank and the Union Transfer Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b829-7\">The defendant below requested the court to make twenty-three additional findings of fact and eight conclusions of law therefrom, which were all denied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b829-8\">A.

But from the facts found, indeed almost wholly admitted in the answer, it is established that the acts and conduct of plaintiff below on which rescission, waiver, ratification, estoppel and election of remedies is sought to be rested, were at a time when plaintiff was being fraudulently misled as to the true situation by the defendant Fargo bank, and which it succeeded in keeping covered up from the knowledge o\u00ed the Portland bank until after January 1, 1919. Those defenses were therefore precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is not claimed, nor argued, nor assigned as error, nor was objection made at the trial, that any of the findings made by the court is wholly without evidential support, nor that the court failed to make a material finding indispensable to the determination of liability under the issues. We can, then, go no farther than to inquire whether the facts found support the judgment, and whether during the progress of the trial there was error prejudicial to the plaintiff in error to which it saved exceptions. The E. A. Packer, 140 U. S. 360, 11 Sup. Ct. 794, 35 L. Ed. 453; Dooley v. Pease, 180 U. S. 126, 131, 21 Sup. Ct. 329, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>45 L. Ed. 457; Stanley v. Albany County, 121 U. S. 535, 7 Sup. Ct. 1234, 30 L. Ed. 1000; Syracuse Tp. v. Rawlins, 104 Fed. 958, 44 C. C. A. 277; Barnsdall v. Waltemeyer, 142 Fed. 415, 73 C. C. A. 515; Tiernan v. Insurance Co., 214 Fed. 238, 131 C. C. A. 284; Bank v. Watkins, 119 Fed. 545, 554, 56 C. C. A. 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> As to the first count, on collecting the $2,450.18 from Mikkelson the Fargo bank was at once obliged to remit to the Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank or the U. S. National Bank its successor, the two having become one by consolidation and reorganization, as alleged and admitted in the pleadings. That obligation has never been discharged by the Fargo bank, plaintiff in error, by any one acting for it. When it received the draft on Mikkelson for collection and collected it, the law implied a promise on its part to remit the amount collected less its reasonable charges. The parties thence stood in a contractual relation, and the plaintiff below was the proper party to bring and maintain this action. No one else could do so. It is the only party interested in the subject-matter of this action and a recovery of the money collected for it. 15 Encyc. Pl. &amp; Pr. p. 502, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> As to the second count, from the special findings it appears that while the plaintiff below was laboring under the mistaken belief that Mikkelson had not paid its draft on him, created by the false and fraudulent acts and representations of the Fargo bank, it sent to the Fargo bank $406.35 which it was induced to do by said fraudulent conduct, and it incurred a liability for $525.55 in bringing and prosecuting the first action it brought while it was being so misled; and there is no finding that any of those amounts have been returned or paid to it. It thus appears that it has been damaged in the sum of $931.90 by the fraudulent acts and representations of the Fargo bank, which amount it was entitled to recover on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Twenty assignments of error are directed to the admission and exclusion of evidence. They have been examined and considered, and we regard none of them as prejudicial to the rights of plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
