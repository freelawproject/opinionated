DAVIS (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Appellants, Joseph W. Payne and Jason Bond, were charged and tried by a jury in a joint trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on charges of first-degree murder and related offenses in the shooting death of Glen Stewart. The jury acquitted Payne and Bond of first-degree premeditated murder, assault in the first degree and conspiracy to commit kidnapping, but convicted them of first-degree felony murder, kidnapping and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. Payne and Bond were each sentenced to a term of life imprisonment for first-degree felony murder, with all but fifty years suspended and concurrent sentences of five years without parole on the handgun counts, the court merging the kidnapping convictions. Appellants filed this timely appeal and appellant Payne presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">I. Did the circuit court err in allowing \u201ccell phone tower\u201d evidence without a foundation by an expert?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">II. Did the circuit court err in admitting the hearsay statements of purported co-conspirators when there was no proof that appellant was part of the conspiracy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">Appellant Bond also raises a third question for our review:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">III. Did the trial court err in failing to grant a mistrial when the State elicited inadmissible hearsay evidence as to who allegedly committed the murder in this case which severely prejudiced appellant and improperly bolstered the State\u2019s case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting testimony about cellular tower site location without qualifying the State\u2019s witness as an expert and that the error is not harmless beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>doubt. We shall, therefore, vacate the convictions of Payne and Bond and remand for a new trial. We shall also address the evidentiary questions as they may arise again on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Officer Christopher Winter of the Baltimore County Police Department testified that, at approximately 2:00 a.m. on August 27, 2007, he was on patrol and responded to a call of a body on fire in the woods located at Villa Nova and Queen Anne Roads in Pikesville. Officer Winter described what he found at the scene: \u201cIt was a black male laying [sic] on his back still smoldering, smoking.\u201d Members of the fire department, who had also been called to the scene, discovered the body in the woods. Robert Latane, who lived on Villa Nova Road, testified that, on the night in question at approximately 10:00 p.m., he and his wife were watching television when Latane heard what he thought was gunfire: \u201c[W]e heard three pops. Pop. Pop. Pop. Like that.\u201d He looked outside his door but did not see anything significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The medical examiner, Dr. Mary Ripple, examined the body of the victim in this case, Glen Stewart. Dr. Ripple testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">Well, in general there were injuries to Mr. Stewart\u2019s body. There were three gunshot wounds to his head and neck. In addition, there were some drag-type scrapes and abrasions primarily to his back, which had underlying soft tissue hemorrhage and intramuscular trauma. There were post mortem burns over about three-quarters of the body, 75 percent of the body. And in addition, there was a partial burned cloth ligature around the neck, some small hemorrhages in the eyes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">There was evidence that two of the three gunshot wounds to the victim\u2019s head were the result of close range firing, including the wound in the center of the victim\u2019s forehead and the wound in the victim\u2019s neck. Three large-caliber bullets were recovered from the victim\u2019s body. Dr. Ripple opined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds and that Stewart was dead by the time the body was burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Detective Brian Edwards of the Baltimore County Police Department testified that, after police identified the victim as Glen Stewart, he responded to Stewart\u2019s residence, spoke with family members and searched his bedroom. There, the detective found a piece of paper next to Stewart\u2019s bed containing names and phone numbers,' including the name \u201cWeasey.\u201d After subpoenaing the phone records for those numbers, the detective was also able to identify phone records for numbers pertinent to the case which were associated with appellants. Detective Edwards testified that he subpoenaed the phone records for appellants and, from the original electronic spread sheet, was able to isolate calls relating to those numbers made on August 26 and 27, 2007 around the suspected time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">According to Detective Edwards, Bond had twenty-one regular cell phone activations and thirty-nine \u201cdirect connect\u201d activations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the dates in question. Detective Edwards \u201c[w]as able to determine information from their records that indicated the time of the call, either dial digits or a phone number that the call was placed to or from, and also a cell tower that the equipment was operating off of for that call.\u201d There then ensued objections by both defense counsel, contending that Detective Edwards was offering expert testimony without a proper foundation. As we will discuss in more detail in the discussion that follows, the court ultimately allowed Detective Edwards to testify to the locations of the cell phone towers that were accessed by appellants\u2019 cell phones on or around the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Consequently, Detective Edwards testified that Bond was the recipient of a Direct Connect call at 9:14 p.m. on August 26, 2007, the day of the murder, and that the call registered off a cell phone tower at Menlo Drive, located one and a half to two miles from the scene of the crime. Bond also received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>a direct connect call at 1:03 a.m. on August 27, 2007 at approximately the same time that the fire department received the call to respond to Villa Nova and Queen Anne Roads. This call registered off a cell phone tower atop the Balmoral Towers building at the corner of Liberty Road and Saint Luke\u2019s Lane, approximately a mile from the crime scene. Detective Edwards testified that this was the only time Bond\u2019s phone registered off this particular tower from August 23, 2007 to August 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">As for appellant Payne, Detective Edwards obtained his cell phone records for a period spanning from August 3, 2007 to August 31, 2007. He limited the records to the period from the time of the report of shots fired at Villa Nova Road to the time of the fire. The detective testified that Payne apparently did not answer a call that was placed to his cell phone at 10:02 p.m. on August 26, 2007, but that the call activated off the Balmoral building cell phone tower, which, again, was located approximately a mile from the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">On cross-examination, Detective Edwards agreed that he had heard that \u201cthe range of a cell phone is an unlimited line of sight.\u201d He testified that line-of-sight depended upon a number of factors, including topography. When asked, hypothetically, if a cell phone tower was located in one corner of the courtroom and another tower in another corner, that the way a person held his or her cell phone determined which tower would be accessed, Detective Edwards replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He then agreed that he could not tell precisely how far the cell phones were from the towers when the calls were made. When asked, with unlimited line-of-sight if it were possible that a person could be standing on top of the World Trade Center in the Inner Harbor and access a particular cell tower, Detective Edwards replied \u201cI suppose that could be possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">On further cross-examination, Detective Edwards testified that Christopher Johnson and Desmond Jones had robbed Donald Bland, also known as Cuzo, also known as \u201cATL\u201d on August 24, 2007. Stewart had been present during the rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>bery. Finally, Detective Edwards testified that he returned to the scene of the crime in November of 2007 and found a set of gold caps or fronts, belonging to Stewart, which had been overlooked by the crime scene technicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Brittany Keller, Christopher Johnson\u2019s girlfriend and a cousin to both appellants, testified that, on the evening of the murder, she was at her aunt\u2019s house with her baby and Tyrice McCant, the mother of Payne\u2019s child. At some point, the appellants were also present. Keller left that gathering at around 9:00 p.m., went to a friend\u2019s house and then went home. Keller testified that her car did not break down that evening and, after seeing appellants at the gathering, she did not see or hear from them the rest of the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">When the police first questioned Keller in early November, she admitted during trial that she told them that appellants, as well as Johnson and Jones, known to her as \u201cWeasey,\u201d were with her on the night in question. She also told the police that the four men had assisted her when her car ran out of gas. She admitted that Ms. McCant had asked her to tell this story to the police. Keller also admitted she discussed this story with Bond. Regarding her discussion of this false alibi with Payne, Keller testified: \u201cAs far as Joey was concerned, I spoke with him about what was said by Jason, but I didn\u2019t know what he was going to do as far as the police were concerned.\u201d She testified that, at some point, Payne knew that she had lied to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">As will be discussed further in the analysis that follows, the trial court allowed recordings of wiretapped cell phone conversations to be played for the jury over a continuing objection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the first conversation between Bond and Keller, Bond stated that he wanted to be certain that Keller had not deviated from the alibi that appellants came to assist her when she ran out of gas on the night of the murder. Another wiretap recording of Keller\u2019s conversation with Payne, made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>immediately after she talked to Bond, was played for the jury. In that conversation, Keller told Payne that Bond had been questioned by the police: \u201cJason just called me and they came to see him so umm I don\u2019t know if you ... inaudible ... me to tell you when I get there or what[\u2019]s up.\u201d Payne\u2019s reply was that she would tell him when she arrived and the conversation ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Tyrice McCant testified that, on October 23, 2007, she told police that she did not know anything about the murder and that Keller\u2019s car ran out of gas and the four men had rendered her assistance. At trial, McCant acknowledged that the story was false. After Keller dropped her off at her house that evening around 9:00 p.m., McCant did not see appellants, Jones or Johnson again until after midnight, when the group arrived at her house. At that time, she noticed that Jones appeared \u201cfrantic and looked like he was scared.\u201d McCant testified that she placed two anonymous calls to the Baltimore County Police Department in the fall of 2007 using an assumed name, in which she provided the police information about the Stewart murder, including the identities of the perpetrators. The trial court did not permit her to provide specific names of the individuals identified during those calls at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Desmond Jones, also known as \u201cWeasey,\u201d knew Bond and Payne and was appellants\u2019 co-defendant, scheduled to be tried subsequent to appellants\u2019 trial. He testified pursuant to a plea agreement in which he would plead guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping and testify against Payne and Bond in exchange for a thirty-year sentence. According to Jones, he was with Christopher Johnson behind the Rogers Avenue Metro station when Johnson pistol-whipped and robbed Donald Bland, Jr. Bland was accompanied at the time by Glen Stewart. Stewart was standing behind Jones and Johnson during the robbery and assault and watched, but did not attempt to intervene.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>A rumor was widely circulated that Stewart had reported the robbery of Bland to the police. Jones confronted Stewart about the rumor and Stewart denied any cooperation with police. At approximately 8:00 p.m. on the night of the murder, Jones called Stewart, in the presence of Payne, Bond and Johnson and invited him to come smoke marijuana with them. When Stewart arrived, he began smoking and talking with the four men about the robbery and whether Stewart had been talking to anyone about the robbery. After they went to a nearby elementary school to smoke some more, Jones testified that Payne then \u201cgrabs the boy and slams him on the floor and hit him in his face.\u201d According to Jones, either Bond or Johnson had a gun and, after beating Stewart some more, the group then put Stewart into the back seat of Payne\u2019s car, seated between Johnson and Bond. Jones described this and the aftermath as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">Glen was fighting for his life for real. He bit the boy Chris on the arm. And I looks back. I think he had a white shirt tied around his mouth. Then he got to the destination. They drag him out the car, put him inside the woods. By the time I walk over there, I heard Payne screaming, just\u2014this is far enough. Chris just shot him twice. Then Payne said shoot him again. He shot him again. By then I\u2019m running back to the car. And drove back to Tyrice[\u2019s] house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">After returning to McCant\u2019s house and smoking for an hour or two, the four went to the 7-Eleven, obtained gasoline and drove back to the scene of the murder. Jones testified that he and Bond stayed in the car and that Payne and Johnson went back to the woods and set the body on fire. Jones testified that, after he saw the victim\u2019s body on fire, Payne and Johnson ran back to the car and the group left.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The four men then had discussions \u201cto get their story straight\u201d if they were \u201cpulled up\u201d by the police. They concocted the story that Brittany Keller had a flat tire and that they drove out to fix it for her. Jones had spoken with Bond \u201cabout getting [the] story straight,\u201d and acknowledged that, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>far as he knew, Keller\u2019s car never did break down, have a flat tire or run out of gas that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Jones recounted that he had phone conversations with Bond in December of 2007; the recordings of these conversations were admitted into evidence. In the conversations, Jones and Bond discussed the police investigation of the murder and the story they intended to tell police. In a wiretap recording of a cell phone conversation between Bond and Jones on December 12, 2007, Bond instructed Jones to \u201c[p]ut shit on private.\u201d Immediately after the transcription ends, Bond called Jones again and it appears from the wiretap that he was upset that Bond had given the name \u201cWeasey\u201d to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The next wiretap recording played for the jury is another cell phone conversation between Bond and Jones on the same day. Both appear nervous that \u201cthe Feds are on us.... \u201d After that, the jury heard another phone conversation between Bond and Jones, which shows concern about keeping their versions consistent with those of Keller and McCant. In the final recording between Bond and Jones, Bond asks Jones for Keller\u2019s telephone number. In a recording already played for the jury, Bond immediately called Keller to be certain that she did not deviate from the story that she had run out of gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The State\u2019s final witness was Detective A1 Barton, who investigated the murder of Stewart along with Detective Edwards. After responding to the home of the victim, Barton testified that one of the last calls to the Stewart residence prior to Stewart\u2019s death was from Jones\u2019 cell phone. Also included in Jones\u2019 phone records were numbers associated with Bond and Payne. Detective Barton provided his interpretation of the cell phone records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">[W]hen we looked at the historical phone records for two phones in particular, we found that Joseph Payne\u2019s phone was registered off a cell tower near the crime scene at 10:00:03, which is around the time the shots were heard. We noticed that the cell phone later determined to be used by Jason Bond was registered off the cell tower near the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>crime scene at 1:03, around the time the fire was discovered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Detective Barton then testified that he also reviewed the cell phone records for Payne. From August 3rd to August 31st, 2007, there had been 1,978 phone calls made by Payne\u2019s phone. Over objection, Barton was permitted to testify that the phone call made to Payne\u2019s phone on the night of the murder was the only time any of these thousands of phone calls were processed through the Balmoral cell tower near the crime scene. Detective Barton also provided testimony concerning anonymous tips received during the course of the investigation and we will discuss that in the following analysis. Additional facts will be provided as warranted in the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Appellants assign error to the circuit court\u2019s admission of \u201ccell phone tower\u201d evidence without a foundation by an expert witness. Detective Edwards, they complain, should not have been permitted to offer lay testimony regarding the details of cellular telephone tower operations, usage, signals and position because the testimony was the only independent evidence to corroborate the testimony of Jones, an accomplice, who testified that appellants were present when Stewart was killed and his body burned. Appellants rely heavily on our decisions in <em>Coleman-Fuller v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 577, 995 A.2d 985 (2010) and <em>Wilder v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 319, 991 A.2d 172, <em>cert, denied, </em>415 Md. 43, 997 A.2d 792 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The State counters that <em>Wilder </em>and <em>Coleman-Fuller </em>are distinguishable in that the officers in those cases interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the phone records and cell tower locations to draw conclusions about the respective defendants\u2019 location, whereas, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>\u201cDetective Edwards simply testified as to factual, objectively verifiable information regarding appellant\u2019s cell phone records and cell tower locations, without drawing conclusions or rendering any opinion regarding the location of appellants or their cell phones.\u201d According to the State, \u201cthere was no \u2018opinion\u2019 testimony, lay or otherwise, in this case and, even if it did constitute opinion testimony, there was no need for the State to produce an expert to testify regarding the facts relating to appellants\u2019 cell phone records.\u201d <footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We hold that <em>Wilder </em>and <em>Coleman-Fuller </em>are controlling in this case and that the trial court erred in admitting the lay opinion of Detective Edwards. We also hold that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and that a remand for further proceedings is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">During Detective Edwards\u2019 testimony, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">[WITNESS]: There was one call of most interest at\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">THE COURT: Well, sustained to the characterization. Just the number of calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">[WITNESS]: The time frame to the call immediately before the 10 o\u2019clock pertinent time to just I guess within 15 minutes or so of the call for the report of fire, we have two calls of interest, one at 9:14:86 p.m. on August 26, 2007, and one at 1:03:13 a.m. on August 27, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">[STATE]: What did you do with those calls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>[WITNESS]: Those calls, as well as many others, I examined the records that I obtained from the Sprint Nextel Company, was able to determine\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">[WITNESS]: Was able to determine information from their records that indicated the time of the call, either dial digits or a phone number that the call was placed to or from, and also a cell tower that the equipment was operating off of for that call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">[STATE]: By that you mean cell phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">[WITNESS]: Cell phone, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">[STATE]: In regard to the first of those calls, the 9:14 call, were you able to determine what cell phone that call\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-12\">[PAYNE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection. May we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-13\">(The following discussion was held at sidebar:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-14\">[PAYNE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, we now have the police officer interpreting the records that were kept by the custodian and properly authenticated. But we have no, absolutely no information about the detective\u2019s ability to interpret those records. And without a foundation, I am objecting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-15\">And in addition, your Honor, they are highly technical aspects of cell tower usage. Cell towers are not unlimited. When a cellular tower becomes overflowed, it automatically refers its signal to another tower. You can have but one call and up to two or three referrals for a tower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-16\">But the point is there is no expertise on the part of this witness to express or to talk about how those signals are received by towers and whether they originated with that tower or come from a relay tower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-17\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: I would object. I agree and adopt the whole argument of [Payne\u2019s Counsel]. I think it\u2019s improper. He is not qualified to testify as to the things he is going to testify to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>THE COURT: [State]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">[STATE]: He\u2019s not an expert. He doesn\u2019t need to be an expert because I am not asking him for an expert opinion as to where this phone was in terms of direction or latitude or longitude or specific location. I am asking what the record says. I can go through some very basic steps to show how he was able to use the records, and the actual records themselves that have that step-by-step process. And I was going to do that in my next area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The court initially agreed that the State needed to show more in the way of foundation. After testimony resumed and Detective Edwards was directed to an instruction sheet for helping to interpret the records, defense counsel objected and the jury was excused. Defense counsel proffered that they never received this instruction page and that this was expert testimony. The State responded \u201cI don\u2019t know if this specific piece of paper was sent over in discovery along with the cell phone records,\u201d but asserted that the instructions that came with the Sprint Nextel records provided the foundation. The following then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">THE COURT: I haven\u2019t kept records. I was just looking at them to see what they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">To me, the distinction is the following. The detectives look at records and say based upon these records, here\u2019s what calls came in and the time, here\u2019s what cell tower that call bounced off. Unless there are separate records beyond that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: But it\u2019s not. It doesn\u2019t say where the cell tower is. Just gives a number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">THE COURT: But you can get it. That information is contained\u2014obtainable through Sprint records and it\u2019s historical data. They keep a record of what number you call or what number you are dialing and what tower it reflected off of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: But it doesn\u2019t tell you this is Tower C located in Loch Raven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>THE COURT: It says tower number blah, blah, blah. You can then plug it in and get latitude and longitude. All he is doing is saying is this is what this is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: And you don\u2019t need an expert to do that? I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m a lay person. Anything above what a lay person can do I would think an expert would be necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">THE COURT: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: I may be a low-grade person or technical person but not very smart. I would think that an expert would still be needed for the expertise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Payne\u2019s counsel then interposed the following objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">Your Honor, here\u2019s the problem. There are a number of problems but the two that seem to be most striking are, number one, that the detective has used instructions that came along with the records apparently from this telephone organization. We didn\u2019t get those explanations. We got the records but we didn\u2019t get the explanation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">Basically what is happening here is there is an expert somewhere in Teaneck, New Jersey, who wrote these things. The detective is going to rely upon them. We didn\u2019t even receive them to review them. And the detective\u2014I mean, maybe I\u2019m wrong, maybe he\u2019s received this education. But the records indicate beginning towers and ending towers and they gave latitude and longitude but they don\u2019t indicate in the records where it talks about beginning towers and ending towers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">We also don\u2019t deal with whether or not the beginning tower is the beginning of the calls as routed in the system or whether it\u2019s been bounced off three other towers to get to the beginning tower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">And I don\u2019t think the detective has expertise to deal with those issues and yet his testimony is going to sound like he is concretely informed by the records that this is the beginning tower at this location. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the next thing we hear out of him is the radius of distance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>by signal from the phone to the tower. And at that point my young friend is going to explode.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">We have a lay person talking about highly technical things and there is no foundation that any of the data is valid. The records are there but his interpretation of it requires a great deal of technical expertise that he doesn\u2019t have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Still outside the presence of the jury, Detective Edwards informed the court that the Nextel instructions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1T\">[u]se the last two sets of numbers, first being the lag ID, second being the cell ID. Says match that to the table, which there is [sic] multiple ways you can get the cell tower information. There\u2019s a Web site that maintains it, secure Web site. There\u2019s an Excel spread sheet that comes with the records. Go in there, search that lag. It gives you the latitude and the longitude. Says you can use any mapping software. You look at it, find the point on the map where the cell site is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Detective Edwards further asserted that the \u201ckey\u201d to explaining the cell phone records was not produced from those records: \u201cThat is not\u2014this is something I produced from another document.\u201d According to appellants, the other document was never identified. In overruling the objection to the testimony of Detective Edwards, the circuit court relied on an unreported opinion from the Eleventh Circuit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">What is before us now is really a question of whether the detective\u2019s testimony is actually lay testimony or more in the nature of expert testimony for which there\u2019s no foundation that\u2019s been laid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">The issue was before the Eleventh Circuit recently in <em>United States versus Feliciano, </em>which is 300 [Fed.Appx.] 795 (2008). Cert, was denied by the Supreme Court. Basi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>cally it said the line between expert and opinion testimony is not easy to draw. A law enforcement officer may be qualified to provide both lay and expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">And then it talks about whether the officer\u2019s testimony in talking about cell tower locations crossed the line from lay to expert and they find that it did not. In reviewing cellular telephone records in a summary of those calls, which identified cellular sites for each call, then based on personal knowledge concerning the location of the cell towers, he testified to those calls and where they were in relation to those towers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">I mean, if we are talking about the same thing here, the only issue is whether you actually got the ledgers so that you can independently verify the tower locations indications that was shown both on the records and pictorially on maps that were included in the wiretap summary and it seems to me that the information is there in those records and that the officer can testify to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">So, for those reasons, I am overruling the objection to the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Subsequent to the court\u2019s ruling, Detective Edwards testified that a telephone call from Bond\u2019s cell phone registered off of a cellular tower \u201cat a latitude and longitude of 39.350854 by negative 76.696565 located on Menlo Drive\u201d which was approximately one and one half to two miles away from the crime scene at approximately the time when the crime occurred. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on August 27, 2007, another call had been placed from Bond\u2019s cell phone registering off of a cellular tower at latitude and longitude 39.34364 by negative 76.72851, a location known as Balmoral Towers, located approximately one mile from the crime scene. Over objection, Detective Edwards then identified the map which has been generated as a mapping program that depicted the aforesaid locations. Finally, Detective Edwards testified that Paynes\u2019 cellular-phone activated off of one of the towers located in proximity to the crime scene at 10:02 a.m. on August 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Maryland Rule 5-701 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019s testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">In addition, Maryland Rule 5-702 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005), two police officers, neither of whom had been proffered or qualified as an expert witness, opined, over objections, that, based on their observations, Ragland had been engaged in a drug transaction. Ragland was convicted of distribution of cocaine and appealed, claiming that the court erred in allowing the officers to render their opinions based on lay testimony. The Court of Appeals agreed with Ragland, and ruled that the opinion testimony of those officers was expert testimony, given the nature of their conclusions. Such testimony was inadmissible because the discovery and evidentiary predicates had not been satisfied. The Court of Appeals held that Md. Rules 5-701 and 5-702 prohibit the admission of \u201clay opinion\u201d testimony based upon specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training or education. <em>Id. </em>at 725, 870 A.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In <em>Wilder, </em>191 Md.App. 319, 991 A.2d 172 (2010), the defendant was convicted of first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 991 A.2d 172. Before trial, the \u201cdefense moved in limine to exclude testimony about how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>police managed to track [the defendant\u2019s] movements, at or near the time of the shootings, by use of cellular telephone records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 991 A.2d 172. Upon making the motion, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... What my main worry is, Your Honor, is that a detective\u2019s gonna take the stand and state, at 4:47 a.m., [the defendant\u2019s] phone was hitting off of this tower in the general location of where the shooting took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">On cross examination I\u2019m not gonna be able to get into anything \u2018cause he\u2019s\u2019 not an expert on this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">He\u2019s gonna testify to what the tower information is, and I think it needs to come in through an expert who can testify to where the towers are located, how close the towers are, how a phone pings off a certain tower compared to one two miles away, all this information that would come out, and I don\u2019t think a detective\u2014unless [the State] says this detective has that kind of expertise, and I don\u2019t think he does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">[THE STATE]: ... [The detective] is not going to render any opinion whatsoever, neither expert nor lay nor otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">I -will let the Court know that [the detective] is, in fact, not an expert. And I am not attempting to qualify him as such, but he was able to do this just using the certified records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">All he did was look at the records and plot out the towers and the calls that correspond to the towers using just the information from the records, and that\u2019s all he\u2019s going to testify about with regard to this particular issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... This is a highly technical situation where they are claiming that my client is in the general location. I need to know how big of a tower area this is. I don\u2019t know if he knows the answer to that. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>don\u2019t know if he knows what the next closest tower is, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s an expert, but I\u2019m saying it should come in through an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">I mean, this is highly\u2014I mean, the evidence that they\u2019re gonna put in is that he is\u2014his cell phone is in the area at the time of the shooting.

And if I don\u2019t have the ability to do any cross examination on that because their detective\u2019s gonna say, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, then I\u2019m left with nothing, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">[THE COURT]: ... He\u2019s taking some records that are certified and he is plotting some points on them. He\u2019s not going to express any opinions after he\u2019s plotted those points.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... He\u2019s gonna have to express some sort of an opinion that the cell phone was in this area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">[THE COURT]: No. [The State] said he\u2019s not going [to] express any opinions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">[THE COURT]: And, in fact, since he\u2019s not being called as an expert and not being qualified as such, he wouldn\u2019t be able to ex\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">[THE COURT]:\u2014to express that opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I guess we\u2019ll have to wait to see how he testifies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-15\">[THE COURT]: All right. So that defense motion at this point is\u2014it\u2019s not granted at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 350-54, 991 A.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">The detective then testified about how he was able to track the defendant\u2019s whereabouts through the use of cellular telephone tracking and Global Positioning System technology. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>at 354, 991 A.2d 172. During this testimony, defense counsel objected to the detective testifying that he confronted the defendant with cellular telephone records that contradicted his account of the events that allegedly transpired. <em>Id. </em>at 354, 991 A.2d 172. Defense counsel also objected to the detective\u2019s description of the software that he used to create a map of the locations where the defendant made cell phone calls before, during and after the shooting. <em>Id. </em>Finally, when the State moved to admit an exhibit, <em>i.e., </em>a printout of the software-created map, defense counsel objected again. <em>Id. </em>The map was admitted over counsel\u2019s objection. <em>Id. </em>Later, the detective testified that he had used the technique of charting telephone call locations in the computer software \u201capproximately 25\u201d times. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 991 A.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">On appeal, the defendant asserted that the admission of the detective\u2019s testimony directly contradicted the holding of <em>Ragland. Wilder, </em>191 Md.App. at 361-62, 991 A.2d 172. Against the backdrop of <em>Ragland, </em>we determined \u201cthat the better approach is to require the prosecution to offer expert testimony to explain the functions of cell phone towers, derivative tracking, and the techniques of locating and/or plotting the origins of cell phone calls using cell phone records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365, 991 A.2d 172. Although \u201ccellular telephone technology has become generally understood,\u201d we stated that <em>Ragland </em>indicated that any opinion derived from a witness\u2019s experience or training must be admitted as expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 367-68, 991 A.2d 172. We then concluded that the detective should have been qualified as an expert because his training and experience enabled him to map the defendant\u2019s locations based on his cellular telephone records. <em>Id. </em>at 368, 991 A.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In <em>Coleman-Fuller, </em>192 Md.App. 577, 995 A.2d 985 (2010), the defendant was indicted for first-degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 580, 995 A.2d 985. Prior to trial, the defendant proffered a \u201cmotion in limine regarding the State\u2019s attempt to introduce cell phone records and cell phone tracking evidence through a detective instead of an expert witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court denied the motion. <em>Id. </em>During trial, Detective Gary Childs \u201ctestified extensively from the cell phone records of two cell phones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>recovered from [the defendant] at the time of his arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 995 A.2d 985. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the detective used the records and cellular telephone tower sites to illustrate the defendant\u2019s locations before, during and after the murder. <em>Id. </em>During the trial, Detective Childs also testified that he was qualified to decipher cellular telephone records because he \u201cattended a school for cell phone analysis,\u201d and had \u201cbeen doing this ... for a number of years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 995 A.2d 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In objecting to the detective\u2019s testimony, the defendant argued that the detective \u201cwas not a disclosed and qualified expert and he rendered opinions on a topic that was beyond the purview of the ordinary lay juror.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614-15, 995 A.2d 985. On appeal, we concluded that only a person with training and experience would know that cellular telephone technology permits individual phones to function by locking onto the nearest side of the nearest and/or strongest tower. <em>Id. </em>at 615, 995 A.2d 985. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">Patently, the testimony of Detective Childs is equivalent with that of the detective in <em>Wilder. </em>Similar to the detective in <em>Wilder, </em>utilizing the data from the cell phone records, Detective Childs rendered an opinion on appellant\u2019s location at the time of the calls, stating that the phone records were consistent with appellant\u2019s presence in the vicinity of the murder around the time it happened. From the cell phone records, he testified that he was able to determine whether the location of individuals was consistent with their statements to police and their testimony. Neither Detective Childs nor the detective in <em>Wilder </em>were qualified as experts, but rather, stated that their training was the result of certification from the cell phone company. Under our holding in <em>Wilder, </em>it was clearly error for the court to admit this evidence without expert testimony. On remand, this evidence may only be introduced through a witness qualified as an expert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\"><em>Coleman-Fuller, </em>192 Md.App. at 619, 995 A.2d 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Here, Detective Edwards obtained Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s cell phone records in electronic form from Sprint Nextel in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>form of a spreadsheet. He extracted their records from that spreadsheet, limiting them to August 26th and 27th. According to Detective Edwards, the cell tower information may be obtained by matching the lag ID and the cell ID to the table and, utilizing this information as well as information available on the Sprint Nextel Web Site, the latitude and longitude of the tower can be determined by use of mapping software. Detective Edwards further asserted that the \u201ckey\u201d to explaining the cell phone records was not produced from those records: \u201cThat is not\u2014this is something I produced from another document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Employing this procedure, Detective Edwards testified that Bond\u2019s cell phone registered off of a cellular tower at a latitude and longitude located on Menlo Drive, which was approximately one and one half to two miles away from the crime scene at approximately the time when the crime occurred. He further testified that another call had been placed from Bond\u2019s cell phone registering off of a cellular tower at approximately 1:00 a.m. on August 27, 2007, at the latitude and longitude of a location known as Balmoral Towers, approximately one mile from the crime scene, at around the time the fire department responded to the scene. Detective Edwards thereafter identified the map which had been generated as a mapping program that depicted the aforesaid locations. Finally, Detective Edwards testified that Paynes\u2019 cellular-phone activated off one of the towers located in proximity to the crime scene at 10:02 a.m. on August 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We are persuaded that this case is controlled by the decisions in <em>Wilder </em>and <em>Colemcm-Fuller. </em>Thus, we hold that the court erred in admitting lay testimony regarding cell phone tower evidence in tracking of the location of appellants at the time of the murders. We also reject the State\u2019s attempt to distinguish those cases on the grounds that Detective Edwards never testified to the precise locations of appellants\u2019 cell phones, themselves. We discern no other reason that the State would elicit the fact that these towers were in close proximity to the scene of the crime on the day and at the precise time other than to have the jury consider this as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>evidence that appellants were, in fact, present at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Nor are we able to say, based upon our independent review of the record, that the error in the admission of Detective Edwards\u2019 opinion testimony, did not contribute to the verdict in this case. <em>See Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 66, 21 A.3d 1048 (2011) (\u201cThe harmless error standard is highly favorable to the defendant, and \u2018the burden is on the State to show that [the error] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 and did not influence the outcome of the case\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 332, 941 A.2d 1107 (2008) (\u201c \u2018Once it has been determined that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). The evidence was used for the sole purpose of placing Payne and Bond near the scene of the kidnapping and shooting of Glen Stewart and the burning of his body. Because we believe the testimony was critical and we are unable to say that the error in admitting Detective Edward\u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Appellant Payne, in an argument incorporated by reference by Bond, asserts that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements from the wiretap recordings as statements of a co-conspirator in the coverup story suggesting Payne and Bond had an alibi, on the grounds that there was no evidence that he was part of that conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The State responds that the trial court properly admitted relevant evidence of appellants\u2019 efforts to conceal the evidence of their involvement in the murder as a statement by a co-conspirator of the party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy under Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(5). Alternatively, the statements were admissible as admissions made by each appellant as a party-opponent under Rule 5-803(a)(l), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>relevant for the purposes of demonstrating consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In reply, Payne asserts that he did not adopt Bond\u2019s statements and that these statements were not admissible to him as statements by a party opponent. He also contends the statements by Bond are prohibited by <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">This issue concerns the false alibi that Payne and Bond allegedly created by having Keller, as well as McCant, inform the police that these men, along with Johnson and Jones, were with Keller around the time of the murder. In December of 2007, according to Keller, Bond informed her in a telephone conversation as to what he had told the police and she later told Payne in person about what Bond told her. Keller testified that appellants knew that she had lied to the police about her running out of gas and appellants coming to her assistance on the night of the murder. Counsel for appellants objected to the State attempting to introduce taped statements of Keller\u2019s December 12, 2007 phone conversations with Bond and with Payne. During the phone conversation between Bond and Keller, Keller told Bond that she was on her way to Payne\u2019s house and the following is her account of their exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">[Bond]: Alright that\u2019s what\u2019s up, alright [inaudible] when, ah, when you want to talk cause the D\u2019s came to talk to me today. So they caught me at my job, you see what I\u2019m saying, so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">[Keller]: Alright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">[Bond]: So when you went to talk to them, you told them, you told them that the, we came to help you right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">[Keller]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">[Bond]: Alright you said you ran out of gas, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">[Keller]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-12\">[Bond]: Alrigh[t], that\u2019s what I was won ... I want to make sure the shit was cool. For real, for real.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-13\">[Keller]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>[Bond]: You ain\u2019t, you ain\u2019t</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">[Keller]: (Inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">[Bond]: Alright you ain\u2019t stay up there, none of that, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">[Keller]: Uh ... uh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">[Bond]: Naa, I\u2019m talking about that\u2019s what you told them, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">[Keller]: Oh, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">[Bond]: Alright, that\u2019s what\u2019s up, alright. I want to make sure I have this shit straight cause I ain\u2019t ... its been awhile, you see what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">[Keller]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">[Bond]: Alright, shit good you know what I mean, but when you get there tell Joey to call me see what I\u2019m saying, cause they, cause they, they ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">[Keller]: Okay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-13\">[Bond]: They basically, they basically asked me the same thing they asked ya\u2019ll and shit, you see what I\u2019m saying, what was ya\u2019ll doing and shit, I mean, they asked me some time and shit. I was like I don\u2019t know no times, yo, you give \u2018em the best you can, see what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-14\">[Keller]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-15\">[Bond]: I went ahead, I hit em\u2019 off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">[Keller]: That\u2019s what\u2019s up, alright yeah, that\u2019s what\u2019s up, yeah, that's what I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-18\">[Bond]: Yeah, that may help you out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-19\">[Keller]: Okay, right, I\u2019m a [...] I should be at his house probably like 15 minutes and I\u2019ll tell him what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-20\">[Bond]: What, what you be around somebody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-21\">[Keller]: Uh, uh, no, I just don\u2019t be, you know sayin [sic] nothing over the phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-22\">[Bond]: I can dig it, I can dig it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-23\">A few minutes after Bond\u2019s call to Keller, Keller called Payne, and she told him that \u201cJason just called me and they came to see him so umm I don\u2019t know if you ... inaudible ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>me to tell you when I get there or what\u2019s up.\u201d Payne told Keller to \u201cjust tell me when you get here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Arguing that the evidence- of Payne\u2019s \u201cparticipation in uncharged conspiracy\u201d was not established by a preponderance of the evidence, counsel for Payne asserted that the telephone conversation was inadmissible hearsay evidence. Counsel for Bond also objected on the basis that the statements improperly bolstered Keller\u2019s trial testimony. The State argued that the statements were admissible because McCant told Keller to lie and Keller \u201csaid the lie to the police and she knew that Jason [Bond] and Joey [Payne] were being investigated and that Tyrice [McCant] was being investigated and that they knew about this lie as well.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">The trial judge opined:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">I have no problem with proof of the conspiracy that creates\u2014to create some sort of coverup to deflect the police. She said she discussed it directly with Jason Bond, so I have no problem with preponderance of the evidence showing participation with Bond in that. The question that I think is the much closer call is whether there is sufficient evidence that Joseph Payne was a participant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">After the State reminded the court that Keller had indicated she spoke to Payne face-to-face, the court agreed that the evidence was that \u201cin December of 2007 she spoke to Jason and Joey; she talked to Jason on the phone about the lie she told the police; then she talked to Joe face-to-face about what she and Jason had just talked about.\u201d The court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">So, to prove by something other than statements is just virtually impossible to do. Seems to me on all the evidence before me that the players all knew that that was the story, and that is the genesis of conspiracy. She talked to them directly by phone with one; she talked to that other person face-to-face. I think that is sufficient foundation to allow the statements to come in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Keller\u2019s phone conversations with Bond and Payne were admitted into evidence over a continuing objection from coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>sel for both appellants. Keller testified at trial that Bond\u2019s reference to the \u201cD\u2019s\u201d meant \u201cdetectives.\u201d She also testified that she went to see Payne a few minutes after her phone call to him, and \u201ctold him about the conversation that me and Jason had[,]\u201d \u201c[bjecause I knew that they had\u2014that was what Jason wanted to call him about. I told him I would tell him.\u201d Keller also testified that, when she was subsequently interviewed by the police, she told the police \u201cthe truth,\u201d that \u201cthe boys did not come and fix my car that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The other five wiretap statements involved calls between Bond and Desmond Jones earlier on December 12, 2007. In those calls, admitted over objection, Jones told Bond about the police investigating the murder. Jones testified that, during those calls with Bond, they were \u201c[tjalking about what us supposed to say,\u201d \u201cabout the story [they] were going to give them\u201d regarding the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The question presented concerns the hearsay rule. Our standard of review is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">Hearsay, under our rules, must be excluded as evidence at trial, unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule excluding such evidence or is \u2018permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes.\u2019 Md. Rule 5-802. Thus, a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. Whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\"><em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 8, 887 A.2d 602 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Appellants rely on the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Rivenbark, </em>311 Md. 147, 158, 533 A.2d 271 (1987), which held that the statements \u201cmade in connection with acts of concealment performed long after the conspirators have realized all benefits from the offense which they had agreed to commit\u201d are inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">In that case, Rivenbark and Johnson, his accomplice, were charged with the May, 1981 felony murder and burglary of Johnson\u2019s aunt. On the day of the murder, Johnson\u2019s girlfriend, Shirley Wilson, met with Rivenbark, who told her: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cWe got our alibis ... As long as everyone stays cool everything will be fine[,]\u201d and he instructed Wilson to tell Johnson \u201cto make sure the stuff was gone.\u201d <em>Rivenbark, </em>311 Md. at 150-51, 533 A.2d 271. Six months later, after Wilson broke up with Johnson and informed police of Johnson\u2019s role in the murder, Wilson agreed to speak with Johnson while wearing a body wire. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 533 A.2d 271. Wilson \u201cmanaged to elicit from Johnson numerous statements in which he inculpated both himself and Rivenbark in [the] murder[,]\u201d which were introduced into evidence by the State at trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The issue was whether, under a well-established exception to the hearsay rule, a co-conspirator\u2019s statements made while the conspiracy is in effect and in furtherance of its aims are admissible against fellow conspirators. The principal question was whether, after the conspirators have attained their central objectives, there is an implied subsidiary conspiracy of concealment during which one co-conspirator can continue to bind his confederates with hearsay declarations. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 533 A.2d 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">We therefore agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the better reasoned cases reject the theory that every criminal conspiracy includes, by implication, a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal evidence of the substantive offense that the conspirators agreed to commit. Consequently, we adopt the Rrulewitch view that a co-conspirator\u2019s statement is inadmissible unless it was made before the attainment of the conspiracy\u2019s central objective. This is not to say that statements made in connection with acts of concealment are never admissible. As noted above, conspirators do not necessarily achieve their chief aim at the precise moment when every element of a substantive offense has occurred. Before the conspirators can be said to have successfully attained their main object, they often must take additional steps, <em>e.g., </em>fleeing, or disposing of the fruits and instrumentalities of crime. Such acts further the conspiracy by assisting the conspirators in realizing the benefits from the offense which they agreed to commit----Therefore, state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ments made in connection with such acts occur before the conspirators have attained their chief objective and are admissible.... On the other hand, it is necessary to distinguish statements made in connection with acts of concealment performed long after the conspirators have realized all benefits from the offense which they had agreed to commit. Such statements occur after the conspirators attained their principal aim and are, therefore, ordinarily inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0xx\"><em>Id. </em>at 158, 533 A.2d 271 (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">The <em>Rivenbark </em>Court observed that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">[I]f the conspirators expressly agree <em>at the outset </em>to engage in concerted acts of concealment after committing a substantive offense, then statements made in connection with those acts are admissible. In such a case, the conspirators\u2019 principal aim is not simply the successful completion of the substantive offense. Rather, by virtue of the actual agreement, their principal aim includes the acts of concealment as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added, citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The Court pointed out that the acts of disposal of the instrumentalities of the crime, <em>i.e., </em>when garbage men collected a plastic bag containing the shoestrings, ski cap and bloody gloves on May 25, 1981, were in furtherance of attaining the chief objective of the conspirators. By November 1981, however, the chief objective of the conspiracy to conceal the murder and burglary clearly had been achieved. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 533 A.2d 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The Court addressed the State\u2019s argument that the statements should be admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">The State also argues that Johnson and Rivenbark expressly conspired to conceal their offenses. In support of this contention, the State emphasizes the following facts which occurred in May 1981: Rivenbark\u2019s suggestion to Wilson that he and Johnson should not see one another for a while; Rivenbark\u2019s statement to Wilson that \u201cWe got our alibis\u201d; Rivenbark\u2019s instruction to Johnson, communicated through Wilson, to \u201cmake sure the stuff was gone\u201d; John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>son\u2019s destruction of the shoestrings, the ski cap, and the bloody gloves; and Johnson\u2019s continued beatings of Wilson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">These facts are not sufficient to establish an express conspiracy of concealment extending to November 1981.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">The Court concluded that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">[wjhile Rivenbark\u2019s statement that \u201cWe got our alibis,\u201d and Johnson\u2019s compliance with Rivenbark\u2019s order to \u201cmake sure the stuff was gone,\u201d may suggest an obvious understanding to conceal the crime soon after it happened, this evidence does not show an ongoing distinct and explicit agreement to conceal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 159, 533 A.2d 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">In this case, the kidnapping and murder of Glen Stewart occurred in the early morning hours of August 27, 2007. Keller told the false alibi story to the police sometime in early November. And, the conversations in which Bond and Keller confirmed that she told this story to the police occurred on December 12, 2007. There is no evidence in this case that there was an express agreement between the parties, <em>at the outset, </em>to engage in concerted acts of concealment after committing the kidnapping and murder. The chief objective of appellants in committing the substantive offenses of kidnapping and murder was to punish and/or retaliate against Stewart because they suspected him of reporting the robbery of Bland to the police. Because the recordings admitted into evidence were neither hearsay statements of an agreement entered into <em>at the outset of the substantive criminal event </em>nor an express agreement to conceal <em>in furtherance of attaining the chief objective, i.e., to silence </em>Stewart, the hearsay statements are inadmissible to establish an express conspiracy of concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Alternatively, the State contends that the wiretap recordings of Bond and Payne were admissible under Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Rule 5-803(a)(l),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">Hearsay exceptions: Unavailability of declarant not required</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">(a) Statement by party-opponent. A statement that is offered against a party and is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">(1) The party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or representative capacity; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">An admission of a party opponent is admissible because \u201can admission is a statement of pertinent facts which, in connection with proof of other facts, tends to prove guilt....\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>327 Md. 81, 88, 607 A.2d 923 (1992) (quoting <em>Holland v. State, </em>244 Md. 671, 673, 224 A.2d 864 (1966)). Professor McLain has explained what is meant by an \u201cadmission,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">The term \u201cadmission\u201d is misleading, in that it suggests that an out-of-court statement must have been against the party-opponent\u2019s interest at the time it was made in order for it to be admissible. This suggestion is compounded by frequent references to this hearsay exception as involving \u201cadmissions against interest.\u201d To the contrary, there is no requirement that the out-of-court statement have been against the party\u2019s interest at the time it was made; it even may have been self-serving then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">The hearsay exception thus is better termed \u201cstatements of a party-opponent,\u201d because the only requirements for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>qualification of a statement under it are that (1) the statement was made, adopted, or authorized by a party or that party\u2019s agent or coconspirator; (2) the statement is offered in evidence against that party by an opposing party (it is not offered by the party who made the statement); and (3) as with all evidence, the statement must be relevant to a material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 801(4):1, at 96-97 (2001) (footnotes omitted); <em>see generally, </em>Murphy, <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>\u00a7 805, at 390 (4th ed. 2010) (\u201cUnder the \u2018admission\u2019 exception, the plaintiff can introduce against the defendant anything that the defendant has said (or written, or done) which is helpful to the plaintiffs case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Here, we have no difficulty concluding that Bond\u2019s statements in the wiretaps were admissible against him as statements by a party opponent. If there is any problematic issue, that concerns whether those statements were also admissible against Payne. The only recording involving Payne is the last one between him and Keller. In that recording, Keller informs Payne that \u201cJason just called me and they came to see him so umm I don\u2019t know if you ... inaudible ... me to tell you when I get there or what\u2019s up,\u201d to which Payne replied, \u201cokay, just tell me when you get here.\u201d Keller testified at trial that, following this phone conversation, she went and saw Payne directly. At that time, she told Payne about her conversation earlier that day with Bond, inferentially referring to the conversation about maintaining the false alibi in the face of further police investigation. We are persuaded the statements were admissible as to each party. We also note that, during jury instructions, the trial court instructed the jury that it was to \u201cconsider the evidence as it relate[s] to each defendant separately and you must consider separately each offense charged against each defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Replying to this alternative theory, Payne raises the argument that Bond\u2019s statements were not admissible against him under <em>Bruton, supra. </em>Under <em>Bruton, </em>in a joint trial of co-defendants, the prosecution may not move into evidence the confession of a non-testifying defendant that inculpates a co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>defendant, even if the jury is given an appropriate limiting instruction. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 137, 88 S.Ct. 1620. This Court has explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><em>Bruton, </em>of course, was establishing the broad constitutional principle that curative instructions should not be relied upon to legitimate the admission of the confession of a non-testifying defendant at a joint trial, if in the course of that confession the confessor asserts that the codefendant also participated in the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><em>Williams v. State, </em>131 Md.App. 1, 39, 748 A.2d 1, <em>cert, denied, </em>359 Md. 335, 753 A.2d 1032 (2000)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">However, \u201cthere is a distinction between a confession and an admission in criminal cases in that a confession is a direct acknowledgment of guilt and an admission is a statement of pertinent facts which, in connection with proof of other facts, tends to prove guilt.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>244 Md. at 673, 224 A.2d 864. <em>Bruton </em>is distinguishable because the wiretap recordings in this case were admissions, at most reflecting a consciousness of guilt; they were not confessions to the murder. <em>Williams, supra, </em>is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">In this case, of course, we are not dealing with a <em>Brutonlike </em>assertion by the codefendant that the appellant actually participated in the crime. We are not dealing with the circumstance described by <em>Bruton </em>as one where \u201cthe powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial.\u201d 391 U.S. at 135-36 [88 S.Ct. 1620]. We are dealing, rather, with a statement by the codefendant that the codefendant\u2019s \u201cstepmother thought that [the appellant] did it.\u201d It is not even passing on the knowledge of or an observation by the stepmother but only her belief or suspicion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\"><em>Williams, </em>131 Md.App. at 39, 748 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Accordingly, we are persuaded that the wiretap recordings were admissible as to both Payne and Bond as statements of a party opponent. The trial court properly exercised its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>tion in admitting them, albeit on grounds different than argued by the parties at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellant Bond next assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial when the State elicited testimony from both McCant and Detective Barton that he asserts was inadmissible hearsay regarding the identity of the individuals who murdered Glen Stewart. The State initially responds by pointing out that the only motion for a mistrial came during Detective Barton\u2019s testimony and that Bond\u2019s appellate argument that the testimony was \u201chearsay,\u201d is too general for this Court to consider. Our consideration of this preliminary argument will not detain us for long because we conclude that the record from the trial is more than sufficient for us to address this question presented. On the merits, the State observes that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial. Because we agree that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in the matter, we concur with the State\u2019s argument on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">While the mistrial motion, ultimately concerning anonymous tips about the case, came during Detective Barton\u2019s testimony, the initial testimony about the tips came from the alleged tipster herself, Tyrice McCant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">[STATE]: In those calls\u2014let me ask you. In those calls did you name the individuals involved in the murder of Glen Stewart?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">[STATE]: What were the names you mentioned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">THE COURT: Come on up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">At a bench conference, both defense counsel objected on the grounds of hearsay. The court agreed, informing the State, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Part of the problem is\u2014the problem with this is it\u2019s admissible to say what the police do, how they got a lead and why they acted on it. It\u2019s not admissible to prove that these people actually committed a murder because that couldn\u2019t be\u2014that would be hearsay. But it relates not to who committed the murder, it relates to when the police then acted at a later point in time. It relates to the testimony that is going to come.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">In addition, the following ensued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">THE COURT: Enough. Enough. You can\u2019t get into the substance of what she told because it is hearsay and it\u2019s based on things\u2014you can ask did she give the information. You can follow up with the detectives and what they did to follow up on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">[STATE]: I can ask about names?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">THE COURT: No. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">[STATE]: Not to provide but did you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">THE COURT: Did she, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: I would object to that. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper. First of all, she is not part of the investigation. She testifies. What did you do as far as. You can\u2019t do it. The law says you can\u2019t talk to a person, then receive information from that person, so then I did this and that. You can\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">[STATE]: Not names. I am asking the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">[PAYNE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, you realize 1 join in the objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-14\">THE COURT: I do realize that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">(The discussion at sidebar concluded.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-16\">[STATE]: I was asking you questions about the anonymous calls. In those anonymous calls, did you provide names of individuals in the murder of Glen Stewart?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-17\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">At a later point in the trial, Detective Barton testified that, during the course of his investigation into the murder of Glen Stewart, he received anonymous telephone calls in the late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>summer of 2007 from a female who contacted the police \u201cout of the blue.\u201d The following testimony was elicited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">[STATE]: Now, during your investigation while you are looking at cell phone records, does there come a time when you receive an anonymous call or your office receives anonymous calls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">[STATE]: Are these anonymous calls in connection with your investigation of the murder of Glen Stewart?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">[BOND\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">THE COURT: Overruled.

Bond claims that the above quoted testimony, as well as the further testimony concerning the police investigation of the codefendants, was inadmissible hearsay, and that the court erred in denying the motion for a mistrial. The Court of Appeals, in <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>583 A.2d 218 (1990), explained that the grant of a motion for mistrial is reserved for only circumstances in which a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury has been compromised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL2\">[T]he declaration of a mistrial is an extraordinary act which should only be granted if necessary to serve the ends of justice. <em>Jones [v. State], </em>310 Md. 569, 587 [530 A.2d 743 (1987) ]. This Court has recognized that granting a motion for a mistrial lies within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Poole v. State, </em>295 Md. 167, 183 [453 A.2d 1218] (1983). The trial judge, who hears the entire case and can weigh the danger of prejudice arising from improper testimony, is in the best position to determine if the extraordinary remedy of a mistrial is appropriate. We will not reverse a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial unless the defendant was so clearly prejudiced that the denial constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 516 [495 A.2d 1] (1985), <em>cert, denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986) <em>(Johnson II).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 422, 583 A.2d 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As this Court recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201cThe [trial] judge is physically on the scene, able to observe matters not usually reflected in a cold record. The judge is able to ascertain the demeanor of the witnesses and to note the reaction of the jurors and counsel to inadmissible matters. That is to say, the judge has his finger on the pulse of the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\"><em>Washington v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 48, 103, 990 A.2d 549 (quoting <em>State v.

The general rule for the admission of nonhearsay is as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>Parker v. State, </em>408 Md. 428, 438, 970 A.2d 320 (2009) (quoting <em>Graves v. State, </em>334 Md. 30, 38, 637 A.2d 1197 (1994)); <em>see also Conyers v.

The testimony was simply that names were given to the police. As we stated in a case concerning statements made by an interviewee, as opposed to an anonymous tipster:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">As the trial court correctly reasoned, what the officer \u201cdraws upon to make his decisions as an investigator as to arrest or not arrest, is not to adhere to the same rules that we do here.\u201d In other words, an interviewee\u2019s statements to an investigating police officer are not \u201chearsay\u201d unless and until they are offered into evidence for their truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB\"><em>Daniel, </em>132 Md.App. at 589, 753 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Moreover, even assuming that the jury could infer that the anonymous caller identified appellants in her telephone call, the fact that the trial judge gave a curative instruction to the jury and admonished that \u201c[a]ny remarks as to the content of that call is stricken\u201d weighs heavily in our determination of prejudice, <em>vel non, </em>to appellants. This is particularly true in light of the presumption that, when curative instructions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>given, a jury can and will follow them. <em>Brooks v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 355, 360, 584 A.2d 82 (1991); <em>see also Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 160, 872 A.2d 25 (2005) (\u201cMaryland courts long have subscribed to the presumption that juries are able to follow the instructions given to them by the trial judge, particularly where the record reveals no overt act on the jury\u2019s part to the contrary\u201d). The court did not err in denying the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\">.

Although Detective Barton also offered testimony that put appellants' cell phones near the crime scene on the night of the murder, arguably without a timely objection or motion to strike, the State does not argue that this issue is not preserved.
