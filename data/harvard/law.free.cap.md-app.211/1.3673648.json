Appellees and cross-appellants M. Hasip Tuzeer et al. (\u201cNeighbors\u201d) appeal the circuit court\u2019s judgment that the liquor license is still active and that the Board had the authority to reconsider an earlier decision it made denying the license transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">We conclude that the liquor license was still active and therefore subject to transfer. We also find that the Board had the authority to both accept transfer and renewal applications for the license and reconsider its decision to deny the license transfer. However, we remand to the Board for further factfinding on whether D\u2019Souza complies with the requirement that an applicant for a license be a taxpayer of Baltimore City and for consideration of a newly enacted law that affects the requirement that applicants be registered voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">YIM owns a property at 123-129 West 27th Street in Baltimore City that has been used as a restaurant for over fifty years. This property comprises two separately addressed but attached buildings: 127 West 27th Street, where the disputed restaurant is located, and 123 West 27th Street, which houses a bakery run by D\u2019Souza.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Two Sisters, LLC (\u201cTwo Sisters\u201d) rented 127 West 27th Street from YIM in 2007 and operated a restaurant there. It applied for and received its 2007 liquor license, for May 1, 2007 to April 30, 2008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Two Sisters did not apply to renew this license before April 30, 2008. On May 22, 2008, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the Liquor Board wrote Two Sisters and informed it that the Board had \u201cnot received or processed a 2008 renewal application for your location.\u201d The same letter indicated that \u201cArticle 2B, Section 10-504(d) provides that when an establishment has been closed for 180 days ... the license dies by operation of law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two Sisters subsequently closed and vacated the premises on May 30, 2008. The Liquor Board sent Two Sisters another letter on August 5, 2008, in which it notified the entity that the liquor license \u201chas not been renewed and will not be renewed until there is a payment of the $1,500 late fee.\u201d The Board advised Two Sisters that it must \u201cresolve the status of this license and at least file a 2008 renewal application\u201d if it was interested in selling the liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Counsel for YIM<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Two Sisters filed a Petition for Hardship Extension on October 27, 2008. The Liquor Board held a hearing on the hardship extension request on December 11, 2008, and granted an extension of the life of the license for 180 days from December 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Two Sisters also submitted a license renewal application in late October 2008, which the Liquor Board received on or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>about October 31, 2008. Some time after the application, Two Sisters received a license for May 1, 2008 to April 30, 2009.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the fees for the 2008 were apparently paid late. In March 2009, the Board informed counsel for YIM and Two Sisters that \u201cit is necessary that all outstanding 2008 license fees be paid before a renewal application will be accepted for this location.\u201d The Board sent YIM\u2019s counsel another letter on May 29, 2009, in which the Board wrote that \u201cwe cannot verify payment of the 2008 license fee.\u201d The 2008 license fee was eventually paid on June 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Two Sisters next filed a Transfer Authorization on February 18, 2009, to transfer its liquor license to Mid Atlantic Capital Holding (\u201cMid Atlantic\u201d), another restaurant operator that was planning to open a restaurant at 127 West 27th Street. Neither Two Sisters nor Mid Atlantic had filed a renewal application by the following month, and so in a letter dated March 26, the Board reminded counsel for YIM that no action had been taken on the liquor license since the December 11 hearing. The Board indicated that \u201cthe renewal application must be in this office by March 31, 2009.\u201d Two Sisters subsequently filed a 2009 renewal application for the liquor license.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On April 21, 2009, Mid Atlantic also submitted an application to the Board for a liquor license at 127 West 27th Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">A conference on the Two Sisters-Mid Atlantic license transfer was scheduled before the Board for June 4, 2009, but was postponed at the parties\u2019 request.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Counsel for YIM next filed a second hardship extension request on June 8, 2009. The summer apparently passed without any further progress on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the license transfer, and on September 30, 2009, the Board inquired about the status of the license in a letter to Mid Atlantic. The Board -wrote that \u201cif we do not hear from you within the next ten (10) business days, your application will be voided. Since this is an inactive license, this would mean that this license will expire by operation of law.\u201d There was apparently no further action on the license on behalf of Mid Atlantic.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Instead, on October 13, 2009, D\u2019Souza filed an application for a liquor license on behalf of Gluten Free, LLC (\u201cGluten Free\u201d) for 127 West 27th Street. He also filed an application to transfer the liquor license from Two Sisters on November 13, 2009, as well as a license renewal application on March 24, 2010. On March 31, 2010, counsel for YIM submitted a Transfer Authorization form signed by the owners of Two Sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">II. Liquor Board Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Once all the parties were in place, following D\u2019Souza\u2019s substitution on the roster, they then proceeded to have three hearings before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">A. May 27, 2010 Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The first hearing on May 27, 2010, \u201cconcern[ed] the status of\u2019 Two Sisters\u2019 liquor license \u201cwhere a transfer to [D\u2019Souza] at the same location is pending.\u201d The Board heard argument from the Neighbors, the Charles Village Community Association (\u201cCVCA\u201d), YIM, and D\u2019Souza, as well as testimony from two witnesses on behalf of the Neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">The Neighbors\u2019 position was that the license was \u201cdead\u201d and not subject to transfer because it automatically expired 180 days after Two Sisters ceased doing business at the property on May 30, 2008. <em>See </em>Art. 2B, \u00a7 10-504(d)(2). The Neighbors also asserted that the license issued for May 1, 2008 to April 30, 2009, was a \u201cphantom license\u201d that could never have been issued to Two Sisters because of the entity\u2019s tax prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>lems.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They argued that the various documents reflecting approval of the license were fraudulent and that the license was dead. They further argued that the substitution of D\u2019Souza for Mid Atlantic on the transfer application could not toll the hardship extension period for the license and that the subsequent transfer application from D\u2019Souza was thus late under \u00a7 10\u2014504(d)(6).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">D\u2019Souza countered that the license was still active because YIM submitted a hardship extension request within 180 days of May 30, 2008, on October 27, and filed a transfer application on April 21, 2009, within 180 days of the Board\u2019s granting of the hardship extension on December 11, 2008. He argued that the amendment of the transfer application, by replacing Mid Atlantic with his application, continued to toll the hardship extension period and kept the license alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">At the conclusion of argument from all parties, the Board found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">We at this time believe that the following facts were never in dispute. There was a hardship extension request hearing held here in City Hall in Room 215 on December 11th, 2008, wherein the Board granted a 180 day extension from that date for the transfer\u2014that is for the transfer of the license. There was some conflicting testimony as to what date the original hearing extension\u2014a hardship extension request had been filed. [Counsel for YIM] is here and indicated it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>was filed October 27th, 2008. That\u2019s six weeks prior to the December 11th, 2008, hardship extension request hearing. That would seem to be a reasonable date that that was filed. It is uncontroverted, I believe, that the premises did close on or about May 30th, 2008. It is also not controverted that April 21st, 2009, a[n] application to transfer this license was indeed filed. It was filed in the name of David Weishaus and Kelly [McNamee] [for Mid Atlantic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">There was a June 4th, 2009 scheduled transfer conference before this Board. The hearing was postponed at that time for an opportunity for both sides to meet. There was never a public hearing again on the transfer conference for reasons not fully in our realm of understanding. But, for whatever reason, the transfer conference did not go through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">June 8th, 2009, we have [YIM] and our own court file with the filed stamped \u201ccopy\u201d in our file indicating what looks like a carbon copy, second hardship extension request filed on or about June 8th. The Board believes that that is a\u2014 that that would be a consistent action on the part of [YIM\u2019s counsel], that is, a June 4th hearing where [the parties] asked to step back and talk, and out of an abundance of caution, [counsel] files a second hardship extension request on June 8th just in case the negotiations break down and the license is\u2014the transfer is denied, that he would have a backup to keep the license alive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The Board then ruled on two issues: the viability of the license and whether YIM withdrew or amended its application for a license transfer when it sought to replace Mid Atlantic with D\u2019Souza. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">One is[:] was there an opportunity for this license to die from May 30th, 2008 up until June 2009. And the Board believes that by the filing of the first hardship extension request, by the Board granting 180 days on or about December 11 th, 2008, and by the subsequent filing of both or either the transfer application on April 21st with a second hardship extension on June 8th, that in both cases the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>license was certainly alive under those circumstances, in our petition [sic], based on 10-504(d)(2)(i) and (ii) and (iii). The next issue comes to the issue of a withdrawal of a petition. Based on [YIM\u2019s counsel\u2019s] argument, he filed an amendment to the application in good faith when dealing with the Community Association to remove an objectionable owner rather than\u2014the petition was not -withdrawn, it was amended. That\u2019s what the Board finds, that the petition was not -withdrawn by the October 18th, 2009 amendments thereto. So the Board finds there was no withdrawal of the petition, just an amendment, and that under 10\u2014504(d), and the Board\u2019s determination of December 11th, 2009, that this license, as a matter of law, is active.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The Neighbors filed a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the circuit court on June 28, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">B. June 24, 2010 Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The Liquor Board held a second hearing on June 24, 2010, this time about D\u2019Souza\u2019s application to transfer ownership of the liquor license \u201cwhere [the transferor] establishment has been closed for more than 90 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The Neighbors first raised several preliminary motions: \u201ca motion to dismiss the October 13, 2009, [and] the April 21, 2009 transfer applications, a motion to strike the March 2010 renewal application, a motion to strike the March 2009 renewal application, [and] a motion to strike the June 8, 2009 hardship extension request.\u201d They argued that \u201cfraud and total misrepresentation\u201d tainted all of the applications. The Board denied all of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The Neighbors\u2019 arguments at the hearing centered on the lack of neighborhood support for the liquor license and the deficiencies of the license applications. They called over a half-dozen witnesses who testified extensively about their concerns about the restaurant receiving a liquor license, particularly regarding the restaurant\u2019s operating hours, the potential for crowds, and the effect on parking in the area. Regarding the alleged deficiencies in the applications, the Neighbors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>argued that the October 13, 2009 transfer application was \u201cnoncompliant\u201d because neither D\u2019Souza nor his co-applicant<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cidentifie[d] any property on which he pays taxes in his individual name as required by Article 2B,\u201d nor did the application list which applicant is a city taxpayer. <em>See \u00a7 </em>9-101(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The Neighbors also asserted that both the Baltimore City and Baltimore County Boards of Elections had failed to locate D\u2019Souza \u201canywhere on the voting rolls of the State of Maryland.\u201d A witness for the Neighbors testified that she had obtained a copy of the voter registration lists for the legislative district that covers D\u2019Souza\u2019s home address. She said that she had printed the alphabetical listing of voters from the end of the letter C to the beginning of the letter E and that D\u2019Souza\u2019s name was not on the list. However, the Board chairman later stated that he did not take the voter registration lists as seriously as the Neighbors did because, in essence, he did not find them reliable. He explained that he had purchased a similar list before, when he ran for office, and that the list \u201cwas terrible. People had died 10 years ago, I went and knocked on their door, people who had never lived there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">D\u2019Souza testified that although he had not registered to vote, he believed that he had been registered automatically once he became a United States citizen.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When asked to confirm that he asserted on his license application that he was a \u201cresident or taxpayer of Baltimore City for more than two years,\u201d D\u2019Souza stated that this information was still true. On cross-examination, however, he admitted that he did not know if he was registered to vote as of that date and that he had never voted. He also testified that he resided at his home with his wife, in whose name the property was listed. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>stated that he did not pay property tax in his own name, though he also testified that he paid \u201cMaryland personal property taxes, federal taxes, FICA, all that\u201d for both the bakery business that he owned and another warehouse facility in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">D\u2019Souza introduced copies of 47 emails in support of his restaurant, as well as about 1,000 signatures in support of his liquor license application. He testified that he was familiar with the neighborhood because of the bakery he already operated there and that many of the neighbors supported his application. These same \u201cneighbors want[ed] [him] to open the [restaurant] so they could sit down and eat\u201d and signed a petition in support of his application. D\u2019Souza explained that he \u201cwant[ed] to do right by the neighbors\u201d and work with them to get them to support his restaurant. However, on cross-examination, D\u2019Souza also testified that he had not made any compromises when it came to dealing with the neighborhood and that he had not committed to limiting the restaurant\u2019s hours, as requested by the neighborhood association. In fact, D\u2019Souza testified that he was not willing to accept any limitations on the restaurant\u2019s operating hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Following argument from all parties, the Board summarized the facts presented at the hearing and made an oral ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">We hear that there could be parking problems and noise problems as testified to by Sharon Guida from the community. We understand that Mr. D\u2019Souza was willing to put in security. We believe that there is a unique service and product to be offered by Mr. D\u2019Souza\u2019s business....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">We don\u2019t dispute that if you\u2019re going to be open until 2 a.m. you\u2019re probably going to sell more alcohol than food, but we hear it again and again ... that parking is a continuous problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">The proximity to Hopkins certainly makes the Board believe that a young crowd could be attracted to the bar. We have the issue, therefore, as to what we believe is the issue in this case is there a public need and desire for this license.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>We have to determine what is the public need and what is the public desire. We cannot determine that there is a public need and desire at this point for this transfer to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">I also want to note that Mr. D\u2019Souza\u2014he said it, I wrote it down, I didn\u2019t make it up\u2014he said, I\u2019ve given them a chance to support us\u2014and he was asked and cross-examined by [counsel for the Community Association]\u2014but he said about the community associations, I\u2019ve given them a chance to support us. And then he said, I\u2019ve given them four chances. And then he said, I want to do it right by the neighbors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3i\">I\u2019m afraid that that\u2014that attitude might be incendiary. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s upset because he believes that he\u2019s given the neighbors\u2014he\u2019s done everything they\u2019ve asked and still they won\u2019t, they won\u2019t give him a blessing or if his attitude turned the neighbors off long ago. But he\u2019s said specifically I\u2019ve given them a chance to support us and I\u2014and this Board believes it should be the other way around. And that is the business\u2014or the community should be the ones getting the benefit of the doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">They\u2019re\u2014the licensees are in fact in business to make money; that is undisputed. And we believe that, based on what we have in the record, the letters from the community associations\u2014community associations represent hundreds, sometimes thousands, of residents. And if they don\u2019t speak for the public, then who does?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">Based on the testimony and exhibits, therefore, we do find that we do not determine a public need and desire for this license. We will fail\u2014we will deny the transfer in this case____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">As I say, we have easily conceded the uniqueness of products. We do determine on the fourth factor, that the parking has been testified to all day and we don\u2019t live on Howard Street and 27th. And we\u2019re not going to substitute our parking judgment for them, for the neighbors. The neighbors have unequivocally testified that parking is a nightmare in that neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>When asked to clarify what statutory base the Board was relying on, one of the commissioners said \u201c10-202(a), public need and desire.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">On July 2, 2010, the Neighbors sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the circuit court. On July 15, 2010, counsel for D\u2019Souza and Gluten Free sent the Board a letter requesting that it reconsider the decision denying the transfer application. The letter focused on the community support for the liquor license, particularly if D\u2019Souza agreed to time restrictions on the sale of alcohol. The Neighbors opposed the request for reconsideration in a letter on July 26, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>that the Board\u2019s June decision was final and not subject to reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">C. August 12, 2010 Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The Board ultimately scheduled a hearing on August 12, 2010 to consider the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The Neighbors first argued that the hearing should not proceed, claiming that the Board did not have jurisdiction to reconsider the application. They asserted that because there had already been an appeal to the circuit court over the June hearing, the Board could not reconsider anything. The Board denied the Neighbors\u2019 motion, finding that its June 24 decision was \u201cnot a final decision.\u201d According to the Board, because that decision was not final, the Board retained jurisdiction to hear a motion for reconsideration. The Board also determined that D\u2019Souza was not prevented from seeking reconsideration under \u00a7 10-208(c),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which would otherwise impose a six-month restriction on re-application, because the June 24 decision was not final. The Board also rejected the Neighbors\u2019 motion for a stay on the grounds that the circuit court and this Court were considering the issue. The Board found that the petitions for judicial review were filed prematurely and therefore did not divest it of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">D\u2019Souza advised the Board that since the June 24 hearing, he had entered into an agreement with two of the community associations regarding the operating hours for the restaurant. The Board received a copy of the agreement, which indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>that D\u2019Souza\u2019s restaurant would stop selling alcohol at 10:30 p.m. on weeknights and 12:30 a.m. on weekends. The agreement also required D\u2019Souza to get the community associations\u2019 permission to add any other operator or manager to the establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">After a brief hearing, the Board ruled on the motion to reconsider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">The Board did in fact consider the motion of [D\u2019Souza\u2019s counsel] which was timely tiled before the 30 day period. The Board\u2019s decision was not a final one, it does have the power to exercise revisions to its interim orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">Based upon the petition\u2014it was pointed out to us after a 4-1/2 hours hearing on this very matter, we have deliberated for about 5 minutes before denying it, the request\u2014we really did not get a chance to completely delve into the numerous petitions, both for and against the request. Of note though, were the petitions, although pointed out by counsel in closing arguments at the June 24th hearing, a lot of community support within the neighboring 3 blocks was on this petition. It was buried within and it was difficult for the Board to piece together. On reconsideration, obviously, a motion was filed with\u2014highlighting the neighbors with the most proximity to the proposed location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">The Board also considered, and [YIM] argued, the really extreme unique nature of services and products to be offered by this business. This Board is required under 10-202(a) to in fact consider such requests. We routinely grant licenses where potential uniqueness may be dubious. Beer is beer, wine is wine, liquor is liquor. Not in this case. In this case, gluten-free products, including gluten-free alcohol, may not be available anywhere else in the city or the region. So we see an extreme uniqueness of products to be offered. With the only piece of new evidence that was submitted today, which we consider a stipulation, or at least an agreement\u2014a stipulation between three of the parties and their attorneys involved\u2014we\u2019ve accepted an agreement from Charles Village Civic Association, Greater Remington Im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>provement Association, and the property owner of 127 West 27th Street. Therein, the Licensee, Mr.\u2014or the Applicant, Mr. D\u2019Souza, has agreed that he will stop the sale and service of alcohol at 10:30 p.m. on Sunday nights through Thursday nights, no new patrons entering after 11, and the premises being shuttered by 11:30. He\u2019s also agreed that there will be no alcohol sold or served after 12:30 a.m., and that the premises will be shuttered by 1:00 a.m. with no patron re-entry----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">Based on all those facts, the Board does in fact reconsider [its] decision of June 24th, 2010, finding by the agreement ... and the petition which was in evidence at the original hearing, that there is a public need and desire, a <em>de minim-is </em>impact on existing licensees, a negligible impact on general health, safety and welfare, including crime, traffic and parking, and certainly a potential uniqueness of services and products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">So we will grant this transfer application to Mr. D\u2019Souza subject to the strict enforcement of the terms and conditions of the agreement between CVCA, GRIA and the property owner and Licensee at 127 West 27th Street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The Neighbors filed a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the circuit court on August 20, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">III. Circuit Court Actions</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The three petitions for judicial review were consolidated into a single action at the circuit court. The court heard additional evidence in the form of testimony from Jane Schroeder, the executive secretary for the Liquor Board. She testified regarding the Board\u2019s practices and procedures, particularly with regard to the renewal process for licenses and the Board\u2019s practice of automatically preparing licenses each year but not releasing them until all the appropriate fees and paperwork were in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">After hearing argument from all parties, the court concluded that the liquor license was still active and subject to transfer; that although the Board\u2019s order from June 2010 was final, the six-month restriction on reapplying in \u00a7 10-208(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>applied only to new license applications, not transfer applications like D\u2019Souza\u2019s; and that the Board\u2019s decision to grant the license transfer was invalid because there was not substantial evidence of D\u2019Souza\u2019s compliance with the voter registration requirements of \u00a7 9-101(c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court expressed no view on the issue of whether D\u2019Souza was a taxpayer of Baltimore City as required by this provision. The court also observed that \u201c[cjounsel for [D\u2019Souza] argued that [\u00a7 9-101(c) ] violates the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, but no authority for this argument was submitted.\u201d YIM, D\u2019Souza, and the Neighbors each filed Motions to Alter or Amend Judgment, and all of the motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">YIM filed a Notice of Appeal on June 29, 2011. D\u2019Souza filed his own Notice of Appeal on July 18, 2011, and the Neighbors filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal on July 21, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Given that the parties cannot agree on whether the subject of this appeal, the liquor license for 127 West 27th Street, is alive or dead, it is no surprise that they present radically different descriptions of the issues before this Court. Appellants YIM, D\u2019Souza,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the Liquor Boards<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> focus on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>validity of the Board\u2019s decision to grant the license transfer, and D\u2019Souza contends that the voter registration requirement is unconstitutional. By contrast, the Neighbors,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> as cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>appellants, vigorously dispute the existence of any liquor license for 127 West 27th Street since April 30, 2008, and challenge many of the actions the Board has taken. For these reasons, we have consolidated and recast the various issues presented and address the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">1. Did the expiration of the 2007-08 license on April 30, 2008, preclude the Board from considering a renewal application filed in October 2008?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">2. Did the Board err by accepting incomplete liquor license applications and permitting later amendments of those applications?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">3. Was the Board authorized to accept the license renewal applications filed in 2009 and 2010?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">4. Did the Board have the authority to reconsider its June 2010 decision, and was its subsequent reversal of that decision supported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\"><em>5. </em>Do the requirements of \u00a7 9-101(c) that an applicant be a registered voter and a taxpayer in Baltimore City prevent D\u2019Souza from receiving a liquor license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">6. Is the registered voter requirement unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection of the laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">7. Are the Neighbors entitled to the costs of preparing the transcripts from the Board\u2019s hearings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">We find that: (1) the expiration of the 2007-08 license did not preclude the Board from considering a renewal application; (2) the Board was authorized to accept incomplete applications and amendments of those applications; (3) the Board was likewise authorized to accept license renewal applications; (4) the Board had the authority to reconsider its June 2010 decision and the subsequent reversal of that decision was supported by substantial evidence; (5) further Board action is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>necessary to consider a new law on the registered voter requirement of \u00a7 9\u2014101(c) and to determine D\u2019Souza\u2019s compliance with the city taxpayer requirement of \u00a7 9-101(c); (6) D\u2019Souza did not preserve the equal protection argument, nor does he have standing to raise it; and (7) the Neighbors are not entitled to the costs of preparing the transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The standard for appellate review of an administrative agency decision differs depending on whether agency factfinding or law determinations are under attack. Where a factual question or a discretionary judgment is concerned, the reviewing court will uphold an agency\u2019s decision so long as it is \u201csupported reasonably by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>HNS Dev., LLC v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>425 Md. 436, 449, 42 A.3d 12 (2012) (Internal quotations and citations omitted). Review of an agency\u2019s conclusions of law is less deferential but often gives \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers\u201d as well as respect for \u201cthe expertise of the agency in its own field.\u201d <em>Thanner Enters., LLC v. Balt. County, </em>414 Md. 265, 275, 995 A.2d 257 (2010) (Internal quotations omitted). When a statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we \u201cgenerally give[] considerable weight to the agency\u2019s view\u201d and implementation of the ambiguous statute. <em>Opert v. Crim. Injuries Comp. Bd., </em>403 Md. 587, 593-94, 943 A.2d 1229 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Because the parties disagree on the validity of many Board actions taken at nearly every step of the process, determining the status of the license first requires untangling all of the threads of this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The Neighbors argue that the license for 127 West 27th Street expired as a matter of law in April 2008 and that any Board action taken to extend the life of the license was invalid. Accordingly, they contend that the Board did not have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>authority to accept the various renewal and transfer applications in October 2008 and April and October 2009. They further assert that, even if the license did not expire, the renewal applications filed in 2009 and 2010 were inadequate and could not toll the expiration period for license renewals. They also contend that the Board\u2019s decision denying the transfer in June 2010 was final, precluding its reconsideration of the decision in August 2010, and that the subsequent reversal of the June 2010 ruling was not supported by substantial evidence. Finally, the Neighbors assert that they are entitled to the costs of preparing the transcripts of the Board\u2019s proceedings on June 24, 2010 and August 12, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">YIM, D\u2019Souza, and the Board focus their arguments on the circuit court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s actions. They assert that the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and that the circuit court erred when it reviewed the evidence before the Board and reached a different conclusion on the issue of D\u2019Souza\u2019s voter registration status. D\u2019Souza and YIM also argue that the voter registration requirement violates equal protection. Although the Board makes no arguments on the merits of this constitutional contention, it asserts that this case should be remanded to the Board so that it can consider the impact of a new law that appears to eliminate the voter registration requirement for a Baltimore City licensee like D\u2019Souza.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">I. Life of the License</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">We first consider whether the 2007-08 license \u201cdied\u201d when it expired by statute on April 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">A. Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Several provisions of Article 2B apply to a situation like this one, where an ostensible license renewal application is submitted on behalf of a business that is no longer active. First, a license-holder seeking to renew a liquor license \u201cshall, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days before the first day of May of each and every year, file a written application ... for the renewal of the license.\u201d \u00a7 10-301(a)(l)(i). In other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>renewal applications should be submitted between March 1 and March 31. \u00a7 10\u2014301(j)(2)(i) (local Baltimore City renewal provisions). In Baltimore City, the Board may reject or charge a fee of $50 per day, up to $1500, for late applications. \u00a7 10\u2014301(j)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Separate statutory provisions apply when a license-holding business closes or vacates the premises. The general rule is that a license expires ten days \u201cafter the holder of any license ... has vacated, or been evicted from the premises for which the license has issued ... unless an application for approval of a transfer to another location or assignment to another person ... has been approved or is pending.\u201d \u00a7 10-504(a). In Baltimore City, however, other provisions apply. A Baltimore City license expires 180 days after \u201cthe holder of any license ... has closed the business or ceased active alcoholic beverages business operations\u201d unless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">(i) An application for approval of a transfer to another location or an application for assignment to another person ... has been approved or is then pending;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">(ii) An application [for continuation of the business following the death of the licensee] has been approved or is then pending; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">(iii) A written request for a hardship extension, as provided in this subsection, is filed within the 180-day period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u00a7 10-504(d)(2). The licensee or \u201cother appropriate interested parties\u201d may also seek a hardship extension, which, if granted, may extend the license up to \u201c360 days after the date of the closing or cessation of alcoholic beverages business operations of the business.\u201d \u00a7 10-504(d)(3); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 10-504(d)(4) (after finding that undue hardship exists, \u201cthe Board may grant an extension of the life of the license for a time period not to exceed 360 days\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Perhaps recognizing that the local Baltimore City provisions of \u00a7 10-504(d) might complicate interpretation, the Legislature set out its intent in paragraph (5):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">It is the intent of this subsection that the total time period for which a license may be deemed unexpired ... is 180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>days if no undue hardship extension is granted, and no more than 360 days if an undue hardship extension has been granted. The time period begins at the earlier of the closing of the business or cessation of alcoholic beverages business, and shall be tolled only upon the filing of a [transfer application or hardship extension request], the expiration period to begin running again, cumulatively to the time period before the filing of the application or request, upon the occurrence of the later to occur of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">(i) Final action of the Board granting or denying a [hardship extension] request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">(ii) Final action of the Board denying [a transfer] application ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">(iii) Final judgment of the appellate court when judicial review of the Board\u2019s action on [a hardship extension request or transfer] application ... has been sought, or on dismissal of a petition for judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The time periods are thus tolled if an application for transfer or a hardship extension request is pending. \u00a7 10\u2014504(d)(5). The time periods expire upon the later of final action by the Board on a hardship extension request or a transfer request, or final judgment of the appellate court when judicial review is sought. \u00a7\u00a7 10\u2014504(d)(5)(i)\u2014(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">B. The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The Neighbors\u2019 position is that the Board lacked all authority to renew the license. First, they argue that the hardship extension provisions of \u00a7 10-504(d) do not apply to 127 West 27th Street because there was no license to transfer or grant a hardship extension for once the 2007-08 license expired. They next assert that even if \u00a7 10-504(d) applies, it is abrogated by the automatic ten-day expiration procedure of \u00a7 10-504(a), meaning that the license expired ten days after Two Sisters vacated the premises on May 30, 2008. Finally, they contend that the late fee provisions of \u00a7 10\u2014301(j)(2) cannot \u201ccure\u201d a late application.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The Board argues in response that \u00a7 10\u2014504(d)(2)(iii) \u201cexpressly permits a license in Baltimore City to be extended by a hardship application filed within 180 days after the cessation of active alcoholic beverages operations.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It also disputes the Neighbors\u2019 contention that \u00a7 10-504(a) overrides \u00a7 10-504(d), arguing that the local provisions of \u00a7 10-504(d) should prevail over the general provisions of \u00a7 10-504(a). Finally, the Board relies on its express statutory power to impose a f\u00edne on late applicants (instead of rejecting the application) and its longstanding practice of accepting late applications as support for its assertion that applications are not dead even if they are not filed by April 30. Indeed, the Board asserts that it has not \u201crejected a liquor license renewal application because it was not filed in a timely manner\u201d since 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The Neighbors and the Board present different interpretations of several provisions of Article 2B, making this a question of statutory construction. Analysis of a statute frequently requires consideration of three factors: (1) text; (2) purpose; and (3) consequences. <em>Buckley v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>207 Md.App. 574, 584-85, 53 A.3d 456 (2012), <em>cert, granted, </em>430 Md. 11, 59 A.3d 506, 2013 Md. LEXIS 68 (Jan. 18, 2013).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">Text is the plain language of the relevant provision, typically given its ordinary meaning, viewed in context, considered in light of the whole statute, and generally evaluated for ambiguity. Legislative purpose, either apparent from the text or gathered from external sources, often informs, if not controls, our reading of the statute. An examination of interpretive consequences, either as a comparison of the results of each proffered construction or as a principle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>avoidance of an absurd or unreasonable reading grounds the court\u2019s interpretation in reality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 585, 53 A.3d 456 (Citations omitted). When evaluating the text, purposes, and consequences, \u201cwe presume that the [legislature has acted with full knowledge of prior legislation, and construe the statute as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 420, 918 A.2d 470 (2006). However, we do not permit a \u201cpatent drafting error\u201d to frustrate the goal of a statute. <em>Kaczorowski v. Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 520, 525 A.2d 628 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">1. \u00a7 10-504(a) versus \u00a7 10-504(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Section 10-504 deals generally with \u201cvacation of premises\u201d and contains general and local provisions that set out how and when a license expires if a licensee stops selling alcohol, closes the business, or vacates or is evicted from the premises. In Baltimore City, a \u201clicensee or other appropriate interested parties\u201d may file a hardship extension request with the Board, to extend \u201cthe life of the license due to undue hardship,\u201d for up to \u201c360 days after the date of closing or cessation of alcoholic beverages business operations of the business for which the license is held.\u201d \u00a7 10-504(d)(4). Any hardship extension request must be tiled within 180 days after the business is closed or has stopped selling alcoholic beverages. \u00a7 10-504(d)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\"> However, neither the exact nature of the relief afforded by the hardship extension nor the type of licenses to which it applies is fully detailed in the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s understanding of the relief that it may grant after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>finding undue hardship apparently includes extending the life of an unexpired but inactive license\u2014such as when a restaurant operator holds a valid license but stops selling alcohol\u2014as well as an inactive and statutorily expired license, like the license in this case. Section 10-504(d) does not explicitly apply to licenses after their statutory expiration dates, but the Board\u2019s practice of applying the 180-day window to licenses after April 30, when combined with its practice of not actually issuing licenses until a licensee is in full compliance with all requirements, is neither \u201cagainst the public interest\u201d nor unreasonable under \u00a7 16\u2014101(e).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The hardship provisions of \u00a7 10\u2014504(d) therefore apply when a licensee seeks to extend the life of a license that has expired by statute, provided that the licensee makes the request within 180 days of the expiration date. Because Two Sisters filed a hardship extension request on October 27, 2008, exactly 180 days after Two Sisters ceased selling alcoholic beverages on April 30, 2008, the Board did not err by granting the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Finding that the hardship provisions of \u00a7 10-504(d) apply to this license, we now consider the Neighbors\u2019 argument that the general ten-day expiration period of subsection (a) for vacated premises overrides the Baltimore City provisions in subsection (d) for closed premises. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">First, we recognize that, by their terms, subsections 10-504(a) and (d) operate not in harmony but in dissonance. Subsection (d)\u2019s allowance of 180 days after a Baltimore City business has closed or ceased selling alcoholic beverages\u2014or 360 days if undue hardship is found\u2014is inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>shorter ten-day expiration period for license-holders that have \u201cvacated, or been evicted from the premises\u201d in subsection (a). \u00a7 10-504(a). Although subsection (a) has an explicit exception for Baltimore County, it does not have exceptions for any other localities. Reading subsection (a) alone, it thus appears that all liquor licenses automatically expire ten days after a license-holder vacates the premises. However, this does not take account of the separate provisions of subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Article 2B provides initial guidance: local provisions prevail over the general rules when there is \u201cconflict or inconsistency\u201d between the two. \u00a7 1-103; <em>see also </em>Md.Code, (1957, 2011 Repl.Vol.), Art. 1, \u00a7 13 (when a public general law and a public local law are in conflict, the public local law shall prevail); <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 63, 507 A.2d 172 (1986) (\u201cIt is well settled that when two statutes, one general and one specific, are found to conflict, the specific statute will be regarded as an exception to the general statute.\u201d). The preference for local statutes over general ones implicitly recognizes that, without such a policy choice, the local rules could easily be rendered mere surplus-age in some circumstances. For example, if a Baltimore City license-holder applied for a license transfer or a hardship extension, under \u00a7 10-504(d), but had also vacated the premises, that license would automatically expire ten days after the premises were vacated, regardless of the pending application. Yet there is no legislative intent that the transfer and hardship extension provisions of \u00a7 10-5Q4(d) only apply where the license-holder has <em>not </em>vacated the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The legislative history related to the various vacation and closure provisions of \u00a7 10-504 provides little guidance. The first exception to \u00a7 10-504(a) was introduced in 1979, when legislation expressly exempted Baltimore County from the ten-day expiration period and instead applied a 180-day time period for license expiration in the event of vacancy or eviction from the licensed premises.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The first Baltimore City excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>tion came into effect in 1998,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> with a law that permitted a license to be placed on \u201cdeposit\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> with the Baltimore City Liquor Board for up to 180 days, if the licensee experiences \u201cpersonal or financial hardship,\u201d has not been evicted from the licensed premises, and the premises are not used for any other business purpose. The new law also allowed for license expiration after 180 days if a transfer application was pending or had been approved. There were no amendments to \u00a7 10-504(a) and thus no exception for Baltimore City was written into that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The current text of the Baltimore City exception in \u00a7 10-504(d) dates back to Senate Bill 128 of the 2000 session.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> At a Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee hearing on SB 128, Senator George W. Della, Jr., the bill\u2019s sponsor, explained that the purpose of the bill was to combat the practice of some license-holders of applying and getting approval for license transfers but not actually transferring the license. The bill as introduced reflected this narrower intent: the proposed language affected only the transfer provisions of \u00a7 10-503. However, an amendment to the bill expanded its reach to the business closure provisions of \u00a7 10-504(d). The legislative history does not shed light on the reason for the amendment. The text of SB 128 as passed essentially mirrored the exception for Baltimore County then in effect.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Because of the identical nature of the City and County provisions, it appears that the Legislature intended for SB 128 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>to provide a different timeline for Baltimore City licenses than the generally applicable ten-day expiration period set out in \u00a7 10-504(a). Had the legislature explicitly included a Baltimore City exception, by amending subsection (a) to include Baltimore City, this conclusion would be undeniable. But the absence of an explicit exemption does not prevent us from concluding that subsection (d)\u2014the Baltimore City provision\u2014 was intended to supplant subsection (a)\u2014the general provision\u2014when it came to Baltimore City licenses, just as \u00a7 10-504(e) applies in Baltimore County but subsection (a) does not.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Finally, the meaning of \u201cvacated\u201d in \u00a7 10-504(a) is not helpful to the Neighbors in this case. In <em>Rupinski v. Biel, </em>43 Md.App. 635, 644, 406 A.2d 684 (1979), this Court found that vacation had occurred when the license-holder \u201cremoved all stock and inventory\u201d and \u201cleased the licensed premises to other businesses which were not related in any manner to an operation involving an alcoholic beverage license.\u201d Although Two Sisters left 127 West 27th Street on May 30, 2008, there was no evidence before the Board that they removed the restaurant fixtures when they left or that they had absolutely no intention of returning. Further, by seeking to transfer the license to a new restaurant tenant, Two Sisters was interested in a business \u201coperation involving an alcoholic beverage license,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 644, 406 A.2d 684, taking over the location.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Thus, we conclude that a Baltimore City license expires 180 days after \u201cthe holder of any license ... has closed the business or ceased active alcoholic beverages business operations.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-504(d)(2), (5). If a license-holder applies for and the Board grants an undue hardship extension request, that time period extends up to 360 days. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>504(d)(3)-(4). Subsection 10-504(a)\u2019s ten-day expiration period does not apply in Baltimore City because the local provisions of \u00a7 10-504(d) prevail over the general terms of subsection (a).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Therefore, Two Sisters\u2019 license did not expire ten days after it left the premises on May 30, 2008, because the Board accepted a hardship extension request within 180 days of Two Sisters\u2019 last day of active alcoholic beverages business, or April 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">2. Late Fee Provisions of \u00a7 10-301(j)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Section 10-301(j)(2) permits Baltimore City to charge a late fee for a late application instead of rejecting the application. According to the Neighbors, the $1,500 cap on the $50 per day late fee means that an application cannot be more than 30 days late. The Board argues in response that the $1,500 cap is merely a cap, not indicative of a deadline, and suggests that this Court should defer to the Board\u2019s thirty-year history of accepting applications more than thirty days after the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Although the policy embodied in Article 2B states that \u201cit is necessary to regulate and control the manufacture, sale, distribution, transportation and storage of alcoholic beverages within this State,\u201d \u00a7 l-101(a)(l), for the \u201cprotection, health, welfare and safety of the people of this State,\u201d <em>id. </em>at (4), the restrictive reading of \u00a7 10\u2014301(j)(2) that the Neighbors advocate is not necessary to effectuate this intent. Nowhere does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the statute mention a thirty-day deadline. Had the legislature wanted to impose such a deadline, it would have done so, in a clear and unambiguous manner. <em>Cf. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs v. Hollywood Prods., </em>344 Md. 2, 16-17, 684 A.2d 837 (1996) (noting that the \u201cGeneral Assembly\u2019s detailed regulation of the alcoholic beverages industry suggests that where [the General Assembly] intends a liquor board to have a particular enforcement mechanism at its disposal, it expressly provides for it by statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Section 10\u2014301(j) dates from Senate Bill 512, passed during the 1991 Session. The Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee noted that despite an April 30 deadline, \u201cmany licensees submit their renewal applications late which makes it difficult for the Board to process all the applications in a timely manner.\u201d Bill Analysis, SB 512, 1991 Session. The Bill Analysis does not indicate that the Board <em>refused </em>late applications; rather, the Board struggled to keep up with the late applications it accepted. Accordingly, SB 512 sought to accomplish two things. First, it set a new window for timely applications and required that they be submitted between March 1 and March 31. Second, by giving the Board the authority to fine or reject late applicants, SB 512 \u201cprovide[d] an incentive for licensees to submit their license renewal applications in a timely manner.\u201d Nowhere in the bill\u2019s legislative history is there a discussion of a final and fixed \u201cdue date\u201d for the applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Section 10-301(j)(2) therefore does not impose a thirty-day deadline for late applications, nor does it preclude the Board from accepting a late application after April 30.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>D. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Two Sisters\u2019 liquor license expired by statute on April 30, 2008. Two Sisters then filed a hardship extension request on October 27, 2008, within 180 days of April 30, as allowed under \u00a7 10-504(d). On December 11, 2008, the Board held a hearing on this hardship extension request. The Board granted the request, thereby allotting 180 days from the date of the hearing for the license transfer application to be filed. Counsel for Two Sisters filed a second hardship extension request on June 8, 2009, which the Board again granted. The total time period for which the license could be deemed unexpired was thus 360 days from the cessation of alcoholic beverages business, or from April 30, 2008.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-504(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Two Sisters also filed an application for renewal of the liquor license in October 2008, although the exact date is unclear: the application was notarized on October 21, 2008, and the Board received it on or around October 31, 2008. Section 10-301(j)(2) permits the Board to charge a fee of up to $1,500 or even reject a late application but does not preclude the Board from accepting applications more than thirty days after the March 31 deadline. Accordingly, the Board was within its rights to accept Two Sisters\u2019 October 2008 renewal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Two Sisters\u2019 liquor license thus survived beyond Two Sisters\u2019 business itself and lived on to be renewed or transferred. We turn next to the various applications to take over the license and continue selling alcoholic beverages at 127 West 27th Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">II. Effect of Subsequent Applications</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The Neighbors next argue that the subsequent applications from Mid Atlantic and Gluten Free were inadequate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>cannot make the liquor license qualify for an extension of the expiration period under \u00a7 10-504(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">A. Mid Atlantic\u2019s Application</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The Neighbors assert that because Mid Atlantic\u2019s April 2009 application was substantively invalid, it could not stay the extended 360-day expiration period for licenses under \u00a7 10-504(d)(6). They claim that the application lacked information from one of the company\u2019s three owners, in violation of \u00a7 9-101(b); the remaining two applicants were not Baltimore City taxpayers, as required by \u00a7 9\u2014101(c); and the three witness affidavits required were invalid because they came from individuals who were registered voters in Baltimore County, not Baltimore City, as mandated by \u00a7 10-104(d). The Neighbors also contend that because Mid Atlantic\u2019s application was \u201clater abandoned as if never filed,\u201d it was effectively withdrawn, restarting the clock on the 360-day expiration period.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Mid Atlantic filed its application on April 21, 2009, just shy of 360 days from April 30, 2008. On September 30, 2009, the Board notified Mid Atlantic that its application would be voided if the Board did not hear from it within ten business days. As the Board noted in its letter, because the license was inactive, it would \u201cexpire by operation of law\u201d unless the Board heard from Mid Atlantic. Within ten business days, on October 13, 2009, Gluten Free filed a substitute transfer application.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">B. Gluten Free\u2019s Application</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The Neighbors argue that Gluten Free\u2019s application was likewise invalid because it did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 9-101(c): D\u2019Souza was not a registered voter in Baltimore City nor a payer of property tax in his own name. Given their view that Mid Atlantic\u2019s April 2009 application was invalid, they also dispute the Board\u2019s finding that Gluten Free\u2019s application constituted a valid \u201camendment\u201d of Mid Atlantic\u2019s application, arguing that it is impossible to \u201camend something that is void in the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">As previously discussed, once the Board granted the hardship extension request, Two Sisters\u2019 license was considered unexpired for 360 days after Two Sisters stopped serving alcohol on April 30, 2008. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-504(d)(4). That time period is tolled if a transfer application is pending. \u00a7 10-504(d)(5). If the Board grants the transfer application, the transfer must occur within 180 days of the Board\u2019s approval. \u00a7 10-503(d)(4). However, if the transfer application is withdrawn, \u201cthere shall be no tolling of the period for automatic expiration of the license and it shall be deemed as if no such application or request was filed.\u201d \u00a7 10\u2014504(d)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Section 10-503 sets out requirements for the transfer of licenses, but what is striking is what the statute does <em>not </em>specify. For example, there is no statutory requirement that the Board render a decision on a transfer application within a certain period of time. There is likewise no indication of whether an applicant may amend a defective application or whether there are any limits on the Board\u2019s power to accept such an amendment. The Board apparently operates under the assumption that it has the power to accept amended applications. At the June 24, 2010 hearing, the Board expressly rejected the Neighbors\u2019 arguments and denied their motion to dismiss the amended application. Although the Board initially expressed skepticism about D\u2019Souza\u2019s argument that an incomplete application could be amended, it ultimately decided that the D\u2019Souza application amended and rectified the \u201csloppy\u201d Mid Atlantic application. The Board expressly found that \u201cthe petition was not withdrawn by the October 13th, 2009 amendments thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">While the Neighbors note that the \u201cBoard has cited no provision of Article 2B authorizing\u201d the amendment of an application, they have not cited any provision that precludes the Board from considering an amendment. Absent evidence that the Board\u2019s decision to consider the amended application was \u201cbeyond the [Board\u2019s] powers\u201d or was \u201cillegal,\u201d \u00a7 16-101(e)(l)(i), we are not convinced that the Board\u2019s decision should be overturned. Review of the Board\u2019s interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ambiguous statutes remains somewhat deferential and typically gives \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>See Opert, </em>403 Md. at 593-94, 943 A.2d 1229. The Neighbors simply have not justified a reversal of the Board\u2019s decisions to accept (1) an application that was arguably deficient and (2) an amendment of that application.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">III. Renewal Applications</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Neighbors contend that the renewal applications filed on behalf of Two Sisters in 2009 and Gluten Free in 2010 are invalid because \u201c[njeither \u2018renewal\u2019 applicant was a \u2018licensee\u2019 or \u2018holder of an expiring license\u2019 as required at the time of filing.\u201d They assert that the 2010 application was invalid because D\u2019Souza misrepresented himself as the licensee on the application when the Board had not yet approved the license transfer. The Neighbors argue that because the 2010 application was noncompliant, it should be treated as an original application under \u00a7 10-301(b), not a renewal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Because we have already determined that the Board has the authority to accept a late renewal application, we reject the Neighbors\u2019 claim that Two Sisters\u2019 2009 renewal application was invalid simply because it was filed after their 2008 license expired. <em>See </em>Section I.C, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We likewise reject their asserted reasons that D\u2019Souza\u2019s 2010 renewal application was invalid. The Board considered and rejected the Neighbors\u2019 arguments on whether D\u2019Souza improperly filed a renewal application. We find no reason to substitute our judgment for its decision on the matter.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 16\u2014101(e)(l)(i). D\u2019Souza\u2019s Alcoholic Beverage License Application, filed in October 2009 for the 2009-2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>license year, has \u201cTransfer of Ownership\u201d written in the \u201cOffice use only\u201d section at the bottom of the application form. It would thus appear that the Board knew that D\u2019Souza was filing a transfer application, not an original application, making the Neighbors\u2019 claims of misrepresentation without merit.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">IY. The Board\u2019s June and August 2010 Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The Neighbors also take issue with the Board\u2019s decisions in June and August 2010. They argue that (1) the Board did not have the authority to reconsider its June 2010 decision denying the license transfer, and (2) the Board\u2019s reversal of that decision in August 2010 was not supported by substantial evidence. For reasons stated below, we find that although the Board had the authority to reconsider its June decision, at least as to D\u2019Souza\u2019s qualifications, the Board may have been mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">A. Reconsideration of June Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The Neighbors argue that the Board did not have the authority to reconsider its June 2010 decision at a later hearing. They point to \u00a7 10-208(c), which provides that in Baltimore City, \u201c[i]f a license is refused, ... other applications may not be considered from the applicant or for the premises, as the case may be, for a period of six months.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> At the August hearing, the Board denied the Neighbors\u2019 motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>dismiss under \u00a7 10-208(c), noting that it had the \u201cpower to exercise revisions to its interim orders\u201d and that the June 2010 decision denying the transfer \u201cwas not a final one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The Board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 10-208(c) and the Neighbors\u2019 challenge involve a question of statutory construction. Because the text of \u00a7 10-208(c) does not plainly indicate what types of applications are covered and whether it applies to actions deemed by the Board to be interlocutory, it is ambiguous. Thus, we give deference to the Board\u2019s conclusion. <em>See HNS Dev., </em>425 Md. at 449, 42 A.3d 12; <em>Opert, </em>403 Md. at 593-94, 943 A.2d 1229. Moreover, even if rejection of a license transfer is covered by the statute, it is unclear whether the Board\u2019s action was aimed at D\u2019Souza or the premises. Therefore, under \u00a7 10\u2014208(c)(3), the Board could have concluded in its sole judgment that the refusal was aimed at D\u2019Souza and not against the premises and was not subject to \u00a7 10-208(c)(2). <em>See Philip Moms, supra, </em>349 Md. at 678, 709 A.2d 1230. We therefore find that the Board had the power to reconsider its June 2010 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">B. Reversal of June Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The Neighbors also argue that the Board\u2019s August 2010 reversal of its June 2010 decision was \u201cwithout substantial evidence, arbitrary and capricious, and a violation of due process\u201d because the Board based its new decision on the number of signatures on a petition rather than \u201cthe personal testimony of immediately affected residents.\u201d Although we reject the Neighbors\u2019 argument that the Board erred when it reconsidered evidence of support from the restaurant\u2019s neighbors,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> we find that the Board\u2019s decision in August 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>granting the license was not supported by substantial evidence of D\u2019Souza\u2019s compliance with the voter registration and taxpayer requirements.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <em>See Paek v. Prince George\u2019s County Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs, </em>381 Md. 583, 590, 851 A.2d 540 (2004) (reversing Board\u2019s decision if \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Section 9-101(c) requires that for a limited liability company to receive a liquor license, that license must be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">applied for by and be issued to 3 of the authorized persons of that limited liability company, as individuals, for the use of the limited liability company, at least 1 of whom shall be a registered voter and taxpayer of the county or city ... and shall also have resided there at least 2 years before the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">If the limited liability company has less than three members, then \u201call authorized persons shall make the application as provided in this section.\u201d \u00a7 9-101(e)(5)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>D\u2019Souza testified at the June 2010 hearing. When asked if he had registered to vote, he stated \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d He followed up on that answer with an explanation that he believed that when he became a United States citizen, he was automatically registered to vote, though he admitted that he was not sure if that was correct.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> He also testified that he had been a Baltimore City resident for at least two years, though his wife was the sole owner of the house in which they lived. When asked to confirm that he asserted on his license application that he was a \u201cresident or taxpayer of Baltimore City for more than two years,\u201d D\u2019Souza stated that this information was still true. On cross-examination, however, D\u2019Souza admitted that he did not know if he was registered to vote as of the date of the application and that he had never voted. When asked if he paid property tax in his own name, he stated that he did not. He testified, however, that he paid \u201cMaryland personal property taxes, federal taxes, FICA, all that\u201d on his bakery and his warehouse facilities, both of which were located in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The evidence before the Board at the June 2010 hearing is contradictory at best and certainly does not lead to a finding that D\u2019Souza is both a registered voter and a taxpayer. The Board\u2019s decision to grant the license transfer request was therefore not supported by substantial evidence regarding D\u2019Souza\u2019s compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 9-101(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">V. Section 9-101(c) Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Our conclusion that the Board failed to determine whether D\u2019Souza is a taxpayer and a registered voter is complicated by a lack of clarity in the definition of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d and by the passage of a new law. Although the Board, as the administrative agency, must consider and rule on these issues in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>instance, we discuss them here to give the Board some guidance on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">A. Taxpayer</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">At oral argument, counsel for the Neighbors argued that this Court had all the evidence it needed to find that D\u2019Souza was not a taxpayer under \u00a7 9-101(c). They argue that under this provision only a real property taxpayer may qualify. But it is not clear that this position is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Although \u201ctaxpayer,\u201d read literally, could mean any person who pays any tax, even sales tax or income tax, the word \u201ctaxpayer\u201d must be read in the context of Article 2B, particularly when coupled with the words \u201cof the county or city.\u201d <em>Cf. Superior Outdoor Signs, Inc. v. Eller Media Co., </em>150 Md.App. 479, 502-07, 822 A.2d 478 (2003) (defining \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in the context of standing to challenge a municipal zoning regulation). Article 2B does not have a general definition of \u201ctaxpayer,\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> nor has this Court or the Court of Appeals considered the meaning of the word in the alcoholic beverage laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Three Attorney General Opinions touch on the subject, however. In 1940, the Attorney General responded to a question from a member of a corporation that had applied for a liquor license. 25 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>88 (1940). Only one of the officers was a resident and registered voter in the county in which the application had been made, and the only tax that person paid was a personal property tax of $100 for his car. <em>Id. </em>In the Attorney General\u2019s view, Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>2B did not \u201crequire that the applicant own property of a specific kind, or of a minimum value,\u201d making the car-owning officer qualified to apply for the license. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Although the property tax on automobiles was abolished in 1947, <em>see </em>ch. 99, 1947 Md. Laws 142, in another opinion the Attorney General observed that this change did not affect \u201cthe right of an owner of an automobile to qualify as a taxpayer in the County and taxing area of his residence.\u201d 32 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>64 (1947). This opinion was based on the fact that an automobile owner must still pay a license fee to the State, which then remits part of the fee to the county in which the individual resides. <em>Id. </em>Yet a later opinion from the Attorney General appeared to repudiate the view that the payment of tax to the State suffices for tax to the county. In finding that the payment of income tax does not qualify an individual as a taxpayer under Article 2B, the Attorney General observed that the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">[Pjayment of income tax to the State does not gratify the requirement that the officer be a taxpayer of the County or City and, we believe that this deficiency is not remedied by the fact that the State distributes to the various political subdivisions certain portions of the revenue derived from several taxes, including the income tax law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">35 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>87 (1950). The Board may wish to consider these opinions, along with additional testimony by D\u2019Souza,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">B. Voter Registration</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Although the requirement that a license applicant be a voter has been the law in Maryland since 1933, <em>see </em>Act of December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>5, 1933, ch. 2, 1933 Md. Laws (Extraordinary Session) 5, it seems that for over thirty years, it has been viewed by some as unconstitutional as applied to non-citizens. In 1976, Judge Joseph Mathias of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County found that the registered voter requirement of \u00a7 40(b) (the predecessor to today\u2019s \u00a7 9-101(b)) was unconstitutional. <em>See Reforzo v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs, </em>Equity No. 56008 (Cir. Ct. for Montgomery Cnty. July 7, 1976). That case involved three non-citizens whose application for a liquor license was rejected by the local liquor board because they were not citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In a letter from the Attorney General\u2019s office to the Baltimore City Liquor Board, forwarding a copy of the decision to the City Liquor Board, an Assistant Attorney General noted that the result seemed \u201cvirtually inevitable in view of several recent Supreme Court decisions\u201d that held unconstitutional various citizenship requirements.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> However, the Assistant Attorney General also interpreted the decision as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">[Ljimited to the situation in which the applicant is not a registered voter for the sole reason that he was legally precluded from registering to vote because of his alienage. We would .not interpret this ruling as going so far as to terminate the distinction often drawn in the alcoholic beverage laws between voters and non-voters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The letter concluded with a recommendation that the Board \u201ctake such steps as are necessary administratively in order to reflect the unconstitutionality and invalidity of statutory provisions which would deny consideration of an application for a license solely on the basis of the alienage of the applicant.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Following 2012 legislation, the registered voter requirement no longer appears to apply to a person in D\u2019Souza\u2019s situation. House Bill 232 and Senate Bill 534 of the 2012 Session added an exception to \u00a7 9\u2014101(c): \u201cIn Baltimore City, an authorized person of a limited liability company who holds an alcoholic beverages license for the use of the limited liability company that was granted on or before June 1, 2012, need not be a registered voter in Baltimore City.\u201d Chapters 532 and 533, <em>Laws of 2012.</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Board approved the liquor license transfer on August 12, 2010, so that D\u2019Souza appears to fall under the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">However, this law was passed well after the hearing before the circuit court in March 2011, and so there has been no occasion for any party to raise any legal questions about the application of the new law or constitutional objections to it. Accordingly, we are unwilling to undertake a full analysis of the new law, as \u201cour powers are limited to appellate review and we cannot invade the province of the <em>nisi prius </em>courts by making an original factual finding.\u201d <em>Hartley v. State, </em>238 Md. 165, 168, 208 A.2d 72 (1965); <em>see also Workers\u2019 Compensation Comm\u2019n v. Driver, </em>336 Md. 105, 124 n. 7, 647 A.2d 96 (1994) (declining to address new statute passed during course of litigation).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Moreover, because we have already decided that a remand is necessary to determine D\u2019Souza\u2019s compliance with the taxpayer provisions, it is prudent to have the Board consider the voter registration on remand as well. In <em>Grasslands Plantation v. Frizz-King Enters., </em>410 Md. 191, 978 A.2d 622 (2009), a county enacted two zoning ordinances pertinent to the subject of an appeal just two weeks prior to oral argument before this Court. <em>Id. </em>at 200, 978 A.2d 622. The Court of Appeals determined that the new legislation applied to the challenged zoning action but declined to decide what effect the legislation had. Instead, the Court remanded to the zoning board for a decision, observing that it was \u201cdealing with an administrative decision made before enactment of the new legislation, but one which we void for reasons other than the new legislation, <em>i.e., </em>error in applying the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 978 A.2d 622. Similarly, because we remand to the Board for consideration of D\u2019Souza\u2019s taxpayer status, <em>supra, </em>we find that the Board is in the best position to consider both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The Board should therefore determine in the first instance whether the new law applies to D\u2019Souza.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">VI. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">D\u2019Souza and YIM argue that the voter registration requirement violates the equal protection component of Article 24<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> of the Declaration of Rights for two reasons. First, they assert that the voting requirements in \u00a7 9-101 treat types of applicants differently. Partners who apply for a liquor license on behalf of a partnership do not need to be registered voters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>see </em>\u00a7 9-101(a), while members of a corporation or LLC are required to be registered voters, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9-101(b), (c). They contend that this distinction \u201cimpermissibly creates classifications of citizens\u201d in violation of the Declaration of Rights and the United States Constitution. Second, they argue that any voter registration requirement is unconstitutional because it treats citizens differently from non-citizens. They maintain that this policy unconstitutionally \u201cbar[s] non-citizens from holding liquor licenses\u201d because \u201c[t]here is no rational connection between the voter registration requirement and the needs of the State to regulate the sale of alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"> We decline to reach the constitutional arguments for two reasons. First, even constitutional issues \u201cmust be pursued and exhausted\u201d before the relevant administrative agency \u201cbefore resort[ing] to the courts.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Ray\u2019s Used Cars, </em>398 Md. 632, 651, 922 A.2d 495 (2007); <em>see also Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the United States, </em>339 Md. 596, 617, 664 A.2d 862 (1995) (\u201c[Constitutional issues, including the constitutionality of applying particular statutes, can and often must be raised and initially decided in the statutorily prescribed administrative proceedings.\u201d). D\u2019Souza and YIM did not raise their constitutional arguments before the Board and cannot do so for the first time in court. Second, because D\u2019Souza is a United States citizen, he lacks standing to challenge the voter registration requirement on behalf of non-citizens. <em>See Clark </em>v. <em>State, </em>284 Md. 260, 265, 396 A.2d 243 (1979) (\u201cIn other words, a person challenging the validity of a statute on equal protection grounds cannot rely on theoretical inequalities, or such as do not affect him, but must show that he is himself affected unfavorably by the discrimination of which he complains.\u201d) (Citations and internal quotations omitted). Finally, because the new law appears to eliminate the voter registration requirement for applicants like D\u2019Souza, his constitutional challenges may also be moot.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>VII. Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Finally, the Neighbors argue that they are \u201centitled to the costs of preparing the transcripts of the Board\u2019s proceedings on June 24, 2010 and August 12, 2010.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-101(e)(4)(i) (\u201cCosts shall be awarded as in other civil cases.\u201d). The circuit court denied the Neighbors\u2019 requests for costs without prejudice in its Order of June 6, 2011, on the grounds that \u201cthe court has been unable to locate a certification of costs pursuant to Rule 7-206(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Rule 7-206 provides that when testimony before an agency \u201chas been recorded but not transcribed before the filing of the petition for judicial review, the first petitioner ... shall pay the expense of transcription, which shall be taxed as costs and may be apportioned as provided in Rule 2-603.\u201d The petitioner must file a certification of costs with the agency, which must include the certification in the record on appeal. Md. Rule 7-206(a). Provided that the costs are known and \u201c[u]nless otherwise provided by rule, law, or order of court, the prevailing party is entitled to costs.\u201d Md. Rule 2-603(a). Although Rule 7-206 requires merely substantial compliance, <em>see Volk v. Pugatch, </em>262 Md. 80, 277 A.2d 17 (1971), even substantial compliance cannot be achieved if no one knows what the costs are. The circuit court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of the Neighbors\u2019 request, on the grounds that the court did not have a certification of the costs, is reasonable and not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Further, the Neighbors are not entitled to the costs of the transcripts from either the June or August 2010 hearings because they are not the prevailing party under Rule 2-603.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> They argued that the Board\u2019s decision to deny the license transfer in June 2010 should be upheld, and we reject that argument, finding that the Board had the authority to reconsider its decision. They also argued that the Board\u2019s decision to grant the transfer in August 2010 should be reversed, and we instead remand the case for further factfinding on D\u2019Souza\u2019s voter and taxpayer status.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">For all of these reasons we affirm the Board\u2019s finding that the liquor license was \u201clive\u201d and subject to transfer but remand the case to the Board for further factfinding on D\u2019Souza\u2019s status as a taxpayer and the effect of the changes to \u00a7 9\u2014101(c) on D\u2019Souza\u2019s application.

Although the Board does not specifically argue the point, the fact that the Board accepted a hardship extension request for the license in October 2008, when the license expired by statute on April 30, 2008, indicates that it interprets its power to grant an \"extension of the life of the license due to undue hardship\u201d to apply even when a licensee has not applied for renewal of the license in a timely fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\">. The Board\u2019s determination of what is \"undue hardship\u201d would appear to be governed by the rule set forth in <em>Philip Morris, Inc. v.

The inclusion in a general provision of exception language for a subsection later added to the section is a drafting convention, sometimes followed and sometimes not followed in the Alcoholic Beverages law.

Our conclusion that \u00a7 10-504(d) prevails over \u00a7 10-504(a) is bolstered by the legislature\u2019s treatment of a similar statutory exception for Allegany County. In 2005, Senate Bill 575 introduced \u00a7 10-504(h), which copied the Baltimore City and Baltimore County vacancy terms and applied them to Allegany County. The Floor Report for SB 575 noted that in \"Baltimore City and Baltimore County, license holders have 180 days from the closing of the business or cessation of alcoholic beverage business before an alcoholic beverages license expires.\u201d This description of the applicable law in Baltimore City and Baltimore County suggests that the legislators viewed \u00a7\u00a7 10-504(d) and (e) as applying in place of \u00a7 10-504(a) and that they intended for \u00a7 10-504(h) to do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\">.

However, the Board emphasized the \"unique nature\u201d of the restaurant more than any other factor and unfavorably compared its previous denial of the liquor license with its \u201croutine[] grant [of] licenses where potential uniqueness may be dubious.\u201d The Board concluded its decision by finding that \"there is a public need and desire, a <em>de minimis </em>impact on existing licensees, a negligible impact on general health, safety and welfare, including crime, traffic and parking, and certainly a potential uniqueness (continued ...) of services and products.\u201d It then granted the license transfer, \"subject to the strict enforcement of the terms and conditions of the agreement between\u201d D\u2019Souza, the owner of 127 West 27th Street, and the community and business associations. Based on the evidence of community support before the Board at the time of the August hearing, we cannot conclude that the Board erred. <em>See Woodfield v. W.
