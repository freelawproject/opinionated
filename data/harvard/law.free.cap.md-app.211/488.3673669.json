Did the circuit court err in allowing substantial damage awards to fifteen \u201cuse plaintiffs\u201d who never joined any case prior to verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">II. Did the circuit court err in the <em>Hewitt </em>case by rejecting allocation of damages according to the respective harm caused by smoking and exposure to asbestos?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">III. Did the circuit court err in instructing the jury that suppliers and installers have a duty to inspect, analyze, and test any product that they supply or install?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer questions I and II in the affirmative and question III in the negative. We, therefore, reverse and vacate the judgments entered against appellant in favor of the use plaintiffs, concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>statute of limitations now bars the use plaintiffs from bringing wrongful death claims. As to the <em>Hewitt </em>case, we reverse the judgments entered against appellant in favor of the plaintiffs, and remand for a new trial. We affirm the judgments entered against appellant in favor of the plaintiffs in the <em>Carter </em>case, the <em>James </em>case, and the <em>Lawrence </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AQA\">(1) The Parties and Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">(a) Wallace &amp; Gale, Incorporated (\u201cW &amp; G\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Established in 1881, W &amp; G was a Baltimore-based insulation and roofing contractor that installed asbestos-containing products for various companies, including Bethlehem Steel and American Smelting &amp; Refining Company (\u201cASARCO\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On November 16, 1985, W &amp; G filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. On April 17, 2001, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland entered an order confirming the Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, creating appellant, an entity that assumed W &amp; G\u2019s liabilities resulting from asbestos claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">On November 2, 2010, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland approved the \u201cSecond Amended and Restated Asbestos BI Claims Resolutions Procedures.\u201d Section 5.4(b) of the Procedures provided for the tolling of the statute of limitations applicable to claims against appellant. Pursuant to Section 5.4(b), claims accruing after the petition date, November 16, 1985, and prior to the implementation date, August 26, 2009, were required to be brought against appellant before: (1) the expiration of the ninety-day period immediately following the date that the Claims Materials were made publicly available to claimants, September 28, 2010, or (2) the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the claim, whichever was later.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>(b) The <em>James </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On January 5, 2007, Willean Peoples (\u201cPeoples\u201d), Levester James\u2019s (\u201cJames\u201d) stepdaughter, as personal representative of James\u2019s estate, filed a short form asbestos complaint against numerous defendants, including appellant, containing counts of negligence (survival), strict liability (survival), conspiracy, fraud, and wrongful death. Peoples alleged that James had been employed as a laborer at ASARCO from 1968 to 1972, and that, on July 4, 2004, James died from lung cancer. The case caption on the short form complaint identified the following use plaintiffs: Katherine, James\u2019s surviving spouse, Kevin, James\u2019s surviving son, and Monica, James\u2019s surviving daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">(c) The <em>Lawrence </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">On February 21, 2008, Arthur L. Drager (\u201cDrager\u201d), as personal representative of Mayso A. Lawrence, Sr.\u2019s (\u201cLawrence\u201d) estate and Bernice, as Lawrence\u2019s surviving spouse, filed a short form asbestos complaint against numerous defendants, including appellant, containing counts for negligence (survival), strict liability (survival), conspiracy, fraud, and wrongful death. The complaint alleged that Lawrence worked as a laborer at ASARCO from 1968 to 1969, and as a laborer and machine operator at Bethlehem Steel from 1970 to \u201clater into the\u201d 1970s. On October 8, 2007, Lawrence died from lung cancer. The case caption on the short form complaint listed the following use plaintiffs: Elaine, Mayso Jr., Tyrone, Phaedra, Cephus, Sean, and Tanesha, Lawrence\u2019s four sons and three daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">(d) The <em>Carter </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">On February 17, 2006, Johanna Carter, as personal representative for Rufus E. Carter\u2019s (\u201cCarter\u201d) estate, and Sonia, as Carter\u2019s surviving daughter, filed an amended short form complaint against numerous defendants including appellant, incorporating the counts set forth in the original complaint\u2014 loss of consortium, negligence (survival), strict liability (survival), conspiracy, and fraud, and adding a count alleging wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ful death. Johanna alleged that Carter had been employed as a laborer and crane operator at ASARCO from 1966 to 1975. On November 6, 2003, Carter died from lung cancer. The case caption on the amended short form complaint listed the following use plaintiffs: Kenneth and Rufus Jr., Carter\u2019s sons, and Natasha, Carter\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">On March 7, 2006, Sonia filed a Notice to Substitute Parties, advising that Johanna had been removed as the personal representative of Carter\u2019s estate and that Sonia had been appointed as successor personal representative of Carter\u2019s estate. Sonia notified the circuit court and the parties that she, as successor personal representative, was substituted as the party plaintiff in the survival action.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">(e) The <em>Hewitt </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">On September 7, 2006, Roger C. Hewitt, Sr. (\u201cHewitt\u201d) and Annette Hewitt filed a short form asbestos complaint against numerous defendants alleging that Hewitt had been diagnosed with \u201casbestosis and asbestos-related diseases\u201d in April 2006. Hewitt alleged that he was exposed to asbestos through his work as a laborer, mechanic steamfitter and pipe fitter at the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1943 to 1944, and as a laborer and crane operator at Bethlehem Steel from 1946 to the late 1970s. On January 5, 2007, the plaintiffs filed an Amendment by Interlineation, adding appellant as a defendant. On December 20, 2008, Hewitt died of pneumonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">On January 23, 2009, Roger Jr. filed a Notice to Substitute Parties, notifying the circuit court and the parties that he, as personal representative of Hewitt\u2019s estate, was substituted as a party plaintiff in the survival action. On July 24, 2009, Annette, as surviving spouse of Hewitt, and Roger Jr., as personal representative of Hewitt\u2019s estate, filed an amended short form complaint, incorporating the counts set forth in the original complaint-loss of consortium, negligence (survival), strict liability (survival), conspiracy, and fraud, and adding a count alleging wrongful death. The case caption on the amended short form complaint identified the following use plaintiffs: Penny and Idalyn, surviving daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>On the same day, July 24, 2009, Roger Jr. filed an Amendment by Interlineation to Add Disease Process, alleging that recent medical records indicated that, in addition to asbestosis, Hewitt had also suffered from lung cancer causally connected to his exposure to asbestos and asbestos products.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">(2) Pre-Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On November 10, 2009, the circuit court consolidated the four cases for trial, scheduled to begin on January 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">(a) Answers to Interrogatories</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In three of the cases\u2014the <em>James, Lawrence, </em>and <em>Carter </em>cases\u2014personal representatives filed answers to interrogatories, referring to themselves as the singular \u201cPlaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">In the <em>Hewitt </em>case, plaintiff Roger Jr. filed answers to interrogatories. Throughout the answers to interrogatories, Roger Jr. is referred to as the singular \u201cPlaintiff.\u201d In one answer, Roger Jr. stated that Hewitt smoked approximately one-half to one pack of cigarettes per day from approximately 1943 to approximately 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">(b) Proposed <em>Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">On December 20, 2010, approximately one month before the start of trial, the plaintiffs filed proposed <em>voir dire. </em>As to plaintiffs, question 2 of the proposed <em>voir dire </em>asked the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">Is any member of the panel or any member of your immediate family, or close circle of friends related to or otherwise acquainted with the plaintiffs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">Rufus E.

Asserting that trial was scheduled to begin in two weeks and that its ability to prepare a defense had been \u201csignificantly and unfairly prejudiced[,]\u201d appellant requested that the circuit court exclude all fact witnesses not offered for deposition by October 18, 2010, from testifying at trial. The circuit court denied the motion to exclude and continued the trial for three weeks. During the three week continuance, appellant\u2019s counsel conducted approximately thirty depositions of family members, including some of the individuals identified as use plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-18\">(3) Trial Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b519-19\">A jury trial was held from February 9, 2011, to February 11, 2011, February 14, 2011, to February 18, 2011, February 22, 2011, to February 25, 2011, and February 28, 2011, to March 2, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-20\">(a) <em>Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-21\">On February 9, 2011, during the morning session of <em>voir dire, </em>the circuit court asked the following questions as to the plaintiffs in the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-22\">The plaintiffs in the case are Rufus Carter, Roger Hewitt, Levester James, Mayso Lawrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-23\">Do any of you know any of these folks? Any of you know them?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>During the afternoon session of <em>voir dire, </em>the circuit court again identified the plaintiffs in the case as Rufus Carter, Roger Hewitt, Levester James, and Mayso Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">(b) Opening Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In opening statement, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel identified the plaintiffs in the case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury----I, along with my co-counsel, represent the four plaintiffs and families in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">The plaintiffs are Levester James, Rufus Carter, Roger Hewitt and Mayso Lawrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">(c) Apportionment in the <em>Hewitt </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Hewitt was a crane operator who worked at Bethlehem Steel from 1946 to the late 1970s. Hewitt was a cigarette smoker who smoked a half a pack to a pack per day. Hewitt was diagnosed with lung cancer in October 2008, and died on December 20, 2008, at eighty-one years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">At trial, Dr. Steven Zimmet testified that asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing cause to Hewitt\u2019s lung cancer, and that smoking was also a cause of Hewitt\u2019s lung cancer. According to Dr. Zimmet, he could not differentiate \u201cwhich caused what\u201d because the two exposures are \u201cnot just additive, they are synergistic which means they multiply exposures.\u201d At trial, appellant conceded that Hewitt had asbestosis and that asbestos had contributed to his lung cancer. Appellant\u2019s counsel requested that the circuit court permit apportionment of damages, and appellees\u2019 counsel objected, arguing that trial courts have never addressed the apportionment of damages for smoking, and that it would not be possible to apportion anyway. Appellant\u2019s counsel responded that there was a \u201cstrong foundation\u201d for apportionment and that its expert, Dr. Gerald R. Kerby, would render an opinion that apportionment of damages is possible based on epidemiology studies and other scientific studies. The circuit court expressed doubt that the damages could be apportioned, commenting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>No, I understand there is statistical basis for likelihood of risk. But in a given\u2014with a given plaintiff, I don\u2019t know how you can apportion it. But, you know, I guess, the witness can say what he says if he is qualified to say it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">But I\u2019m not going to give an instruction on this because it is not\u2014I don\u2019t perceive it at this point to be the law in these type of cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">You can apportion risk. I don\u2019t know how, in an individual plaintiff\u2019s] case, you can apportion damages. I don\u2019t know. It is a mystery to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">We\u2019ll find out. This doctor will show up, and we\u2019ll hear about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Subsequently, appellant\u2019s counsel filed an offer of proof regarding Dr. Kerby\u2019s testimony, which provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">1. Dr. Kerby has reviewed the [Hewitt] case including Mr. Hewitt\u2019s medical records, currently in evidence as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit no. 6, x-rays and Plaintiffs Answers to Defendants\u2019 Master Interrogatories, attached hereto as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 for identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">2. Based on a review of the information contained in Paragraph No. 1, Dr. Kerby understands that Mr. Hewitt was occupationally exposed to asbestos from 1943 to 1978 while working for the Pennsylvania Railroad and Bethlehem Steel Sparrows Point Steel Mill. Further, Dr. Kerby understands, based on the information contained in Paragraph No. 1 herein, that Mr. Hewitt smoked cigarettes from 1943 to 2008 at a rate of <em>1/2 </em>pack to 1 pack per day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">3. Based on a review of the information contained in Paragraph No. 1 herein, Dr. Kerby is aware that Mr. Hewitt developed lung cancer in October 2008 and died on December 20, 2008 as a consequence of the lung cancer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">4. Based on his review of Mr. Hewitt\u2019s medical records and x-rays identified in Paragraph No. 1, Dr. Kerby is of the opinion that Mr. Hewitt had pulmonary asbestosis and as a result, Mr. Hewitt\u2019s history of occupational exposure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to the development of Mr. Hewitt\u2019s lung cancer and death therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">5. Further, based on his review of the information contained in Paragraph No. 1, Dr. Kerby is also of the opinion that Mr. Hewitt\u2019s cigarette smoking history was also a substantial contributing factor to the development of Mr. Hewitt\u2019s lung cancer and death therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">6. Dr. Kerby is of the opinion that there is a reasonable medical and scientific basis for determining the relative contributions of Mr. Hewitt\u2019s cigarette smoking history and Mr. Hewitt\u2019s occupational history of asbestos exposure to the development of Mr. Hewitt\u2019s lung cancer and death therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">7. The reasonable medical and scientific basis for determining the relative contributions of Mr. Hewitt\u2019s cigarette smoking history and occupational history of asbestos exposure to the development of his lung cancer and death therefrom is derived from epidemiologic studies concerning asbestos, cigarette smoking and the risk of lung cancer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">11. Based on the foregoing, Dr. Kerby, if permitted, would opine that the relative contribution of Mr. Hewitt\u2019s cigarette smoking history to the development of his lung cancer and resultant death was 75%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">12. Based on the foregoing, Dr. Kerby, if permitted, would opine that the relative contribution of Mr. Hewitt\u2019s history of occupational exposure to asbestos (in the setting of asbestosis) to the development of his lung cancer and resultant death was 25%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The circuit court accepted the offer of proof, but excluded Dr. Kerby\u2019s testimony concerning apportionment of damages, stating: \u201cIt is just this effort to apportion doesn\u2019t really work for me. It doesn\u2019t make any sense[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Appellant\u2019s counsel offered Dr. Kerby as an expert in pulmonary medicine and the historical development of knowledge in the medical and scientific community regarding asbes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>tos and disease. The circuit court accepted Dr. Kerby as an expert in those areas with no objection from the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">(d) Use Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, appellant filed a Motion for Directed Verdict Based on the Statute of Limitations, arguing, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">Plaintiffs in the <em>[James </em>] and <em>[Carter </em>] cases failed to join all necessary parties to the action as required under Maryland Rule 15-1001. Certain \u201cuse\u201d <em>plaintiffs\u2014e.g., </em>those not joined in the action-were never properly added to these cases. In both cases, plaintiffs listed \u201cuse\u201d plaintiffs for the decedent\u2019s family members when filing their wrongful death actions. At trial, plaintiffs have called the \u201cuse\u201d plaintiffs to present evidence as to their wrongful death claims against [appellant]. The \u201cuse\u201d plaintiffs were never amended into the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints and limitations has run. Plaintiffs are now precluded from amending their complaints to add necessary parties. [Appellant] is therefore entitled to directed verdict as to the claims of the \u201cuse\u201d plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">(Citation omitted). Appellant requested that the circuit court \u201cfind that the current wrongful death claims for \u2018use\u2019 plaintiffs Katherine James, [Kevin] James, Monica James, Kenneth Carter, Rufus Carter, Jr., and Natasha Sloan [were] improper\u201d and time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, appellant\u2019s counsel orally moved for judgment \u201cagainst all the plaintiffs cases on all the respective counts.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel argued, in pertinent part, that the use plaintiffs failed to join the action as \u201cnecessary parties,\u201d and that the use plaintiffs were identified only to give them notice of the action. The circuit court denied the motion for judgment with leave for appellant\u2019s counsel to renew the motion at the close of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">After the close of all of the evidence, appellant\u2019s counsel renewed the motion for judgment. As to the issue of the use plaintiffs, the circuit court observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>To my mind, usually a use plaintiff sues filing in one person\u2019s name for use of another person. And that\u2019s usually been where I bump into it. So that implies that someone has a fiduciary relationship and someone else is supposed to be serving their interest. But that\u2019s not what goes on here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB_\">The circuit court commented: \u201cWhat is the harm of leaving them in, let them render a judgment, that way if it goes up on appeal and they happen to be right\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter whether they are right, if they happen to convince several people that they are right, then there is no\u2014they have to go back and retry the use plaintiffs.\u201d The circuit court reasoned that it was best to include the use plaintiffs on the verdict sheets because if it decided appellant\u2019s counsel was correct, then it could \u201cjust strike all the verdicts against the use plaintiffs and it goes up on appeal and they can deal with it however they choose to deal with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">(e) Verdict Sheets</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">On February 23, 2011, appellant filed proposed revised verdict forms for the four cases. In the <em>Hewitt </em>case, the proposed verdict form contained questions concerning apportionment, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">6. Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the compensatory damages of the Estate of Roger Hewitt can be apportioned between cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">YES_NO_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">[If YES, answer 6a and 6b below. If NO, go to question 7]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">6a. What percent of the Estate of Roger Hewitt\u2019s compensatory damages are related to Mr. Hewitt\u2019s cigarette smoking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">\n<em>_%</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">6a. What percent of the Estate of Roger Hewitt\u2019s compensatory damages are related to Mr. Hewitt\u2019s asbestos exposure[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">_%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>7. What amount of compensatory damages, if any, do you award Annette Hewitt, widow of Roger Hewitt, as a result of the death of Mr. Hewitt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">8. Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the compensatory damages of Annette Hewitt can be apportioned between cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">YES_NO_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">[If YES, answer 8a and 8b below. If NO, go to question 9]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">8a.

What percent of Annette Hewitt\u2019s compensatory damages are related to Mr. Hewitt\u2019s asbestos exposure[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">_%</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">After the close of all of the evidence, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel addressed the verdict sheets and apportionment, stating: \u201cI am concerned about the verdict sheets. If Your Honor ruled, I would ask if [appellant\u2019s counsel] is going to do the verdict sheets that the apportionment part come out and that each of the wrongful death claimants be listed.\u201d The circuit court agreed. As a result, in the <em>Hewitt </em>case, no question concerning apportionment was included on the verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">(f) Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">Prior to the court instructing the jury, the parties discussed jury instructions. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to instruction number 28, titled \u201cstate of the art,\u201d arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-15\">I think the objection we have is the last language here at the end, manufacturer, supplier-installer, particularly we\u2019re talking about supplier-installers have a duty to test, analyze, inspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>And for the reasons we already discussed, that wouldn\u2019t be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The circuit court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Appellant requested a jury instruction concerning apportionment of damages in the <em>Hewitt </em>case, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">If you decide that plaintiff suffered from an asbestos-related lung disease for which the defendant is responsible, and that plaintiff had a history of smoking and/or tobacco exposure, and that plaintiffs asbestos exposure and plaintiffs smoking history and/or tobacco exposure were both substantial contributing factors in the development of plaintiffs lung disease, then you shall apportion the damages between plaintiffs asbestos exposure and plaintiffs smoking history/tobacco exposure. This apportionment of damages should be based on the percentage you believe each factor contributed to plaintiffs lung disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The circuit court declined to give the requested instruction on apportionment, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">It is just not the law in these cases. But I understand the theory. Although it does strike me, with all due respect. It is kind of a very unscientific wild guess you\u2019re asking the jury to make. I mean, there is no real basis in the record, nor could there ever be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">After the close of all the evidence, the circuit court instructed the jury, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">The duty of the non manufacturer supplier to warn plaintiffs is different under some circumstances than the duty of a manufacturer. In general, the supplier-installer is not held to a standard as strict as imposed on the manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">If, however, that you find\u2014if, however, you find that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the supplier-installer is based upon claimed exposure to the installation or application of asbestos-containing products by the defendant, then the installer-supplier has the duty to warn the plaintiff of the dangers of which the installer-supplier was actually then aware or which it should have discovered in light of its particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>skill, knowledge, or expertise gained in the course of handling or installing such products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">When a seller or other manufacturer is nothing more than a conduit between manufacturer and customer, the retailer or supplier ordinarily has no duty to discover the defects or dangers of a particular product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">However\u2014pardon me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">However, if the installer-supplier does something more than merely act as a conduit of goods, then those additional acts may impose a higher standard of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">If you find the installer-supplier not only supplied asbestos products to various job sites, but also that its employees installed these products, and if you further find the installer created a danger to other workers, that may impose upon the installer-supplier a duty to discover the products were dangerous by reading the literature that was available at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">You may consider what reasonably should have been discovered in light of the supplier and installer\u2019s particular oppor\u2014peculiar opportunity and competence as a dealer in a particular product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">As to strict liability only, strict liability does not apply where the predominant purpose of the defendant\u2019s conduct was provision of a service rather than sale of the good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">If you find the predominant purpose of the defendant\u2019s product at work in which it used any asbestos-containing building materials was the provision of a service only rather than a sale of goods, then you must find in favor of the defendant as to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of strict liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">State of the art. You heard a lot of discussion about state of the art. Under both negligence and strict liability theories, the manufacturer is held to the knowledge of and skill of an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">The manufacturer\u2019s status as an expert means that, at a minimum, the manufacturer must keep abreast of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>scientific knowledge, discoveries, and advances, and is presumed to know what is imparted thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">Industry standards and the state of the art are not synonymous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">State of the art includes all available knowledge on a subject at a given time. This includes scientific, medical, engineering, and other knowledge that may be available. State of the art includes the amount of time, what was known, when was this knowledge available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">The manufacturer supplier or installer is under a duty to use ordinary care to test, analyze, and inspect the products it sells, installs, or uses\u2014sells, supplies, or installs. I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">Efficacy of warning. If a warning would not have prevented the harm from occurring, then a defendant who failed to warn is not responsible because the absence of a warning could not have been or would not have been the cause of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">Considering this issue may\u2014you may presume that people ordinarily exercise\u2014pardon me\u2014that people exercise ordinary care for their own safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">Presumption of due care arises from the natural instinct of human beings to guard against danger, namely the known and ordinary disposition of people to guard themselves from danger or risk. It is therefore presumed that if a warning is given, it will be read and heeded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">At the end of jury instructions, appellant\u2019s counsel excepted to several instructions, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-12\">I would like to make an objection on the record now about the particular item, No. 24, Your Honor, the duty to inspect. It wasn\u2019t plead by the plaintiff. There\u2019s no duty from the supplier-installer regarding design, manufacture, testing or inspection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Furthermore, you read it in regard to manufacturer. I think it is confusing to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\">Next, 28 state of the art, they did not plead failure to analyze test or inspect. There is no duty to analyze, test, or inspect, and it did not include the nonobscure literature reference this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">And lastly, just to reserve under the apportionment of damages you had a prior ruling so obviously it wasn\u2019t read but.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">One additional one, Your Honor. To the extent that the instructions as a whole are referring to plaintiffs as plaintiffs, wherein we contest that use plaintiffs had not been joined to this action and had claims said in this action, I want to register an objection now because it just conferred plaintiffs status to the jury for use plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The circuit court noted the exceptions, but took no further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">(g) Verdicts and Judgments</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The jury returned verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs and use plaintiffs, in the following amounts: (1) <em>James </em>case\u2014 $2,035,684.71; (2) <em>Lawrence </em>case\u2014$2,930,532.09; (3) <em>Carter </em>case\u2014$2,017,302.50; and (4) <em>Hewitt </em>case\u2014$2,686,686.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">On May 12, 2011, the circuit court entered orders in the four cases reducing the jury verdicts after application of the cap on non-economic damages, bankruptcy settlement payments, and joint tortfeasor credit for appellant\u2019s cross-claims against another defendant <em>(i.e. </em>pro rata share allocation).

Appellant asserted that Maryland law generally recognizes apportionment of damages in tort cases where the criteria set forth in the Restatement are satisfied. According to appellant, \u201cDr. Kerby\u2019s proffered testimony satisfied the Restatement\u2019s requirements for allowing the jury to apportion damages between the two causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In a response to the post-trial motion, as to the apportionment of damages in the <em>Hewitt </em>case, appellees contended that Hewitt\u2019s lung cancer was an indivisible injury, and that appellant\u2019s request was actually a request to apply comparative fault, which has \u201cbeen refused both in [Maryland] courts and by legislature.\u201d Appellees argued that because Maryland is not a comparative fault state, the circuit court did not need to address the exclusion of Dr. Kerby\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Appellant filed a reply memorandum in support of its post-trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">On July 21, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing on the post-trial motion. The circuit court denied the post-trial motion as to the apportionment issue, ruling from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_2\">All right. I\u2019m going to deny. I find it a fascinating argument. I\u2019m going to deny it. It will be preserved for appeal, if you can convince the Court of Special Appeals/Court of Appeals with this. It\u2019s a fascinating argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>I just have no idea how\u2014we\u2019re already putting on the jury\u2019s shoulders and into their heads material that, sitting here listening to these cases, I have listened to how many, eight or ten or how many I\u2019ve heard is really\u2014approaches the unknowable to start with. And then you start having them divide up and apportion different levels of the unknowable among different parties. It\u2019s just too much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">It\u2019s a fascinating issue. I think that if the legislature wanted to pass a bill saying in all cases where there\u2019s smoking and there\u2019s asbestos inhalation, we\u2019ll divide the liability in the following fashion based upon epidemiological studies, I guess they could do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">If the Court of Appeals wants to send us down that path to another swamp, I suppose we could do that. It\u2019s an interesting issue. Technologically, it\u2019s interesting. But we don\u2019t have any basis for drawing an intelligent conclusion regarding what we\u2019re going to plug into the matrix. So no, we\u2019re not doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">Interesting argument. Like it, but never happen in here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">As to the giving of the jury instruction on the duty to inspect, test, or analyze, the circuit court denied the post-trial motion, ruling: \u201cI\u2019m not going to grant the motion, because I think even if I were wrong, I think it was harmless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">At the end of the post-trial motion hearing, the circuit court held the issue of the use plaintiffs <em>sub curia, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">Now, this\u2014so we\u2019re on the record and clear about this. I\u2019m going to hold off on this mess with the use plaintiffs, but not too long, because I\u2019ll forget everything we argued about if I go too long, and we\u2019re going to try to have a time ... when ... we can have an intelligent discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">On October 13, 2011, the circuit court held a brief hearing on the outstanding issue of the use plaintiffs, and ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">Right. Right. And there is no question that use plaintiffs have to be included. They\u2019re supposed to be included. They\u2019re necessary parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Honestly, I don\u2019t know what the right answer is. But I\u2019m going to rule in favor of the plaintiffs on this and get this on to appeal by allowing the verdicts, although I have serious qualms, quite frankly, in my own mind as to how you can throw someone in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">I did it, admittedly. I did it, so I might as well deal with the consequences of it. I did it sort of as a safety device, and I don\u2019t think the law is particularly clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">The issue clearly is defined in my mind as does a use plaintiff who otherwise didn\u2019t appear until the trial and never got moved into the case until it was ready for verdict, are they entitled to have a verdict entered in their name? Or are they simply entitled to share in whatever verdict is taken in the name of the plaintiffs in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">Common sense tells me that if you\u2019re a use plaintiff, you shouldn\u2019t\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have put them on the verdict sheet. But the court of appeals decision\u2014I don\u2019t think it really clears the issue up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">But since I put them on the verdict sheet, I\u2019ll stick with that. And we\u2019ll allow the verdict to stand with respect to that and overt ]rule motions, although I think honestly it is very dubious. I\u2019m doing the best I can with what I have because I did it. Whatever mess we have, I created by not dealing with that up front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">So, I\u2019ll allow it to stand. And it will go on appeal. And it will work out itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">I don\u2019t think there is any definitive law in Maryland on exactly how to deal with exactly this factual situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">On October 18, 2011, the circuit court entered an order denying appellant\u2019s post-trial motions. On November 15, 2011, appellant filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">Relying on <em>Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp. v. Muti, </em>426 Md. 358, 44 A.3d 380 (2012), appellant contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u201cfailure of the \u2018use plaintiffs\u2019 to join the actions precludes them from recovering damages.\u201d Appellant argues that, by the plain language of Maryland Rule 15-1001, use plaintiffs are statutory beneficiaries who have not joined the action as party plaintiffs. Appellant argues that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the use plaintiffs as they were not served with process, and that the use plaintiffs were \u201cnot required to participate in pretrial proceedings, submit to written discovery, or accept other obligations imposed on a party.\u201d Appellant asserts that the plaintiffs in the instant case \u201cacted as if the use plaintiffs were not parties and owed no obligations to the defense[,]\u201d and \u201cignored discovery requests and refused to present the use plaintiffs for deposition until compelled by the [circuit] court[.]\u201d Appellant maintains that the use plaintiffs inexplicably failed to join the action throughout the case, waiting until the end of the trial, after the close of evidence, to move to join as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Appellant contends that the failure of the use plaintiffs to timely join the action is \u201cfatal\u201d as the statute of limitations has expired as to their claims. Appellant argues that under the Wrongful Death Act, an action must be brought within three years after discovery of an occupational cause of death, and, under the Claims Resolution Procedures for its bankruptcy discharge, claims must be brought against appellant before the expiration of limitations as set forth in the Wrongful Death Act or December 28, 2010, whichever is later. Appellant asserts that, as to the <em>Carter </em>and <em>James </em>cases, the use plaintiffs were required to join the action, <em>i.e. </em>bring a claim for wrongful death, by December 28, 2010, as to the <em>Lanrrence </em>case, February 21, 2011, and, as to the <em>Hewitt </em>case, December 20, 2011, or, at the latest, July 24, 2012. Appellant maintains that, as the claims of the use plaintiffs would supplement the claims of the named plaintiffs and possibly increase appellant\u2019s liability, the claims of the use plaintiffs do not \u201crelate back\u201d and are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Appellees respond that \u201cdesignating individuals as use plaintiffs accomplishes joinder of those use plaintiffs in the action so that they are proper parties in interest in the case.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Appellees contend that the use plaintiffs were parties to the action and were properly awarded damages by the jury. Appellees argue that appellant and the circuit court had \u201cclear notice\u201d that all of the plaintiffs\u2014including the use plaintiffs-were \u201cclaiming their share.\u201d In support of this argument, appellees point out the following as to the use plaintiffs: \u201cThey were listed in plaintiffs\u2019 Answer to Interrogatories; they were deposed pre-trial; they were introduced to the jury at voir dire; they were called as witnesses at trial and they were on the verdict sheets.\u201d Appellees contend that appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>dicta </em>from <em>Muti </em>is misplaced, and that <em>Muti </em>is not dispositive as it addressed a different factual scenario. Appellees argue that, unlike in Muti\u2014where a potential beneficiary was not named as a use plaintiff\u2014in this case, all plaintiffs and use plaintiffs participated in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">As to the statute of limitations, appellees contend the use plaintiffs are not time barred because they are not new parties, and do not bring new causes of action. Appellees argue that the filings of the use plaintiffs would relate back to the original filing when the wrongful death claimants were named.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In a reply brief, reiterating that <em>Muti </em>is dispositive and that the use plaintiffs are not parties, appellant asks: \u201cHow could [the use plaintiffs] be bound by a judgment of the court absent service of process or voluntary invocation of the court\u2019s jurisdiction?\u201d Appellant contends that, contrary to appellees\u2019 arguments, counsel for the plaintiffs never entered an appearance on behalf of any of the use plaintiffs, and conceded before the circuit court that the use plaintiffs had not affirmatively joined the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>(2) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Maryland Wrongful Death Act, contained at Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.

Essex, </em>318 Md. 516, 524, 569 A.2d 645 (1990), a wrongful death case, the Court of Appeals vacated a judgment entered on behalf of only one of two potential beneficiaries, holding that the \u201cjudgment should not have been entered in the [trial] court unless it included the interests of all of the known beneficiaries.\u201d In <em>Walker, id. </em>at 523, 569 A.2d 645, the Court of Appeals discussed the unique nature and purpose of the Maryland Wrongful Death Act, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">[U]nder our statute the suit is brought in the name of a person entitled to recover, and to the use of all such parties who may have an interest. Many states require a cause of action to be brought in the name of the personal representative, executor or administrator of the estate. When a wrongful death action is settled by the personal representative, the proceeds are distributed according to statute. An issue is unlikely to arise as to settlements by only one of several beneficiaries who are part of the suit where all are represented by one responsible plaintiff. Unlike most other states, Maryland has two independent causes of action; one claim is in the name of the personal representative for any claim the deceased could have maintained; the other claim is brought on behalf of the surviving heirs or beneficiaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>for their loss resulting from the death of the spouse, parent or child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The Court of Appeals held that, based on the language of the Wrongful Death Act and accompanying rule, settlement by one wrongful death beneficiary requires mutual consent of the other joined beneficiaries or court approval. <em>Id. </em>at 518, 569 A.2d 645. The Court of Appeals concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">When looking to the direction of [C. J.P.] \u00a7 3-904[ ], we are told that \u201conly one action under this subtitle lies in respect to the death of a person.\u201d We are also instructed that, if a recovery or verdict is obtained in this one action, the amount recovered shall be \u201cdivided among the beneficiaries in shares directed by the verdict.\u201d The statutory language does not allow a judgment for one of the beneficiaries to be made a matter of record, as by its very nature, other claims are forever foreclosed or barred. The trial [court] in this case considered the claims of the beneficiaries to be severable. The statute does not. A judgment should not have been entered in the [trial] court unless it included the interests of all of the known beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 523-24, 569 A.2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In <em>Williams v.

The wife brought suit against the defendants, <em>Williams I, </em>as the decedent\u2019s personal representative but two of the decedent\u2019s sons were not named as plaintiffs or use plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 15 A.3d 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Later, the wife\u2019s counsel, now representing the two sons, filed a second lawsuit against the defendants, <em>Williams II, </em>seeking damages for the wrongful death of the decedent. <em>Id. </em>at 448, 995 A.2d 744. A year later, the two sons moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>reopen <em>Williams I </em>and to consolidate it with <em>Williams II, </em>asserting that, \u201cas primary wrongful death beneficiaries, who did not receive any compensation and who had not consented to the settlement in <em>Williams I, </em>they [were] entitled to recover for the wrongful death of their father.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendants filed motions for summary judgment in <em>Williams II, </em>which were granted. <em>Id. </em>at 449-50, 995 A.2d 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">We observed that nothing in the record demonstrated that the sons were named as plaintiffs as required by Maryland Rule 15-1001. <em>Id. </em>at 452, 995 A.2d 744. In discussing the concept of use plaintiffs, we stated that Maryland Rule 15-1001 \u201cis in the nature of a joinder rule or a condition precedent that requires all known statutory beneficiaries, <em>i.e., </em>the real parties in interest, be identified as parties to the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We discussed Maryland Rule 15-1001 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqP\">Although Rule 15\u20141001(b) does not require the statutory beneficiaries to formally join the litigation, \u201call persons who are or may be entitled by law to damages by reason of the wrongful death shall be named as plaintiffs.\u201d The words \u201cto the use of\u2019 simply identify plaintiffs who have not formally joined the action, but, as real parties in interest, they are plaintiffs whose interests must be acknowledged and protected throughout the litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">Although Rule 15-1001(b) does not require formal joinder, the failure to include a known statutory beneficiary as a plaintiff or a \u201cuse plaintiff\u2019 in a wrongful death action and to settle without providing for that beneficiary can be analogized to the failure to join a necessary party in an action where joinder is required. In our view, because of the one action rule, the failure to do so is a \u201cdefect\u201d or \u201cmistake\u201d of jurisdictional proportions in the proceeding, which may be raised at any time. That would be true whether the failure to name the statutory beneficiary as a plaintiff or use plaintiff is attributed to a failure to file or to a clerk\u2019s error in docketing a filed pleading. In a situation where no financial provisions were made for known beneficiaries, the former is in the nature of a jurisdictional mistake and the latter is an irregularity of process or procedure. Either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>would permit, and, in the circumstances of this case, require, opening the judgment to protect the interests of those beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">Here, it appears that the parties did undertake compliance with Rule 15-1001. A copy of the unfiled complaint was sent to the parties and, though not required by the Rule, it was \u201cserved\u201d on Donna. But, even if we treated Rule 15-1001 as having been substantially complied with, the result would again be the same. Rather than looking to Rule 2-535(b), we would, instead, conclude that the judgment ... was not a final judgment under <em>Walker v.

We shall therefore adopt the above quoted portions of the [Court of Special Appeals]\u2019s opinion and affirm the judgment of that Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In <em>Muti, </em>426 Md. at 384-85, 44 A.3d 380 the Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death claims as a sanction for omitting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>decedent\u2019s adopted stepson as a use plaintiff. The decedent, Elliott, died, survived by his widow, Guiseppina, and their children, Tom and David (\u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 363, 44 A.3d 380. After Elliott\u2019s death, the plaintiffs brought a claim for wrongful death, but omitted as a use plaintiff Ricky, the decedent\u2019s adopted stepson from a prior marriage, and did not otherwise notify Ricky of the action. <em>Id. </em>at 362, 44 A.3d 380. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to join a necessary party. <em>Id. </em>at 364, 44 A.3d 380. The plaintiffs did not amend the complaint to name Ricky as a use plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 366, 44 A.3d 380. At a hearing on the motion to dismiss, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that he had been unable to locate Ricky and that he would \u201camend, by relation back, if they found Ricky alive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court granted the motion to dismiss for failure to comply with Maryland Rule 15-1001, <em>i.e. </em>for failure to name Ricky as a use plaintiff. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In <em>Midi, id. </em>at 370-71, 44 A.3d 380 the Court of Appeals discussed the Wrongful Death Act statute of limitations, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">Since at least ... 1925[ ], this Court has construed the time limit in the wrongful death statute to be a substantive provision, that is, a condition precedent to asserting the statutorily created cause of action. A plaintiff who does not assert the cause of action within the statutorily prescribed time, now three years, loses the right to sue a defendant who is not estopped to assert the defense. Even infancy of the plaintiff when a wrongful death claim was asserted and settled by a parent of the plaintiff does not toll the triggering of the timeliness condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">(Citations and footnote omitted). Pursuant to the time limit in the Wrongful Death Act, the Court of Appeals held that Ricky\u2019s claim had expired because, as a beneficiary, he had not brought an action within three years of Elliott\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 376, 44 A.3d 380. The plaintiffs argued that \u201cthe trial court erred by not applying the doctrine of relation back and treating Ricky as having been named as a use plaintiff when [they] filed their action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that the doctrine of relation back would not be applied, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u201cbecause Ricky\u2019s claim ha[d] expired by operation of the three year condition precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376-77, 44 A.3d 380. In other words, \u201crelation back does not apply to wrongful death claims barred by the three year condition precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380-81, 44 A.3d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The Court of Appeals discussed Maryland Rule 15-1001, stating that the purpose of the Rule \u201cis to implement the one-action provision in the statute. The purpose of that provision \u2018is to protect a defendant from being vexed by several suits instituted by or on behalf of different equitable plaintiffs for the same injury when all of the parties could be joined in one proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 44 A.3d 380 (citation and emphasis omitted). As to prejudice to Ricky, the Court of Appeals observed that it was \u201cdifficult to consider how a claim by Ricky could have any value, even if it were timely asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As to the plaintiffs\u2019 duty, the Court of Appeals stated, in no uncertain terms, that the plaintiffs should have identified Ricky as a use plaintiff, despite their lack of knowledge of his whereabouts. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 44 A.3d 380. The Court of Appeals determined that Maryland Rule 15-1001(b) \u201crequires that \u2018all persons who are or may be entitled by law to damages\u2019 be named as plaintiffs. Those beneficiaries who do not join are to be named as use plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the Court of Appeals, the plaintiffs could have named Ricky as a use plaintiff and stated in their complaint that \u201cany address for use plaintiff Ricky was unknown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382, 44 A.3d 380. In so making that representation in a complaint, however, the Court of Appeals stated that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel first had a duty to conduct a good faith and reasonably diligent search for the use plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">In cases in which the identity and location of the beneficiaries is known by the original plaintiffs, there ordinarily should be no difficulty in complying with Rule 15-1001. In cases where the whereabouts of an identified beneficiary are unknown, compliance with the steps outlined above, <em>i. e., </em>identification of the use plaintiff, a bona fide and reasonably diligent search, and advising the court if the original plaintiff has been unable to find a last known address for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>plaintiff, ordinarily should satisfy whatever obligations an original plaintiff has to a use plaintiff that can be derived from [C.J.P.] \u00a7 3-904 or Rule 15-1001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals thus held that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death claims as a sanction for omitting Ricky as a use plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 384-85, 44 A.3d 380. The Court of Appeals remanded the case for consideration of \u201cwhat, if any, sanction for the omission is appropriate from the standpoint of reinforcing for the Bar as a whole the requirement for naming, as a use plaintiff, a potential beneficiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 44 A.3d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In a section labeled <em>\u201cSome Considered Dicta,\u201d </em>in <em>Midi, id. </em>at 384, 44 A.3d 380 the Court of Appeals stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlO\">Even if Ricky had been identified as a use plaintiff when this action was filed, but did not \u201cjoin\u201d as a plaintiff within three years of Elliott\u2019s death, his identification as a use plaintiff would not permit [h]im to join more than three years after Elliott\u2019s death. Rule 15-1001(b) distinguishes between those beneficiaries who join in the action for damages and those, the use plaintiffs, who do not. Use plaintiffs who wish to assert their respective claims for damages must timely join the action by indicating to the court and to the original parties in some clear fashion that they are claiming their \u201cshare.\u201d Ordinarily, this is done by intervening.... Intervention in wrongful death cases is now covered by Rule 2-214.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">[C.J.P.] \u00a7 3-904 and Rule 15-1001 cannot be construed to anoint counsel for the original <em>(i.e. </em>joined) plaintiffs as the attorney for the use plaintiffs as well. By designating potential beneficiaries as use plaintiffs, counsel demonstrates that he or she does not represent them and has no authority to make decisions for them or to present evidence, including proof of damages, on their behalf. To hold otherwise invites grave problems of conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">After the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Mwti, </em>on July 26, 2012, the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>dure issued its 174th Report, including a Notice of Proposed Rules Changes, stating that amendments to Maryland Rule 15-1001 were necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">to conform with holdings in <em>University of Md. Medical Systems [System </em>] <em>v. Muti </em>[426 Md. 358 44 A.3d 380] (2012), including the duty of the named plaintiffs to make a good faith and reasonably diligent effort to identify, locate, and name as \u201cuse plaintiffs\u201d all individuals who may qualify as such, to send a certain notice to such individuals, to require certain action by such individuals who wish to make a claim, and to provide for a waiver of the right of use plaintiffs to make a claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Maryland Rule 15-1001 was amended, effective January 1, 2013. The Rule now requires that a wrongful death complaint state the last known address for each use plaintiff and the party bringing the action state that he or she conducted a good faith and reasonably diligent effort to identify, locate, and name all individuals who might qualify as use plaintiffs. The new Rule requires that notice to the use plaintiffs be achieved through in personam service of process as set forth in Maryland Rule 2-121, whereas the old Rule simply required that a copy of the complaint be sent certified mail to the use plaintiff at his or her last known address and that proof of mailing be filed with the court. The new Rule adds provisions setting forth requirements that use plaintiffs must comply with to make a claim. Significantly, the new Rule requires that a use plaintiff who wishes to make a claim file a complaint or motion to intervene within certain statutory deadlines or risk exclusion from participation in the action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>(3) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Returning to the case at hand, we review the decision to grant or deny the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict <em>de novo. Scapa Dryer Fabrics, Inc. v. Saville, </em>418 Md. 496, 503, 16 A.3d 159 (2011). In agreement with appellant, we conclude that the use plaintiffs, in the four consolidated matters, are not parties to the cases as they failed to join the actions and are, therefore, unable to recover damages. We reverse and vacate the judgments entered against appellant in favor of the use plaintiffs. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The record demonstrates in no uncertain terms that the use plaintiffs never joined the action as party plaintiffs, and that appellees and their counsel misapprehended the need to join the use plaintiffs as party plaintiffs. Although amended complaints were filed identifying the use plaintiffs as use plaintiffs, it is undisputed that the use plaintiffs never filed a motion to intervene, no attorney filed a notice of appearance on behalf of the use plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs never filed amended complaints or amendments by interlineation naming the use plaintiffs as party plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The identification of an individual as a use plaintiff does not designate the individual as a party plaintiff with the right to recover damages for the wrongful death of the decedents. C.J.P. \u00a7 3-904(f) provides that only one action for wrongful death may lie with respect to the death of a person. In keeping with this requirement, Maryland Rule 15-1001(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>required that all individuals \u201cwho are or may be entitled by law to damages by reason of the wrongful death shall be named as plaintiffs whether or not they join in the action. The words \u2018to the use of shall precede the name of any person named as a plaintiff who does not join in the action.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, all possible beneficiaries are to be identified in one action for wrongful death, but all beneficiaries need not be party plaintiffs\u2014they can be use plaintiffs who do not join in the action. As to damages, C.J.P. \u00a7 3-904(c) provides that, in the one action for wrongful death, \u201cdamages may be awarded to the beneficiaries proportioned to the injury resulting from the wrongful death\u201d and \u201cthe amount recovered shall be divided among the beneficiaries in shares directed by the verdict.\u201d The Court of Appeals has held that the claims of the beneficiaries are not severable, and that a judgment may not be entered by a trial court unless it includes the interests of all known beneficiaries. <em>Walker, </em>318 Md. at 523-24, 569 A.2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In <em>Williams, </em>192 Md.App. at 452, 995 A.2d 744, we stated that Maryland Rule 15-1001 was \u201cin the nature of a joinder rule or a condition precedent that require[d] all known statutory beneficiaries, <em>i.e., </em>the real parties in interest, be identified as parties to the litigation.\u201d We explained, however, that Maryland Rule 15-1001 did not require the statutory beneficiaries to \u201cformally join\u201d the action, and stated: \u201cThe words \u2018to the use of simply identify plaintiffs who have not formally joined the action, but, as real parties in interest, they are plaintiffs whose interests must be acknowledged and protected throughout the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 995 A.2d 744. The concept that use plaintiffs are real parties in interest comports with the requirement, pursuant to C.J.P. \u00a7 3\u2014904(f), that only one action for wrongful death may lie\u2014thus, all beneficiaries, all those with a possible stake in the outcome of the case, must be identified in the case, although they need not formally join and take on the mantle of party plaintiff. As we explained in <em>Williams, id. </em>at 460-61, 995 A.2d 744:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">In common law pleading, a \u201cuse plaintiff\u2019 is \u201c[a] plaintiff for whom action is brought in another\u2019s name.\u201d As ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>plained above, Rule 15\u20141001(b) requires that all the statutory beneficiaries be made plaintiffs in a wrongful death action, whether or not they join. When they do not join in the action, they are identified as \u201cuse plaintiffs\u201d and the action proceeds to their use or benefit. All known beneficiaries must be \u201cplaintiffs\u201d under the rule and the court is put on notice that any recovery is for the benefit of all plaintiffs, joined or otherwise, in accordance with their statutory interest, whether that interest is represented by an award of damages as the result of a trial, [C.J.P.] \u00a7 3-904(c), or by a settlement, <em>Walker, </em>318 Md. at 518 [569 A.2d 645],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">(Emphasis added) (footnote and one citation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">As such, it is evident that use plaintiffs are, in fact, different from party plaintiffs in several key respects: (1) use plaintiffs do not join the action, but rather the action proceeds to their use or benefit; (2) use plaintiffs cannot recover damages in their own names as the action is brought to their use or benefit and not in their own name or on their own behalf; and (3) use plaintiffs\u2019 recovery is confined to the methods provided for in C.J.P. \u00a7 3-904(c) in that the recovery awarded for the party plaintiffs is for the benefit of all plaintiffs\u2014party plaintiffs and use plaintiffs. In short, appellees\u2019 contention otherwise\u2014that use plaintiffs are party plaintiffs and need not join the action to recover\u2014is an incorrect assessment of the law. Indeed, appellees\u2019 contention that designation as a use plaintiff accomplishes joinder of the use plaintiff is in conflict with the language of the Rule and case law, which clearly state that a use plaintiff is someone who has not joined the action. This point was made explicit in the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Muti. </em>The Court of Appeals unequivocally stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">Rule 15-1001(b) distinguishes between those beneficiaries who join in the action for damages and those, the use plaintiffs, who do not.

In <em>Bryan v. State Rds.

It is evident in <em>Muti </em>that, by labeling the section <em>\u201cSome Considered Dicta </em>\u201d and by including several paragraphs within the section for the purpose of clarifying the case law on use plaintiffs, the <em>dicta </em>is more than just a \u201ccasual or hurried word[,]\u201d or a \u201cby the way\u201d statement. <em>Bryan, </em>115 Md.App. at 713, 712, 694 A.2d 522 (citation omitted).

Rather, the use plaintiffs were required to timely file an amended complaint, an amendment by interlineation, a motion to intervene, or some other pleading, to identify them as party plaintiffs and not wait until after the close of evidence at trial to make an oral motion to join in the case as was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">As the use plaintiffs did not join the action and did not timely move to join the action, they are now barred from doing so as the statute of limitations in each of the cases has expired. C.J.P. \u00a7 3-904(g) provides a general three year statute of limitations for 'wrongful death actions, requiring that actions for deaths caused by occupational disease be filed within three years after the discovery of the cause of death. Under the Second Amended and Restated Asbestos BI Claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Resolutions Procedures for claims against appellant, the statute of limitations is tolled as follows: claims accruing after November 16, 1985, and prior to August 26, 2009, may be brought against appellant before (1) the expiration of the ninety-day period immediately following September 28, 2010, when the Claims Materials were made public, <em>i.e. </em>December 28, 2010, or (2) the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the claim, whichever is later.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">As to the four cases at issue, the statute of limitations expired on the following dates: (1) In the <em>James </em>case, the statute of limitations expired on December 28, 2010. The record reflects that James died on July 4, 2004. On January 5, 2007, the amended complaint alleged wrongful death due to lung cancer. Accordingly, under C.J.P. \u00a7 3-904(g), the statute of limitations expired, at the latest, on January 5, 2010, three years later. Pursuant to the Claims Resolutions Procedures, however, claims against appellant could be brought against appellant by the expiration of the statute of limitations\u2014here, January 5, 2010\u2014or December 28, 2010, whichever is later. December 28, 2010, is, therefore, the expiration date. (2) In the <em>Lawrence </em>case, the statute of limitations expired on February 21, 2011. Lawrence died on October 8, 2007. On February 21, 2008, the amended complaint alleged wrongful death due to lung cancer. Accordingly, under C.J.P. \u00a7 3\u2014904(g), the statute of limitations expired, at the latest, on February 21, 2011, three years later, and the later date between that and December 28, 2010. (3) In the <em>Carter </em>case, the statute of limitations expired on December 28, 2010. Carter died on November 6, 2003. Prior to his death, on November 27, 2002, Carter filed a complaint alleging an asbestos-related disease. On February 17, 2006, the amended complaint alleged wrongful death due to lung cancer. Accordingly, the three year statute of limitations under C.J.P. \u00a7 3-904(g) expired, at the latest, on February 17, 2009. Pursuant to the Claims Resolutions Procedures, however, claims against appellant could be brought by the expiration of the statute of limitations\u2014here, February 17, 2009\u2014or December 28, 2010, whichever is later. December 28, 2010, is, therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>expiration date. (4) In the <em>Hewitt </em>case, the statute of limitations expired July 24, 2012. Hewitt died on December 20, 2008. Prior to his death, on September 7, 2006, Hewitt filed a complaint alleging asbestosis and an asbestos-related disease. On July 24, 2009, the amended complaint alleged wrongful death due to lung cancer. Accordingly, the three year statute of limitations under C.J.P. \u00a7 3-904(g) expired, at the latest, on July 24, 2012, the later date between that and December 28, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In sum, any claims by the use plaintiffs in their own right as party plaintiffs were required to be asserted by December 28, 2010, as to the <em>James </em>and <em>Carter </em>cases, February 21, 2011, as to the <em>Lawrence </em>case, and July 24, 2012, as to the <em>Hewitt </em>case. The use plaintiffs failed to assert claims as party plaintiffs by any of the above listed dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The use plaintiffs are barred from asserting claims because the doctrine of relation back is not applicable. Although Maryland generally freely permits amendments and relation back to the date of the original filing, \u201c[w]hen amendment is sought to add a <em>new party </em>to the proceedings, that principle is inapplicable because <em>any </em>cause of action as to that party is, of course, a new cause of action.\u201d <em>Grand-Pierre, </em>97 Md.App. at 175-76, 627 A.2d 550 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). In addition, relation back is not applicable in circumstances where the new cause of action involves a \u201cwholly distinct measure of damages,\u201d and \u201cpyramid[s] the amount sought.\u201d <em>Morrell v. Williams, </em>279 Md. 497, 507-08, 366 A.2d 1040 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In this case, amending the complaints would involve adding the fifteen use plaintiffs as new party plaintiffs bringing new causes of action and increasing the overall amount of damages sought. As such, the doctrine of relation back to the original filings of the amended complaints is not applicable. Indeed, the Court of Appeals explicitly stated in <em>Muti, </em>426 Md. at 380-81, 44 A.3d 380 \u201crelation back does not apply to wrongful death claims barred by the three year condition precedent.\u201d It is evident, therefore, that the statute of limitations, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>four cases, has expired. The use plaintiffs are time-barred at this point from asserting wrongful death claims against appellant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and vacate the judgments entered against appellant in favor of the use plaintiffs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in the <em>Hewitt </em>case by refusing to instruct the jury as to apportionment of damages and by excluding its expert\u2019s testimony on the issue of apportionment. Appellant argues that this Court has previously permitted apportionment pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts Section 433A \u201cwhen a reasonable basis exists to apportion damages between two or more causes of injury.\u201d Appellant asserts that the principle of apportionment of damages is not a subset of comparative fault, as apportionment is decided \u201cwithout regard to fault or negligence by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Relying on <em>Dafler v.

Appellees contend that \u201cMaryland law does not allow for comparative fault or apportionment of damages for asbestos-related cancers[.]\u201d Appellees argue that appellant\u2019s reliance on New Jersey law is not dispositive as New Jersey follows a form of comparative fault, while Maryland does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">As to Dr. Kerby\u2019s testimony, appellees contend as follows: \u201cBecause Maryland is not a comparative fault state, the Court need not address the issues raised in [appellant\u2019s Dr. Kerby section.\u201d As to the merits, appellees argue that appellant failed to present a sufficient factual basis to support Dr. Kerby\u2019s opinions, and, therefore, the circuit court properly excluded the doctor\u2019s testimony on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">In a reply brief, appellant contends that appellees confuse apportionment with comparative fault. Appellant argues that apportionment may be appropriate even where comparative fault is not available. Appellant asserts that \u201c[t]he question is whether a reasonable basis exists to allow for apportionment, not whether it is proven with precision and exactitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">(2) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 433A, entitled \u201cApportionment of Harm to Causes,\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>(1) Damages for harm are to be apportioned among two or more causes where</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">(a) there are distinct harms, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">(b) there is a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">(2) Damages for any other harm cannot be apportioned among two or more causes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Comment a to Section 433A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">The rules stated in this Section apply whenever two or more causes have combined to bring about harm to the plaintiff, and each has been a substantial factor in producing the harm, as stated in \u00a7\u00a7 431 and 433.

The Superior Court discussed the principle of apportionment generally, noting that apportionment of damages among multiple causes is \u201ca well-recognized tort principle\u201d and embodied in the Restatement (Second) of Torts Section 433A. <em>Id. </em>at 141. The Superior Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">Once it is determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct has been a cause of some damage suffered by the plaintiff, a further question may arise as to the portion of the total damage sustained which may properly be assigned to the defendant, as distinguished from other causes. The question is primarily not one of the fact of causation, but of the feasibility and practical convenience of splitting up the total harm into separate parts which may be attributed to each of two or more causes. Where a factual basis can be found for some rough practical apportionment, which limits a defendant\u2019s liability to that part of the harm of which that defendant\u2019s conduct has been a cause in fact, it is likely that the apportionment will be made. Where no such basis can be found, the courts generally hold the defendant for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>entire loss, notwithstanding the fact that other causes have contributed to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 142 (quoting Prosser and Keeton, <em>Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 52, at 345 (5th ed.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The Superior Court held that the \u201cburden of proving that the harm is capable of apportionment is on the party seeking it[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142. The Superior Court observed that, although the issue of apportionment in asbestos and cigarette industry cases presented was one of first impression, New Jersey courts had approved apportionment of damages in other circumstances, including a worker\u2019s compensation case and a medical malpractice case. <em>Id. </em>at 144. As an aside, the Superior Court observed that apportionment was consistent with the principles of the state\u2019s Comparative Negligence Act. <em>Id. </em>at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Apportionment of damages has also been applied under federal law, specifically in cases where an employee seeks relief pursuant to the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (\u201cFELA\u201d) for injuries sustained during the course of employment. For example, in <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Bickerstaff, </em>187 Md.App. 187, 249, 978 A.2d 760, <em>cert, denied, </em>411 Md. 600, 984 A.2d 244 (2009), a FELA case, this Court discussed the issue of damages, observing that there was a \u201clong line of FELA case law in which courts permitted the apportionment of damages for non-negligent causes.\u201d (Citations omitted). In <em>Bickerstajf, id. </em>at 250-51, 978 A.2d 760, we determined that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on apportionment in a FELA case \u201cmay constitute reversible error[.]\u201d This Court stated, however, that to warrant giving an instruction on apportionment of damages, there must be sufficient evidence adduced at trial to support the instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 251, 978 A.2d 760. We described sufficient evidence as follows: \u201c[A] defendant need only produce \u2018some evidence to support its proposed apportionment instruction\u2019 and is \u2018not required to demonstrate an exact percentage\u2019 or a \u2018mathematical proportion\u2019 representing the likelihood of the causal relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>(3) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Returning to the matter at hand, we conclude that the circuit court erred in the <em>Hewitt </em>case in refusing to instruct the jury as to apportionment of damages and by excluding Dr. Kerby\u2019s testimony on the issue of apportionment. In opposing Dr. Kerby\u2019s testimony and an instruction on apportionment, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argued only that apportionment was not possible and that trial courts have not addressed apportionment of damages for smoking in asbestos cases. Rather than considering whether Dr. Kerby\u2019s testimony supported the giving of an apportionment instruction, the circuit court expressed doubt about the jury\u2019s ability to apportion damages and stated that the \u201ceffort to apportion doesn\u2019t really work[.]\u201d In our view, both the circuit court and appellees misunderstood the concept of apportionment, and Maryland case law on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We begin by stating that the issue of apportionment concerns causation, not comparative negligence as appellees urge this Court to determine. Comparative fault or comparative negligence involves determination of the relative percentages of fault between joint <em>tortfeasors\u2014i.e. </em>in a negligence action, comparative negligence involves looking at the respective duties and breaches of the joint tortfeasors. Such a system necessarily requires that a jury consider the actions of the joint tortfeasors leading up to the injury to determine whether both were at fault and, if so, how much of the fault each joint tortfeasor should shoulder. Maryland has explicitly rejected adopting comparative fault or comparative negligence in favor of maintaining contributory negligence. <em>See Franklin v. Morrison, </em>350 Md. 144, 167-68, 711 A.2d 177 (1998); <em>Harrison v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Ed., </em>295 Md. 442, 463, 456 A.2d 894 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Apportionment of damages, on the other hand, involves instances where there are two or more causes and a reasonable basis exists for determining the contribution of each cause to a single <em>harm\u2014i.e. </em>in a negligence action, apportionment of damages involves looking at the causes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the injury, not the duties and breaches of the tortfeasors. Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 433A(l)(b). Under apportionment, the relative fault of the parties is not considered and the doctrine applies \u201cwhenever two or more causes have combined to bring about harm to the plaintiff[.]\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 433A, cmt. a. This Court has adopted and applied apportionment of damages in certain cases. <em>See Bickerstaff, </em>187 Md.App. at 249-51, 978 A.2d 760 (a FELA case); Gress, 150 Md.App. at 388-89, 388 n. 11, 820 A.2d 616 (an asbestos cases with asbestos industry and cigarette industry defendants); <em>Mayer, </em>145 Md.App. at 249-50, 254-55, 802 A.2d 483 (a medical negligence case). Thus, the doctrines of apportionment of damages and comparative fault/negligence are distinct and involve different considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Under relevant Maryland case law and the Restatement (Second) of Torts, apportionment of damages between several causes of an injury is appropriate in certain circumstances. Pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 433A(1), apportionment of damages between two or more causes is appropriate \u201cwhere (a) there are distinct harms, or (b) there is a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm.\u201d Multiple causes may include the combination of acts of two or more parties, an innocent act and a negligent act, or an aggravation of a preexisting injury. Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 433A, cmt. a.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Although not binding authority, we find persuasive the Superior Court of New Jersey\u2019s opinion in <em>Dafler, </em>a ease involving a similar factual scenario as that presented in this case. In <em>Dafler, </em>611 A.2d at 138, the Superior Court of New Jersey affirmed the jury\u2019s award which apportioned damages as to the plaintiffs lung cancer, finding that 70% of the damage was caused by the plaintiffs cigarette smoking and that 30% of the damage was caused by the defendant\u2019s use of asbestos products in shipbuilding. Notably, in <em>Dafler, id. </em>at 140\u201441, both parties presented expert testimony on the issue of apportionment. In <em>Dafler, id. </em>at 140, the plaintiff suffered a single harm\u2014lung cancer\u2014caused by a six-year occupation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>al exposure to asbestos and a forty-five year long cigarette smoking habit. In concluding that the issue of apportionment of damages was properly submitted to the jury, the Superior Court of New Jersey emphasized that the result was \u201crational and fair\u201d and certainly \u201cfairer than requiring defendant to shoulder the entire causative burden where its contribution in fact was not likely even close to 100%.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146. The Superior Court\u2019s determination involving apportionment was not grounded in principles of comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In this case, Hewitt suffered a single harm\u2014lung cancer. He experienced an occupational exposure to asbestos through his work as a laborer, mechanic steamfitter and pipe fitter at the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1943 to 1944, and as a laborer and crane operator at Bethlehem Steel from 1946 to the late 1970s. Notably, from 1943 until his death in 2008, Hewitt smoked cigarettes at a rate of a half a pack to a pack per day. According to appellant\u2019s proffer, had Dr. Kerby been permitted to testify, he would have rendered the opinion that occupational exposure to asbestos and cigarette smoking were substantial contributing factors to Hewitt\u2019s lung cancer, and that the ratio of relative risk for each to the development of lung cancer was three to one, cigarette smoking to asbestos. Dr. Kerby would have testified that Hewitt\u2019s cigarette smoking contributed 75% toward his lung cancer and that Hewitt\u2019s occupational exposure to asbestos contributed 25% toward his lung cancer. Due to the circuit court\u2019s mistaken belief that apportionment of damages was not possible and not permitted, Dr. Kerby\u2019s testimony was excluded. That was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In sum, we conclude that the circuit court erred in excluding Dr. Kerby\u2019s testimony and, without considering the testimony, erred in refusing to instruct on apportionment of damages. We reverse the judgments entered against appellant in favor of the plaintiffs in the <em>Hewitt </em>case and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that suppliers and installers have a duty to inspect, test, and analyze the products they supply or install as such a duty is imposed on manufacturers, not suppliers and installers.

Balbos, </em>326 Md. 179, 186, 604 A.2d 445 (1992), a case involving the deaths of two former shipyard workers caused by malignant mesothelioma resulting from inhalation of microscopic asbestos fibers, the Court of Appeals discussed whether a nonmanufacturing supplier has a duty to inspect or test a product. In <em>Balbos, id. </em>at 198-99, 604 A.2d 445, the Court of Appeals noted that the Restatement (Second) of Torts applied different standards of knowledge to manufacturers and nonmanufacturing suppliers as to whether their products are dangerous or defective, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">In order to hold a retailer or other nonmanufacturing supplier liable on a negligence theory, a plaintiff must prove that the supplier knew or had \u201creason to know\u201d of the danger of the product. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 388(a), 399, 401 &amp; comment <em>a, </em>402[.] ...

The Court of Appeals concluded: \u201cWe now hold that, as to a supplier-installer, it is not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 604 A.2d 445. In so concluding, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">The nonmanufacturing supplier, however, may do something more than merely act as a conduit of goods, and those additional acts may impose a higher standard of care upon the supplier. <em>See Kaplan v. Stein, </em>198 Md. 414, 421-22, 84 A.2d 81, 84-85 (1951) (car dealer had duty to inspect used car that it loaned to customer who had returned purchased car for repair)[.] ... In this case, Porter was not merely a conduit of goods. Porter not only supplied asbestos products to the shipyards, its employees also installed those products, and that installation created danger to other workers. In many cases retailer-installers have been held to a duty to inspect or test a product, although the standard of care is not necessarily as high as that imposed on a manufacturer. 2 Frumer &amp; Friedman, <em>[Products Liabili</em>ty], \u00a7 6.03[4], at 6\u201448, 6-54; <em>see </em>Harper &amp; James, <em>[The Law of Torts </em>], \u00a7 28.29, at 557 (arguing for a rule that would hold sellers to a duty of discovering defects that could be revealed by inspection, as opposed to mechanical testing); <em>Seller\u2019s Duty, [To Test or Inspect as Affecting His Liability for Produet-Causal Injury, </em>6 A.L.R.3d 12], \u00a7 8 [ (1996) ].

In <em>ACandS, id. </em>at 700-01, 710 A.2d 944, the trial court instructed the jury with instructions almost identical to the instructions at issue in this case concerning the duties of nonmanufacturing suppliers and installers. We held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">With these instructions, [the trial court] made clear that the jury was to determine whether, in light of their particular skills, knowledge, or expertise, certain nonmanufacturing defendants had a duty to discover\u2014or should have known of\u2014the dangers of their products by familiarizing themselves with nonobscure literature. It was not necessary for the judge to provide further instruction\u2014it was for the jury to determine whether a particular defendant had the enhanced duty.

[I]n certain cases, the mere inability of a reviewing court to rule out prejudice, given the facts of the case, may be enough to declare an error reversible.

In <em>Pitts, id. </em>at 393, 38 A.3d 445 we nonetheless held that the jury instruction was harmless \u201c[ajbsent evidence of any prejudice, confusion, or even a question by the jury as to the instruction!)]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">(3) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In this case, upon review of the circuit court\u2019s instructions as a whole, we are not persuaded that the circuit court abused its discretion or erred in instructing the jury on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>duties owed by manufacturers and nonmanufacturer suppliers/installers and on state of the art. The circuit court instructed the jury as to all of the applicable law. The circuit court instructed the jury that the duty of the \u201cnon manufacturer supplier to warn plaintiffs is different under some circumstances than the duty of a manufacturer!,]\u201d and that an installer-supplier may be under a duty to discover the products it installed were dangerous if the installer-supplier\u2019s employees installed the products and the installer created a danger to other workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In <em>Balbos, </em>326 Md. at 203, 604 A.2d 445, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cIn many cases retailer-installers!, who act as more than a conduit of goods,] have been held to a duty to inspect or test a product, although the standard of care is not necessarily as high as that imposed on a manufacturer. It appears that in most of those cases, however, the retailer-installer has been negligent in the installation itself.\u201d (Citations omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, a retailer-installer who acts as more than a conduit of goods has a duty to inspect or test a product, even in circumstances where the installation of the product was not negligent. Here, the evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that W &amp; G was an installer of asbestos-containing products\u2014it performed contracting and sales activities throughout Maryland, and its employees went on site at other companies to perform installation jobs. W &amp; G was not simple a middleman in the process, it was an active installer. A defendant\u2019s installation activity, in addition to sales of products manufactured by others, is a proper basis on which to hold the defendant to a higher \u201cshould have known\u201d standard generally applicable to a manufacturer as the \u201cstandard considers what reasonably should have been discovered in light of the supplier\u2019s peculiar opportunity and competence as a dealer in the particular type of chattel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203-04, 604 A.2d 445. Upon reviewing the instructions as a whole, we perceive no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the limited language complained of\u2014\u201c[t]he manufacturer supplier or installer is under a duty to use ordinary care to test, analyze, and inspect the products it ... sells, supplies, or installs\u201d\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>gave rise to the implication that the jury was required to find that appellant breached a duty to inspect, test, or analyze, or that appellant\u2019s duty as an installer-supplier was somehow improperly equated with that of a manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Alternatively, we observe that to establish that an erroneous instruction warrants reversal, appellant bears the burden of demonstrating prejudice. <em>Barksdale, </em>419 Md. at 669, 20 A.3d 765. Here, despite contentions to the contrary, appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice. The circuit court correctly instructed the jury as to the duties owed by nonmanufacturer installer-suppliers, and how, under certain circumstances, the nonmanufacturer installer-supplier can be held to a higher standard of care if the installer-supplier undertakes certain actions. In the midst of the instructions, the circuit court gave the brief instruction at issue. The instruction was not repeated or elaborated upon, and the circuit court continued instructing the jury. Appellant does not contend that the instruction was an incorrect statement of law as to the duty owed by a manufacturer. Rather, appellant contends that the instruction improperly equated W &amp; G\u2019s duty as an installer-supplier with that of a manufacturer. We note, however, that, at trial, appellant had ample opportunity to present\u2014and did present\u2014evidence demonstrating that W &amp; G was an installer-supplier that did not manufacture or design the asbestos-containing products it installed and repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">From the voluminous record in the case, one of the only references we find concerning the instruction is an indirect reference by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in closing argument, stating that when W &amp; G\u2019s files were combed through after it ceased operations in 1984, \u201c[tjhere was no testing information [found]\u201d and the \u201cfiles were incomplete.\u201d The record reveals, however, that the parties previously had entered into a stipulation, which was read into the record, and included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">[W &amp; G] ceased operations in 1984. A review of the [W &amp; G] files after operations ceased was conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>1, no medical or scientific literature on the hazards of asbestos was found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">Number 4, no documents reflecting testing of insulation materials were located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">Number 5, no documents reflected studies of insulation products and the levels of asbestos given off by working with the products were located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s reference in closing argument to the lack of records regarding testing information was simply a restatement of the stipulation between the parties. Under this circumstance, we find it difficult to discern how the reference in closing argument to the lack of testing documentation was prejudicial. Appellant fails, on brief, to provide a reference to any other argument made by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel \u201cciting the lack of testing,\u201d and we decline to comb through the record to substantiate appellant\u2019s claim. There were no questions from the jury as to the erroneous instruction<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or any indication that the jury focused on the erroneous instruction. Other than the instruction being given, amidst numerous other instructions, the record is devoid of any basis to support appellant\u2019s contention of prejudice. \u201cAbsent evidence of any prejudice, confusion, or even a question by the jury as to the instruction,\u201d <em>Pitts, </em>203 Md.App. at 393, 38 A.3d 445 we conclude that any alleged error with the jury instruction as to the duty to test, inspect, and analyze was harmless, and does not warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED, IN PART, AND REVERSED, IN PART, AS STATED IN THE OPINION.
