Unable thereafter to manage her financial affairs due to the side effects of her surgery and her Parkinson\u2019s disease, she consented to the appointment of a guardian over her property by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Two years later, believing that she had sufficiently recovered to resume control over her affairs, she urged the court-appointed guardian of her property to request a hearing, before the Montgomery County circuit court, to determine whether the property guardianship should be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">After a hearing was held, as requested, the Montgomery County circuit court denied her request to terminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>guardianship. That decision prompted this appeal, which presents three issues. Rephrased so as to facilitate review, they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">I. Whether the circuit court applied an incorrect legal standard in deciding to continue the guardianship of the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in failing to consider a less restrictive alternative to guardianship; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">III. Whether there was sufficient evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s decision to continue the guardianship of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Because we conclude that the circuit court did not apply the correct legal standard in declining to terminate the guardianship of Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s property, we vacate that decision and remand for further proceedings. On remand, it is our view that the circuit court may consider less restrictive alternatives to a full guardianship of property, if it deems such a course of action fitting and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Ms. Rosenberg was born in 1942. After earning a Ph.D. in French, she was employed as a professor of French and German at the University of Tennessee. Then, after moving to Washington, D.C., and earning a law degree, she worked as an attorney for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, where she specialized in federal contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">When Ms. Rosenberg was 54 years old, she was diagnosed as suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease. During the ten-year period that followed, her condition deteriorated, and, despite \u201cmassive doses\u201d of medication, her symptoms worsened. As a consequence, her neurologist, Thomas Hyde, M.D., suggested that she undergo \u201cdeep brain stimulation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>When she was admitted to Suburban Hospital, in the summer of 2008, for that procedure, two physicians examined her \u201cto determine whether she was competent to consent to medical treatment and handle her financial matters.\u201d After they found that she was competent to consent to medical treatment, though not competent to manage her finances, they obtained her consent to undergo deep brain stimulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Following that surgery, Ms. Rosenberg experienced, in the words of Dr. Hyde, \u201csome postoperative medical problems that impaired her cognitive function\u201d; in fact, she was, at least initially, \u201cmuch worse off after the surgery than ... before.\u201d When the time came to discharge her to \u201can acute rehabilitation facility,\u201d the hospital filed a petition, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, seeking the appointment of \u201ca temporary and permanent guardian of the property\u201d for Ms. Rosenberg. A guardian was necessary, the hospital opined, \u201cto manage Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s finances and property to assist in creating a discharge plan\u201d and then \u201cto consent to decisions regarding long term care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The hospital further stated that Robert McCarthy, Esquire, appellee, was willing to serve as temporary and permanent guardian of Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s property and was qualified for appointment under Maryland law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that Ria Rochvarg, Esquire, was \u201cwilling to serve as the attorney for [Ms. Rosenberg] if appointed by the Court.\u201d The circuit court promptly entered orders appointing Ms. Rochvarg as counsel to represent Ms. Rosenberg and Mr. McCarthy as the temporary guardian of her property. Although Ms. Rochvarg, as counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>for Ms. Rosenberg, initially requested that the guardianship petition be denied, Ms. Rosenberg ultimately consented to an order appointing Mr. McCarthy as the guardian of her property*</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Mr. McCarthy, in his words, acted as \u201ca heavy-handed guardian of the property\u201d and, as he later admitted, \u201ca pseudo-guardian of the person\u201d (presumably, he meant \u201cquasi-guardian\u201d). He hired Ms. Felice Grunberger, a social worker, to act as his \u201cprivate case manager\u201d and to make sure that Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s needs were addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">While Mr. McCarthy saw the guardianship as indefinite, Ms. Rosenberg did not. In her view, the arrangement was temporary and solely one that applied to her property and not her person. In fact, she claimed that when she discussed the matter with Ms. Rochvarg, she was advised by her that it \u201cshould take about three months to recover and then [they] could have the guardianship dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">After Ms. Rosenberg was discharged from Suburban Hospital, she was admitted to a rehabilitation hospital and then a nursing home and, after that, an assisted-living facility. The following year, as Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s condition gradually improved, it was agreed that she would move to an apartment in Washington, D.C. Mr. McCarthy signed the lease for Ms. Rosenberg. Assisted by Ms. Grunberger, as well as an aide, who visited three days a week, four or five hours at a time, Ms. Rosenberg began living in the apartment in July 2010. Ms. Grunberger, among other things, monitored Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s medications, as she was then taking eight different medications for various illnesses,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the aide helped her to shop for groceries and to perform such routine chores as preparing meals, grooming, bathing, and dressing.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">At some point, Ms. Rosenberg felt she was now capable of living on her own. Mr. McCarthy felt otherwise. In a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>to \u201cinterested persons,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> dated August 2, 2010, Mr. McCarthy wrote that the move to the Washington, D.C., apartment would, in his view, \u201cbe a complete disaster,\u201d as Ms. Rosenberg both lacked \u201cthe capacity to organize her own affairs\u201d and suffered from \u201cvery poor judgment.\u201d Ms. Rosenberg could live independently, he opined, but it would require the help of \u201ctwenty-four hour aides\u201d at a prohibitive cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Predictably, Ms. Rosenberg had an entirely different view of her capabilities. Asserting that she was now able to handle the challenge of independent living, she urged Mr. McCarthy to seek a review hearing before the circuit court for the purpose of determining whether the guardianship should be terminated, and, thereafter, he filed a motion to set a review hearing \u201cfor the possible modification and/or termination\u201d of her guardianship. A hearing was held, at Mr. McCarthy\u2019s request, on July 27, 2010. At that time, the circuit court, at Mr. McCarthy\u2019s suggestion, appointed Patricia T. Nay, M.D., to perform an independent medical evaluation of Ms. Rosenberg to \u201cdetermine\u201d if she had \u201crecovered from the disability requiring [the] imposition\u201d of the guardianship \u201cto an extent\u201d that it was now \u201cappropriate\u201d to terminate that guardianship. Upon making that appointment, the court ordered that, after Dr. Nay\u2019s report was completed, a hearing be held on Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s motion to terminate guardianship. The court then declared that, at that hearing, Dr. Nay\u2019s report would be admitted as substantive evidence and that no testimony from Dr. Nay or any other person need be taken, though, it added, Dr. Nay could be \u201csubpoenaed by any party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>In late September 2010, four weeks before the scheduled hearing, Dr. Nay submitted her independent medical evaluation. In the summary of that report, Dr. Nay opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">Mrs. Rosenberg has dementia secondary to Parkinson\u2019s disease and self neglect. She has impaired executive functioning. Her overall situation is exacerbated by her narcissism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">She can make and communicate only simple and limited decisions concerning her person and property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">She requires a guardian of property and a guardian of person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">She requires 24-hour supervision in a structured environment at this time to keep her safe and meet her needs. If that is her apartment, then she requires 24-hour private duty caregivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">She does not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of a guardianship of person or property and cannot consent to the appointment of a guardian.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Several days after the submission of that evaluation, Ira E. Zimmerman, Esquire, entered his appearance on behalf of Ms. Rosenberg, and, shortly thereafter, at the scheduled motions hearing, he indicated that he wanted to call Dr. Hyde to the stand. To enable him to do so, the hearing was then rescheduled for January 4, 2011. At that hearing, Dr. Hyde opined that, although Ms. Rosenberg \u201chas some cognitive limitations,\u201d they do not \u201crise to the level of incompetency\u201d and that she does not presently suffer from dementia. Rather, in Dr. Hyde\u2019s view, Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s \u201cpoor judgment is not any worse than multiple people in our society who are deemed not to be incompetent.\u201d He did caution, however, \u201cthat she needs assistance\u201d and that she should \u201cmaintain the aide ... and the case worker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Cheryl Floyd, Esquire, a trial attorney employed by the United States Department of Justice and a friend of Ms. Rosenberg for nearly thirty years, also testified at the hearing. Ms. Floyd stated that she would be willing to serve as attorney-in-fact for Ms. Rosenberg, \u201cin the event that Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Rosenberg was hospitalized or for some other reason could not continue to handle her finances.\u201d She declined, however, to offer to serve as a guardian of Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">At the conclusion of the January 4th hearing, the circuit court denied Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s motion to terminate the guardianship of her property, observing that, as it was not considering \u201cwhether to establish a guardianship\u201d but only whether to terminate one, it was not required to apply a clear and convincing evidence standard. It then said that its decision was \u201ccontrolled by the statute,\u201d that is, \u00a7 13-221 of the Estates and Trusts Article, which merely required it to determine \u201cwhether there has been a cessation of the disability.\u201d And, in making that determination, the circuit court asserted that it should consider \u201cwhat is in the best interest of Ms. Rosenberg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">After hearing the testimony of Dr. Hyde and considering the report of Dr. Nay, the independent medical examiner, the court thus stated that it did not \u201chave some comfort and reliance that [Ms. Rosenberg] is indeed in a position to manage her affairs and to manage her property\u201d and denied Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s request to terminate the guardianship. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">At the outset, we note what is and what is not at issue before us. Ms. Rosenberg raises several contentions of error, based upon her interpretation of the Maryland statutory scheme addressing guardianships of property, namely, Title 13, Subtitle 2 of the Estates and Trusts Article. She does not, however, contend that that statutory scheme violates her constitutional right to due process of law. Consequently, our analysis shall focus on statutory (and rule) interpretation, and we will refrain from exploring in detail any due process issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Ms. Rosenberg contends that the circuit court erred in failing to require Mr. McCarthy, the guardian of her property, to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the guardian<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ship of her property should be continued. Although Maryland Code, \u00a7 13-221 of the Estates and Trusts Article (\u201cET\u201d), is, in her words, \u201csilent as to the standard of proof and as to who bears the burden of persuasion,\u201d she maintains that <em>In re Lee, </em>132 Md.App. 696, 714, 754 A.2d 426 (2000), is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In that case, this Court declared that, before a guardianship of the person may be imposed, the petitioner must establish by clear and convincing evidence the \u201cneed\u201d for such a guardianship. <em>Id. </em>at 714, 754 A.2d 426. The same standard, Ms. Rosenberg maintains, should be imposed on the party (in this case Mr. McCarthy) seeking to continue the guardianship. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Termination of a guardianship of property falls under ET \u00a7 13-221, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">(a) Petition to terminate.\u2014The minor or disabled person, his personal representative, the guardian, or any other interested person may petition the court to terminate the guardianship proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">(b) Cause for termination.\u2014A guardianship proceeding shall terminate upon:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">(1) The cessation of the minority or disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">(2) The death or presumptive death of the minor or disabled person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">(3) Transfer of all the assets of the estate to a foreign fiduciary; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">(4) Other good cause for termination as may be shown to the satisfaction of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">(c) Rights and procedures.\u2014Termination and final distribution of the estate of a former minor or disabled person shall be made in compliance with the provisions of the Maryland Rules, applying to a fiduciary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">ET \u00a7 13-221.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">This statute simply states that the \u201cminor or disabled person, his personal representative, the guardian, or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>interested person may petition the court to terminate the guardianship proceedings\u201d and that a guardianship \u201cshall terminate\u201d upon the occurrence of any of a list of triggering events, which includes the \u201ccessation of the disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 13-221(a)-(b). Subsection (b)(4), a catch-all provision, states that a guardianship shall terminate upon \u201c[o]ther good cause for termination as may be shown to the satisfaction of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In the context of a revocation of probation hearing, which, like the case at bar, \u201cis a civil proceeding,\u201d <em>Gibson v. State, </em>328 Md. 687, 690, 616 A.2d 877 (1992), the Court of Appeals has held that \u201creferences in our decisions to the reasonable satisfaction of the trial court mean that the trial judge must find the essential facts ... by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Wink v. State, </em>317 Md. 330, 340-41, 563 A.2d 414 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Although the \u201csatisfaction of the court\u201d language appears only in subsection (b)(4), which might suggest that it is applicable only to that subsection, we have no reason to conclude that a different quantum of evidence would apply to subsections (1) through (3). <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>413 Md. 287, 297, 992 A.2d 446 (2010) (observing that \u201ccourt may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application\u201d) (citations omitted). Indeed, it is fair and reasonable to assume that the \u201csatisfaction of the court\u201d standard enunciated in subsection (b)(4) was intended to apply to all four subsections, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We find further support for this interpretation in <em>Wink, </em>317 Md. at 338, 563 A.2d 414 (emphasis added), where the Court of Appeals said: \u201cHere, as in civil cases generally, [the legally requisite] degree [of persuasiveness] is only that the fact finder conclude that the existence of the fact sought to be proved is more likely than unlikely.\u201d In other words, the general rule in civil cases is that a matter at issue must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 423, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979), and nothing in ET \u00a7 13-221 states or even suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Moreover, we must assume that, if the General Assembly had intended that a clear and convincing standard was to apply to a question whether a guardianship of the property should be terminated, it would have said so, as it did when it addressed the appointment and the termination of a guardianship of the person. <em>Compare </em>ET \u00a7 13-221 (termination of guardianship of property) <em>with </em>ET \u00a7 13-705<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (appointment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>guardian of person) <em>and </em>ET \u00a7 13\u2014708(b)(7)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (termination of guardianship of person) (providing for \u201chearing, similar to that provided for in \u00a7 13-705 of this subtitle\u201d). The absence of such language in ET \u00a7 13-221 leaves us to conclude that the evidentiary standard for terminating a guardianship of property is a preponderance of the evidence and not clear and convincing evidence, even though we confess that, on occasion, and some would suggest even more often than that, a guardianship of the property amounts to a guardianship of the person. As Ms. Rosenberg has not raised any constitutional challenge to the Maryland statutes concerning guardianships of property, we simply have no basis upon which to read a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard into ET \u00a7 13-221.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We turn now to consider who, that is, which party bears the burden of proof, in a proceeding to terminate a guardianship of property. Subsection (c) of ET \u00a7 13-221 instructs that termination \u201cshall be made in compliance with the provisions of the Maryland Rules, applying to a fiduciary,\u201d that is, Title 10 of the Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>When we turn to Title 10, we find, in Rule 10-305, that a \u201cguardianship of the property shall be administered pursuant to Rules 10-702 through 10-712.\u201d Among those procedural precepts is a rule governing the termination of a fiduciary estate: Rule 10-710. It provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">(b) Time for Filing-Who May File. Within 45 days after the fiduciary discovers that the grounds for termination exist, the fiduciary shall file a petition requesting the court to terminate the estate. Thereafter, if the fiduciary has not timely filed the petition, an interested person may file a petition requesting the court to terminate the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">(d) Contents. The petition shall be signed and verified by the petitioner and shall contain the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">(1) the petitioner\u2019s interest in the estate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">(2) the name and address of each interested person entitled to notice of the petition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">(3) a statement of facts establishing the grounds for termination; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">(4) documentation as set forth in this Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">(e) Documentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">(3) Medical Certificate. If the cause for the termination of the guardianship of the property of a disabled person is the cessation of the disability, the petitioner shall file with the petition a certificate, signed by a physician who has examined the person within 21 days of the filing of the petition, attesting to the cessation of the disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">It is clear that neither ET \u00a7 13-221 nor Rule 10-710 specify who bears the burden of proof.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>has held that, when the \u201cplain text\u201d of a statute \u201cis silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion,\u201d it \u201cbegin[s] with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims,\u201d <em>Schaffer v. Weast, </em>546 U.S. 49, 56, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005), it has also said that this \u201cordinary default rule ... admits of exceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 126 S.Ct. 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We think that such an exception should apply here, as a guardianship of property is a substantial interference with a ward\u2019s liberty interest. Specifically, ET \u00a7 13-213 provides that \u201c[a]ll the provisions of \u00a7 15-102 of this article with respect to the powers of a fiduciary and the manner of exercise of those powers are applicable to a guardian [of property].\u201d Then, turning to ET \u00a7 15-102, we find that a guardian of property, as a fiduciary, has very broad powers over a ward\u2019s property, including, to name just a few, the power to \u201cinvest in, sell, mortgage, exchange, or lease any property, real or personal\u201d; to borrow money; to retain any assets owned by the ward; to \u201creceive assets from any sources\u201d; to deposit funds for the ward\u2019s account; to \u201csell or exercise stock subscription, conversion or option rights\u201d and to vote securities; and to \u201cexercise any inter vivos power which the minor or disabled person could have exercised under an instrument, including the power to sell, mortgage, or lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 (c), (d), (f), (g), (j), (k), (n), (x). Thus, a ward, under a guardianship of property, suffers a substantial diminution of liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Rule 10-710, however, suggests the course we should follow. Subsection (e)(3) of that rule requires that the petitioner wishing to terminate a guardianship of property on the grounds that the disability, which justified the imposition of that guardianship, has ceased or, as in this case, substantially diminished, file \u201ca certificate, signed by a physician who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>examined the person within 21 days of the filing of the petition, attesting to the cessation of the disability.\u201d We hold that, once the ward satisfies this provision, the burden of proof shifts to the guardian to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the disability has not ceased and that, if the guardian does not meet this burden, the court should order that the guardianship of property be terminated. Such a burden-shifting is \u201cparticularly appropriate ... where the guardianship,\u201d as here, \u201cwas voluntarily imposed with no contested hearing.\u201d <em>In re Hedin, </em>528 N.W.2d 567, 581 (Iowa 1995).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Ms. Rosenberg next contends that the circuit court erred in not considering a less restrictive alternative to guardianship of her property. In support of this claim, Ms. Rosenberg directs our attention to ET \u00a7 13-705, the statute governing the appointment of a guardian of the person. Admittedly, that statute does require a circuit court to explore less restrictive alternatives to appointment of a guardian of the person. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 (b). But, ET \u00a7 13-201,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the statute governing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>appointment of a guardian of the property, and ET \u00a7 13-221, governing termination of such a guardianship, do not. Thus, there is no statutory requirement that a circuit court consider any less restrictive alternatives to a guardianship of the property, and the court below did not err in failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We observe, however, that nothing in ET \u00a7\u00a7 13-201 and 13-221 prohibits a circuit court from considering less restrictive alternatives to a full and complete guardianship of property, and a court would certainly not abuse its discretion in so doing. We feel impelled to further note that, in contrast to Maryland, the courts, in some states, are expressly required by statute to consider less restrictive alternatives, when imposing guardianships of property. <em>See, e.g., </em>Iowa Code \u00a7 633.570(2) (requiring, in \u201call proceedings to appoint a conservator,\u201d that the court \u201cshall consider the functional limitations of the person and whether a limited conservatorship, as authorized in section 633.637, is appropriate\u201d); Mass.

For guidance, we make several observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">First, it appears that the proceedings were more informal than contemplated by Rule 10-710. There was no petition filed, but simply the ward\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d to terminate the guardianship of her property, and Ms. Rosenberg did not file a medical certificate, under Rule 10-710(c), failings that may be attributable to the fact that the guardian both made the request and thereafter opposed it. The guardian did not object to the failure to precisely comply with Rule 10-710(c), as he in fact made the request, and, in light of the informality of the proceedings below, we could reasonably construe Dr. Hyde\u2019s testimony, urging that Ms. Rosenberg did not \u201cneed\u201d guardianship, as substantially complying with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">As to Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s assertion that the lower court inappropriately imported into this matter a standard from family law, the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard, we concede that the circuit court did consider \u201cwhat [was] in the best interest of\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Ms. Rosenberg, in deciding whether to continue the guardianship of her property, but we note that a guardian of the property is required to \u201cutilize powers conferred ... to perform the services, exercise his discretion, and discharge his duties for the best interest of the ... disabled person.... \u201d ET \u00a7 13\u2014206(c)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Because, as the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Kicherer v. Kicherer, </em>285 Md. 114, 118, 400 A.2d 1097 (1979), \u201c[i]n reality the court is the guardian; an individual who is given that title is merely an agent or arm of that tribunal in carrying out its sacred responsibility,\u201d the court properly considered the \u201cbest interest\u201d of Ms. Rosenberg, which the guardian was statutorily mandated to do, and the court\u2019s fleeting observation, that \u201cthis is a standard [from] family law,\u201d did not mean that the court engaged in an improper importation of an inappropriate standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; EACH PARTY TO BEAR ITS OWN COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\">.
