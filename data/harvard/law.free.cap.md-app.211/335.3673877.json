As a consequence, appellants, Drew Para, et al., challenged MDE\u2019s initial recommendation to issue 1691 a construction permit and argued that 1691 had neither presented substantial evidence of public need nor ruled out all other practicable alternative designs and locations for its proposed retail center.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Subsequent to MDE\u2019s initial recommendation, a contested case hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) with the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). The contested case hearing was held over six days in September and October of 2009. On December 30, 2009, the ALJ issued a detailed Proposed Decision and Order upholding MDE\u2019s issuance of the construction permit, with certain modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Appellants filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s recommendations and, after a hearing before the Final Decision Maker for MDE (\u201cFDM\u201d), MDE issued its Final Decision and Order on June 29, 2010, denying all of appellants\u2019 exceptions and affirming the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision. Appellants subsequently filed a petition for judicial review before the circuit court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>further denied appellants\u2019 exceptions and affirmed the FDM\u2019s decision to issue a construction permit to appellees. Appellants noted an appeal to this Court, and presented seven questions for our review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have consolidated, rephrased, and reordered these questions, to the extent properly before this Court, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">1.

Whether the FDM erred in approving 1691\u2019s wetland\u2019s mitigation plan where 1691 traded land to the County rather than donating the land to the county when the wetland\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>mitigation project stated that 1691 would donate the land to the County? <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">STATUTORY BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">In 1972, the United States Congress enacted the federal Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) to \u201crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 83 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (2008). As part of this enactment, Congress noted that nontidal wetlands are a crucial natural resource that assist in the purification of the Nation\u2019s open waters and additionally \u201cprovide habitat[s] for many plants and animals.\u201d <em>See </em>Richard H. McNeer, <em>Now,tidal Wetlands Protection Maryland and Virginia, </em>51 Md. L.Rev. 105, 106. Thus, protection of these wetlands, as important wildlife refuges, is a legitimate purpose for which the CWA was intended, <em>United States v. Akers, </em>785 F.2d 814 (1986); and, as a consequence, \u201c[t]he federal scheme, laid out in the [CWA], requires a developer to obtain a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers before filling wetland areas.\u201d McNeer, <em>supra, </em>51 Md. L.Rev. at 106 (citing the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-500, 86 Stat., 816, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-217, 91 Stat. 1566 (codified as amended at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251-1376 (2008)) (footnote omitted)). In addition, the CWA\u2019s 1977 amendments provide for an environmentally based program that delegates to state governments an option of permitting authority for discharges of dredging or fill material into the navigable waters and wetlands of the United States within that state\u2019s jurisdiction. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In response, Maryland\u2019s General Assembly enacted the Maryland Nontidal Wetlands Protection Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), Md. Code (1996, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-901 through 5-911 of the Environmental Article, \u201c[for] the purpose of establishing a statewide program for the conservation, enhancement, and regulation of nontidal wetlands in [the] State.\u201d S.B. 481, 399th Sess. (Md.1989). <em>See also </em>Md.Code (1996, 2007 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-902(a) of the Environmental Article (noting that nontidal wetlands play an important role in the preservation and protection of the Chesapeake Bay and other waters of the State). <em>Cf </em>Md.Code (1996, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-102 <em>et seq., </em>of the Environmental Article (outlining Maryland\u2019s purpose in protecting wetlands through the State generally). Since its enactment, the goal of the Act remains to prevent \u201coverall loss in nontidal wetlands acreage and function and to strive for a net resource gain in nontidal wetlands over present conditions.\u201d Md.Code (1996, 2007 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-902(b) of the Environmental Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Act requires that persons who wish to conduct certain regulated activities within the nontidal wetlands apply for a MDE permit to lawfully engage in the regulated activity. Md.Code (1996, 2007 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-906(b)(1) of the Environmental Article. Section 5\u2014901(j)(l) of the Environmental Article classifies regulated activities as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>(i) The removal, excavation, or dredging of soil, sand, gravel, minerals, organic matter, or materials of any kind;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">(ii) The changing of existing drainage characteristics, sedimentation patterns, flow patterns, or flood retention characteristics;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">(iii) The disturbance of the water level or water table by drainage, impoundment, or other means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">(iv) The dumping, discharging of material, or filling with material, including the driving of piles and placing of obstructions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">(v) The grading or removal of material that would alter existing topography; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">(vi) The destruction or removal of plant life that would alter the character of a nontidal wetland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Md.Code (1996, 2007 RepLVoL), \u00a7 5-901(j)(l) of the Environmental Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">In general, however, MDE \u201cmay not issue a nontidal wetland permit for a regulated activity unless the Department finds that the applicant has demonstrated that the regulated activity\u201d meets four criteria. Md.Code (1996, 2007 RepLVoL), \u00a7 5-907(a) <em>el seq. </em>of the Environmental Article. In order for the regulated activities to be permissible, they must either be \u201cwater dependent\u201d or independent of water with no \u201cpracticable alternatives.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5-907(a)(l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, the proposed regulated activity must \u201cminimize alteration or impairment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the nontidal wetland, including existing topography, vegetation, fish and wildlife resources, and hydrological conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-907(a)(2). It must not \u201ccause or contribute to a degradation of groundwaters or surface waters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-907(a)(3). Lastly, the proposed regulated activity must be consistent with \u201cany comprehensive management plan that may be developed in accordance\u201d with MDE\u2019s watershed management plans addressing nontidal wetland protection, creation, and restoration. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5\u2014907(a)(4); Md.Code (1996, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-908 of the Environmental Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In sum, Subtitle 5 of the Environmental Article demonstrates the legislature\u2019s efforts at balancing two important State interests. First, the General Assembly recognized the importance in protecting the Chesapeake Bay as one of the world\u2019s great estuaries that plentifully supplies blue crabs, clams, and oysters in its waters, in part, through the preservation of Maryland\u2019s nontidal wetlands. See <em>Md. Bd. Pub. Works v. Hovnanian\u2019s Four Seasons at Kent Island, LLC (\u201cHovnanian III\u201d), </em>425 Md. 482, 486, 42 A.3d 40 (2012); <em>Foley v. Hovnanian at Kent Island, LLC (\u201cHovnanian II </em>\u201d), 410 Md. 128, 132, 978 A.2d 222 (2009). Second, the General Assembly acknowledged the importance of continued land development for regulated industries and population growth. It is through this lens that we now review the facts of the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"A3m\">(A) 1691\u2019s Application to MDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">On January 28, 2002, 1691 filed a permit application for construction in freshwater nontidal wetlands on property it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>owns in the unincorporated area of Crofton, Anne Arundel County, Maryland (hereinafter referenced as \u201cthe property\u201d). The property is approximately seventeen to twenty acres and fronts along the west side of Maryland Route 3. The nontidal wetlands within the property are primarily the result of past sand and gravel mining activity. Notwithstanding the nontidal wetlands on the property, it is zoned C-3 under the Anne Arundel County Code and designated for general commercial development. <em>See </em>Anne Arundel Cnty., Md., Code \u00a7 18-2-105 (2005).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Among the many permitted uses of a C-3 designated property is the development of business complexes, commercial recreational facilities, conference centers, schools, and department stores. Anne Arundel Cnty., Md., Code \u00a7 18-5-102 (2005) (outlining a comprehensive list of all permitted, conditional, special exception, and business complex auxiliary uses for C-3 zoned properties).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">1691\u2019s application identified the proposed regulated activity as the development of a \u201cbig box\u201d retail store greater than 130,000 square feet \u201cwith [an] associated parking lot and drives on the site of a former sand and gravel pit.\u201d According to 1691, the development required the \u201cfilling of [nontidal] wetlands[, removing vegetation, and building structures] to bring the site up to a grade height that will accommodate traffic from adjacent [Maryland Route] 3 and provide adequate area for the proposed development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Moreover, 1691\u2019s application provided an alternative site analysis, explaining that alternative sites were rejected because they had failed to meet the project\u2019s purpose and maintained engineering and design constraints. Further, the application asserted that any alternative site would lead to greater wetlands impact. 1691 additionally explained that several building layouts and designs had been considered and rejected due to site access and safety or because they would have greater impacts on the nontidal wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>MDE notified 1691 that the Department required additional information. Particularly, MDE requested that 1691 provide \u201ca plan view showing the limits of the 100-year floodplain and the areas of the floodplain that w[ould] be impacted by the development of the site,\u201d and an approximate amount of fill that would be placed within that floodplain. In addition, MDE requested that 1691 provide \u201c[a] detailed avoidance and minimization analysis,\u201d and a specific \u201calternative sites analysis[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">1691 complied and provided MDE a site plan illustrating the limits of the 100-year floodplain and its potential impacts. 1691 explained that the proposed development was located and designed to avoid and reduce impacts \u201cas much as reasonably practical.\u201d 1691 additionally noted that the configuration and size of the wetlands did not permit total avoidance if demands of County parking codes and traffic safety were to be satisfied. As a consequence, 1691 provided a series of methods that it used to avoid and minimize impacts to regulated areas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">1. The proposed size of the retail store footprint on the site has been reduced in order to reduce parking requirements, improve traffic flow, and reduce the total amount of impervious surface[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">2. The configurations of the wetland and floodplain boundaries allow for more development on this site than is proposed, however, service drives and access areas have been reduced to the minimum that will allow safe and reasonable access to the building[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">3. Retaining walls and other construction methods have been incorporated into the design of the project in order to avoid and minimize impacts to regulated areas while producing sufficient buildable area[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">4. The [development] has been swept around the upland side of the floodplain limits rather than closely following the limits, providing a buffer between the floodplain and the edge of the development in many places.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">5. Design and placement of stormwater control devices will help minimize hydrological impacts on the on-site (non-swamp) wetlands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>1691 also submitted a copy of the Crofton Small Area Plan (\u201cCSAP\u201d) and argued that the site plan formed with the CSAP. Further, 1691 asserted that it was \u201cstriving\u201d to conform with the goals within the CSAP by \u201cdedicating acreage to the [ JCommunity for a \u2018passive\u2019 park\u201d to preserve \u201cenvironmental features\u201d and by constructing a development that \u201cprovides for the service and business needs of\u2019 Crofton. 1691 additionally indicated that the minimal acreage designated for commercial zoning by CSAP provided for few alternatives, regardless of tract size.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">On August 21, 2002, MDE acknowledged that the property\u2019s wetland configurations made it exceptionally difficult to develop without any adverse impact. Nonetheless, MDE requested detailed information regarding alternative designs and reasons why those designs had been rejected. Expressing some doubt, MDE added that although the CSAP indicates the property \u201cis the appropriate area for the expansion of commercial development, it does not require a \u2018big box\u2019 retail design.\u201d Therefore, MDE ordered 1691 to examine additional locations \u201cwhere the projected purpose can be accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">On October 11, 2002, 1691 provided a detailed alternative site and design analysis that ultimately concluded that other designs would lead to greater impact to the wetlands. As a consequence, 1691 argued that its preferred property remained the only practicable location for the geographic market, Satisfied with 1691\u2019s response regarding avoidance, minimization, mitigation, and stormwater management proposals, MDE notified 1691 that its application was complete. MDE did, however, request clarification regarding the minimum and maximum sizes of a \u201cbig box\u201d store and the maximum number of parking spaces required for such a store. In addition, MDE inquired whether the wetlands and buffers on the south side of the property could be preserved with a smaller retail facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">While MDE awaited 1691\u2019s answer, it gave public notice of the application and opportunity to submit written comments or request a public informational hearing. No comments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>filed and no request for a hearing was submitted to MDE based upon the public notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">On January 24, 2003,1691 submitted a memorandum outlining its responses. 1691 indicated that the maximum size of a \u201cbig box\u201d facility was in the range of 150,000 to 175,000 square feet. 1691 assured MDE, however, that its three years of research demonstrated that the smallest acceptable facility was approximately 142,000 square feet. 1691 further informed MDE that, after considering both county requirements and the facility\u2019s requirements, that 786 parking spaces were needed. 1691 assured MDE that it had rejected requests for additional parking spaces because it was committed to minimizing environmental impacts to the nontidal wetlands on the property. Regarding MDE\u2019s third question, 1691 insisted that the wetlands\u2019 confirmation did permit for avoidance beyond the proposed plan \u201cgiven parking, traffic flow, site access, and safety requirements.\u201d Thus, 1691 rejected alternative designs and smaller configurations as a result of demographics in the Crofton area.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In light of 1691\u2019s answers to MDE\u2019s questions, and given the lack of comments or requests for a public hearing during the public notice period, MDE approved 1691\u2019s Nontidal Wetlands and Waterways Permit on April 15, 2003. MDE did note, however, that its decision was subject to authorization from the United States Army Corps of Engineers.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">(B) The Public Attention and Controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Following MDE\u2019s decision, 1691 announced Wal-Mart as the prospective end-user for the development. Suddenly, the degree of public interest increased significantly, prompting MDE to provide an additional comment period in the fall of 2006, staying the permit\u2019s issuance. In addition, a public hearing was held on November 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Based on the comments received, MDE requested that 1691 address five additional questions. First, MDE addressed inconsistencies between the alleged and actual impacts the development would have on the 100-year floodplain. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>fore, MDE required 1691 to resolve its concerns by submitting an amended floodplain study providing the actual amount of fill required. Second, MDE required that 1691 submit full-sized stormwater management (\u201cSWM\u201d) plans and to address the discovery of two additional stormwater discharge structures outside the proposed limit of disturbance to the nontidal wetlands. Third, MDE requested that 1691 provide complete sediment and erosion control plans for the property. Fourth, 1691 was asked to provide copies of the wetland delineation sheets and soil borings for the entire property. Lastly, MDE required 1691 to provide additional details regarding 1691\u2019s avoidance and minimization of impacts to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Both Wal-Mart and 1691 responded to MDE\u2019s requests. Wal-Mart alleged that it had made extensive efforts to minimize the impact of the project by reducing the overall footprint of the building by twenty-five percent, reducing the paved area by fifteen percent, and reducing the fill proposed for the property\u2019s floodplain and nontidal wetlands to twenty-five percent. As a result, the footprint of the store would be \u201conly slightly larger\u201d than a two-story design created for an urban environment. Wal-Mart further explained that even if the two-story design reduced the size of the store\u2019s footprint, \u201ca significant parking field would still be required under the requirements of the Anne Arundel County Code.\u201d Therefore, \u201conly negligible reduction in wetlands impact would result.\u201d An identical explanation was offered for the tiered parking. Wal-Mart also noted that even after reducing the building footprint, traffic flow requirements of the State Highway Administration \u201crestrict! ] any benefits otherwise attributable to the use of a slightly smaller footprint.\u201d Thus, it concluded that any impact reduction would be minimal to non-existent, providing \u201cnegligible benefits\u201d at higher costs of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">1691 argued that the fill volumes and environmental impacts were recalculated based on the most current SWM and sediment and erosion control plans. These plans, it asserted, were compliant with industry standards. To illustrate the argument, it enclosed a copy of the SWM plans for the entire project. 1691 noted that the increased wetland and floodplain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>impacts from the outfall designs discharged the stormwater directly into the river. Lastly, 1691 explained that impacts to cranberry on the property were unavoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Following MDE\u2019s review of these materials, MDE issued 1691 its permit on January 28, 2009. Two days later, on January 30, 2009, the Department issued notice of the permit, attaching an explanation of its decision. Within its explanation, MDE noted that the proposed \u201cbig box\u201d retail operation satisfied the intent of the CSAP by \u201callowing Crofton residents to save time, fuel and money, without duplicating existing services or displacing local businesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Regarding 1691\u2019s alternative\u2019s analysis, MDE acknowledged that 1691 had considered other properties in the market area too small to accommodate a \u201cbig box\u201d store. Additionally, it noted that the other sites had no access to public utility service, were not proximate to existing roads, and were unavailable to purchase. As a consequence, MDE concluded that the alternative site analysis was sufficient and proceeded with an explanation of 1691\u2019s proposed avoidance and minimization of adverse impacts. The Department noted that the wetlands were a byproduct of sand and gravel mining. Further, MDE determined that no rare, threatened, or endangered species existed as \u201cpermanent residents on the project site.\u201d The Department acknowledged, however, that native cranberry had been located on the property and was removed subsequently to preserve the species genotype. The removed plants would be used at the Turner Environmental Park and at other restoration sites by Anne Arundel County Public Schools. As a consequence, MDE determined that preservation of the narrow nontidal wetlands on the property would prohibit adequate use of the property. The department further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">... While these wetlands do connect to forested wetlands in the 100-year floodplain of the Little Patuxent River, there is a significant length (500 feet +) between the wetlands to be impacted and the river itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>... [0]nce the applicant has a contract purchaser, MDE will require final, engineered construction plans demonstrating that further avoidance and minimization of nontidal wetlands and their 25-foot buffer, and nontidal waterways, including the 100-year nontidal floodplain, are not possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Therefore, MDE concluded that its findings merited the issuance of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">(C) Appellants\u2019 Challenges to the Permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On February 13, 2009, appellants, filed a petition for a formal contested hearing regarding MDE\u2019s decision to issue the Nontidal Wetlands and Waterways Permit to 1691. MDE referred appellants\u2019 petition to OAH. Over a period of six days, an ALJ for OAH held a contested case hearing in September and October of 2009. The parties offered testimony from thirteen witnesses. Nine of the \"witnesses were qualified as experts in a variety of areas, including, wetlands ecology, land use and planning, and retail market analysis. The ALJ accepted seventy documents arising out of 1691\u2019s application for a Nontidal Wetlands and Waterways Permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">On December 30, 2009, the ALJ issued a sixty page Proposed Decision and Order, which upheld MDE\u2019s issuance of the construction permit, with certain modifications.

As with the review of any administrative agency decision, this Court looks to three things: (1) whether the agency\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record made before the agency; (2) whether the agency committed any substantial error of procedural or substantive law in the proceeding or in formulating its decision; and (3) whether the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously in its application of the law to the facts. <em>Hovnanian III, </em>425 Md. 482, 514, 42 A.3d 40 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u201cWe review the final decision of the administrative agency in accordance with the well established principles of administrative law.\u201d <em>Neutron Products, Inc. v.

In that regard, we adhere to this Court\u2019s prior explanation of our review of a final agency decision following the decision of an ALJ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">Despite that procedural posture, it remains the agency\u2019s final decision, not the ALJ\u2019s decision, that we review for substantial evidence.... More precisely, this Court\u2019s \u201c \u2018job\u2019 [is] not to assess the \u2018rationality\u2019 of or evidentiary basis for the ALJ\u2019s recommendation; it [is] to assess the rationality or evidentiary basis of the agency\u2019s ... final order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v.

Thus, when the ALJ renders factual findings based on an assessment of credibility, \u201c \u2018the agency should give appropriate deference to the opportunity of the [ALJ] to observe the demeanor of the witnesses,\u2019 and the agency should reject credibility assessments only if it gives \u2018strong reasons\u2019 \u201d <em>Kaydon, </em>149 Md.App. at 693, 818 A.2d 259 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Therefore, judicial review of the agency\u2019s findings of fact is highly deferential. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn this context, \u2018 \u201c[substantial evidence,\u201d as the test for reviewing factual findings of administrative agencies, has been defined as \u201csuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion[.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v.

Nevertheless, in this Court\u2019s determination of legal error, our review of the agency\u2019s legal conclusions are less deferential. <em>Hovnanian III, </em>425 Md. at 514, 42 A.3d 40. \u201c[Previewing courts are under no constraint to affirm an agency decision premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Ins.

First, appellants argue that the FDM erred in ruling that COMAR\u2019s definition of \u201cpracticable\u201d authorized 1691 to exclude an alternative design for its project because it would cost more to construct. Thus, appellants insist that \u201c[t]he FDM erred because she interpreted that law to allow 1691 to rule out an alternative [design] <em>solely </em>on the basis of cost.\u201d (emphasis in appellants\u2019 brief). Second, appellants assert that the record lacked substantial evidence supporting the FDM\u2019s and ALJ\u2019s decisions that a public need existed for the development.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">As observed briefly in Part I, <em>swpra, </em>Section 5-903 of the Maryland Environmental Article authorizes MDE to enforce a statewide program for \u201cconservation, regulation, enhancement, creation, monitoring, and wise use of nontidal wetlands.\u201d Md. Code (1996, 2007 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-903(a) of the Environmental Article. One such duty delegated to MDE in order to enforce the statewide program is to \u201c[e]valuate proposed activities on nontidal wetlands and grant or deny permits or other approvals of proposed activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-903(b)(4). In that regard, MDE\u2019s decision to issue a permit is based on enumerated preconditions provided within Section 5-907 of the Maryland Environmental Article. Specifically, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">(a) In general.\u2014The Department may not issue a nontidal wetland permit for a regulated activity unless the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ment finds that the applicant has demonstrated that the regulated activity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">(1) (i) Is water dependent and requires access to the nontidal wetland as a central element of its basic function; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">(ii) Is not water dependent and has no practicable alternative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">(2) Will minimize alteration or impairment of the nontidal wetland, including existing topography, vegetation, fish and wildlife resources, and hydrological conditions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">(3) Will not cause or contribute to a degradation of groundwaters or surface waters; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">(4) Is consistent with any comprehensive management plan that may be developed in accordance with \u00a7 5-908 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">(b) Practicable alternatives.\u2014The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that practicable alternatives have been analyzed and that the regulated activity has no practicable alternative.

First, MDE must define the \u201cproject[\u2019s] purpose,\u201d or, rather, the \u201cprincipal reason for conducting all regulated activities and other activities on the project site.\u201d COMAR 26.23.01.01.-B(72). Second, the Department must then consider four sub-factors: (1) whether \u201cthe basic project purpose cannot be reasonably accomplished utilizing one or more other sites in the same general area that would avoid or result in less adverse impact on nontidal wetlands[;]\u201d (2) whether \u201ca reduction in the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project as proposed and all alternative designs that would result in less adverse impact on the nontidal wetland would not accomplish the basic purpose of the project[;]\u201d (3) \u201c[i]n cases where the applicant has rejected alternatives to the project as proposed due to the constraints such as inadequate zoning, infrastructure, or parcel size, whether the applicant has made reasonable attempts to remove or accommodate these constraints; and (4) [t]he economic value of the proposed regulated activity in meeting a demonstrated public need in the area and the ecological and economic value associated with the nontidal wetland.\u201d Md.Code (1996, 2007 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-907(b) of the Environmental Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In the instant case, because appellants are contesting only the design of 1691\u2019s proposed project and whether there was a demonstrated public need for the project, we are under no obligation to further consider Sections 5-907(b)(l) and (3) of the Environmental Article, provided <em>supra. </em>We shall, therefore, address both of appellants\u2019 arguments regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>FDM\u2019s application of Sections 5-907(b)(2) and (4) respectively and conclude that both arguments are without merit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">(1) The FDM\u2019s Finding That No Alternative Designs Would Result In Less Adverse Impact On The Nontidal Wetlands While Accomplishing The Project\u2019s Basic Purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">A practicable alternative exists when the alternative is \u201cavailable and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes.\u201d COMAR 26.23.01.01.B(69). <em>See also </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.10(a)(2) (providing the same definition for a harmonious analysis under the CWA). To be sure, where the projected purpose associated with a regulated activity as provided within Section o\u2014901(j)(l) of the Environmental Article is located on nontidal wetlands but does not require access or proximity to water (i.e. is not \u201cwater dependent\u201d), practicable alternatives that do not involve nontidal wetlands are presumed to be available unless clearly demonstrated otherwise. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1996, 2007 RepLVoL), \u00a7\u00a7 5\u2014907(a)(1)(ii), (2), (3), &amp; 4. <em>See also </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.10(a)(3); <em>York, supra, </em>761 F.2d at 1047; <em>Sylvester, supra, </em>882 F.2d at 409 (citing <em>La. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Wildlife Fed\u2019n, Inc. v.

Only after the \u201cproject purpose\u201d is defined can one objectively determine whether the project is, in fact, water dependent or independent of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In the instant case, the project purpose, as proposed by the applicant and as additionally accepted by MDE, is the \u201cconstruction of a \u2018big box\u2019 store and its required infrastructure.\u201d Appellants fault the Department for accepting 1691\u2019s definition of \u201cproject purpose,\u201d which they contend illegitimately restricted MDE\u2019s ability to require further reductions in wetland impacts. Indeed, had MDE rejected 1691\u2019s proposed project purpose and alternatively defined the purpose more generally as only a non-descriptive, commercial development, as opposed to a \u201cbig box store\u201d or \u201cwarehouse-type store\u201d for a single tenant, an alternative design <em>may </em>have been built on the site and that <em>may </em>have impacted the wetlands to a lesser degree. That potentially smaller commercial project, however, would not, as required by Section 5-907(b)(2), accomplish the \u201cbasic purpose\u201d of the project as provided by 1691 in its application to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Defining the term \u201cproject purpose\u201d begins with the applicant\u2019s purpose. While there is no Maryland case law on point, the United States Courts of Appeal have explicitly observed that, pursuant to the analogous federal wetlands permitting program administered by the Corps, it is not only \u201cpermissible for the Corps to consider the applicant\u2019s objective; the Corps has a duty to take into account the objectives of the applicant\u2019s project.\u201d <em>York, </em>761 F.2d at 1048. <em>See also Hillsdale Envtl. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Loss Prevention, Inc. v.

For example, in <em>Shoreline, </em>the Corps refused to issue a permit to a developer for building a number of waterfront town houses together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>with a boat storage and launching facility. 555 F.Supp. at 171. There, the developer contended before the United States District Court for the District of Maryland that, because its project was designed to maintain a park-like atmosphere of the upland areas and because the project is dependent on construction of the boat storage and launch area, the Corps\u2019 proposed alternative site for the town houses was \u201cuntenable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179. The district court upheld the Corps\u2019 denial of the permit, observing that the boat facilities were merely \u201cincidental\u201d to the town house development. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">____ The primary aspect of the proposed project is the construction of a townhouse community, not the construction of a boat storage facility and launch which are incident to it. Shoreline has failed to show, in compliance with the regulations, why it is necessary for the townhouses to be located on the wetlands rather than the uplands, except for its preference to build on the wetlands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\"><em>Shoreline, </em>555 F.Supp. at 179 (footnote omitted). As a consequence, the court further concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">[i]f Shoreline firmly believed that the boat facilities were of primary importance, it could have sought a permit for this activity alone[,] which, presumably, would have required a much reduced impact on the wetlands. [Shoreline\u2019s attached appendices] ... clearly show[ ] that the vast bulk of the filling of 8.2 acres was necessitated by the housing development itself [and not the boat facilities and launch area].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 179 n. 40. But the facts of Shoreline are inapposite to the case at bar. The record before this Court supports MDE\u2019s conclusion that a \u201cbig box\u201d store is a \u201clegitimate\u201d business proposition, <em>See, e.g., Sylvester, </em>882 F.2d at 409,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and not \u201ca pretense for excluding other alternatives or artificially constraining [MDE\u2019s] alternatives analysis.\u201d <em>Great Rivers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>Habitat Alliance v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019r, </em>437 F.Supp.2d 1019,1027 (E.D.Mo.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Indeed, MDE <em>had </em>initially demonstrated some skepticism regarding 1691\u2019s design and requested detailed information regarding alternative designs for the property and the reasons why 1691 had rejected those designs. In that regard, MDE added that \u201c[w]hile the [CSAP] states that the west side of [Maryland Route 3] is the appropriate area for the expansion of commercial development, it does not require a \u2018big box\u2019 retail design.\u201d 1691 replied to MDE\u2019s request, providing a detailed alternative site and design analysis, which concluded that other designs and sites would result in more impact to the nontidal wetlands. At the contested case hearing, 1691 presented ample testimony that \u201cbig box\u201d stores occupy a specific niche in the retail market and employ a uniform design strategy across the country. Further, 1691 noted that it had made extensive efforts to minimize the impact of the project by reducing the overall footprint of the building by twenty-five percent, reducing the paved area by fifteen percent, and reducing the fill proposed for the property\u2019s floodplain and nontidal wetlands to twenty-five percent. Therefore, the record clearly reflects that MDE did not summarily accept 1691\u2019s proposed basic purpose, but, in fact, engaged in an independent analysis to determine that the project\u2019s purpose was supported by substantial evidence. As a consequence, we can hardly say that MDE\u2019s determination of the project\u2019s basic purpose was arbitrary aucL capricious. See Sylvester, 882 F.2d at 409-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Nonetheless, appellants maintain their contention that MDE rendered its final decision in contravention of alleged practicably alternative designs. Specifically, appellants argue that MDE erred by failing to appropriately consider whether \u201calternative designs [existed] that would result in less adverse impact on the nontidal wetlands [and whether such alternative designs] would ... accomplish the basic purpose of the project,]\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 5\u2014907(b)(2), arguing that the FDM based her decision solely on the cost of alternative designs without considering other important factors in the alternative design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>calculus. We conclude, however, that the FDM committed no error in rendering her decision that no practicable alternative design existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">As observed <em>swpra, </em>when addressing whether a practicable alternative exists, MDE must consider \u201c[w]hether a reduction in the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project as proposed and all alternative designs that would result in less adverse impact on the nontidal wetland[s] would not accomplish the basic purpose of the project[.]\u201d Md.Code (1996, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-907(b)(2) of the Environmental Article. Similar to the definition of \u201cbasic purpose,\u201d there is no Maryland case law on point that addresses the circumstances under which this Court may confidently observe that MDE reasonably considered and dismissed alternative designs. Therefore, because Maryland\u2019s Nontidal Wetlands Protection Act and accompanying regulations are harmonious\u2014and in some instances mirror\u2014the CWA and its accompanying federal regulations,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we turn our attention to the reasoning of the United States Circuit Courts of Appeal to determine whether MDE properly found that no practicable alternative existed for 1691\u2019s proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered whether the Corps adequately considered practicable alternatives to a proposed project\u2019s design in <em>Bering Strait Citizens for Responsible Res. Dev. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019r (\u201cBSC\u201d), 524 </em>F.3d 938, 947 (9th Cir.2008). There, the Alaska Gold Company (\u201cAGC\u201d) had applied for a permit with the Corps for a major gold-mining project near Nome, Alaska, formally known as the Rock Creek Mining Project. <em>Id. </em>at 943. Ultimately, AGC\u2019s proposed project would be approved by the Corps through the issuance of a permit. <em>Id. </em>AGC\u2019s proposed project would consist of two open-pit gold mines at separate locations outside of Nome, plus facilities built for recovering gold ore. <em>BSC, 524 </em>F.3d at 943. Once the proposed project was approved and mining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>would commence, about 15,592,411 cubic yards of fill from the mine would be placed in wetlands totally 346.5 acres. <em>Id. </em>In an effort to prevent the AGC\u2019s potentially damaging effect on Alaskan wetlands, Bering Strait Citizens for Responsible Resource Development with other concerned parties (collectively referenced as \u201cBSC\u201d) sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction before the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, alleging that the Corps had violated the CWA and National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by granting a permit for the Rock Creek Mine Project. <em>Id. </em>The District Court ultimately denied BSC\u2019s motion for injunctive relief and dismissal of its suit on summary judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">On appeal before the Ninth Circuit, BSC argued that the Corps had failed to adequately consider practicable alternative designs and locations AGC\u2019s Rock Creek Mining Project. <em>BSC, </em>524 F.3d at 947-48. Specifically, BSC, in part, asserted \u201cthat the Corps failed to consider the option of relocating only the North waste dump at the Rock Creek Mine/Mill site to an upland site.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 948. \u201cIn support of [BSC\u2019s] claim, [it] cite[d] to the ... rejection of an alternative design that would [have] placed all facilities in uplands and claims that the Corps failed to consider the relocation of some, but not all, of the facilities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The Ninth Circuit rejected BSC\u2019s contentions and observed that although \u201c[t]he Corps considered and rejected the \u2018all uplands\u2019 alternative [design] ... contrary to BSC\u2019s assertion, that was not the only alternative design considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the appellate court noted that the record reflected that the \u201cCorps considered] ... 24 different design altema<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>tives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court found that \u201c \u2018[w]hile an argument can be made that one of these sites was suitable, it would not be appropriate for [the Court] to overturn the Corps\u2019 contrary finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>BSC, </em>524 F.3d at 948 (quoting <em>Hintz, </em>800 F.2d at 834) (addition provided in <em>BSC). </em>Therefore, the court concluded that the Corps \u201creasonably reviewed the feasible options and reasonably concluded that the proposed design was the best design alternative.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Much like the Ninth Circuit in <em>BSC, supra, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit more recently addressed similar contentions regarding the Corps consideration of alternate designs in <em>Hillsdale Envtl. Loss Prevention, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019r (\u201cHillsdale </em>\u201d), 702 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir.2012). There, several environmental groups (\u201cHills-dale\u201d) raised concerns regarding the construction of a Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail/truck terminal outside Kansas City, Kansas. <em>Id. </em>at 1162. Because the applicant\u2019s preferred site contained streams and wetlands protected under the federal law, the Hillsdale challenged the permitted dredging and filling permits issued by the Corps under the CWA. <em>Id. </em>On appeal before the Tenth Circuit, Hillsdale requested that the court set aside the Corps\u2019 decision to grant the permit \u201cbecause the Corps inadequately considered alternatives to the selected site under the [CWA]----\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, Hills-</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">dale argued that the Corps and applicant failed to provide \u201c\u2018detailed, clear and convincing\u2019 information establishing the eliminated alternatives were not practicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1168 (quoting <em>Utahns for Better Transp. v. U.S. Dept. of Transp., </em>305 F.3d 1152, 1186 (10th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Rejecting Hillsdale\u2019s argument that the Corps had not adequately considered alternative designs and locations by clear and convincing evidence, the appellate court noted that the practicable alternatives analysis \u201cdoes not require a specific level of detail to rebut the presumption, but only record evidence the agency took a hard look at the proposals and reached a meaningful conclusion based on the evidence.\u201d <em>Hillsdale, </em>702 F.3d at 1168 (discussing 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.10(a)(3)). The court additionally noted that although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the Corp\u2019s environmental assessment had not explained in detail \u201cthe application of every criterion to every site,\u201d it did, however, \u201cprovides more explanation when necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In concluding that the Corps had adequately considered and ruled out alternatives, the court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">[t]here is no magic number of alternatives the Corps must consider for its analysis to be acceptable, but the agency must draw the line somewhere, even when [the] presumption [for projects independent of water] applies. \u201cThere will always be more data that could be gathered; agencies must have some discretion to decide when to draw the line and move forward with decision making.\u201d <em>Habitat Educ. Ctr., Inc. v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>673 F.3d 518, 531 (7th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Town of Winthrop v. FAA, </em>535 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2008)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><em>Hillsdale, </em>702 F.3d at 1169-70. In addition, the court noted that in evaluating the practicability of alternatives, the Corps is not entitled to reject an applicant\u2019s determination that a particular type of development is economically advantageous so long as to the proposed project is legitimate. <em>Id. </em>at 1170. Therefore, the reviewing agency is \u201centitled to accept a project applicant\u2019s criteria based on information the applicant submits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the proposed alternatives do not provide for lesser impact on the wetlands than the plan provided by the applicant, the proposed alternatives are not practicable. <em>Id. </em>at 1168 (\u201cFor an alternative to be selected under the Corps\u2019[] CWA regulations, it must be practicable ... and it must be less environmentally damaging than all other practicable alternatives.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Indeed, while both the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>BSC </em>and the Tenth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Hillsdale </em>articulate the applicable test in somewhat different ways, the analysis in each focuses on the record in front of the agency and emphasizes the deference that reviewing courts should give to the agency\u2019s determinations of the complex environmental and economic issues raised in cases such as the one before us. Like the Ninth Circuit in <em>BSC, </em>we conclude that the FDM \u201creasonably reviewed the feasible options and reasonably concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the proposed design was the best design alternatively.]\u201d Given the back-and-forth between MDE and 1691 in the instant case, we have no trouble discerning the path of the Department\u2019s reasoning over time and cannot conclude that its ultimate decision was unsupported by the record. To be sure, 1691 informed MDE that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">Several building layouts [had been] considered for [the] site and rejected due to access and/or safety. Other areas near the site were too steep and narrow and would have greater wetland impacts, including Little Patuxent River swamp....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Further, 1691 provided a series of methods that it used to avoid and minimize impacts as a result of the regulated activities of filling and dredging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">1. The proposed size of the retail store footprint on the site has been reduced in order to reduce parking requirements, improve traffic flow, and reduce the total amount of impervious surface^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">2. The configurations of the wetland and floodplain boundaries allow for more development on this site than is proposed, however, service drives and access areas have been reduced to the minimum that will allow safe and reasonable access to the building[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">3. Retaining walls and other construction methods have been incorporated into the design of the project in order to avoid and minimize impacts to regulated areas while producing sufficient buildable area[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">4. The [proposed development] has been swept around the upland side of the floodplain limits rather than closely following the limits, providing a buffer between the floodplain and the edge of the development in many places.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">5. Design and placement of stormwater control devices will help minimize hydrological impacts on the onsite (non-swamp) wetlands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">In addition, 1691\u2019s dismissal of a two-story design further explained that \u201cwhile the use of a [two-story] design would marginally reduce the building footprint, a significant park<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ing field would still be required under the requirements of the Anne Arundel County Code, and given site restrictions only negligible reduction in wetlands impact would result.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, even if the two-story design provided a slightly smaller footprint, the reduction on impacts to wetlands and wetland buffers would be minimal to non-existent and a much higher cost. An alternative that does not reduce the size of the impact is not practicable. Further, MDE\u2019s back- and-forth exchange with 1691, the information provided by 1691 regarding potential alternatives, and the negligible to nonexistent reduction and that any further reduction in size would frustrate the project\u2019s basic purpose clearly support that substantial evidence existed to support the FDM\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we find that the FDM committed no error in concluding that no practicable alternative existed pursuant to Section 5-907(b)(2) of the Environmental Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">(2) The FDM\u2019s and ALJ\u2019S Findings That Public Need Existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">During the contested case hearing, 1691 began its case by offering the testimony of William D. Berkshire (\u201cMr. Berkshire\u201d), president of Lancer Corporation. Lancer Corporation serves as the general partner to 1691. Mr. Berkshire first attested to 1691\u2019s acquisition of the property in 1987, indicating that the purpose of the property\u2019s acquisition was to create activity on the west side of Maryland Route 8 to serve the Crofton area\u2019s public need. He further noted that shortly after 1691\u2019s acquisition of the property, 1691 mutually agreed with the Crofton Community in December of 1988 \u201cthat, in exchange for consideration of preserving a lot of open space land, that the western part of\u2014the western side of Route 3 would be reserved as a commercial retail regional servicing center.\u201d Specifically Mr. Berkshire testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">... the idea was to establish mutual agreement that, for considerations on both sides, the community would be able to rely upon assertions that open space would continue its residential section, residential portion of the community, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>and that development could take place in certain agreed upon areas, basically in the western side of Route 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">And that, in particular, this document calls for the community to actively support the agreement. And in fact, the community did. It\u2019s signed by the President of the Community Association and it required that the community formally present itself to the county in the rezoning that was going on in 1988 to support a rezoning application of the land to be zoned from various smaller commercial zones to C-3, which would enable the subject property and other property there on the western side of Anne Arundel County to join the other development that was taking place along the western side of Route 3, in a higher regional servicing retail environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Following his detailed explanation of the agreement that 1691 reached with the Crofton community and the subsequent rezoning of the property, Mr. Berkshire noted that 1691 then began discussing the implementation of the corporation\u2019s developmental goals with several brokers and retailers as prospective end-users to the property and additionally addressed 1691\u2019s initial application with MDE. It was during these discussions that 1691\u2019s project purpose was fully realized. Mr. Berkshire discussed the realization of the project\u2019s purpose during the following colloquy with counsel at the contested case hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">[Mr. Berkshire]: The project purpose is, as it was filed, is to be able to create and fulfill a need for a regional servicing retail center that can fulfill the needs of this area, which the existing commercial family does not fulfill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">[Counsel for 1691]: And [is] the regional servicing retailer center[ ] synonymous with big-box here [sic], you\u2019ve indicated that ... is the projected purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">[Mr. Berkshire]: Yes, that has been the project purpose. Yes, and it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">[Counsel for 1691]: And why is that the project purpose and not simply a smaller strip center, as some public comments have provided?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>[Mr. Berkshire]: As I said, the area is already well serviced by other retail services. And the services that this regional facility can provide for the citizens of the area can only be done by a larger retail service installation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">[Counsel for 1691]: And the larger retail servicing institutions, have you been contacted by those end-users?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">[Mr. Berkshire]: Yes. Over the years, we have been contacted by numerous, numerous end-users. Probably all of what\u2019s called the big-box retailers that exist [sic]. Not only the stated Wal-Mart, but Cabelas, Costco, B.J.\u2019s, [and] Ikea. I could give a list, Your Honor, of probably a couple dozen of these by specific retail name, as well as a dozens of other regional servicing centers. Literally that many.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Thereafter, 1691\u2019s counsel inquired whether the \u201cbig-box retail servicing centers\u201d had contacted and solicited 1691. Mr. Berkshire responded affirmatively. This dialogue prompted the objection of appellants\u2019 counsel on grounds of hearsay. Appellants\u2019 objection was subsequently overruled by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Consecutive to the ALJ\u2019s ruling, Mr. Berkshire began discussing a commercial brokerage firm\u2019s report of 2001 (the \u201cKLNB report\u201d), which provided information regarding the Crofton area\u2019s economic marketplace. Anticipating 1691\u2019s offering of the KLNB report into evidence, appellants objected, and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">[Appellants\u2019 counsel]: Object. May I be heard very briefly? I apologize for the interruption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">[ALJ]: [1691] hasn\u2019t offered it yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: I know, but ...\u2014I\u2019m mindful of that point, but [Mr. Berkshire] is about to discuss the document and there\u2019s a technical point as to whether the Agency could rely on a document to defend its decision when it wasn\u2019t in the administrative records. A technical point that I alluded to in my opening and I think this is the appropriate time to raise that objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">[ALJ]: All right. I heard your point in your opening[,] but[ ] go ahead and make your point and I\u2019ll make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>decision. If you want to speak to your\u2014tell me what your objection is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">[Appellants\u2019 counsel]: This case concerns the Agency\u2019s approval of a certain permit and the applicant now seeks to introduce, into the record, a document that the Agency did not have when it relied\u2014when it issued its determination. And this is a challenge to an administrative decision and the technical point that I\u2019m making, and this is where [1691\u2019s counsel] and I disagree, is that I believe that under the law, the Agency cannot supplement the record in this way to have an <em>ex post facto </em>explanation of what he [sic] did before, when it didn\u2019t have the benefit of this document. And so, I raise that objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">MDE responded to appellants\u2019 argument and contended that \u201c[t]he whole purpose of [the contested case hearing] is to get a full and complete record [on which] [MDE] can then render a final decision [regarding the contested] permit.\u201d The Department further noted that the contested case hearing \u201cprocess is designed to generate the evidence [on which] the Department will base its final decision.... And the testimony [of Mr. Berkshire] and the[ KLNB report is] relevant\u2014 relevant to that analysis.\u201d After 1691 echoed MDE\u2019s argument, the ALJ admitted the KLNB report over appellants\u2019 objection. Thereafter, Mr. Berkshire attested that the KLNB report provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">a description of the demographics of the area, describing the economic and other factors that exist. It describes the, in my reading of it, the area. It paints a picture of the marketplace that exists here and the need that has to be fulfilled. It can be fulfilled by the facility that is proposed here, that is why it is part of our purpose here. And[,] in my opinion, ... it fulfills what we had hoped to fulfill in the original agreement with the community in 1988.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In addition, Mr. Berkshire indicated that the acreage zoned C-3 had increased consequently with the growth in Crofton\u2019s population as a result of the \u201cinflux\u201d of military families pursuant to the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>1990 (\u201cBRAC\u201d), Pub.L. No. 101-510, 104 Stat. 1485 (codified as amended at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2687 (2011)). Mr. Berkshire opined that \u201ctens of thousands of people and jobs [would] com[e] ... within [the] marketplace in the Crofton area and Fort Meade,\u201d as a result of BRAC, providing \u201cextreme further evidence of need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Thereafter, Mr. Berkshire discussed in greater detail the zoning of the area in which 1691 planned to place its proposed project, indicating that the zoning was consistent with both the initial agreement of 1988 and the CSAP of 2001. Mr. Berkshire described the CSAP in the following dialogue with 1691\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">[Counsel for 1691]: Can you describe the small area plan process as it relates to this parcel on your property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">[Mr. Berkshire]: Yes. In about 2001, the county decided that it was going to comprehensively re[-]zone itself again, as in '88, and divided the county up into[,] I think[,] eight or nine areas called small area plans. And each area was given a committee, of which I served on Crofton\u2019s, at the time to solicit statements and opinions from experts and citizens as to what facilities and combinations for services would beneficial to the area. And the Crofton area is the Crofton Small Area Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">[Counsel for 1691]: So you actually sat on the Crofton Small Area Planning Committee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">[Mr. Berkshire]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">[Counsel for 1691]: And were there any particular discussions regarding this parcel in the Small area Plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">[Mr. Berkshire]: Yes. The agreement with the community was discussed, along with many, many other things. And the subject matter of the community was one that the Small Area Plan, I think, adopted and wished to see go forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">And, in fact, during this process there was a small portion of this property increased in zoning at the request of the Small Area Plan and agreed to by the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>[Counsel for 1691]: And this was all still part of fulfilling the overall land plan for the area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">[Mr. Berkshire]: Yes. This was part of trying to fulfill the planning of both the community\u2014the desires of the community and the planning of the county in the 1988 General Redevelopment Plan that was adopted in 1988.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Thereafter, the CSAP was admitted into evidence without any objection. Both the ALJ and FDM subsequently relied, in part, on the testimony provided by Mr. Berkshire, on the KLNB report, and the CSAP in their findings of public need.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Notwithstanding the ALJ and FDM\u2019s finding of public need, appellants contend before this Court that the record lacked substantial evidence supporting the FDM\u2019s and ALJ\u2019s decisions that a public need existed for the development for three reasons. First, appellants contend that the ALJ erred by admitting hearsay evidence regarding the KLNB sales brochure, the interest by national \u201cbig box\u201d retailers provided through Mr. Berkshire\u2019s testimony, and BRAC\u2019s impact on the Crofton area additionally provided in Mr. Berkshire\u2019s opinion before the ALJ. Second, appellants argue that planning and zoning documents included in the CSAP are irrelevant to the existence of public need, and, therefore, should have been excluded from the evidence. Third, appellants insist that the advancement of the CSAP\u2019s goals in creating a passive parkland is irrelevant to public need, and, therefore, should have been excluded from evidence. In sum, the thrust of appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is that had the FDM and ALJ excluded of the above-mentioned materials from their consideration regarding the existence of public need, the record would have lacked substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We conclude, however, that appellants are foreclosed from presenting arguments on the basis of the KLNB record and the CSAP and premised on Mr. Berkshire\u2019s opinion regarding the impact of the BRAC. During appellants\u2019 contemporaneous objection to the admission of the KLNB report, appellant failed to present argument that the KLNB report was inadmissible hearsay. Because appellants raised specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>contentions regarding the report\u2019s inadmissibility, which did not include their bald assertion that the KLNB report was \u201ctoo old\u201d to be reliable, appellants are precluded from raising the issue for the first time on appeal. <em>Cf. Rosov, </em>163 Md.App. at 112, 877 A.2d 1111. \u201cOrdinarily, [this Court] will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided\u201d below. Md. Rule 8-131(a). Therefore, when specific grounds for an objection are stated, any other argument not presented by a party to the adjudicating body are deemed waived. <em>See Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 541, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999) (noting that when specific grounds for the objection are stated, the party has deemed to have waived all other grounds on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">To be sure, appellants <em>did </em>raise <em>an </em>argument before the ALJ during the contested case hearing, regarding the admissibility of the KLNB record. Nonetheless, appellants\u2019 objection regarding the KLNB record\u2019s admissibility was not on the basis of hearsay. Rather, the argument presented to the ALJ pertained to \u201ca technical point as to whether [1691 and MDE] could rely on a document to defend its decision when it wasn\u2019t in the administrative records.\u201d Indeed, appellants\u2019 counsel presented the following argument before the ALJ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">This case concerns the Agency\u2019s approval of a certain permit and the applicant now seeks to introduce, into the record, a document that the Agency did not have when it relied\u2014when it issued its determination. And this is a challenge to an administrative decision and the technical point that I\u2019m making, and this is where [1691\u2019s counsel] and I disagree, is that I believe that under the law, the Agency cannot supplement the record in this way to have an <em>ex post facto </em>explanation of what he [sic] did before, when it didn\u2019t have the benefit of this document. And so, I raise that objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">(emphasis added). Further, appellants presented no objections to the admission of the CSAP and Mr. Berkshire\u2019s opinion regarding the impact the BRAC, an act and public law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>passed by the United States Congress, at the time Mr. Berkshire offered his opinion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If a party fails to offer any objection, \u201c[it] will not later be heard to complain that the evidence should not have been admitted.\u201d <em>Ginn v.

Black, </em>107 Md. 642, 658 (1908)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Since appellants raised a specific objection to the admission of the KLNB report, which did not include the issue of hearsay, and raised no objections to the admission of the CSAP and Mr. Berkshire\u2019s opinion regarding the impact of the BRAC, appellants\u2019 contentions regarding the admissibility of these materials are unpreserved for this Court\u2019s review. Nonetheless, even if appellants had not abandoned these arguments, appellants\u2019 assertions would remain without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We shall, therefore, (1) address appellants\u2019 argument regarding the admissibility of Mr. Berkshire\u2019s statements regarding whether the \u201cbig-box retail servicing centers\u201d had contacted and solicited 1691 and the admissibility of the KLNB report,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (2) aggregate appellants\u2019 claims of relevancy and address them in tandem, and (3) conclude that the FDM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>committed no error in her consideration of the above-mentioned, evidentiary materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">(a) The Admissibility and Consideration of Hearsay Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u201cHearsay\u201d is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial or at a hearing, offered into evidence to prove the matter asserted.

First, one must consider the hearsay\u2019s reliability and probative value. Once the offered hearsay is deemed sufficiently reliable and probative, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>must then consider whether the hearsay\u2019s admission contravenes due process. <em>See Perales, </em>402 U.S. at 402, 91 S.Ct. 1420. <em>Accord Travers, </em>115 Md.App. at 416, 693 A.2d 378.

Supervisor of Assessments for Washington Cnty., </em>267 Md. 519, 523, 298 A.2d 148 (1973)) (some internal quotation and citation omitted) (emphasis added), as long as the relaxed rules are not misapplied in an arbitrary or oppressive manner, depriving the party of his or her right to a fair hearing. <em>Travers, </em>115 Md.App. at 412, 693 A.2d 378 (relying on <em>Comm\u2019n on Med. Discipline v. Stillman, </em>291 Md. 390, 422, 435 A.2d 747 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In the instant case, appellants contention that Mr. Berkshire\u2019s testimony offered during the contested case hearing regarding whether potential end-users had contacted and solicited 1691 constitutes inadmissible hearsay is plainly wrong. As noted, <em>supra, </em>\u201chearsay\u201d is a <em>statement, </em>other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial or at a hearing, offered into evidence to prove the matter asserted. Md. Rule 5-801. Mr. Berkshire\u2019s testimony regarding the solicitous <em>conduct </em>of big-box retail servicing centers contained no communicative statements of the potential end-users. Rather, his testimony was based on his personal knowledge and perception of the potential end-users\u2019 conduct. In addition, his statements regarding efforts to find a property that met the requisite public need do not include specifics about what any potential end-user had requested. Mr. Berkshire simply stated that the end-users\u2019 needs prompted him to investigate particular parcels of land within the Crofton area marketplace. Therefore, the ALJ and FDM committed no error in considering Mr. Berkshire\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Moreover, appellants failed to articulate how the KLNB report is incompetent or unreliable except for the bald assertion that it was \u201ctoo old to be substantial evidence.\u201d Nor have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>appellants demonstrated how either the ALJ\u2019s or FDM\u2019s decisions to consider the report was arbitrary or oppressive. In fact, appellants\u2019 specific objection to the admission of the KLNB report precluded any consideration of the two-step hearsay analysis, because they failed to present the issue before the ALJ and FDM. Notwithstanding appellants\u2019 failure, however, the past treatment of similar reports support sufficient reliability and probative value. The identity of the report\u2019s authors were known, and Maryland Rule 5-803, entitled, \u201cHearsay exceptions: Unavailability of declarant not required,\u201d provides two exceptions to the rule against hearsay which may have been applicable to the report\u2019s proper admission had this matter been tried before the trial court. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 5\u2014803(b)(6) &amp; (17).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, the record from the contested case hearing contained testimony that it would be appropriate for a planner to rely on the type of data found within the KLNB report. Further, Mr. Berkshire attested that the KLNB report was created to assist 1691\u2019s understanding of the Crofton area\u2019s demographic marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Nonetheless, appellants contend that they were precluded from cross-examining the authors of the KLNB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>report, thereby violating their due process rights. Although we recognize \u201cthe basic tenet of fairness in administrative adjudications is the requirement of an opportunity for reasonable cross-examination,\u201d <em>Travers, </em>115 Md.App. at 416-17, 693 A.2d 378, fairness also requires the complaining party to avail itself of the opportunity to cross-examine. <em>Id. </em>at 418, 693 A.2d 378 (relying on <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). <em>Accord Rosov, </em>163 Md.App. at 117, 877 A.2d 1111. As a consequence, the complaining party must subpoena testimony or a witness of the production of any evidence when the administrative proceeding permits. <em>Travers, </em>115 Md.App. at 418, 693 A.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Our decision in <em>Travers v. Baltimore Police Dep\u2019t, </em>115 Md.App. 395, 693 A.2d 378 (1997), is instructive. Travers, a former Baltimore City police officer, was accused of violating departmental rules and regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 400, 693 A.2d 378. He alleged that the administrative trial board erred in admitting hearsay statements of the alleged victim through the testimony of other officers, depriving him of the opportunity to cross-examine the alleged victim. <em>Id. </em>at 407-08, 693 A.2d 378. Travers had not subpoenaed the alleged victim. Writing for this Court, Judge Glenn T. Harrell, Jr., (now, of the Court of Appeals) opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">... because appellant failed to exercise his right to subpoena [the victim], see Md. Ann.Code, art. 27 \u00a7 730(j), we conclude that he has effectively waived his right to complain about a denial of the opportunity to cross-examine [her]. In 1971, the Supreme Court in <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), upheld the admission of hearsay evidence in a proceeding before the Social Security Board, noting that Perales\u2019 lawyer could have subpoenaed the hearsay declarant but did not do so. <em>Id. </em>at 404-05 [91 S.Ct. 1420]. Although not citing <em>Perales, </em>we held in <em>American Radio-Telephone [Service, Inc. v. Public Service Com., </em>33 Md.App. 423, 365 A.2d 314 (1976) ] that the error in admitting affidavits, without subjecting the affiant to cross-examination, was harmless because the opponents \u201cmade no request for ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>an opportunity to bring the affiant in for cross-examination.\u201d 33 Md.App. at 435, 365 A.2d [at] 320. Finally, in <em>Tron, </em>we distinguished Perales on the ground that <em>Tron [v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>69 Md.App. 256, 517 A.2d 113 (1986) ] had not been furnished with subpoena power, while the claimant in <em>Perales </em>failed to exercise his right under the Social Security Act to subpoena adverse witnesses. We read <em>Perales </em>as standing for the proposition that claimants who forgo their right to subpoena known, material witnesses effectively waive any objections to denial of an opportunity to cross-examine. 69 Md.App. at 264, 517 A.2d at 117. <em>Accord Changing Point, Inc. v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>87 Md.App. 150, 172, 589 A.2d 502 (1991); <em>but cf. Kade [v. Charles H. Hickey School </em>], 80 Md.App. [721] at 726, 566 A.2d [148] at 151 [ (1989) ] (concluding that hearsay was reliable based on the fact that hearsay proponent did not subpoena declarant). We conclude that, in light of appellant\u2019s failure to subpoena [the victim], the admission of her statements to Officer Moore and Lieutenant Henderson did not vitiate appellant\u2019s right to a fair administrative hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 693 A.2d 378 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The regulations governing MDE\u2019s contested case hearings explicitly provide all parties subpoena power. Specifically, COMAR 26.01.02.18, entitled, \u201cSubpoenas,\u201d in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">B. Issuance of Subpoenas. The Office of Hearings may, on request of any party or upon the hearing examiner\u2019s own motion, issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence, including relevant books, records, correspondence, or documents in the possession or under the control of the witness, at the hearing. Requests for subpoenas may be made ex parte. A subpoena shall show on its face the name and telephone number of the party at whose request it was issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>COMAR 26.01.02.18(B) (2012). Thus, appellants were not deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses by MDE, by 1691, by the ALJ, or by the FDM; but by their own failure to subpoena witnesses or further documentation. As a consequence, we perceive no error regarding the admission of the KLNB report or its consideration by the ALJ and FDM in determining the public need for 1691\u2019s proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">(b) The Relevancy of the Planning and Zoning Documents Within the CSAP &amp; the Relevancy of the CSAP\u2019s Goals in Creating Passive Parkland.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Even if appellants had objected to the admission of the CSAP, appellants\u2019 insistence that the CSAP is irrelevant to the Crofton area\u2019s public need is without merit. The CSAP is clearly relevant to a public need determination.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">It is well established that \u201c \u2018[Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401 (emphasis added). Alternatively, evidence that is not relevant is inadmissible. Md. Rule <em>5-A01. </em>The undergirdings of relevancy are comprised of two components: materiality and probative value. <em>Smith v. State, </em>423 Md. 573, 590, 32 A.3d 59 (2011) (citing 1 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 185, at 773 (4th Strong ed. 1992) (McCormick)). Writing more recently for the Court of Appeals in <em>Smith v. State, </em>Judge Lawrence F. Rodowsky further defined the two components of relevancy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>A material proposition is also called a \u201c \u2018consequential fact\u2019 \u201d 1 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 401[03], at 401-10 (1980). \u201cMateriality looks to the relation between the proposition for which the evidence is offered and the issues in the case.\u201d McCormick, \u00a7 185, at 773. Probative value is \u201cthe tendency of evidence to establish the proposition that it is offered to prove.\u201d McCormick, \u00a7 185, at 774.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">423 Md. at 590, 32 A.3d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Notwithstanding appellants\u2019 general assertions that the planning and zoning documents and the goals in creating passive parkland contained within the CSAP are irrelevant to a determination of public need, appellants falls short in presenting any argument that the CSAP fails to provide \u201cany tendency\u201d to make the proposition of public need\u2019s existence \u201cmore probable.\u201d A demonstrated public need is broader than market demand minus retail supply. To be sure, CO-MAR 26.23.02.04D(2)(d)(i) specifically provides that the MDE \u201cshall consider any pertinent information, including the economic value that the proposed project contributes to an identified State or local economic priority and if the proposed project promotes the public health, safety, or welfare.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, consideration of the CSAP, including its zoning documents and the stated goals in creating passive parkland, makes it more probable, in conjunction with the opinions of Mr. Berkshire and appellee\u2019s other witnesses, that public need exists, further supporting the issuance of a nontidal wetland permit. It essential to observe that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">[ujnder our system ... a party offers his [or her] evidence not <em>en masse, </em>but item by item. An item of evidence, being but a single link in the chain of proof, need not prove conclusively the proposition for which it is offered. It need not ever make that proposition appear more probable than not. Whether the entire body of one party\u2019s evidence is sufficient ... is one question. Whether a particular item of evidence is relevant to his [or her] case is quite another. It is enough if the item could reasonable show that a fact is slightly more probable than it would appear without that evidence. Even after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>probative force of the evidence is spent, the proposition for which it is offered still can seem quite improbable. Thus, the common objection that the inference for which the fact is offered \u2018does not necessarily follow\u2019 is untenable, it poses a standard of conclusiveness that very few single items of circumstantial evidence ever could meet. A brick is not a wall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 185, at 776 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added), <em>quoted with approval in Smith, </em>423 Md. at 590-91, 32 A.3d 59. <em>See Rosov, supra, </em>163 Md.App. at 119, 877 A.2d 1111. <em>Cf.

Therefore, both Crofton\u2019s and Anne Arundel County\u2019s long-term decisions for the proposed project\u2019s site, as explained in the CSAP and 1988 agreement, are ostensibly relevant to a determination of public need.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Because the CSAP, KLNB report, and Mr. Berkshire\u2019s statements regarding the BRAC as well as whether the \u201cbig-box retail servicing centers\u201d had contacted and solicited 1691 were admissible within this contested case hearing and because the FDM is required, by regulation, to consider all pertinent information related to public need, COMAR 26.23.02.04D(2)(d)(i), we reject appellants\u2019 first assignment of error. As noted, <em>supra, </em>the substantial evidence test is applicable to the assessment of the agency\u2019s fact-finding and mixed questions of law and fact. It is not\u2014as appellants assert\u2014an after-the-fact determination of the admissibility of specific documents or the weight to be given lines of testimony provided during the contested case hearing. We accordingly conclude that neither the ALJ nor the FDM committed any error in considering the offered evidence and further hold that substantial evidence existed to support MDE\u2019s finding of demonstrated public need.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">(B) 1691\u2019s Mitigation Plan With MDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Our best guess at the thrust of appellants\u2019 final assignment of error that the FDM \u201cerred legally\u201d in approving 1691\u2019s mitigation plan because 1691 is attempting to sacrifice one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>body of water of the State for another by converting the drained point into wetlands. Thus, appellants assert that this claimed practice is in contravention to Section 5-902\u2019s of the Environmental Article\u2019s stated goals of the Maryland Nontidal Wetland Protection Act, which are to attain no net overall loss in nontidal wetland acreage. In response, appellees counter that it did not matter if the applicant to a permit transferred the land to the County as part of a land exchange instead of donating the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">It is well-settled that an administrative agency is entitled to deference in the interpretation of its own propounded regulations unless the agency\u2019s interpretation is clearly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. <em>See Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997). <em>See also Kentuckians for the Commonwealth v. Rivenburgh, </em>317 F.3d 425, 439 (4th Cir.2003) (noting that, when reviewing an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation, \u201c[t]he reviewing court does not have much leeway\u201d); <em>Najafi v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>418 Md. 164, 173-74, 12 A.3d 1255 (2011) (quoting <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 571-72, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005)) (noting that \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Neither the Maryland Nontidal Wetland Protection Act, its supporting statutory provisions, or its accompanying regulations with COMAR prohibit MDE from allowing preservation by way of exchange as a component of a mitigation plan. Indeed, preservation is a subset of enhancement. <em>See </em>COMAR 26.23.04.03.F(6) (observing that \u201c[ejnhancement activities may be accepted to replace the loss of nontidal wetland functions when an enhancement activity provides additional protection, creates, or improves the function of, nontidal wetlands[,]\u201d including the \u201c[p]urchase or preservation of existing nontidal wetlands\u201d). In addition, expert testimony suggests that preserving wetlands and the uplands around them pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>vents access to the wetlands for future development and is a means \u201cto keep the high quality wetlands in a high quality state.\u201d Further, as in the case at bar, where the land was transferred to the county, \u201ca public agency capable of protecting the area in perpetuity,\u201d COMAR 26.23.04.03.K(l)(c), the Department need not require an additional protection mechanism of the applicant. Moreover, should concerns eventually emerge to question any aspect of the proposed mitigation plan, MDE can require additional mitigation during the Phase II planning process. <em>See </em>COMAR 26.23.04.05.C. Accordingly, because the interpretation of the agency\u2019s regulations are fairly debatable, we conclude that the FDM committed no error in approving the mitigation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.
