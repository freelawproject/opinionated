Federal Regulatory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">In 1948, the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to promote states to safeguard and restore the country\u2019s bodies of water. <em>National Pork Producers Council v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>635 F.3d 738, 742 (5th Cir.2011) [hereinafter <em>\u201cNational Pork\u201d]. </em>In 1972, the Clean Water Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> replaced the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and encompassed a responsibility to conform to the 1972 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d) permit program. <em>Id. </em>Although the Clean Water Act forbids the release of pollutants into U.S. waters, under the permit program, the EPA may grant permits to individuals and companies to discharge pollutants, but with significant limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">In 1976, the EPA required Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (\u201cCAFOs\u201d)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to obtain permits to release pollu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>tants, which was predicated on the amount of animals located in the facility. <em>Id. </em>However, because of \u201c \u2018changes that ... occurred in the animal production industries,\u2019 \u201d <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>399 F.3d 486, 494 (2nd Cir.2005) [hereinafter <em>\u201cWaterkeeper Alliance v. EPA </em>\u201d] (additional citation omitted), the EPA required all CAFOs to \u201capply for an individual NPDES permit or submit a notice of intent for coverage under an NPDES general permit\u201d in 2003.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 495 (citing 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.23(d)(1)) (emphasis added). Additionally, all CAFOs were required to establish and design a site-specified NMP that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">(i) Ensure[d] adequate storage of manure, litter, and process wastewater, including procedures to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the storage facilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">(ii) Ensure[d] proper management of mortalities (i.e. dead animals) to ensure that they [were] not disposed of in a liquid manure, storm water, or process wastewater storage or treatment system that [was] not specifically designed to treat animal mortalities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">(iii) Ensure[d] that clean water [was] diverted, as appropriate, from the production area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">(iv) Prevented] direct contact of confined animals with waters of the [U.S.];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">(v) Ensure[d] that chemicals and other contaminants handled on-site [were] not disposed of in any manure, litter, process wastewater, or storm water storage or treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>system unless specifically designed to treat such chemicals and other contaminants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">(vi) Identified] appropriate site specific conservation practices to be implemented, including as appropriate buffers or equivalent practices, to control runoff of pollutants to waters of the [U.S.];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">(vii) Identified] protocols for appropriate testing of manure, litter, process wastewater, and soil;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">(viii) Established] protocols to land apply manure, litter or process wastewater in accordance with site specific nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the nutrients in the manure, litter or process wastewater; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">(ix) Identified] specific records that [would] be maintained to document the implementation and management of the minimum elements described [above].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\"><em>Waterkeeper Alliance v.

EPA, </em>399 F.3d at 496).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">In <em>Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA, </em>399 F.3d at 502, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit determined whether the requisites of the NMPs constituted \u201ceffluent limitations,\u201d and hence, were required in the NPDES permit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiffs-environmental organizations contended that the 2003 Rule was unlawful because (1) NPDES personnel were permitted to issue permits to Large CAFOs without an extensive evaluation of the NMPs, and (2) the NPDES permits did not include the NMPs\u2019 terms. <em>Id. </em>at 490. The Second Circuit agreed with the plaintiffs, reasoning that the Clean Water Act described an effluent limitation as \u201c \u2018any <em>restriction </em>established by a State or the Administrator on quantities, <em>rates, </em>and concentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other constituents which [were] discharged from point sources ...,\u2019\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>id. </em>at 502 (emphasis in original), and thus, because \u201cthe requirement to develop a[NMP] constitute[d] a restriction on land application discharges ...,\u201d the requisites of the NMP should have been included in the permits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In accordance with the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, on June 30, 2006, the EPA proposed that (1) CAFOs present NMPs with their NPDES permit applications, (2) authorities would review the plan, and (3) the permit would include the NMP terms. 71:126 Fed.Reg. 37744 (June 30, 2006). On December 4, 2008, the proposal became finalized as a rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>National Pork, </em>635 F.3d at 747. Farmers opposed the 2008 Rule, and filed complaints in several federal courts, arguing that the EPA exceeded its authority in requiring all NMPs to submit procedures regarding land application.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 753. The actions were transferred to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and joined into one case, <em>National Pork. Id. </em>at 747. The Fifth Circuit concluded that the farmers\u2019 arguments were time-barred because they concerned the 2003 Rule, <em>id. </em>at 754, and ultimately, the Court upheld the 2008 Rule.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">B.

However, pertinent to the case at bar are the inspections relating to (1) NMPs for the Nest Egg Farm in Princess Anne, Maryland, and (2) NMPs for AFOs with approximately 125,000 broiler chickens that conducted waste management practices and were located in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. On July 17, 2007, the MDA denied access to the Waterkeeper Alliance, alleging that disclosure would be contrary to the Water Quality Improvement Act. Waterkeeper Alliance presented an additional request on July 30, 2007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>regarding \u201cthe owner name, facility name, address, county, phone number, longitude, latitude, and type of operation, of all poultry farms in ... Maryland.\u201d On August 27, 2007, the MDA again denied the Waterkeeper Alliance access to the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Subsequently, on February 5, 2008, appellants filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against the MDA and its administrators, alleging that \u201cMaryland law keeps confidential a summary of an NMP only to the extent that the <em>identity </em>of the individual for whom the NMP was prepared would be revealed,\u201d but the MDA \u201cbroadly and inappropriately refused to disclose any and all portions of NMPs.\u201d (emphasis in original). On May 16, 2008, appellants submitted a third request, relating to enforcement records and NMPs that were filed within and over the previous three years for AFOs in several counties, including Dorchester County. The MDA surmised that these records could be disclosed, but indicated that the requested enforcement records were still under evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">After being notified of possible disclosure, on July 18, 2008, the Farm Bureau brought an action in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County against the MDA to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, averring that Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1(b)(2) required that the MDA protect its members\u2019 identifies beyond three years. On July 25, 2008, the MDA filed a motion to transfer the Farm Bureau\u2019s action to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. On August 8, 2008, the Farm Bureau filed an opposition to the motion, a motion to proceed anonymously, and a motion for protective order, avowing that (1) the cases involved different parties, (2) its members would be unduly inconvenienced, and that (3) the request interfered with the members\u2019 rights to privacy. On August 13 and August 22, 2008, the MDA filed its respective reply and opposition, as well as a motion to strike and to dismiss the Farm Bureau\u2019s complaint. On September 2, 2008, the Circuit Court for Dorchester County granted the MDA\u2019s motion to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>On September 15, 2008, the MDA filed a motion to consolidate the Farm Bureau\u2019s case with appellants\u2019 action. The Farm Bureau filed a motion for summary judgment on September 29, 2008. Thereafter, the MDA filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and an opposition to the Farm Bureau\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On October 30, 2008, appellants filed their opposition to the Farm Bureau\u2019s motion for summary judgment and their motion in support of the MDA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On November 7, 2008, the Farm Bureau filed a motion for preliminary injunction, requesting that the court prevent the MDA from disclosing the farmers\u2019 information.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">A motions hearing was held on December 8, 2008, and on February 19, 2009, the court filed a memorandum opinion and order [hereinafter \u201c2009 order\u201d], which granted the MDA\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, and denied the Farm Bureau\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">DECLARED, that the [MDA] must disclose [NMP] [s]ummaries that have been maintained by the [MDA] for 3 years or less pursuant to the Public Information Act with the limitation that the [MDA] must redact any and all information from the [NMP] [s]ummaries that may allow for the identification of the individual for whom the [NMP] was prepared; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">DECLARED, that the [MDA] must disclose [NMP] [s]ummaries that have been maintained by the [MDA] for more than three years without any redaction of identifying information unless failure to redact identifying information from [NMP] [summaries that have been held for more than three years would allow for the identification of the individual for whom the [NMP] was prepared with respect to those [NMP] [s]ummaries that have been maintained by the [MDA] for three years or less; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">DECLARED, that the [MDA] must redact any information from any documents subject to disclosure under the Public Information Act that are related to [NMPs] if such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>information would allow for the identification of the individual for whom the [NMP] was prepared with respect to those [NMP] [summaries that have been maintained by the [MDA] for three years or less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">On April 2, 2010, one of the appellants, Assateague Coast-keeper, filed a request concerning NMPs and reports regarding any Worcester County farm that violated the provisions of the Water Quality Improvement Act during 2007 through 2010. In response, the MDA \u201cproposed that, instead of providing hard-copies of such records, it could search its database and provide this information more efficiently in a spreadsheet but, to comply with [Agrie.] \u00a7 8-801.1(b)(2) and the court\u2019s order, it would be required to redact any plan information.\u201d On September 6, 2010, the Farm Bureau sent a letter to the MDA, stating, \u201c[c]learly, the excel spreadsheets<footnotemark>[20]</footnotemark> that have been created to respond to the [Public Information Act] request fall into the \u201cany document\u201d category cited by [the] judge.... Clearly, the document is related to nutrient management plans. And clearly, the name, address, zip code, party id [sic], and operator voucher id [sic] number would allow for the identification of the individual for whom a nutrient management plan was prepared.\u201d As a result, the Farm Bureau requested that all identifying information from the spreadsheets be redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">On September 13, 2010, the Farm Bureau filed a new action against the MDA in the Circuit Court for Worcester County.

This landmark legislation offered guidance to other states regarding the control of nutrient levels in waterways. U.S. EPA, <em>Special Focus Issue: Controlling Nutrients [T]hrough State-Based Authorities, </em>Non-point Source News-Notes, May 2012, at 7, <em>available at </em>http:// water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/outreach/upload/91issue.pdf (last visited Apr. 11, 2013). Senate Bill 178 of the 1998 General Assembly was introduced because of the contaminated fish occurrences in Maryland\u2019s Lower Eastern Shore. Dep\u2019t of Legis. Servs., Revised Fiscal Note, S.B. 178 (1998). This new bill gained opposition from agriculturalists because its purpose was to \u201creplace [the] voluntary, nitrogen-based, agricultural nutrient management program with a phosphorus and nitrogen-based program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rural legislators introduced a counter bill, the \u201cNutrient Management Practices Improvement Act of 1998.\u201d <em>See </em>Amendments to H.B. 599 (Third Reading File Bill), 412th Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess. (Md.1998). After several compromises regarding both bills, the Water Quality Improvement Act was passed and enacted in May 1998. Dep\u2019t of Legis. Servs., Revised Fiscal Note, S.B. 178 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">When originally enacted, Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1 stated \u201ceach nutrient management plan shall be filed with the [MDA] when it is developed; and each time it is updated.\u201d <em>See </em>Amendments to H.B. 599 (Third Reading File Bill), 412th Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess. (Md.1998) (emphasis added) (capital letters and roman numerals omitted). However, in 2004, the General Assembly amended the statute to read \u201ca summary of each nutrient management plan shall be filed and updated with the [MDA] ...\u201d at a time and in a form that the MDA requires by regulation. S.B. 182, 418th Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess. (Md.2004) (emphasis added) (capital letters omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Maryland is not the only state that requires a summary to be filed. Delaware\u2019s regulation concerning pollution from private lands into its watersheds provides that \u201c[t]he homeowner\u2019s association must retain the [NMP] on file and maintain records of nutrient applications. A summary of nutrient application records must be submitted to the Delaware Department of Agriculture, Nutrient Management Program on an annual basis.\u201d <em>Delaware Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. &amp; Envtl. Control v. Sussex County, </em>34 A.3d 1087, 1094 (Del.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">We perceive that the General Assembly may have amended the statute because agricultural plans are voluminous, expensive, and time-consuming. For example, in <em>Goldschmidt v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>557 F.Supp. 274, 275 (D.D.C.1983), the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia determined whether inspection reports were \u201cinvestigatory reports compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d concerning the inspection of meat and poultry, and thereby, exempt from public disclosure when a Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) request was submitted. Regarding the inspection reports and the summaries, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">Prior to May of 1982, the [Food Safety and Inspection Service (\u201cFSIS\u201d) ] Review Staff routinely wrote up [inspection location reports] for every establishment reviewed irrespective of whether any serious violations of regulations were found. The [inspection location report] contained a list of all deficiencies noted by the reviewer, no matter how minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">In May[ ] 1982, that policy was changed. Instead of preparing an [inspection location report] for each establishment reviewed, FSIS Review Staff prepared circuit reports which summarized general conditions in an FSIS circuit. However, if the reviewer noted conditions in a particular plant that posed a \u201cserious\u201d violation of regulations, an individual [inspection location report] would also be prepared and attached to the circuit summary report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 275. Hence, it is logical to require \u201csummations or compilations of what the records contain ...\u201d as opposed to extensive documents. <em>Chapman v. State, </em>331 Md. 448, 461, 628 A.2d 676 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">More importantly, the authority that the General Assembly delegated to the MDA includes \u201ca broad power to promulgate legislative-type rules or regulations in order to implement the statute.\u201d <em>Adventist Health Care, Inc. v. Maryland Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 119, 896 A.2d 320 (2006) (quoting <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 445, 644 A.2d 34 (1994)). The MDA promulgated COMAR 15.20.07.06(A)(4), which states that the MDA \u201cshall keep, and shall protect the confidentiality of, all nutrient management plan information submitted, so as to protect the identity of the person for whom the plan was developed.\u201d (emphasis added). The MDA asserts that it has applied this regulation to NMP information associated with summaries, but also plan information relating to conducting an on-farm audit.

Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>425 Md. 629, 638, 42 A.3d 596 (2012), we respect the MDA\u2019s expertise, and defer to its interpretation that nutrient management records must also be safeguarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">B.) Whether The General Assembly Only Intended To Protect Applicant\u2019s Identification For \u201cThree Years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Concerning the \u201cthree years\u201d requirement, appellants maintain that the circuit court erred because Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1(b) \u201cclearly and unambiguously limits its scope to NMP summaries maintained by [the] MDA for three years or less and protects only the identifying information.\u201d The MDA asserts that Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1(b)(2) is silent on the issue, and that disclosing the NMP summaries that are more than three years old is consistent with the Public Information Act. The Farm Bureau argues that \u201c... because many NMPs do not change significantly from one year to the next and if NMP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>information were [sic] released to the public after three years, it would be very easy for someone to figure out the identity of the farmers who have current NMPs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">As previously indicated, we explore other sources \u201c \u2018[e]ven when the language of [the] statute is free from ambiguity, in the interest of completeness....\u201d\u2019 <em>See Whitley, </em>429 Md. at 155, 55 A.3d 37 (quoting <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>360 Md. at 131, 756 A.2d 987).

The measured quantity of extractable nutrient in a soil is then used to predict the crop yield response to application of the nutrient as fertilizer, manure, or other amendment. As soil test levels increase for a particular nutrient, the expected crop yield response to additions of that nutrient decreases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Frank J.

Assem., Reg. Sess. (Md.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">As previously indicated, the 1998 and 1999 General Assemblies focused on controlling the levels of pollutants entering Maryland\u2019s waters, and attempted to solve this problem by enacting environmental statutes that encompassed different methods of deterrence. While soil testing regarding NMPs are revised every three years, Agrie. 8-306\u2019s \u201c[soil conservation and water quality plan] can be used for up to ten years without revision if substantial changes in management do not occur.\u201d <em>Soil Conservation Water Quality Plan Implementation, </em>MDA, http://mda.maryland.gov/resource_conservation/ Pages/scwqpi.aspx (last visited Apr. 11, 2013). This is logical because Agrie. \u00a7 8-306\u2019s approach to prevent environmental deterioration and degradation of Maryland\u2019s waters is wider, concerning the management of erosion and runoff in an effort to maximize the best use of the soil and water via enforcement mechanisms. <em>See id. </em>However, Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1(b)\u2019s method is narrower, focusing on the nutrients necessary to yield a productive crop, requiring farmers to \u201cfollow guidelines for the amount, timing, and placement of nutrients on each crop.\u201d <em>Nutrient Management Implementation Plan, </em>MDA, http:// mda.maryland.gov/resource_conservation/Pages/nmp.aspx (last visited Apr. 11, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">As we noted previously, both Agrie. \u00a7\u00a7 8-306 and 8-801.1(b) refer to protecting the identity of the individual for whom the plans were prepared, but Agrie. \u00a7 8-306 does not include any time period. If we conclude that the General Assembly intended to provide an exemption regarding NMP documents for three years, but after, the NMP records were unprotected, and could be disclosed, this interpretation would contradict Agrie. \u00a7 8-306\u2019s language. Hence, the soil conservation and water quality plans would be forever exempt from disclosure. However, because our Courts have traditionally examined the statutory scheme in its entirety and in an \u201cattempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect,\u201d <em>Henriquez, </em>413 Md. at 297-98, 992 A.2d 446 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(quoting <em>Bowen, </em>402 Md. at 613-14, 937 A.2d 242) (quoting <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d 186), and \u201cso that the various sections of the article do not conflict with one another,\u201d <em>Ctr.

Under the pertinent Washington statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">In addition to the submission of [NMPs] to [the Department], the permit require[d] CAFOs to maintain \u201c \u2018certain additional operational records onsite\u2019 \u201d and make these records \u201c \u2018available upon request by [the Department] and [the Department of] Agriculture.\u201d If a member of the public requested] information, [the Department] [would] request the information from the CAFOs.

The plaintiff-community organization filed a complaint with the Pollution Control Hearings Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d), who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>affirmed. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff then filed a complaint with the circuit court, contending that \u201c...

The plaintiff-environmental organization submitted a request to the Department of Agriculture (\u201cthe Department\u201d) regarding disclosure of feedlot operators\u2019 NMPs. <em>Id. </em>at 633. The Department failed to disclose the NMPs, averring that it did not have possession. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff filed a complaint, and the circuit court held that \u201cthose NMPs need not be produced by [the Department] because they had been filed using the Idaho OnePlan computer format, and a statute directed] information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>so submitted [as] exempt from disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Idaho statute provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">...

The Department avowed that the public only had a right to inspect regarding NMPs that were in its possession. <em>Id. </em>Concerning the NMPs submitted electronically, the plaintiff maintained that only voluntary conservation plans were exempted. <em>Id. </em>at 636. The Idaho Supreme Court was unpersuaded by the Department\u2019s contention, stating that possession was irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>Regarding the plaintiffs assertion, the Idaho court held that this contention was not stated in the plain language of the statute, and ultimately exempted the Idaho OnePlan NMPs. <em>Id. </em>However, relating to the non-electronic submitted NMPs, the Court concluded that there was no statutory exemption, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">If the Legislature should choose to make NMPs exempt from public inspection, it certainly could do so, as it has on a number of occasions for records compiled elsewhere which come into the hands of a public agency, such as court files of judicial proceedings, law enforcement records, trade secrets, draft legislation, tax commission records, and, ... certain information submitted via the Idaho One Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\"><em>Id. </em>(additional citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">We further examine federal case law, and surmise that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is a leading court in examining the issue. In <em>Zanoni v.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (\u201cAgriculture Department\u201d) denied her request, alleging that FOIA exempted the documents from disclosure. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court, and the Court ordered that the Agriculture Department respond to the plaintiffs request. <em>See id. </em>at 234. The U.S. Department provided the entities\u2019 names, but did not disclose any further information. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The U.S. District Court examined the organic statute,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">[A]ny officer or employee of the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture ... shall not disclose ... information provided by an agricultural producer or owner of agricultural land concerning the agricultural operation, farming or conservation practices, or the land itself, in order to participate in programs of the [U.S.] Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 236.

The U.S. Forest Service (\u201cForest Service\u201d) stated that the draft reports were exempted pursuant to FOIA. <em>Id. </em>at 32. The plaintiff filed a complaint, and both parties filed motions for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 33. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia stated that the purpose of the alleged exception was to \u201c \u2018protect [ ] the consultative functions of government by maintaining the confidentiality of advisory opinions, recommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies [were] formulated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36. Amongst other reasons, the Court concluded that the documents were not protected because (1) the Forest Service was meticulous in not revealing recommendations or opinions, and (2) the Forest Service\u2019s employees obtained the drafts without disclosing any policy or preliminary positions. <em>Id. </em>at 37-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In <em>Defenders of Wildlife et al. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>311 F.Supp.2d 44, 50-51 (D.D.C.2004), the plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request to the Agriculture Department regarding the disclosure of (1) all records relating to suspending national forest management regulations, and (2) a record of non-agency individuals who were contacted concerning reviewing, recommending, or amending the regulations. The Forest Service disclosed 166 pages, but exempted 636 pages of important documents from disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 51. In addition to other documents, the exempted information included (1) redacted electronic communication to protect investigating personnel\u2019s personal information, (2) an outline that was redacted to protect the theories of the individuals, and (3) documents referring to conversations between agency personnel. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>52.

First, the NMPs at issue constitute public records pursuant to the Public Information Act, and it permits the public to inspect any public record at any reasonable time. Moreover, if we determine that the General Assembly intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ed to offer an exemption concerning NMP documents for three years, but after, the NMP records could be disclosed, this interpretation would frustrate the purpose of Agrie. \u00a7 8-306(b)\u2019s language. Thus, Agrie. \u00a7 8-306\u2019s required soil conservation and water quality plans would be forever exempt from disclosure. Lastly, the MDA articulated the reasons why it possessed the NMP documents beyond three years, and neither reason concerned confidentiality of the permit applicant\u2019s identity. Instead, the reasons were comparisons of the original and new filings, determining whether there was a willful violation by examining past compliance, and ascertaining the impact and success of the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">As Judge Harrell stated in <em>Whitley, </em>429 Md. at 153, 55 A.3d 37 \u201c[i]n construing a statute, we must keep in mind also the purpose of the provisions at issue.\u201d (citing <em>Barbre v.
