(\u201cCPS\u201d), against appellant, Alicia Daley Paul, individually and as parent and guardian of Christopher Clinton Paul (\u201cChristopher\u201d), in a cause of action for negligence and recovery of medical ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>penses related to the near drowning of then three-year-old Christopher in a swimming pool at Country Place Apartments. Appellant noted an appeal raising four issues, which we consolidate and rephrase as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af7\">Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees, and ruling that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">A. Christopher was a trespasser to whom appellees owed only a duty of care to avoid willful and wanton misconduct or entrapment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">B. Appellees did not engage in willful or wanton misconduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">C. Statutory and regulatory provisions governing public pools in Montgomery County did not apply to the pool at Country Place Apartments and, as such, appellees did not owe Christopher any statutory or regulatory duty?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer question I.C in the affirmative. At oral argument, during rebuttal, appellant\u2019s counsel stipulated that, if this Court determined the existence of a regulatory duty, appellant would not proceed under common law theories of liability at trial. In light of our decision as to question I.C, we do not address questions I.A or I.B, concerning Christopher\u2019s common law status and any common law duty owed to him by appellees. We shall, therefore, reverse and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Add\">(a) The Pool</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Blackburn owns an apartment complex in Burtonsville, Maryland called Country Place Apartments (\u201cCountry Place\u201d), which has an outdoor swimming pool (\u201cthe pool\u201d) and a playground as community amenities. Country Place is a large apartment community, containing over 300 units. Berkshire generally manages Country Place, and CPS manages the pool at Country Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The pool and pool deck are surrounded by a metal fence approximately six feet high. The pool and fence were constructed in 1978, and, at the time of the incident, the fence had not undergone any replacements or renovations since its original construction. Two vertical gates controlled access to the pool area. When the pool was open, pool staff would remove the padlock and chain that locked the gates together, and the gates would swing in toward the pool, closest to the deep end of the pool. When the pool was closed, pool staff would affix the padlock and chain to the upper half of the gate. There was no lock on the bottom portion of the gate. Berkshire, the property management company, was responsible for maintaining and repairing the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">On March 23, 2010, CPS entered into a -written \u201cSwimming Pool Management Agreement\u201d (hereinafter \u201cthe pool agreement\u201d) with Blackburn, for operation and maintenance of the pool from May 29, 2010, to September 6, 2010, for $19,900.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the pool agreement, the general pool hours are listed as 12:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and any holiday. Under the pool agreement, CPS agreed to meet with a representative of Blackburn \u201c[a]t least once per week ... to discuss the pool operation and any related problems.\u201d At that weekly meeting, CPS was to \u201cmake any recommendations to [Blackburn] which it deem[ed] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>appropriate for a safer, more efficient or more beneficial operation of the pool.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Pursuant to the terms of the pool agreement, CPS was responsible for the daily maintenance and operation of the pool, limited to maintaining proper filter operation, water quality, and health department records, and cleaning the pool and pool area. CPS also agreed to conduct \u201ca minimum of three (3) Pool Inspections per week by its supervisory personnel!,]\u201d that \u201cwfould] cover all phases of pool operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Pursuant to the pool agreement, Blackburn was responsible for completing the following tasks by April 15, 2010:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">1. Complete all building repairs such as broken windows or doors, toilet partitions, damaged tile or dry wall etc. Provide soap, towel and tissue dispensers at all fixtures as needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">2. Complete any needed plumbing repairs!.] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">5. Provide working locks on all doors, gates and windows and provide [CPS] with keys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">6. [E]nsure all fencing meets local codes and prevents unauthorized entry into the pool area. Repair as necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">In the pool agreement, CPS and Blackburn agreed that CPS would not be \u201cresponsible for any losses or damages caused when the pool is not open, by those acts or omissions of third parties over whom [CPS] has no control, or by failure of [Blackburn] to comply in a timely manner with its responsibilities under\u201d the pool agreement. Blackburn agreed to indemnify CPS against claims \u201carising from or out of maintenance, operation, repairs or use by [Blackburn] and/or its agents, servants, employees, invitees, licensees, contractors and/or trespassers or any breach of the [pool a]greement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Country Place\u2019s \u201cPool Rules and Regulations 2010,\u201d provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-12\">1. No one will be able to enter the pool area without his or her pool pass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>2. All persons using the pool or pool area do so at their own risk. The management and agents assume no responsibility for any accident or injury in connection with such use. Persons using the pool covenant and agree with the owner, management, or its agent for or on account of any loss of life or personal injury, damage to or loss of personal property. Residents and their guests agree to use extreme care and caution in all acts concerning their activities in order to avoid mishaps to themselves and others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">5. Residents and their guests using the pool facilities do so with the understanding that they comply with all the rules and regulations proclaimed by local jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">8. <em>Children in the pool area under the age of 16 years old must be accompanied by an adult member of their family at all times.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">(Emphasis in original). The Pool Rules and Regulations stated that the pool did not open until noon on the days it was open..</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">(b) The Lease and the Near Drowning</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">In June 2010, Christopher, born March 1, 2007, resided at Apartment 22, a second floor apartment at Country Place, with his parents, appellant and Junior Christopher Paul (\u201cJunior\u201d), and his ten-year-old half-brother, Andre. In the \u201cApartment Lease Contract,\u201d dated and signed by appellant on May 19, 2009, appellant agreed to use the pool \u201cwith care in accordance with apartment rules and posted signs\u201d and to \u201ccomply with any written apartment rules and community policies[.]\u201d Blackburn, in turn, agreed to \u201ckeep common areas reasonably clean,\u201d \u201csubstantially comply -with applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding safety, sanitation, and fair housing[,]\u201d and \u201cmake all reasonable repairs, subject to [the tenant\u2019s] obligation to pay for damages for which [the tenant is] liable.\u201d In a \u201cMontgomery County, Maryland-Addendum,\u201d Blackburn agreed to \u201cdeliver the leased premises and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>common areas in a clean, safe, habitable and sanitary condition, free of rodents and vermin, and in complete compliance with all applicable laws.\u201d In the addendum, Blackburn acknowledged its \u201cresponsibility for maintaining the premises in accordance with all applicable laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">On June 11, 2010, appellant, Junior, Andre, and Christopher received pool passes for Summer 2010. On June 12, 2010, Junior took Andre and Christopher to the pool during operating hours. On the morning of the following day, Sunday, June 13, 2010, when he woke up, Christopher asked appellant if he could go to the pool, and she told him the pool was not open. Christopher continued to ask appellant if he could go to the pool, and appellant told him that the pool was closed, that they could not go to the pool, and that they would go to the pool in the afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Later that morning, at approximately 10:00 a.m., Andre and Christopher left the apartment to play at the playground.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While playing, Andre left Christopher to fetch a toy that Christopher had thrown down a hill next to the playground. Wdien Andre returned to the top of the hill near the playground, he could not find Christopher. Andre went to Apartment 22 to notify appellant that he could not find Christopher, and asked whether Christopher had returned to the apartment. Because Christopher had not returned, appellant and Andre left the apartment to search for him outside, believing that he was hiding from them. Appellant sent Andre to look behind the building, while she began looking in the parking lot at the front of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">After not finding Christopher in front of or behind the building, appellant and Andre eventually searched near the pool, which was closed, and appellant observed Christopher\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>shirt and shoes on the ground inside the closed pool area. As appellant realized Christopher was in the pool area, Tiffany Miles, the pool manager, and Vitalie Plamiodeala, a lifeguard, arrived in a vehicle to open the pool for the day. Appellant yelled for Miles and Plamiodeala to open the gate because she believed her son was inside the pool area. At that point, Plamiodeala unlocked the padlock with a key and removed the chain on the gate. Appellant ran into the pool area and discovered Christopher unresponsive and submerged in the water in the five foot section of the pool closest to the gate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plamiodeala jumped into the pool and pulled Christopher out. Christopher was not breathing and did not have a pulse. Miles called 911 and she and Plamiodeala began rescue efforts on Christopher.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Paramedics arrived on the scene and continued rescue efforts as Christopher was still unresponsive. Paramedics administered epinephrine to restart Christopher\u2019s heart and transported him emergently to Howard County General Hospital, where he was partially stabilized, before being transported by helicopter to Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Christopher suffered a severe anoxic brain injury as a result of the near drowning. As a result, Christopher is now nonverbal, visually impaired, lacks purposeful movement of his extremities, requires a gastric feeding tube, and is dependent on constant care from others for activities of daily living.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Detective Paula Hamill conducted an investigation of the near drowning, taking notes on the condition of the pool, fence, and gate. According to Detective Hamill, \u201cthere was a lot of play in the gate, so that it allowed for a large area from the midpoint down in either direction, whether [she] was pulling it forward or towards [her] or pushing it away from [her], and [she] was able to completely put [her] leg from the waist down into that [] opening, how the gate bowed out.\u201d Detective Hamill reported that it did not take the \u201cforce of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>adult\u201d to open the gate. Detective Hamill observed that metal \u201ccrossbars\u201d on the fence were missing in some areas and that, in those areas, she could grab the two bars and \u201cpull them open.\u201d Detective Hamill observed a pair of shoes and a T-shirt \u201con the table, [ ] right inside, [ ] the first table [ ] inside the front gate.\u201d Detective Hamill noted that she did not recall any specific cuts or bruises on Christopher.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Detective Hamill concluded, based on her investigation, that Christopher \u201cgained entry to the pool through the front gate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">At a deposition taken on August 10, 2011, Benjamin Alexander Beerman, Berkshire\u2019s property manager, testified that he inspected the fence surrounding the pool within a day of the incident and measured six inch spacing between the vertical posts of the fence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Beerman admitted that, at the time of the near drowning, he had not yet met with CPS representatives nor did he know whether CPS was inspecting the pool three times per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">At a deposition taken on September 29, 2011, Miles testified that, either on the day of the near drowning or the day after, she completed an \u201cOwner\u2019s Inspection Report\u201d recommending that the fencing around the pool be repaired so that there were no \u201cbreaks\u201d or gaps in the fencing. Miles testified that, at some point after the near drowning, she learned that the pool barrier had been \u201cpainted and repaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In a \u201cProfessional Report\u201d prepared on July 26, 2011, Dr. William N. Rowley, Ph.D., P.E., of Rowley International Inc., an aquatic design, engineering, and consulting firm, concluded that Country Place has \u201cone of the most inadequate swimming pool barrier systems [he had] seen in over 40 years of professional swimming pool design practice.\u201d Dr. Rowley visited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Country Place pool on July 15, 2011, and, at that time, \u201ca sphere of 4 inches could be passed through EVERY opening in the fence that [he] tested near the gate[.]\u201d Dr. Rowley observed that, at the time of the near drowning, \u201ceach of the 1'// posts in the ... fence had a 51/2\" gap on either side, through which ... Christopher [ ] could have easily passed[.] Christopher[\u2019s] head width was only 5-1/8\".\u201d Dr. Rowley further observed that, at the time of the near drowning, \u201cone of the 8/4\" vertical bars in the fence was not riveted at its midpoint and was sufficiently movable to allow a 7\" gap through which [ ] Christopher [ ] could have easily passed[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">(c) The Complaint and Answers</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">On December 17, 2010, appellant filed a complaint naming appellees as defendants,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> alleging negligence <em>per se, </em>negligence, and recovery of medical expenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As to negligence <em>per se, </em>in the complaint, appellant alleged that appellees failed to comply with Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 10.17.01.01 <em>et seq., </em>Montgomery County Code (\u201cMont.Co. Code\u201d) \u00a7 51-1 <em>et seq., </em>and Code of Montgomery County Regulations (\u201cCOMCOR\u201d) 51.00.01 <em>et seq. </em>Appellant alleged that Christopher was a member of the class of persons to be protected by COMAR, the Montgomery County Code, and COMCOR, that his injuries were of the type the regulations and statutes were intended to protect against, and that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>lees were aware or had reason to know of the \u201cdangerous conditions\u201d at the pool. Appellant alleged that appellees breached their statutory and regulatory duties by, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to ensure the pool was completely enclosed by a barrier that met the statutory and regulatory requirements, and caused Christopher\u2019s injuries. Appellant requested recovery of medical expenses, alleging that she had expended and expected to continue expending significant monies to care for Christopher. Appellant ultimately requested compensatory damages in the amount of $15,000,000, plus costs and pre- and post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">As to negligence, appellant alleged that Christopher, as a resident, was an invitee at Country Place, and that appellees owed a duty of care to maintain the pool in a reasonably safe condition for all residents. Appellant alleged that appellees \u201cknew or should have known that the lack of closed and/or properly secured fence gates made the pool readily accessible to children outside of operating hours while no lifeguards or other staff members were present, thereby creating a dangerous condition to persons unable to comprehend it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">On May 12, 2011, Blackburn and Berkshire filed an answer to the complaint, generally denying liability. On May 16, 2011, CPS filed an answer to the complaint, generally denying liability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>(d) Motions for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">On November 30, 2011, CPS and Berkshire and Blackburn filed motions for summary judgment as to the claims asserted by appellant, arguing that they owed no duty to Christopher because he was a trespasser. CPS argued that the only duty owed to a trespasser is to \u201crefrain from willfully or wantonly injuring or entrapping that person[,]\u201d and that no evidence demonstrated CPS acted in a willful or wanton manner causing Christopher injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Blackburn and Berkshire contended that, although Christopher was an invitee while on the playground, he became a trespasser at the pool as he \u201cpenetrated the pool barrier\u201d when the pool was closed and locked. Like CPS, Blackburn and Berkshire asserted that the only duty they owed to Christopher, a trespasser, was to \u201c \u2018abstain from willful or wanton misconduct and entrapment[,]\u2019 \u201d and that there was no evidence that they acted with willful or wanton misconduct. (Citation omitted). Blackburn and Berkshire maintained that Christopher\u2019s injuries were caused by superseding negligent acts of others\u2014namely, that Christopher was allowed to play outside without proper supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">As to alleged statutory and regulatory violations, in the motion for summary judgment, Blackburn and Berkshire contended that the current applicable statutes and regulations \u201cwere not enacted when th[e] pool fence was constructed and no statute or regulation require[d Blackburn and Berkshire] to bring the pool barrier into compliance with the more recent regulations.\u201d Blackburn and Berkshire argued that, aside from any alleged statutory and regulatory violations, the violations did not create a duty to Christopher because he was a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">On December 16, 2011, appellant filed a consolidated opposition to the motions for summary judgment and a statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>material facts in dispute. In the opposition, appellant contended that summary judgment was inappropriate because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\">(1) the status of the parties was that of landlord (or landlord\u2019s agent) and tenant; (2) [appellees] owed a duty to maintain the pool barrier in a reasonably safe condition for their tenants; (3) [appellees] owed statutory and regulatory duties to prevent children from entering the pool when it was closed; (4) [appellees] negligence was the proximate cause of Christopher\u2019s injuries; and (5) Blackburn and Berkshire concede[d] that Christopher\u2019s status on the property [was] a question of fact for the jury.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">As to Christopher\u2019s status, appellant contended that Christopher, as a tenant, was an invitee to whom appellees owed a duty of care. As to a regulatory duty, appellant argued that appellees were required to comply with statutory and regulatory provisions governing pool barriers, including a requirement that the barrier not allow passage of a sphere four inches in diameter.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">On January 3, 2012, CPS filed a reply in support of its motion for summary judgment against appellant. CPS argued that negligence based on an alleged statutory violation requires that the injured person, at the time of the injury, have \u201cthe right to be on the property of the defendant^]\u201d <em>i.e. </em>not be a trespasser. (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted). CPS maintained that it had \u201cno liability under the statutes and regulations because it had no responsibility for the pool barrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">On January 3, 2012, Blackburn and Berkshire filed a reply in support of their motion for summary judgment as to the claims asserted by appellant. Blackburn and Berkshire argued that they were not required to comply with COMAR provisions regulating spacing between vertical fence rails be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>cause the pool and fence were constructed in 1978 and the regulations allegedly violated were enacted in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">(e) Summary Judgment Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">On January 19, 2012, the circuit court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment. During the hearing, as to the alleged regulatory violation, counsel for Blackburn and Berkshire argued, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">The legislative history and the regulation itself are very clear that they do not apply[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">Everybody knows this incident occurred. Montgomery County Health Department knows this incident occurred____ Berkshire has never been cited for the pool</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">being not in compliance with COMAR regulations, because it\u2019s not required to be. It\u2019s grandfathered under the law, and the regulations simply don\u2019t apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court took the motions under advisement, and acknowledged that other issues, including the motion to sever, remained pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">(f) The Circuit Court\u2019s Order and Memorandum Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">On January 26, 2012, the circuit court issued an Order granting appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment, finding CPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to indemnity moot, and finding Blackburn\u2019s and Berkshire\u2019s motion to sever cross claims moot. On the same day, the circuit court issued a Memorandum Opinion, finding that Christopher was a trespasser to whom appellees owed only a duty to \u201cabstain from willful or wanton misconduct or entrapment.\u201d The circuit court found that \u201c[t]here was no evidence ... that [appellees\u2019] actions rose to the level of willful and wanton misconduct[,]\u201d and that, therefore, appellees \u201cdid not breach a duty.\u201d As to statutory code violations, the circuit court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">\n<em>Statutory Code Violations</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\">[Appellant] argue[s] that [appellees] violated statutes and regulations governing public swimming pools, including <em>Code of Md. Regs. </em>(\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 10.17.01.21 (2010), <em>Mont</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>gomery Code </em>\u00a7 51-15 (2010), and COMCOR 51.00.01.03. These regulations are designed to protect and promote public health and safety of individuals at public pools in Maryland. However, a potential violation of a statutory regulation is relevant only if the Court found that [appellees] owed duty beyond that of a trespasser. As explained above, [appellees] did not owe any duty to Christopher, other than to avoid willful or wanton misconduct or entrapment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\">[Appellant] offer[s] an additional argument in relation to the statutory duties allegedly imposed on [appellees]\u2014that their violations set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence. Courts have found <em>prima facie </em>cases of negligence when a plaintiff demonstrates a \u201cviolation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons ... [including] the plaintiff, and ... that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u201d The violation claimed by [appellant] is [appellees\u2019] failure to ensure that the Country Place pool was enclosed by a barrier with a locked entrance that does not allow passage of a sphere four (4) inches in diameter. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.17.01.21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">The Country Place pool was built in 1978 and COMAR 10.17.01.21 became effective on February 10, 1997. [Appellant] contend[s] that the Code required some pre-existing pools to comply with the new requirements and that the Country Place pool was one of them. The Court disagrees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">COMAR 10.17.01.03B states that the owner of a pool in existence prior to the enactment of the regulations \u201cshall maintain the pool or spa, including appurtenant structures and equipment as originally approved.\u201d Nothing in this subsection requires the owners of the Country Place pool to bring the enclosure into compliance with the later-enacted regulations. Furthermore, COMAR 10.17.01.03E enumerates several safety requirements which are <em>not </em>exempt from the new regulations. The required barriers, as defined in COMAR 10.17.01.21, are not included in that list of required updates. Therefore, the Court finds that even if Christopher was an invitee when he circumvented the pool, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>subsequent duty analysis would not include the application of the COMAR regulations as they did not require Country Place pool to meet those new standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">Finally, a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence also requires the finding that the violation of a regulation was the proximate cause of the injury. While this analysis is not required under the instant facts, the Court finds that the mere existence of the fence, without more, is not the core conduct within this cause of action for negligence. Without a scintilla of evidence demonstrating exactly how Christopher circumvented the fence, the Court cannot consider a possible violation as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">The reality of this case is that a tragic accident occurred on June 13, 2010 and the Court deeply sympathizes with the entire Paul family. But the facts do not dictate the application of the law, and the law in this situation is clear. Christopher\u2019s legal status when he entered the pool enclosure was that of a trespasser. [Appellees\u2019] duty owed him was to prevent any willful or wanton misconduct, a situation that the facts do not support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">(Some internal citations omitted) (some alterations and omissions in original).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>On March 21, 2012, appellant filed a supplemental notice of appeal, appealing \u201call appealable issues.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We review a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo.

Appellant argues that both state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>county regulations \u201cimpose explicit gate and barrier restrictions to promote safety and prevent unauthorized entry into pool areas.\u201d Appellant asserts that appellees failed to comply with COMAR as the pool barrier permitted passage of an object larger than a four inch sphere. Appellant maintains that under the Montgomery County Health Department, \u201cthe pool barrier was required to be in compliance with COMAR and COMCOR.\u201d Appellant points out that the grandfathering provision contained in COMAR\u2014COMAR 10.17.01.03A\u2014ex-empted only seven specific areas from compliance, and those areas did not include gates and barriers. Appellant contends that although COMAR 10.17.01.03E sets forth certain regulations from which previously-approved pools are not exempted from compliance, a reading of the regulation does not lead to the conclusion that previously-approved pools need not comply with COMAR 10.17.01.21. By way of example, appellant asserts that, under the circuit court\u2019s reasoning, other provisions not specifically mentioned in COMAR 10.17.01.03A or E, would not apply, including provisions that pre-1997 pools could be inspected by the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Appellant contends that COMAR and COMCOR created statutory duties to Christopher. Appellant argues that whether Christopher was a trespasser at the time of the incident is not relevant to a determination of whether appellees were required to comply with the statutory and regulatory provisions at issue in the case. Appellant asserts that the violation of a statutory duty is presumptive evidence of negligence. According to appellant, where a plaintiff presents evidence of a statutory violation that proximately caused injury, evidence of the violation is sufficient to submit the case to the jury for a determination of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Alternatively, appellant contends that the 1970s statutes and regulations are applicable, and those statutes and regulations \u201ccreate a duty to maintain an appropriate pool barrier.\u201d Appellant argues that the circumstances in this case demonstrate that appellees failed to comply with the 1970s statutes and regulations. Appellant asserts that the sole difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>between the 1970s and 1990s statutes and regulations is that the 1997 regulation \u201csimply put a hard number on the longstanding requirement that a pool be \u2018inaccessible to small children\u2019 as required by the older codes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Aside from any statutory and regulatory duty owed, appellant contends that appellees owed Christopher, as a lawful tenant, a contractual duty to \u201cmaintain the pool barrier.\u201d Appellant asserts that appellees breached their contractual duties by, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to prevent unauthorized entry into the pool area and to adequately secure the gate to the pool. Appellant maintains that, because \u201cChristopher was a tenant, the contractual duties existed regardless of his conduct and of common law landowner/trespasser analysis,\u201d and, accordingly, created tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">As to causation, appellant contends that the circuit court erred in finding a lack of proximate causation because there was no direct evidence demonstrating the manner in which Christopher gained access to the pool area. Appellant argues that there was circumstantial evidence supporting an inference that Christopher gained access to the pool by squeezing through the gap in the loose gate. Appellant asserts that even \u201cmeager\u201d circumstantial evidence of negligence is sufficient for the survival of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Appellees respond that \u201cregulations enacted twenty years after the swimming pool and barrier were constructed d[o] not apply to the pool and do not create a duty owed by appellees that did not otherwise exist.\u201d Appellees contend that no statute or regulation required them to bring the pool barrier into compliance with the 1997 COMAR regulation. Appellees argue that COMAR 10.17.01.21, concerning pool barriers, is not included in the enumerated provisions with which an existing pool is required to comply. According to appellees, \u201c[t]he applicable codes in 1978 [when the pool was built] were possibly the BOCA Codes of 1970 and 1975 and the Montgomery County Codes of 1971 and 1972,\u201d none of which \u201chave any requirements concerning the permissible space between vertical rails of a fence surrounding a pool.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Appellees contend that violation of a statute as evidence of negligence applies only where a defendant owes a common law duty to the plaintiff. Appellees argue that they owed no duty to Christopher, a trespasser, and that the statutes and regulations did not create a duty to Christopher. Appellees assert that \u201cthe existence of [a] statute cannot alone create [a] duty[.]\u201d Appellees maintain that \u201cthe \u2018evidence of negligence\u2019 effect of a violation of statute or regulation may be used only by one who is entitled to assert it[,]\u201d <em>i.e. </em>not a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">As to proximate cause, appellees contend that \u201c[a]bsent even a scintilla of evidence that [Christopher] breached the enclosure through a part of it that violated a regulation, no such theoretical violation can be used as evidence of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">(2) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">(a) 1970s Statutes and Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The Laws of Montgomery County, 1971, Chapter 105, governing swimming pools in Montgomery County, became effective on March 10, 1971.

But being caught off guard does not have to mean being unprepared. For those instances when the unexpected does occur and there may be a lapse in supervision, the [NSPI] has developed the Model Child Protection/Barrier Code. This Model Code establishes layers of protection to supplement and complement the requirement for constant adult supervision of young children around aquatic environments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">This is a multipurpose document, intended to meet the need of Code groups, local governments or building departments, where necessary, in the development and promulgation of barrier criteria for residential swimming pools, spas and hot tubs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The Scope of the Model Barrier Code was stated as follows: \u201cThese requirements establish layers of protection for young children against the potential for drowning and near drowning in residential swimming pools, spas and hot tubs by limiting or delaying their access to swimming pools, spas, and hot tubs.\u201d The Purpose of the Model Barrier Code stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">The objective of these requirements is to establish provisions that address supervision, the foremost deterrent to a young child\u2019s access to a pool, spa or hot but and to potential accidental drowning, both at times when a pool, spa or hot tub is in use, and at times when it is not in use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">Additionally, in the event of a lapse in adult supervision, and particularly for the protection of children in the most at-risk age group, less than five (5) years of age, who cannot yet appreciate or be instructed as to the risk of drowning, supplemental layers of protection are established. They limit or delay child access to an outdoor or an indoor pool, spa or hot tub from the surrounding area and to an outdoor or an indoor pool, spa or hot tub from within a building or dwelling where walls of the building or dwelling are the barrier, or part of the barrier, to the pool, spa or hot tub.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFu\">In light of the scope and purpose of the Model Barrier Code, the ANSI and NSPI adopted the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">Where a picket/ornamental fence is provided as the barrier, the horizontal open-air spacing between pickets shall be a maximum of four mohos (4\") (102mm) between all vertical pickets and support posts.

This chapter adopts rationally recognized standards for public pools, public spas, and public pool and spa circulation system components and piping.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\"><em>Id. </em>As to the summary of the economic impact of the new regulations, the Notice of Proposed Action explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">The economic impact should be minimal due to the grandfathering of existing public pools and spas and the creation of the semipublic pool classification of pools and spas at hotels, motels, condominiums, and similar facilities. Pools and spas at facilities with up to four private residences are exempt from these regulations. Although there will be an increased cost to owners of some pools and spas for safety personnel and to meet updated standards, these increases have been minimized. The public should have greater protection of health and safety, resulting in reduced illness and injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Id. </em>In a section titled \u201cAssumptions\u201d under the Estimate of Economic Impact, the impact on owners of public pools and spas is described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">The impact on owners of existing pools and spas should be insignificant due to a grandfathering provision in Regulation .03. Certain pool or spa owners may have an increased cost in order to comply with Regulation .40 which requires safety rescue equipment to be on site. Public pools will be required to have a minimum number of lifeguards and CPR certified personnel on site; however, most public pools currently have these personnel. A new classification of pools termed semipublic is not required to have lifeguards on site and need only provide minimal safety equipment. This dramatically lessens the impact on hotels, motels, condominiums, marinas, and other facilities. Semipublic pools and spas also have different standards than public pools regarding operation, safety, and structures, which alleviates any economic impact to the semipublic facilities. Certain pool and spa owners will have a significant, non-quantifiable reduction in operating and construction costs for bathhouse facilities under Regulation .35 which allows the use of existing toilets, sinks, and showers in an equivalent facility. Any potential economic impact may be spread out through the use of a compliance schedule as provided in Regulation .52.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1068. In the Assumptions, the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene further observed that \u201c[t]he public may have significant, nonquantifiable savings as a result of decreased illness and injury at public pools and spas.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">It was proposed that COMAR 10.17.01.21A(3) require a pool barrier to comply with the requirement that \u201c[ejxcept when the entrance gate is open, an opening in the barrier and in the gate does not allow passage of a sphere 4 inches in diameter[.]\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1074.

Hagner Mgmt. Corp., </em>182 McLApp. 632, 653-54, 959 A.2d 110 (2008), <em>cert, denied, </em>407 Md. 276, 964 A.2d 676 (2009), we explained the concept of violation of a statute as evidence of negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">[T]he Court [of Appeals] stated that \u201cviolation of a statute ... is itself sufficient to prove such a breach of duty as will sustain a private action for negligence.\u201d We elucidated the distinction^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">To prevail in a typical negligence action, one must show \u201c(1) that the defendant was under a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, (2) that the defendant breached that duty, (3) that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss, and (4) that the loss or injury proximately resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty.\u201d But, \u201cwhere there is an applicable statutory scheme designed to protect a class of persons which includes the plaintiff, ... the defendant\u2019s duty ordinarily \u2018is prescribed by the statute\u2019 or ordinance and that the violation of the statute or ordinance is itself of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">Thus, when a plaintiff alleges that a defendant\u2019s duty is established by statute, \u201call that a plaintiff must show is: (a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u201d ... [0]nce the violation of a statute is shown, \u201c[proximate cause is established by determining whether the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent. It is the existence of this cause and effect relationship that makes the violation of a statute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">The plaintiff need not show that the defendant had knowledge of the statutory violation (although the statute itself might require knowledge in order to establish a violation). Notably, while \u201c[t]he majority of state courts treat the violation as negligence <em>per se ... </em>Maryland is among the minority of states that treat the violation simply as evidence of negligence.\u201d Thus, once the plaintiff has presented a <em>prima facie </em>case, by introducing \u201cevidence that the violation of the statute proximately caused the plaintiffs injury,\u201d the defendant\u2019s negligence becomes a question for the fact finder. At that point, \u201c[t]he trier of fact must ... evaluate whether the actions taken by the defendant were reasonable under all the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">(Citations omitted) (some alterations and omissions in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">(e) Relevant Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In <em>Brooks v. Lewin Realty III, Inc., </em>378 Md. 70, 72, 835 A.2d 616 (2003), a lead paint case, the Court of Appeals narrowly held that, \u201cin the context of a tort action against a Baltimore City landlord, based upon a child\u2019s consumption of lead-based paint which was present in the form of flaking, loose, or peeling paint in the leased premises, in violation of the Housing Code, the plaintiff does not have to show that the landlord had notice of the violation to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d The Court of Appeals observed, as an initial matter, that, \u201cunder the common law and in the absence of a statute, a landlord ordinarily has no duty to keep rental premises in repair, or to inspect the rental premises either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 835 A.2d 616. An exception to that general rule, however, is where circumstances permit the violation of a statute to serve as evidence of negligence\u2014namely, \u201cwhere there is an applicable statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>scheme designed to protect a class of persons which includes the plaintiff,\u201d such that the defendant\u2019s duty is prescribed by the statute. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Under such circumstances, to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence, a plaintiff must demonstrate the violation of a statute \u201cdesigned to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff,\u201d and that the \u201cviolation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 835 A.2d 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In <em>Brooks, id. </em>at 81, 835 A.2d 616, the Court of Appeals examined the relevant provisions of the Baltimore City Housing Code, which generally \u201cimpose[d] numerous duties and obligations upon landlords who rent residential property to tenants.\u201d One violation of the Housing Code included maintaining a residence containing flaking, loose, or peeling paint. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 835 A.2d 616. Based on the Court\u2019s review of the applicable statutes and statutory scheme, the Court determinated that the Housing Code did not make a \u201clandlord\u2019s notice of a defective condition a factor with regard to the landlord\u2019s duty to the tenant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In <em>Joseph, </em>173 Md.App. at 321-22, 327, 918 A.2d 1230, a slip-and-fall case, with Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr. speaking for the Court, we discussed the evidentiary principle of a violation of a statute or regulation serving as evidence of negligence generally, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">There must, first and foremost, be an actual violation of a statute or regulation, not simply a statute or regulation in existence that might be violated. The injury, moreover, must be of a type which the statute or regulation was specifically designed to prevent. The plaintiff must also be a member of the class that the statute or regulation was designed to protect. The violation of the statute must constitute a breach of a legally cognizable duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">[Each] of the cases we have cited and discussed has reiterated the general principle that, <em>under some circumstances, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the violation of a statute or regulation may constitute evidence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">(Citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Upon quoting Section 285 of the Restatement, Second of Torts, we explained that courts may accept a statutory rule of conduct, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">[C]ourts may usually accept the statutory rule of conduct as a judicial rule for tort cases, even though the statute itself does not require it. In other words, courts are free to accept, reject, or modify the rule as applied in tort law, so long as the statute does not state or imply to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah4\"><em>Id. </em>at 328, 918 A.2d 1230 (citation and emphasis omitted). We quoted Sections 286 and 288 of the Restatement, Second of Torts, stating that statutes or ordinances must clear a high bar before a court will hold that its violation is evidence of negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 329-30, 918 A.2d 1230. We commented generally that \u201ccourts usually refused to adopt statutory standards that were not aimed at protecting groups that included the plaintiff and those not aimed at protecting against harms of the kind suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, 918 A.2d 1230 (citation and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In <em>Joseph, id. </em>at 309-10, 918 A.2d 1230, the plaintiff, an invitee at an apartment building where his father resided, slipped and fell on an oily substance on a stairwell landing. At issue in the case was whether the plaintiff, to sustain a cause of action in negligence against the defendants, ms required to \u201cprove not only that a dangerous condition existed but also that the [defendants] \u2018had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and that the knowledge was gained in sufficient time to give [them] the opportunity to remove it or to warn the invitee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 918 A.2d 1230 (citations omitted). The plaintiff, however, failed to proffer evidence demonstrating that the defendants had either actual or constructive knowledge of the oily substance on the stairwell. <em>Id. </em>at 319, 918 A.2d 1230. As such, the plaintiff argued that <em>Brooks </em>negated the notice requirement in slip and fall cases and that the defendants violated a provision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Montgomery County Code and that the violation of the statute was evidence of the defendants\u2019 negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 319-20, 918 A.2d 1230. We rejected both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">As to the violation of the provision of the Montgomery County Code\u2014which simply stated in \u201cboiler-plate\u201d language that a landlord must keep all areas of a building \u201cin a clean, sanitary, and safe condition\u201d\u2014we observed that the provision was contained within a larger chapter of the Code, Chapter 29, governing landlord-tenant relations. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 918 A.2d 1230. One of the express purposes of Chapter 29 was to make \u201cthe contractual relationships between landlord and tenant more arm\u2019s length and amicable by removing as many areas of doubt or ambiguity as possible and by providing a specially designed tribunal to reconcile any differences between them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332-33, 918 A.2d 1230. As such, the purpose of Chapter 29 of the Montgomery County Code was to improve relations between landlords and tenants. <em>Id. </em>at 333, 918 A.2d 1230. The chapter purported to \u201cregulate[] and determinen the legal rights, remedies and obligations of the parties and beneficiaries of any rental agreement concerning any rental dwelling unit located in the County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334, 918 A.2d 1230 (emphasis omitted). We observed that many of the provisions of the chapter concerned \u201ccontractual obligations under the lease, not the establishment of tort liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, based upon our review of the statutory scheme and provision at issue, we concluded that \u201c[i]t could not be more clear that Chapter 29 generally, and [the statute at issue] specifically, of the Montgomery County Code did not create a civil action tort for the benefit of invitees in slip-and-fall cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 918 A.2d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">As to the argument that <em>Brooks </em>abolished the element of notice in slip-and-fall cases, we observed that the Montgomery County Council, in enacting the chapter concerning landlord-tenant relations, in no way demonstrated an intent to abolish the element of notice in slip-and-fall cases. <em>Joseph, </em>173 Md.App. at 338, 918 A.2d 1230. We distinguished <em>Brooks </em>as a unique case involving \u201cexclusively with heightened landlord responsibility in Baltimore City for injuries to children caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>by loose and flaking lead paint.\u201d <em>Joseph, </em>173 Md.App. at 341, 918 A.2d 1230. We concluded that the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Brooks </em>\u201cleft no doubt that that case was a lead paint case and nothing but a lead paint case,\u201d thus making its abolishment of the notice requirement under very narrow circumstances inapplicable to traditional slip-and-fall cases such as the one at issue. <em>Joseph, </em>173 Md.App. at 344, 918 A.2d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">In <em>Allen v. Dackman, </em>413 Md. 132, 137, 991 A.2d 1216 (2010), another lead paint case, the Court of Appeals held that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiffs under the Baltimore City Housing Code, even if the plaintiffs were trespassers with no legal right to possess the property and the defendant never intended to lease the property. In <em>Allen, id. </em>at 138-39, 991 A.2d 1216, the plaintiffs resided at the property with their grandmother pursuant to the grandmother\u2019s lease. The owner of the property failed to pay property taxes. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 991 A.2d 1216. Hard Assets, a limited liability company of which the defendant was one of two members, purchased the property at tax foreclosure. <em>Id. </em>Hard Assets did not intend to lease the property and had no knowledge that the plaintiffs, or their grandmother, were residing at the property. <em>Id. </em>Once Hard Assets discovered that the plaintiffs and their grandmother were residing at the property, Hard Assets took legal action to remove them. <em>Id. </em>Exactly one year after purchasing the property at tax foreclosure, Hard Assets sold the property. <em>Id. </em>During the one year that it owned the property, Hard Assets did not receive rent and the grandmother did not pay rent or even know who Hard Assets was. <em>Id. </em>at 139-40, 991 A.2d 1216. The plaintiffs, two minor children, eventually sued Hard Assets, claiming they were exposed to lead at the property. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 991 A.2d 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In <em>Allen, id. </em>at 156, 991 A.2d 1216, among other issues discussed, the Court of Appeals discussed the defendant\u2019s duty to the plaintiffs, persons \u201cwho ha[d] no legal right to possess the property.\u201d Although the defendant argued that the Housing Code was not intended to protect individuals with no legal right to possess the premises, the Court of Appeals deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>mined that \u201cthe common law rule that a landowner owes a limited duty to those who trespass on his or her property[,]\u201d was \u201cinapplicable to the present case because the duty here is based on the Housing Code, not the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 991 A.2d 1216 (citation omitted). The Court of Appeals concluded, upon review of the Housing Code, that the Code was intended to protect \u201coccupants of dwellings[,]\u201d defined as persons who \u201cactually use[ ] or ha[ve] possession of the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156-57, 991 A.2d 1216. As to the violation of a statute as evidence of negligence, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0g\">[The plaintiffs] are within the class of persons that the Housing Code was intended to protect, and they have alleged injuries that the statute was designed to prevent. The express purposes of the Housing Code demonstrated that the City Council intended to protect the occupants of dwellings. [The plaintiffs] are within that protected class of persons.... [T]he Housing Code was intended \u201cto protect children from lead paint poisoning----\u201d [The plaintiffs\u2019] claims are all based on harm to children that was allegedly caused by lead paint poisoning. Accordingly, we conclude that [the defendant] owed a duty to [the plaintiffs] regardless of whether [the plaintiffs] had a legal right to possess the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 157-58, 991 A.2d 1216 (citations and footnotes omitted) (second omission in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In <em>Allen, </em>413 Md. at 158 n. 18, 991 A.2d 1216, in a footnote, the Court of Appeals discussed a case decided by the Supreme Court of North Carolina, <em>Bell v.

A child, who was trespassing on the defendant\u2019s property, drowned in the pool. The court recognized that the defendant would have owed a limited duty to the child under the common law. Regardless, the court held that the defendant should be held to the higher duty established by the ordinance because the ordinance\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose and intent ... was to provide protection for children without reference to whether they were legally entitled to use the pool.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">(Citations omitted). To the Court of Appeals\u2019s concise and accurate summary of <em>Bell, </em>we add only that, in <em>Bell, </em>156 S.E.2d at 715, the Supreme Court of North Carolina discussed the issue of proximate cause, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201cWhat is the proximate or a proximate cause of an injury is ordinarily a question for a jury.

Under these circumstances, whether the violation of said ordinance, if such occurred, was a proximate cause of [the childj\u2019s death is for determination by the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">(3) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">(a) Applicability of Statutes and Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Returning to the case at hand, as an initial matter, we conclude that appellees\u2019 argument\u2014that for there to be a statutory or regulatory duty, there must first be a common law duty\u2014is without merit. In <em>Allen, </em>413 Md. at 157, 991 A.2d 1216, a Baltimore City lead paint case, the Court of Appeals rejected the defendant\u2019s common law trespasser rule argument, stating that the rule was \u201cinapplicable to the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ent case because the duty [was] based on the Housing Code, not the common law.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Bell, </em>156 S.E.2d at 714-15, a case involving a child trespasser who drowned in a swimming pool where the defendant had failed to erect a fence around his pool in violation of a local ordinance, the Supreme Court of North Carolina observed that although, under the common law, the defendant would owe only a limited duty to the child trespasser, the defendant would be held to the higher duty established by the ordinance because \u201c[t]he primary purpose and intent of [the] ordinance ... was to provide protection for children without reference to whether they were legally entitled to use the pool.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A review of the case law above demonstrates that a statutory or regulatory duty is not dependent upon the existence of an underlying common law duty. Indeed, duties may arise from multiple sources. We reject the premise that where a plaintiff pursues a negligence action alleging a violation of a statutory or regulatory duty, the plaintiff must first demonstrate the existence of a common law duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Before proceeding, we state that this Court\u2019s holding does not address, in any manner, the duty of a homeowner with a private swimming pool, as defined by the relevant statutes and regulations. Rather, the opinion concerns only the duties owed by owners of public swimming pools.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Under either the 1970s statutes and regulations or the 1990s statutes and regulations, appellees were required to comply with certain requirements concerning the pool barrier. Under the 1970s statutes and regulations, appellees were required to maintain \u201cin good condition\u201d a \u201cfence, ... or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>[ ] closure designed to prevent accidental or unauthorized entry\u201d into the pool, Laws of Montgomery County, 1971, Chapter 105-12; Mont.

Additionally, under the 1970 and 1975 BOCA Basic Building Codes, appellees were required to \u201cerect and maintain thereon an adequate enclosure either surrounding the property or pool area, sufficient to make such body of water inaccessible to small children.\u201d 1970 BOCA Basic Building Code \u00a7 429.83; 1975 BOCA Basic Building Code \u00a7 428.8.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Similarly, under the 1990s statutes and regulations, appellees were required to enclose a public swimming pool with a \u201cbarrier designed so as to minimize the possibility of unauthorized or unwary persons entering the pool area.\u201d Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51-15(b)(2); COMCOR 51.00.01.03(B). In addition, pursuant to COMAR 10.17.01.21A(3), appellees were required to surround the pool with a barrier such that, \u201c[e]xcept when the entrance gate is open, an opening in the barrier and in the gate does not allow passage of a sphere 4 inches in diameter[.]\u201d Thus, the statutes and regulations from the 1970s and 1990s demonstrate that appellees, and all other owners of public swimming pools, were required to meet certain minimum standards as to the construction and maintenance of an adequate pool barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">As to which set of statutes and regulations applied to the pool at the time of the near drowning on June 13, 2010, the circuit court incorrectly determined that COMAR 10.17.01.21, and, specifically, the requirement that openings in the pool barrier and gate \u201cnot allow passage of a sphere 4 inches in diameter[,]\u201d did not apply to the pool at Country Place. In its Memorandum Opinion, as to the applicability of COMAR 10.17.01.21, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">COMAR 10.17.01.03B states that the owner of a pool in existence prior to the enactment of the regulations \u201cshall maintain the pool or spa, including appurtenant structures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>and equipment as originally approved.\u201d Nothing in this subsection requires the owners of the Country Place pool to bring the enclosure into compliance with the later-enacted regulations. Furthermore, COMAR 10.17.01.03E enumerates several safety requirements which are <em>not </em>exempt from the new regulations. The required barriers, as defined in COMAR 10.17.01.21, are not included in that list of required updates. Therefore, the Court finds that even if Christopher was an invitee when he circumvented the pool, the subsequent duty analysis would not include the application of the COMAR regulations as they did not require Country Place pool to meet those new standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Simply put, the circuit court misread the intent and applicability of COMAR 10.17.01.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">To begin, we conclude that the pool at Country Place is a recreational pool, as that term is defined in COMAR 10.17.01.05B(19)(f)(v), as it is a pool provided by, or used by, an apartment complex consisting of more than ten units. In turn, pursuant to COMAR 10.17.01.05B(18)(b)(ii), a recreational pool is a public pool for purposes of the chapter. COMAR 10.17.01.03, a \u201cgrandfathering\u201d provision, provides limited exemptions for previously approved pools, <em>i.e. </em>owners of previously approved pools are exempt from bringing the pools into compliance with certain specific regulations. COMAR 10.17.01.03A(1) specifically exempts previously approved pools and spas from compliance with seven regulations, including six regulations not at issue in this case, and Regulation .13C, which provides that recreational pools must comply with the American National Standard for Public Swimming Pools. Significantly, COMAR 10.17.01.03A(1) does not exempt recreational pools from complying with COMAR 10.17.01.13A and B, which mandate that owners of existing recreational pools comply with the chapter, generally, as well as with applicable State and local codes\u2014both of which, as detailed above, set certain minimum standards concerning pool barriers, including the four inch sphere requirement for pool barriers contained in COMAR 10.17.01.21A(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>COMAR 10.17.01.03B and C concern maintenance and repairs to previously approved pools. COMAR 10.17.01.03B permits previously approved pools to be maintained in their original condition, and to be repaired to their original condition without complying with the requirements of the chapter (with two exceptions), provided that: (1) the repairs cost less than 25% of the replacement value of the pool, (2) the materials or components used in the repair are the same or equivalent to the materials and components originally approved, and (3) repairing the pool to its original condition \u201c[d]oes not create a danger or allow a danger to continue that threatens the health and safety of an individual using the pool[.]\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> COMAR 10.17.01.03D(1) specifically provides that the limited exemptions detailed in sections A and B are not applicable, however, if the previously approved pool \u201chas a condition that jeopardizes the health or safety of the public, in which case the owner shall ensure that the condition is corrected to meet the requirements of this chapter!.]\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdI\">A review of the exemptions provided for in COMAR 10.17.01.03A and the mandatory regulations set forth in CO-MAR 10.17.01.03E reveals that the two provisions concern national standards promulgated for pools and spas, and whether or not compliance with the national standards is required for previously approved pools and spas under the COMAR chapter governing public swimming pools and spas. <em>See supra </em>notes 19 and 20 for a listing of the regulations referenced in COMAR 10.17.01.03A and E. Both subsections are silent as to a previously approved pool\u2019s compliance with COMAR 10.17.01.21, governing pool barriers. Read together, the subsections of COMAR 10.17.01.03, as a whole, provide that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>limited exemptions set forth in COMAR 10.17.01.03A do not apply if a condition exists that poses a threat to the health or safety of an individual or the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">For the reasons explained above, we conclude that, pursuant to COMAR 10.17.01.03, previously approved pools are required to comply with COMAR 10.17.01.21 and COMAR regulations not specifically exempted by subsection A, in circumstances where a condition exists that poses a danger that threatens the health and safety of pool users. In concluding otherwise, the circuit court failed entirely to consider subsection A and that previously approved recreational or public swimming pools were not exempted from complying with (1) COMAR 10.17.01.21, (2) the whole of COMAR 10.17.01.03B\u2014 which does not allow for maintenance and repair to a previously approved pool\u2019s original condition if such maintenance or repair creates or continues to permit a danger to the health and safety of pool users\u2014and (3) COMAR 10.17.01.03D, which clearly provides that a previously approved pool is not exempted from complying with any regulation contained within the chapter if the pool \u201chas a condition that jeopardizes the health or safety of the public[.]\u201d Were we to conclude otherwise and affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling, we agree with appellant that we would strain interpretation of the Chapter and COMAR 10.17.01.03 to an absurd result and generally create bad public policy. Were we to conclude, as the circuit court did, that previously approved pools could be maintained as originally approved, unless compliance with a regulation is required by COMAR 10.17.01.03E, without regard to the health and safety of the individuals using the pool, we would, of necessity, have to conclude, for example, that owners need not comply with COMAR 10.17.01.50\u2014which provides that an owner may not knowingly permit a person to enter a pool, <em>inter alia, </em>who has an infectious or contagious disease that may be transmitted through water\u2014or with COMAR 10.17.01.25\u2014which provides for the installation and maintenance of circulation systems meeting certain criteria. We refuse to interpret the COMAR regulations in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Our reading of COMAR 10.17.01.03 and our conclusion that previously approved pools are not exempted from compliance with COMAR 10.17.01.21 is bolstered by the legislative history of the regulations as well as the purpose and scope of the Chapter. The Model Barrier Code for Residential Swimming Pools, Spas and Hot Tubs, adopted and incorporated by reference into the COMAR chapter governing swimming pools, <em>see </em>COMAR 10.17.01.04D, demonstrates the great concern that pools be surrounded by an adequate barrier so as to prevent young children from accidental drownings and near drownings. In the purpose statement of the Model Barrier Code, the objective of the Code is listed as establishing requirements to deter access by children to pools, especially children under five years of age, who are not able to appreciate the dangers posed by pools. As part of maintaining an adequate pool barrier, the Model Barrier Code requires that a sphere greater than four inches not be permitted to pass through openings in the barrier. In the Notice of Proposed Action proposing adoption of the new COMAR regulations, the Notice specifically states: \u201cThe purpose of this action is to enact regulations that protect and promote the health and safety of individuals at public and semipublic swimming pools and spas[.]\u201d Proposed Action on Regulations, 22:14 Md. Reg. 1067 (July 7, 1995). The new regulations included a proposed regulation adopting the four inch sphere requirement set forth in the Model Barrier Code. <em>Id. </em>at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">In the Notice of Proposed Action, the economic impact of the new regulations was discussed in some detail. <em>Id. </em>at 1067-68. Although the Notice stated that the economic impact on existing public pools \u201cshould be minimal due to the grandfathering\u201d of those preexisting pools, the Notice specifically recognized that some owners will face \u201cincreased cost[s]\u201d to \u201cmeet updated standards,\u201d and that, as a result of the new regulations, \u201c[t]he public should have greater protection of health and safety, resulting in reduced illness and injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1067. The Assumptions contained within the Notice stated that \u201c[a]ny potential economic impact may be spread out through the use of a compliance schedule!,]\u201d he. an owner of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>preexisting pool could take some time to comply with the new regulations and spread out the costs associated with compliance over time. <em>Id. </em>at 1068. The main Assumption, however, was that \u201c[t]he public [would] have significant, nonquantifiable savings as a result of decreased illness and injury at public pools and spas.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">As adopted, the COMAR regulations demonstrate an intent to provide measures to increase public health and safety at public swimming pools in Maryland. Indeed, COMAR 10.17.01.01 explicitly recognizes this intent and states that the purpose and scope of the chapter is to \u201cenact regulations that protect and promote the public health and safety of individuals at public spas and pools\u201d and to establish \u201cminimum criteria for public pools and spas.\u201d In light of this explicit purpose and scope, and given the legislative history demonstrating an intent to protect children at pools, in part through the adoption of the four inch sphere requirement as set forth in the Model Barrier Code, we have no difficulty in concluding that the Country Place pool was required to comply with the 1997 COMAR regulations, including COMAR 10.17.01.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">As a separate matter, we note that the circuit court failed entirely to consider the applicability of Montgomery County statutory and regulatory provisions concerning pool barriers. Based on our review of the statutes and regulations at issue, we conclude that the 1990s Mont. Co.Code and COMCOR provisions were applicable to the Country Place pool at the time of the incident.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As with the COMAR regulations, we begin by determining that, under Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51\u2014l(j) and COMCOR 51.00.01.01, the Country Place pool is a public swimming pool, \u201cintended to be used collectively by numbers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>of persons for swimming, diving, wading, or recreational bathing.\u201d Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51-3(a), concerning the scope of the chapter, provides that \u201c[a]ll physical standards required by this chapter shall apply to all public swimming pools constructed after the effective date of this chapter.\u201d The Editor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 51-3 states that the effective date of the chapter is March 10, 1971\u2014well before the pool was constructed in 1978 and before the near drowning in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">As to pool barriers specifically, Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51-15(b)(2) provides that public swimming pools must be permanently enclosed \u201cas required by the manual of public swimming pool construction.\u201d The Editor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 51-15 provides that \u00a7 51\u201415(b)(1), concerning permanent enclosures of private swimming pools, and \u00a7 51-16, concerning pool fences, gates, and locks of private swimming pools, \u201capply only to a pool for which the building permit is submitted after the effective date of this law (July 13, 1990).\u201d As the Country Place pool is not by any stretch of the imagination a private swimming pool, the later effective date of those provisions governing private swimming pools is of no consequence to the applicability of Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51-15(b)(2). Indeed, that appellees contend otherwise on brief\u2014namely, that the 1997 version of the Mont. Co.Code \u201cspecifically states that the requirements of Montgomery County Code \u00a7 [] 51-15, \u2018Enclosure of swimming pools\u2019 and Code \u00a7 [ ]51\u201416, \u2018Swimming Pool fences, gates and locks,\u2019 are not applicable to pools built prior to July 13, 1990\u201d\u2014is simply absurd and contrary to the plain language and construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">As Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51-15(b)(2) applies to the Country Place pool, appellees were required, in turn, to comply with COMCOR 51.00.01.03(B), which states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ll outdoor swimming pool areas must be enclosed by an ornamental wire, wood stave or other type of barrier designed so as to minimize the possibility of unauthorized or unwary persons entering the pool area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Thus, in summary, we conclude that the 1997 COMAR regulations governing public swimming pools, and specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>COMAR 10.17.01.21 governing pool barriers, as well as the 1997 Montgomery County statutory and regulatory provisions, were applicable to the Country Place pool at the time of the incident in this <em>case\u2014ie. </em>appellees were required, by statute and regulation, to comply with the regulations and code provisions relevant to public swimming pools, in general, and pool barriers, in particular. That the circuit court found otherwise was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">(b) Violation of a Statute as the Standard of Care</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Next, despite that appellees were required to comply with the 1997 statutes and regulations, as discussed in detail above, we must determine whether those statutes and regulations may properly be invoked to establish a standard of care, and whether violations of the same statutes and regulations may serve as evidence of negligence. We adopt the standard of care set forth in the statutes and regulations, determining that the statutes and regulations create a civil tort action, and that the violation of the statutes and regulations is evidence of negligence. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">As to whether the statutes and regulations at issue are proper for this Court to adopt as the applicable standard of conduct, we are guided by <em>Joseph </em>and the Restatement, Second of Torts. We observe that the statutes and regulations applicable here do not, in themselves, contain express provisions that violation shall result in tort liability, thus, we must determine whether to adopt the requirements of the statutes and regulations \u201cas the standard of conduct necessary to avoid liability for negligence.\u201d Restatement, Second of Torts \u00a7 285 cmt. c. We turn to Restatement, Second of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 288. Here, we have no difficulty in concluding that the statutes and regulations\u2014Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51-15(b)(2), COMCOR 51.00.01.03(B), and COMAR 10.17.01.21\u2014 meet the requirements as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 288 for adoption by this Court as standards of care. The purpose of the Montgomery County statutes and regulations governing public swimming pools and the Maryland regulations governing public swimming pools meets the four part test set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u00a7 286, in that the statutes and regulations are meant to protect: (1) a class of persons including the one whose interest was invaded\u2014namely, the general public, those who use swimming pools, and Christopher, the individual injured in this case; (2) the particular interest <em>invaded\u2014i.e. </em>the health and safety of individuals at public swimming pools; (8) the interest against the kind of harm which resulted\u2014i.e. protecting the health and safety of individuals at public swimming pools from drownings and near drownings; and (4) the interest against the particular hazard from which the harm results\u2014namely, the public\u2019s health and safety are to be protected by adequate pool barriers that prevent individuals from accessing pools and drowning or near drowning.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The purpose of the statutes and regulations is to protect the public\u2019s health and safety at public swimming pools. Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51\u20148(a)(3) provides that the following basic principle, among others, \u201cshall govern the operation of public swimming pools and shall be used to interpret, promulgate regulations and to serve as the basis of issuance and renewal of operating permits[:] ... To eliminate hazards to the health and safety of bathers and occupations due to: a. Unsafe conditions, and b. Unsafe practices.\u201d Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51-3(a), concerning the scope of the chapter, provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">All physical standards required by this chapter shall apply to all public swimming pools constructed after the effective date of this chapter. The physical standards shall apply to all public swimming pools in existence prior to the effective date and to all private swimming pools proposed for conversion to a public swimming pool where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">(2) Any physical condition exists which would endanger the health, safety or life of any person within the pool or immediately adjacent thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The Montgomery County pool barrier regulation includes explicit language that the barrier must be designed \u201cso as to minimize the possibility of unauthorized or unwary persons entering the pool area.\u201d COMCOR 51.00.01.03B. Similarly, as discussed above, the COMAR regulations, and the legislative history leading up to their adoption, demonstrate an intent to provide measures to increase the public health and safety at public swimming pools in Maryland. Indeed, COMAR 10.17.01.01 explicitly recognizes this intent and states that the purpose and scope of the Chapter is to \u201cenact regulations that protect and promote the public health and safety of individuals at public spas and pools\u201d and to establish \u201cminimum criteria for public pools and spas.\u201d The four inch sphere requirement adopted in COMAR 10.17.01.21, based on the Model Barrier Code, was created specifically to ensure that children are deterred and prevented from gaining access to swimming pools where they could drown or near drown. COMAR 10.17.01.03 exempts previously approved pools from compliance with certain regulations except in cases where the public\u2019s health or safety is jeopardized by a condition or danger that exists at the pool. Thus, unlike in <em>Joseph, </em>173 Md.App. at 331-34, 918 A.2d 1230, where the county statute at issue was contained within a chapter generally governing landlord-tenant relations, and where with the express purpose of the statute was to improve relations between landlords and tenants, here, we are satisfied that the purpose of the statutes and regulations is, in large part, to protect the health and safety of the public. We, therefore, conclude that the statutes and regulations were designed to create a cause of action in tort for the protection of the swimming public.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">We move to the next step\u2014whether violation of the statutes and regulations may serve as evidence of negligence in light of the contention that Christopher was a trespasser. <em>See Joseph, </em>173 Md.App. at 321-22, 918 A.2d 1230. In this case, there is no doubt that the criteria identified in <em>Joseph </em>were fulfilled, and that violation of the 1997 statutes and regulations may properly serve as evidence of appellees\u2019 negligence. First, appellees allegedly violated the applicable stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>utes and regulations by maintaining a pool barrier which: (1) allowed passage of a sphere greater than 4 inches in diameter when the gate was closed and (2) failed to minimize the possibility of unauthorized or unwary persons entering the pool area. COMAR 10.17.01.21A(3); Mont. Co.Code \u00a7 51-15(b)(2); COMCOR 51.00.01.03(B). Second, the injury that resulted, Christopher\u2019s near drowning, was a type of injury which the statutes and regulations were specifically designed to prevent\u2014adequate pool barriers prevent children from accessing a pool and near drowning. Finally, Christopher was a member of the class that the statutes and regulations were designed to protect\u2014he was a small child, a member of the general public who used a public swimming pool, and an \u201cunauthorized or unwary person\u201d entering the pool area. We know of no case law or other authority supporting the proposition that the violation of a statute as evidence of negligence is dependent upon the existence of a common law duty. For these reasons, we conclude that contrary to appellees\u2019 contention\u2014that the principle of violation of a statute as evidence of negligence applies only where a defendant owes a common law duty to the plaintiff\u2014the alleged violation of the applicable 1997 statutes and regulations may constitute evidence of negligence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We pause briefly to address Christopher\u2019s status as a tenant and the contractual duties owed to him by appellees pursuant to the lease and its addenda. Pursuant to appellant\u2019s lease, Blackburn agreed to \u201csubstantially comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding safety, sanitation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>fair housing!,]\u201d and to \u201cmake all reasonable repairs, subject to [the tenant\u2019s] obligation to pay for damages for which [the tenant] is liable.\u201d In the Montgomery County, Maryland-Addendum to the lease, Blackburn agreed to \u201cdeliver the leased premises and all common areas in a clean, safe, habitable and sanitary condition, free of rodents and vermin, and in complete compliance with all applicable laws.\u201d In the addendum, Blackburn further acknowledged its \u201cresponsibility for maintaining the premises in accordance with all applicable laws.\u201d In essence, as to the Country Place pool, a common area under appellees\u2019 control used by all tenants, <em>see Hemmings v. Pelham Wood LLP, </em>375 Md. 522, 538, 826 A.2d 443 (2003), Blackburn contracted to meet its statutory and regulatory duties. Accordingly, the contractual duties, in this case, are part and parcel of the statutory and regulatory duties owed, and need not be addressed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">(c) Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">As a final matter, we determine that the circuit court erred in finding that, because there was no direct proof of proximate causation, <em>i.e. </em>there was no direct evidence \u201cdemonstrating exactly how Christopher circumvented the fence,\u201d appellant failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence. We agree with appellant that proximate cause need not be proven with direct evidence, but rather may be shown through circumstantial evidence. For example, in <em>Dow v. L &amp; R Props., Inc., </em>144 Md.App. 67, 75, 796 A.2d 139 (2002), this Court discussed proximate cause in a negligence action generally, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">There is no requirement that, in a negligence suit, \u201cthe matter of causation ... be proved by direct and positive proof to an absolute certainty.\u201d Circumstantial evidence may support a negligence determination if it \u201camounts to a reasonable likelihood or probability rather than a possibility.\u201d Indeed, \u201c \u2018Maryland has gone almost as far as any jurisdiction that we know of in holding that meager evidence of negligence is sufficient to carry the case to the jury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.... \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Of course, \u201ccausation evidence that is wholly speculative is not sufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">(Citations omitted) (omissions in original). <em>See also Lyon v. Campbell, </em>120 Md.App. 412, 437, 707 A.2d 850, <em>cert, denied, </em>350 Md. 487, 713 A.2d 980 (1998) (\u201cWe are mindful that \u2018the matter of causation [does not have] to be proved by direct and positive proof to an absolute certainty.\u2019 Circumstantial evidence that supports a \u2018rational inference\u2019 of causation is legally sufficient.\u201d (Citations omitted) (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">That there was no direct evidence demonstrating how Christopher gained access to the pool area\u2014for example, in the form of an eyewitness, a surveillance videotape, or Christopher\u2019s own recollection\u2014was not dispositive of the determination of proximate cause. The following circumstantial evidence was sufficient to survive summary judgment on the issue of causation and leads to the reasonable inference that Christopher gained access to the pool area by squeezing through the gap in the gate: (1) at the time of the near drowning, Christopher was three-years-old, and his head was approximately 5.1 inches wide; (2) appellant discovered Christopher submerged in the water in the five foot section of the pool closest to the gate; (3) when investigating the near drowning, Detective Hamill observed a pair of shoes and a T-shirt on the \u201cfirst table [ ] inside the front gate\u201d; (4) Detective Hamill observed that there was \u201ca lot of play in the gate,\u201d and that she was \u201cable to completely put [her] leg from the waist down into that [ ] opening, [with] how the gate bowed out\u201d; (5) Detective Hamill stated that it did not take the \u201cforce of an adult\u201d to open the gate; (6) Beerman, Berkshire\u2019s property manager, testified that he inspected the pool barrier within a day of the near drowning and measured six inch spacing between the vertical posts of the fence; (7) neither Detective Hamill nor Officer Magnelli observed any cuts, bruises, or other injuries to <em>Christopher\u2014i.e. </em>marks indicating that he climbed or jumped over the six foot fence surrounding the pool; and (8) Officer Magnelli testified that there was no evidence suggesting that Andre assisted Christopher in gaining access to the pool area. Based on this chain of circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>stantial evidence, we have no difficulty in concluding that the circuit court erred in finding there was not a \u201cscintilla of evidence demonstrating exactly how Christopher circumvented the fence,\u201d and in granting summary judgment on the issue of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

If a plaintiff is harmed by violation of such a statute, courts think of the plaintiff\u2019s case as an ordinary negligence case with the same issues and rules as other negligence cases except that the plaintiff proves negligence by proving violation of the statute.

The Supreme Court of North Carolina in no way stated or implied, however, that the statutory duty would not exist if the defendant owed no common law duty to the child <em>trespasser\u2014i.e. </em>that the statutory duty was wholly dependent upon the existence of a common law duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b123-5\">.
