The Petition sought reversal of a decision by appellee, the Commissioner <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development (\u201cDepartment\u201d), revoking Madison Park\u2019s Multiple-Family Dwelling License.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Madison Park presented the following three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">1. Did the Circuit Court err when it ruled that the regulation requiring multiple family license holders to \u201cprevent\u201d criminal activity was not void for vagueness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-12\">2. Did the Circuit Court err when it found the Commissioner had not violated [Madison Park]\u2019s due process rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-13\">3. Did the Circuit Court err in affirming the Commissioner\u2019s Decision was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The Commissioner asks an additional question in its reply brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">In the absence of legislative authorization, does [Madison Park] have the right to take an appeal of [the Commissioner's determination to this Court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we find the Commissioner\u2019s decision to be supported by substantial evidence and affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Madison Park owns and operates Madison Park North Apartments (\u201cMPNA\u201d), comprising approximately two city blocks along North Avenue in Baltimore City. MPNA consists of twenty-six apartment buildings and fifty-two townhouses, totaling over two hundred units. The North Avenue area where MPNA is located is notorious for crime, particularly rampant drug trafficking and associated violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">By letter dated August 16, 2010 (\u201cNotice of Hearing\u201d), the Commissioner notified Madison Park that the Department would hold a hearing on September 9, 2010, to \u201cdetermine if the [License] for the property should be revoked.\u201d The Notice of Hearing cited Baltimore City Code (\u201cBCC\u201d), Art. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 5-15 and 5-16, which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">\u00a7 5-15. Revocation of license\u2014In general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">Subject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 5-16 of this subtitle, the Commissioner may revoke a license if the Commissioner finds, or if the Fire Chief, Health Commissioner, or Police Commissioner certify to the Commissioner, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">(1) the owner or lessee of a multiple-family dwelling or rooming house has failed to comply with any lawful notice or order to correct a violation that affects the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the occupants of the property or of the general public; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-12\">(2) the owner or lessee of a multiple-family dwelling or rooming house, or any agent of the owner or lessee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-13\">(i) has allowed the premises to be used for the purpose [of] prostitution, drug trafficking, or other criminal activity or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>for any other activity that creates or constitutes a nuisance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">(ii) knew or should have known that the premises were being used for one of these purposes and failed to prevent them from being so used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u00a7 5-16. Revocation of license\u2014Notice and hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">(a) <em>In general.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">No license may be revoked unless the Commissioner first gives the licensee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">(1) not less than 10 days notice in writing of the Commissioner\u2019s intent to revoke the license; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">(2) an opportunity to be heard as to why the license should not be revoked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">(b) <em>Exception.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">The Commissioner may revoke a license without prior notice and opportunity to be heard if, in the opinion of the Commissioner or the Fire Chief, Health Commissioner, or Police Commissioner, the health, safety, or welfare of the occupants or of the general public are in imminent danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">The Notice of Hearing cited numerous instances where the police responded to crime at the complex and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-13\">There is sufficient evidence to establish that MPNA is being used for the purposes of drug usage, storage and trafficking and other drug-related activity that creates and constitutes a nuisance, as well as violent criminal activity constituting a nuisance, and that you knew or should have known that the premises were being used for these purposes and failed to prevent such use. By letter dated October 3, 2008, I alerted you to the overwhelming amount of serious, illegal drug activity, including drug-related crimes of violence, at MPNA in the hope that you would take whatever steps were necessary to prevent the premises from being so used. Unfortunately, you have failed to prevent the premises from being so used. Between October 3, 2008 and August 7, 2010, the police have been called to [the complex] hundreds of times----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>It also stated, \u201cYou have the right to be heard and represented at the hearing. Failure to appear at the hearing will not prevent the Commissioner or the Commissioner\u2019s designee from issuing a default order to revoke the [License]. In revoking the [License], neither the Commissioner, the [Department], nor the City of Baltimore are taking possession, ownership or control of the property.\u201d The Notice of Hearing further explained where the hearing would be held and the procedures Madison Park should follow to request a postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The Rules adopted by the Commissioner, pursuant to BCC Art. 13, \u00a7 5-2, gave Madison Park the right to present evidence, call witnesses, make objections and argument, and established that the Commissioner \u201cmay revoke a license upon a finding by a \u2018preponderance of the evidence....\u2019\u201d Madison Park was granted a postponement by letter dated September 2, 2010, and the hearing was rescheduled for September 22, 2010. Settlement attempts were unsuccessful between the parties prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">On September 22 and 23, 2010, the Commissioner conducted the revocation hearing. Testimony was taken from four Baltimore City police officers, a City official, a general partner of Madison Park, MPNA\u2019s property manager and maintenance supervisor, the commanding officer of the security company hired to police MPNA, a property management consultant, several MPNA residents, and a neighborhood community organizer. The Commissioner received into evidence 55 exhibits from the Department, including 49 police reports and other documentation of criminal activity in or around MPNA and 11 exhibits from Madison Park. Madison Park introduced evidence regarding how it had implemented crime-reduction measures at MPNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On October 15, 2010, the Commissioner issued a decision and order revoking Madison Park\u2019s License. In its decision, the Commissioner stated in part:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>There was substantial credible testimony about the amount of crime at the complex. Major [Dennis] Smith [of the Baltimore Police Department (\u201cBPD\u201d) ] testified that the complex is \u201cthe most violent area in my district\u201d ... [and] ... there are \u201cat least three drug shops that I know of in the complex [or] related to the complex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\">Major Smith testified that the shops deal right out of the complex, and that \u201c[s]everal of the players use the apartments to package their narcotics, store their narcotics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">Lt. [Dorsey] McVicker [of the BPD] also testified that M[PNA] was used for drug trafficking, and named one dealer in particular....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">Sgt. [Harvey] Martini [of the BPD] testified that he executed search and seizure warrants at \u201cnumerous locations\u201d within the complex, based in part on sending confidential informants to purchase narcotics from someone in the complex. He testified that drugs were \u201cstashed on the grounds, under the steps, in the stairwells, in the cellar parts, the basement parts of the buildings,\u201d as well as in tenants\u2019 mailboxes.... Sgt. Martini concluded, \u201cDue to the sheer volume of people that were in that complex,\u201d the volume of crime was \u201cworse in the complex\u201d than it was in the Reservoir Hill neighborhood generally....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">The extensive evidence of criminal activity at the complex, including [Department] exhibits 1^49, which are a collection of police documents showing mostly drug-trafficking related incidents on the property, was separately corroborated by a key MPNA witness, Lt. [Kirk] Kluver, commander of [MPNA]\u2019s security forces____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The Commissioner found Lt. Kluver\u2019s testimony to be less credible than that of the BPD officers, and found that \u201cLt. Kluver suggested that crime had substantially dropped-off in the complex, but it was clear he was, at best, referring to the past month or two.\u201d Overall, the Commissioner \u201cfound the testimony of the witnesses from BPD to be credible because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>was candid, unrehearsed, and did not appear to be self-serving.\u201d In contrast, the Commissioner found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">that much of [Lt. Kluver\u2019s] testimony concerning the effectiveness of his own security efforts and what he called the diminishing amount of crime at the complex to be much less credible. It was contradicted by other substantial evidence of criminal activity.... I do not doubt Lt. Kluver\u2019s desire to see progress and improved security at the complex, but statements such as these [that no drug shops currently operate in MPNA], in light of the evidence, amount to an exaggeration of the success of the work of his security company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Regarding Madison Park\u2019s plans and efforts to prevent crime, the Commissioner found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">Ms. [Shelby] Kaplan [the general partner of Madison Park] received a letter from Commissioner Graziano, in October 2008 [after Madison Park no longer employed off-duty BPD officers as security personnel]. Subsequent to receiving the letter, Ms. Kaplan, together with other managers of the complex, Ms. Lumley and Ms. Sherwell, met with City and BPD representatives to explain MPNA\u2019s efforts to reduce crime at the complex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">MPNA developed a \u201cstrategic plan\u201d in response to the Commissioner\u2019s letter of October 2008 and a subsequent meeting with the City and police. That plan, submitted to the City by letter dated March 16, 2009, outlined a variety of steps MPNA claimed it had taken or would take in recognition of \u201cthe seriousness of drugs in our community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">The March 2009 strategic plan was an updated version of the earlier plan prepared by Ms. Kaplan years before, in 2004 or 2005, addressing similar issues at the behest of City officials concerned about crime.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>MPNA\u2019s most recent strategic plan, from March 2009, references Central Maryland Security Services, hired by Ms. Kaplan after Martini\u2019s off-duty security services ended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">Lt. Kluver is a Special Police Officer, granted all of the powers of a BPD officer by the BPD itself, but he may only operate within the complex itself and the streets surrounding the complex. He began working for MPNA at the complex two years ago. The commander of Central Maryland Security Services team at the complex, Lt. Kluver recalled working two-man shifts of 16 hours when he first began, running from 8:00 in the morning until 12:00 midnight. However, the March 2009 strategic plan\u2014which was drafted at or near the time Lt. Kluver began working for MPNA\u2014says Central Maryland Security Services was hired to provide security at the complex for \u201c8 hours per day, 7 days per week.\u201d While MPNA introduced some 2010 invoices from the security firm, no invoices or contracts were introduced into evidence to establish the amount of security coverage any time prior to July 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">The increase in security coverage to which some MPNA witnesses testified corresponds, at least temporally, to the Commissioner\u2019s Notice letter of August 15, 2010. An August 24, 2010 letter written by MPNA\u2019s attorney in response to that Notice acknowledged that \u201cAdmittedly ... a substantial amount of criminal activity remains.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">Notwithstanding this recent increase in security staffing at the complex, I find that the complex is being used for the purpose of drug trafficking. I also find that MPNA\u2019s response to the drug trafficking has been uncoordinated and inadequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">Under \u201cConclusions of Law,\u201d the Commissioner stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">I find, under Baltimore City Code, Art. 13, \u00a7 5\u201415(2)(ii) that [the Department] has established by a preponderance of the evidence that Madison Park North Apartments, Ltd. knew or should have known that the premises are being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>used for the purpose of drug trafficking, and failed to prevent them from being so used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">Given the number of search and seizure warrants executed on the premises, the number of arrests involving narcotics trafficking activities on the premises, and the number of violent crimes that have occurred on the property, many of which are described in [Department] exhibits 1^19, it would be impossible for a reasonable landowner not to know that The premises were being used for the purposes of drug trafficking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">I needn\u2019t dwell, however, on what a reasonable landowner would know, because MPNA and its agents were directly told of police efforts to interdict that activity, and took steps to inform themselves of the state of the complex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">[MPNA] attempts to disclaim knowledge of crime at the complex on the grounds that BPD failed to provide management with copies of police reports. But the fact that drug trafficking and violent crime are regularly occurring on the premises are notice in their own right of the fact that such activity exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The Commissioner cited testimony from Veronica Coward, MPNA\u2019s on-site property manager, who acknowledged that police reports are necessary to effectuate evictions, but only made \u201cfour or five\u201d telephone calls since 2008 before abandoning attempts to obtain reports. The Commissioner noted that \u201cMPNA could have made requests in writing, which Ms. Coward testified she never did\u201d and that Madison Park\u2019s counsel \u201ccould have obtained police documents through official channels that MPNA\u2019s on-site staff could not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Addressing Madison Park\u2019s argument that \u201cit is impossible to stop drug trafficking,\u201d the Commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">MPNA misapprehends the issue. The purpose of this proceeding is not to determine whether or how the narcotics trade, crimes of violence, or other crimes that constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>nuisance can be stopped altogether, or what constitutes the ideal amount of security at the complex or apartments like it. I find that MPNA failed to prevent the complex from being used for drug trafficking because the evidence demonstrates that M[PNA] failed to develop and implement a coherent security strategy to deter crime and prevent the nuisance within the two, fenced-in city blocks comprising the complex, blocks under MPNA\u2019s exclusive control. In other words, while reasonable people may disagree about the best security strategy for the complex, Respondent has demonstrated it really had no cogent strategy at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The Commissioner exhaustively explained the items left \u201cincomplete or abandoned\u201d from Madison Park\u2019s strategic plans and noted that \u201cothers appear unrelated to the objective of preventing the premises being used for drug trafficking.\u201d The Commissioner also noted that, regarding the fence around MPNA, Madison Park \u201cpursued the exact opposite of the strategy recommended by its own security staff as well as each BPD officer who testified [and] put forth no coherent reasons for its approach.\u201d The Commissioner found that \u201c[a]fter receiving two days of testimony and documentary evidence regarding the present state of the complex, I find ... that MPNA is slow to appreciate the urgency of the situation. The evidence shows the complex is being used for the purpose of drug trafficking, and MPNA\u2019s response has been confused and inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">On October 28,2010, Madison Park filed the Petition. After multiple postponements, a hearing on the Petition was held on February 6, 2012. On February 21, 2012, the circuit court denied the Petition, and its opinion and order were entered on March 5, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In its decision, the circuit court noted that although the Petition \u201cstates that it is both an administrative mandamus action and a request for judicial review, it has been brought pursuant to Rule 7-^01 <footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> et seq. and not Rule 7-201<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> et <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>seq.\u201d The circuit court stated that it was limited to reviewing the record to \u201cdetermine whether the [Commissioner\u2019s] decision is supported by competent, material and substantial evidence\u201d and to \u201censure that the agency\u2019s decision is constitutional and not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\u201d The circuit court reviewed BCC Art. 13, \u00a7 5-15 of the Baltimore City Code, and determined that it was not void for vagueness and that the Commissioner\u2019s decision finding that Madison Park had violated that section was supported by substantial evidence. The circuit court also found that Madison Park was not denied due process by the statements in the August 16, 2010 letter, because the letter was \u201cclearly a charging document\u201d that was distinct from the final decision of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">On March 22, 2012, Madison Park noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Additional facts will be included in the relevant sections below.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">I. Right to Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Madison Park argues that the Department \u201cdeclined to include a statutory mechanism for judicial review but it did not dispute [Madison Park\u2019s] right to seek review through an administrative mandamus action as provided in Maryland Rule 7-401 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>The Commissioner conceded that Madison Park can pursue judicial review through a writ of mandamus, because the BCC contains no provision for judicial review of a decision of the Commissioner by the circuit court or any other court. We agree that Maryland law provides for divergent paths of review\u2014statutory judicial review and review based on the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>A. Statutory Judicial Review</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">\u201cIt is an often stated principle of Maryland law that appellate jurisdiction, except as constitutionally authorized, is determined entirely by statute, and that, therefore, a right of appeal must be legislatively granted.\u201d <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Bd. of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 485, 693 A.2d 757 (1997). \u201c[I]t should not be thought that the Maryland Rules regulating appeals from administrative agencies ... can grant a right of appeal.\u201d <em>Urbana Civic Ass\u2019n v. Urbana Mobile Village, Inc., </em>260 Md. 458, 462, 272 A.2d 628 (1971); <em>see also Oltman v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>182 Md.App. 65, 73, 957 A.2d 611 (2008) (\u201cMd. Rule 7-202 does not authorize judicial review of administrative decisions\u201d). Therefore, under the statutory avenue of review, resolution of the jurisdictional issue requires an examination of relevant provisions of the Maryland Code and Baltimore City\u2019s legislative enactments. <em>See Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 485, 693 A.2d 757. Upon a finding that this Court does not have jurisdiction, we must dismiss the case <em>sua sponte. Miller &amp; Smith v. Casey PMN, </em>412 Md. 230, 240, 987 A.2d 1 (2010); <em>see Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>358 Md. 166, 174, 747 A.2d 647 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">Except as provided in \u00a7 12-302 of this subtitle, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">CJP \u00a7 12-302(a) provides: \u201cUnless a right to appeal is expressly granted by law, \u00a7 12-301 of this subtitle does not permit an appeal from a final judgment of a court entered or made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of the District Court, an administrative agency, or a local legislative body.\u201d <em>See Rogers v. Eastport Yachting Ctr., LLC, </em>408 Md. 722, 732, 971 A.2d 322 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>This Court has no jurisdiction under CJP \u00a7 12-301 \u201cwhen a circuit court proceeding in substance constitutes ordinary judicial review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency or local legislative body, pursuant to a statute, ordinance, or charter provision, and the circuit court renders a final judgment within its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 971 A.2d 322 (quoting <em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 496, 693 A.2d 757 (citation omitted)). Put another way, if the circuit court reviews an administrative agency decision based on a statutory right to judicial review, \u00a7 12-302(a) applies. The Court of Appeals has held that because CJP</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_q\">\u00a7 12-301 does not authorize an appeal from a circuit court judgment in a statutory action for judicial review of an adjudicatory administrative decision, any right of appeal in such a case must be found in some other statute. Where no other statute authorizes an appeal in the type of case covered by \u00a7 12-302(a), the Court of Special Appeals is not authorized to entertain the appeal and must dismiss it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agj\"><em>Murrell v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>376 Md. 170, 185, 829 A.2d 548 (2003) (citation omitted). Therefore, if the BCC provides for an appeal of the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the circuit court, this Court is without jurisdiction to entertain further review, unless authorization is found elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The Maryland Code also authorizes appeals under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl. Vol,), State Government Article \u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>Regarding the appeals provisions, the <em>Rogers </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">Section 10-222 of the State Government Article provides for judicial review of the final decision in a contested case decided by an administrative agency. A \u201ccontested case\u201d is one in which, inter alia, the proceeding is before an \u201cagency.\u201d State Government Article \u00a7 10-202(d). An \u201cagency\u201d is defined as: (1) an officer or unit of the State government authorized by law to adjudicate contested cases; or cases.

The pension board denied her petition, and she sought relief in the circuit court by asking the court to issue a writ of mandamus directing the board to grant her petition. Exercising its review power, the <em>Heaps </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">Administrative boards in general may be said to act in a quasi judicial capacity insofar as they have the duty to hear and determine facts and, based on them, to make decisions. Moreover, such decisions carry with them the presumption of validity and, where the statute or ordinance provides for an appeal to the courts, will not be disturbed on review if the record shows substantial evidence to sustain the findings. The boards, however, are not clothed with judicial authority, which the legislature has no power to confer upon them, Article 4, Md. Constitution; <em>Dal Maso v. Board, etc., </em>182 Md. 200, 34 A.2d 464 [ (1943) ], and their decisions, when they impair personal or property rights, are not irreviewable. The legislature is without authority to divest the judicial branch of the government of its inherent power to review actions of administrative boards shown to be arbitrary, illegal or capricious, and to impair personal or property rights; but the courts are likewise without authority to interfere with any exercise of the legislative prerogative within constitutional limits, or with the lawful exercise of administrative authority or discretion____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">The appellant Board is one of those tribunals created by an ordinance which does not expressly provide for an appeal from its decisions, and, largely because of that omission, the appellant is claiming for its decision in the instant case a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>finality which would place it beyond the reach of the Court in a mandamus suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\">Where the statute or ordinance makes no provision for judicial review, an implied limitation upon an administrative board\u2019s authority is that its decisions be supported by facts and that they be not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1O\"><em>Heaps, </em>185 Md. at 378-80, 45 A.2d 73 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The parties are correct that, as discussed, when a statute provides for judicial review of an administrative decision by the circuit court, pursuant to CJP \u00a7 12-301, then that is where the review ends. However, in cases like <em>Heeht, Heaps, </em>and the one <em>sub judice, </em>where the code is silent on judicial review, this Court, in a mandamus action, has the authority to review the administrative body\u2019s decision to determine if the decision was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious. <em>Murrell, supra, </em>376 Md. at 194, 829 A.2d <em>548; see Beretta U.S.A.

On the other hand, if at that time none of the essential facts was in dispute, but all of them combined to support the claim for pension as prescribed by the ordinance, then there was no basis for the exercise of judgment or discretion, and any action by the Board contrary to those established facts would have to be classified as \u201carbitrary,\u201d and subject to correction through the writ of mandamus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><em>Heaips, </em>185 Md. at 386, 45 A.2d 73. <em>See also Hayward, </em>426 Md. at 649 n. 6, 45 A.3d 224; <em>Philip Morris, supra, </em>358 Md. at 708, 752 A.2d 200 (describing the common law writ of mandamus as a \u201cprerogative writ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Applying this test, we first determine that no other method of review is available to Madison Park. As discussed, the BCC and the APA contain no statutory provisions for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision revoking Madison Park\u2019s license. Next, we must determine whether the Commissioner, as alleged by Madison Park, acted arbitrarily and capriciously or if the decision was supported by substantial evidence. See Part IV, injto.

Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>100 Md.App. 190, 220, 640 A.2d 259 (1994), that \u201cregulations concerning commercial activities, compared to criminal statutes, require less specificity\u201d and notes that BCC Art. 13, \u00a7 5-15 \u201chas already survived one attack for alleged vagueness.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commissioner avers that the regulation is not vague simply because it allows the Commissioner to exercise some discretion. The Commissioner asserts that the regulation allowed Madison Park to \u201cpursue any lawful avenue\u201d to prevent crime on its property, but that the facts show Madison Park failed to pursue any avenue \u201cat all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>In rebuttal, Madison Park concedes that the regulation is not required to \u201cenumerate <em>every </em>conceivable prohibited activity\u201d but argues that BCC Art. 13, \u00a7 5-15 fails to \u201cenumerate <em>any </em>prohibited activity.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Madison Park reiterates that, because compliance with the mandate to prevent all crime is impossible, the regulation cannot be enforced in any manner that is not arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine applies to laws with both criminal and civil penalties. \u201cHowever, where a statute imposes criminal penalties, the standard is certainly higher than the standard applicable to statutes imposing only civil penalties.\u201d <em>Neutron Prods., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t, </em>166 Md.App. 549, 609, 890 A.2d 858 (2006) (citations omitted). In <em>McFarlin v. State, </em>409 Md. 391, 410, 975 A.2d 862 (2009), the Court of Appeals, quoting <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 781 A.2d 851 (2001), explained that \u201ca statute must be \u2018sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties,\u2019 otherwise, the enactment is void-for-vagueness.\u201d <em>See also Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 120, 389 A.2d 341 (1978). The <em>McFarlin </em>Court then summarized the void-for-vagueness analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">A well grounded principle in federal constitutional law is that, when considering the void-for-vagueness doctrine, courts consistently consider two criteria or rationales. The first rationale is the fair notice principle that persons of ordinary intelligence and experience be afforded a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that they may govern their behavior accordingly. The standard for determining whether a statute provides fair notice is whether persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at the statute\u2019s meaning. A statute is not vague under the fair notice principle if the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves if they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The second criterion of the vagueness doctrine regards enforcement of the statute. This rationale exists to ensure that criminal statutes provide legally fixed standards and adequate guidelines for police, judicial officers, triers of fact and others whose obligation it is to enforce, apply and administer the penal laws. To survive analysis, a statute must eschew arbitrary enforcement in addition to being intelligible to the reasonable person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><em>McFarlin, </em>409 Md. at 410-11, 975 A.2d 862 (citation omitted); <em>see also Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 90, 660 A.2d 447 (1995) (citing <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 125, 389 A.2d 341).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We disagree with Madison Park that BCC Art. 13, \u00a7 5-15 contains language that is unclear. The regulation permits revocation of a license upon a finding that the owner has either \u201callowed\u201d the property to be used for \u201cprostitution, drug trafficking, or other criminal activity that creates or constitutes a nuisance\u201d or \u201cknew or should have known that the premises were being used for one of these purposes and failed to prevent them from being so used.\u201d The types of activities prohibited are clearly enumerated. The regulation then creates two avenues that permit revocation\u2014if the owner allows the prohibited activities, which requires affirmative action by the owner, or if the owner fails to act to prevent such use of which it has actual or constructive knowledge. \u201cPrevent\u201d has a legal meaning: \u201cto hinder or impede,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1226 (8th ed.2004), which is in accord with its common usage. Accordingly, we find that a reasonable person of average intelligence would understand what the regulation required.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Regarding Madison Park\u2019s argument that the Commissioner\u2019s use of discretion renders the regulation unconstitutional, we note that the Court of Appeals has consistently held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">[A] statute is not unconstitutionally vague merely because it allows for the exercise of some discretion on the part of law enforcement and judicial officials. It is only where a statute is so broad as to be susceptible to irrational and selective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>patterns of enforcement that it will be held unconstitutional under [the] second arm of the vagueness principle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 616, 781 A.2d 851; (citing <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d 341). Moreover, the general rule in Maryland is that unless the challenged statute \u201cencroaches upon fundamental constitutional rights\u201d such as free speech and assembly, then the \u201capplication of the void-for-vagueness doctrine is based on the application of the statute to the \u2018facts at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d 341). It is \u201cimmaterial that the statute is of questionable applicability in foreseeable marginal situations, if a contested provision clearly applies to the conduct of the defendant in a specific case.\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d 341 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">As discussed in section IV, <em>infra, </em>the Commissioner examined the \u201cfacts at hand\u201d and found that Madison Park failed to act to \u201cprevent\u201d drug trafficking and other crimes from occurring on its property. The regulation requires notice and an opportunity to be heard as to the facts in each case; which weighs against arbitrary enforcement. Therefore, we hold that BCC Art. 13, \u00a7 5-15 is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">III. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Madison Park argues that the Commissioner \u201cprejudged the outcome of the hearing,\u201d as evidenced by the statements in the Notice of Hearing, that \u201csufficient evidence\u201d existed to revoke the License. Madison Park contends that such pre-judgment, along with the hearing being \u201cconducted by an employee of the Department who answers to the Commissioner,\u201d subjected it to bias and denied it due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The Commissioner responds that it is typical for administrative agencies to investigate and adjudicate their own regulatory enforcement actions. Regarding the Notice of Hearing, the Commissioner asserts that its purpose was to describe the basis for and set the hearing, with the hearing held to allow the Commissioner to \u201cattempt to establish [the] evidence.\u201d In rebuttal, Madison Park maintains that the language in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Notice of Hearing was tantamount to impermissible prejudgment of the case. We agree with the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">In <em>Mont. Cnty. v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. 471, 485, 654 A.2d 877 (1995), the Court of Appeals stated that it is \u201cvery typical for the members of administrative agencies to receive the results of investigations, to approve the filing of charges or formal complaints instituting enforcement proceedings, and then to participate in the ensuing hearings\u201d with no violation of due process resulting. We, likewise, find no violation of due process by the Commissioner simply because an employee of the Department was designated in his place to conduct the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Regarding prejudgment, the Commissioner cites <em>Am. Recovery Co., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>306 Md. 12, 506 A.2d 1171 (1986). We agree that <em>Am. Recovery </em>is on point. In <em>Am. Recovery, </em>the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d) issued civil penalty assessments against American Recovery Company, Inc. (\u201cARC\u201d), a company it licensed for the storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. After a hearing in which the proposed penalties were imposed, and in two instances, increased, ARC petitioned for judicial review in the circuit court. The circuit court affirmed but reduced the assessed penalties. On appeal, ARC argued that its guilt was prejudged prior to the hearing. The language in the original notification from DHMH stated that inspections had found \u201cconditions constituting violations of [the applicable regulations].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20, 506 A.2d 1171. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">This type of factual recitation did not diminish the obligation of DHMH to prove the existence of these facts at the administrative hearing. Indeed, the parties generated over 700 pages of transcript at the hearing in disputing the alleged violations. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that these documents basically constituted \u201ccharging document[s].\u201d[ ] The language contained therein, although factual in tone, did not serve to adjudicate the subject matter of the documents. The mere fact that the charging document, entitled \u201cCivil Penalty Assessment,\u201d may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>artfully captioned, as the trial court pointed out, is not enough to sustain ARC\u2019s contention that the agency prejudged the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 20, 506 A.2d 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We disagree with Madison Park that the Notice of Hearing, by stating: \u201cThere is sufficient evidence to establish ...\u201d renders the case <em>sub judice </em>inapposite to <em>Am. Recovery. </em>Such a statement is not indicative of prejudgment particularly when a full hearing on the merits, where Madison Park had notice and the opportunity to both present evidence and rebut the Department\u2019s evidence, took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">IY. Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\u201cThe proper approach for determining whether there is substantial evidence is if a reasoning mind could reasonably have come to the factual conclusion that the agency reached.\u201d <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t v. Ives, </em>136 Md.App. 581, 585, 766 A.2d 657 (2001). The Court of Appeals recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">The reviewing court defers to the agency\u2019s factual findings, if supported by the record. The reviewing court, moreover, \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is <em>prima facie </em>correct and presumed valid ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-9\"><em>Emps.\u2019 Ret.

The Commissioner stresses that Madison Park\u2019s arguments regarding the rest of the neighborhood are without merit because its license, and the revocation thereof, does not relate to the surrounding neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Madison Park argues in rebuttal that the Department \u201cdid not present credible evidence demonstrating that the security measures taken by [Madison Park] were inadequate or unreasonable.\u201d Madison Park redirects our attention to several shooting instances that occurred outside the property in support of its contention that violent crime was not occurring within the property. Madison Park points to the Department\u2019s inclusion of the shootings as proof that substantial evidence was lacking and that the license revocation was arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">We disagree with Madison Park, and our review of the record reveals that there was substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Kaplan testified that the Strategic Plan Eradicating Drug Activity Madison Park North Apartments/Reservoir Hills (\u201cStrategic Plan\u201d) was prepared in either 2004 or 2005 in response to the City\u2019s concerns about the rampant crime in MPNA. The only items in the plan that were completed were the removal of some shrubbery used to hide drug stashes and the installation of some lighting on the property. However, the record demonstrates that these efforts failed to control narcotics trafficking in MPNA, because individuals (including residents and guests) also used basements and mailboxes to stash drugs and continued to sell drugs through the fence, out of windows, and in front of buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Kaplan testified that she received a letter in October 2008 from the Commissioner that put them \u201con notice to\u2014we were not performing well, and he was upset.\u201d Kaplan testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>after receiving the letter, the management company met with the Department and gave an updated plan. Kaplan testified that on March 16, 2009, her assistant submitted a \u201cstatus report\u201d letter to the Department. As to the items listed in the plan, Kaplan testified that security cameras had not been installed, gates and guard-controlled access to the property were not implemented, photo identification cards of all the residents was not completed, and that many capital improvements had been stopped because of efforts to sell the property-</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The record reflects that Madison Park management and security personnel made minimal efforts to obtain police reports or contact police regarding crime at MPNA in 2008 and none after April of 2009. The record demonstrates that Madison Park disagreed with police recommendations regarding the fence surrounding the property, but did nothing to implement the measures they had proposed, including enclosing the fence with electronically-controlled gates. The record supports the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that any efforts made by Madison Park occurred after the Notice of Hearing was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Police reports in evidence also demonstrate that the Madison Park parking lots were used for drug trafficking. Police reports reveal that in 2010, despite the testimony of Lt. Kluver that drug trafficking had been eradicated from Madison Park, drugs were still being sold on the premises, both in open areas and out of residences. Police reports in December of 2009 continued to report that Madison Park was an \u201copen air drug market where narcotics are readily bought, sold, and used.\u201d The record demonstrates that such activity was occurring as late as July 2010. As noted by the Commissioner, the Department\u2019s exhibits reflected \u201c37 separate incidents spanning 20 months involving the manufacture, packaging, sale or storage of marijuana, cocaine and/or heroin on the property of Madison Park North Apartments. There were also 10 incidents involving violence, murder and/or dangerous weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>While Madison Park attempted to downplay the evidence, including stating that one police report did not reflect criminal activity on the premises because it was a \u201cdead on arrival\u201d where the individual died in their bed, a review of the record reveals that the same residence was involved in a narcotics arrest prior to the death, that the deceased individual was a known drug and alcohol abuser, and drugs were found in the apartment when the police responded to the call. The same apartment was searched in January 2010 after officers smelled burning marijuana coming from the door; four individuals were arrested and the seized evidence included narcotics, paraphernalia, and ammunition. The apartment was searched again in February 2010, when an observed drug dealer informed police that he sometimes lived there with a relative. A second report for \u201cdead on arrival\u201d involved another individual known to use illegal narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The record also demonstrates that residents were not only using illegal substances but were in possession of illegal firearms and engaged in other illegal activities, such as street gambling, and that security was aware of such activity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lt. Kluver testified that he was aware of raids and warrants executed on units in MPNA, and that he notified management. Many of the search and seizure warrants were executed using a key provided by management, and the record reflects that MPNA maintenance were aware of apartment raids that resulted in damage to doors and locks. Therefore, there was ample evidence, despite the lack of police reports provided to management directly, that Madison Park was aware its premises were being used for illegal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Madison Park further admitted that it did not utilize any methods to conduct criminal background checks other than when residents first applied for tenancy, nor did it make any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>efforts to engage police. The record demonstrates that even if residents were evicted from a residence, they could, and did, continue to reside on the premises with relatives or other tenants. The record also demonstrates that numerous registered gun offenders, also known members of the \u201cBlack Guerrilla Family\u201d and other Crips-associated gangs, resided at MPNA, contradicting the testimony of Lt. Kluver that gangs had been eradicated from MPNA in 2009. Madison Park offered no evidence to show it was even attempting to investigate who was living in MPNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Three residents of MPNA testified: Lenore Gary, Danyelle Jones, and Rosalyn Gilliam. Gary testified that drugs are both inside and outside of MPNA. Gilliam testified that \u201cthere is criminal activity everywhere,\u201d that \u201cthe police come and arrest people for nothing like they did my cousin,\u201d and that \u201cthe police is really the problem\u201d because they \u201charass\u201d members of her family. Jones testified that she had worked for Tricap Management, the company responsible for managing MPNA. Gilliam and Jones clearly were not objective witnesses, and we cannot say that the Commissioner erred in finding them to be less credible than the police experts. The testimony of Gilliam supports the reasonable inference that the presence of the police was unwelcome by many residents. It also suggests, along with police documents detailing how relatives were harboring criminals in their units, that some residents were not willing to work with Madison Park to eradicate crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Madison Park\u2019s argument that crime within MPNA was no worse than crime in the surrounding neighborhood is without merit. Madison Park had the responsibility to prevent crime within MPNA, not the surrounding neighborhood. The police testimony and documentary evidence support the finding that drug trafficking, one of the activities forming a basis for revocation, was occurring in MPNA. Any testimony regarding other places in Baltimore City where drug trafficking was also occurring is irrelevant. The documentary evidence negates the testimony of Madison Park\u2019s experts and supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Commissioner\u2019s finding that the testimony of Madison Park\u2019s witnesses was self-serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Madison Park argues that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to stop crime. However, as discussed, \u201cprevent\u201d has a broader meaning. It means to \u201chinder or impede,\u201d and the evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Madison Park did not act to a significant degree to impede crime on its property, despite repeated assurances to the Department that it would implement measures proposed in its Strategic Plan and updates to that plan. While Madison Park prepared plans, it admitted failing to implement those plans, and now attempts to place the blame on the Department. The statute does not require the Department or the police to approve a plan just because it was presented by Madison Park or to otherwise direct Madison Park in its crime prevention efforts. The burden is on the property owner to satisfy the statute, and the evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Madison Park did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision denying the petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
