See recent case of Lamkin v. State, 136 S. W. (2d) 225, and authorities there cited. However in 1941 the 47th Legislature amended Art. 779, C. C. P. and obliterated the right of appeal from a suspended sentence at any time, which act was within the power of the Legislature to so provide. See Millican v. State, 167 S. W. (2d) 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-19\">This appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
