Acts of 1897, Chapter 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">By Chapter 21, Acts. of the Regular Session of the Forty-sixth Legislature in 1939, the Legislature restored criminal jurisdiction to the county court of said county \u201conly to those cases in which pleas of guilty are entered by the defendant in any cases of misdemeanor filed in said Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">This is an appeal from a conviction upon plea of guilty before the County Judge of Marion County for a violation of the liquor law, a misdemeanor, with punishment assessed at a fine of $100.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The appeal is predicated upon the proposition that the judgment is void because the plea was made and the judgment was entered during and while the court was in vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The record affirmatively reflects that the Commissioners\u2019 Court of Marion County has not, since the passage of the Act of 1939, provided for or fixed a time for the holding terms of the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">With reference to the terms of court, the Constitution (Art. 5, sec. 29) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">\u201cThe County Court shall hold at least four terms for both civil and criminal business annually, as may be provided by the Legislature, or by the Commissioners\u2019 Court of 'the county under authority of law, and such other terms each year as m^y be. fixed by the Commissioners\u2019 Court; provided, the Commissioners\u2019 Court ofi any county having fixed the times and number of terms of the County Court, shall not change the same again until the expiration of one year.

S., as amended in 1929 by Chapter 48, Acts of First Called Session of the Forty-first Legislature, prescribed the time for the holding of terms of court the same as that fixed in the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The record affirmatively reflects that the plea of guilty was made and judgment entered on June 24, 1944, which was not during a term of the court as fixfed by the Constitution and the Legislature.
