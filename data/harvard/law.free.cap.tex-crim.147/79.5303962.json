Reliance is had solely upon possession of the property and this possession was first proven to be fifteen months after the property had been stolen. In explanation he claims to have purchased the radio from a \u201ctree army man.\u201d There is no evidence in the case to support the circumstance of possession. From Branch\u2019s Ann; P. C., Section 2463 we quote with approval the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">\u201cTo raise a presumption of guilt from the circumstances alone of possession of property recently stolen, defendant must be shown to have been in possession thereof recently after the theft.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">Fifteen months is not \u201crecently.\u201d See Yates v. State, 37 Texas, 202 (Bed-clothing-five months) ; Bragg v. State, 17 T. C. A., 221 (Horse-five and one-half months) ; Bean v. State, 5 S. W. 525 (Mare-eleven months) ; Tolliver v. State, 8 S. W. 806 (Coat-one year) ; Flores v. State, 9 S. W. 772 (Mule-eleven months) ; Menchaca v. State, 125 S. W. 20 (Jewelry-three and one-half months).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">It will not be necessary to discuss other questions raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is. remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
