Local option did not become effective until such publication was made. The reasons for such holding are apparent from the cases of Chenowith v. State, 96 S. W. 19; Watson v. State, 135 Tex. Cr. R. 632, 122 S. W. (2d) 311; Brooks v. State, 138 Tex. Cr. R. 526, 137 S. W. (2d) 768. It is not necessary to elaborate on the question again. See Sweeten v. State, 135 Tex. Cr. R. 445, 120 S. W. (2d) 1074 and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
