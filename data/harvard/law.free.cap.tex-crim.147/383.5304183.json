The appellant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Our State\u2019s Attorney confesses error on the complaint that the jury discussed and considered the failure of appellant to testify. We agree with him in his conclusion. See Art. 710 C. C. P.; Harrell v. State, 118 Tex. Cr. R. 279, 42 S. W. (2d) 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">We are also of opinion that bill of exception number four presents reversible error. Two State\u2019s' witnesses \"testified to the sale by appellant of the whisky. No other parties were present. The County Attorney in his argument said there was no \u201cword of testimony to deny that this sale was made\u201d just as State witnesses had testified. No one could have denied it save appellant. This was an indirect reference to the failure of appellant to testify. Scarbrough v. State, 98 Tex. Cr. R. 54, 263 S. W. 917; Wood v. State, 116 Tex. Cr. R. 336, 28 S. W. (2d) 130. We quote from Gothard v. State, 99 Tex. Cr. R. 452, 270 S. W. 177:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">\u201c * * * where a'defendant has npt testified himself ner offered any defensive testimony whatever it would be well for counsel representing the state to confine himself to a discussion of the evidence introduced by-the state, and not allude to defendant\u2019s failure to produce evidence, unless it is apparent from the record fhat evidence other than his own was available which he neglected to bring before the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
