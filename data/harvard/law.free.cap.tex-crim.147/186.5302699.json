Some are incomplete, and none of them seems to present a serious question.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">Apparently appellant and his wife had separated and she was living with her two small children in a house which she had rented. The killing occurred just in front of this hpuse. Neighbors heard appellant curse his father and tell him to get up and put his clothes*on which deceased did, and stepped out of the house and told some of the neighbors to call the officers, that something had to be done with appellant. In a few minutes a shot was fired and deceased was killed. Appellant claimed that he killed his father because he caught deceased and appellant\u2019s wife in a compromising position which led him to believe that they had already engaged in an act of intercourse, or were about to do so. It would accomplish no good purpose to detail the evidence at length. Appellant\u2019s evidence brought the case under Art. 1220 P. C. which justifies a killing \u201cwhen committed by the husband upon one taken in the act of adultery with the wife, provided the killing t\u00e1ke place before the parties to the act hav\u00e9 separated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">The trial court gave a liberal and comprehensive charge upon the defensive issue. Evidently the jury discredited appellant\u2019s story.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b212-3\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"A7A\">KRUEGER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Appellant has filed a motion for a rehearing but he fails to point out any error or oversight committed by this court in the original opinion, nor does he present any matter not heretofore discussed by us.
