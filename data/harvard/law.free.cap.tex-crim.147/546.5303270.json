D. Jones.\u201d Nowhere therein is it set forth in such affidavit and warrant that appellant occupied, possessed, was in control of or had charge pf such premises. We said in Miller v. State, 114 S. W. (2d) 244, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">\u201cMany people own \u2018premises\u2019 \u25a0 on which there may be situated many residences, all of which may be occupied by people other than the owner, when he in fact lives \u2014 has his residence \u2014 at an entirely different place. It is true the officers testified that they knew the house searched was appellant\u2019s residence, but such testimony would not supply the omission of such averment in the description of the property in the affidavit and warrant.\u201d Also see 38 Tex. Jur., 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">Again it was said in the case of Brown v. State, 124 S. W. (2d) 124:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201cAlso we find in the affidavit and warrant no recital that appellant either occupied, possessed, or had charge of the premises to be searched. One of such recitals was essential to the validity of the affidavit and warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">The affidavit and warrant issued thereunder being thus defective, the search of the house was illegal. Any testimony based upon such illegal search was inadmissible herein, and its admission requires a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">The State\u2019s Attorney also confesses error in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
