I was scared of him. I didn\u2019t know at that time where my husband was, and I didn\u2019t know where he was until he later hollered at me. * * * I got around somewhere between the car shed and the porch when my husband hollered at me and asked me where I was going; and I told him I was going to my daddy\u2019s, and he told me if I left there he would take a piece of iron and beat my brains out, so I just whirled and shot him and ran. * * * When he hollered at me and wanted to know where I was going, I told him that I was going to my daddy\u2019s, and he said: \u2018If you leave here, God damn you, I will take a piece of iron and beat your brains out,\u2019 and then I whirled and shot and ran.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>We think the remark of the District Attorney in his argument to the jury was substantially in accord with the appellant\u2019s testimony and was a reasonable deduction therefrom. We see no . harm that could have resulted to her from the remarks complained of. We therefore overrule Bill of Exception No. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"AYb\">\u25a0 By Bill of Exception No. 2 she complains of other argument of District Attorney. The bill is qualified by the trial court, who states in his qualification that there was no objection to said argument. The bill, as thus qualified, was accepted by the appellant and she is bound thereby. The bill, as qualified, fails to reflect any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">.This court has consistently held that unless the argument is objected to at the time it is made, it will not be any ground for a reversal of the judgment. See Reeves v. State, 167 S. W. (2d) 176; O\u2019Brien v. State, 145 S. W. (2d) 881, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Bill of Exception No. .3 is similar to Bill No. 1, and what we have said in disposing of that bill also applies with equal force to bill No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"ATp\">The court, in his charge to the jury, instructed them as to the law on every issue that was raised by the evidence, although the evidence on some of the issues was very meagre. Furthermore, appellant urged no objections to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">All other matters complained of have been carefully examined by us and found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">It is therefore ordered that the judgment of the trial court be, and the same is, in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission, of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
