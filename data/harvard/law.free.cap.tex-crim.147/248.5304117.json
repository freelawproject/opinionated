Goens, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, of Austin, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b273-6\">KRUEGER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The conviction is for the offense of an assault with intent to commit rape. The punishment assessed is confinement in the penitentiary for a term of fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Appellant\u2019s main contention is that the evidence is insufficient to justify and sustain his conviction. We have carefully read the statement of facts and reached the conclusion that the Stat\u00e9\u2019s evidence makes a complete case against him. It is true that there are some discrepancies in the little girl\u2019s testimony but that of Mrs. Pitman, if believed by the jury, was sufficient upon which they could base their conclusion of his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Appellant insists that Mrs. Pitman was uncertain as to some acts and transactions which occurred prior and subsequent to the alleged assault and therefore she was not a credible witness, and we should so hold as a matter of law. The record discloses that Mrs. Pitman*s testimony was direct and positive to the main fact in issue. The question of her credibility and the weight to be given to her testimony was within the exclusive province of the jury, and this court would not be justified in disturbing their finding on such fact. Therefore, his contention is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Appellant has brought forward three bills of exception complaining of the admission of certain evidence. These bills are wholly deficient to require consideration by this court, in this: that they fail to set out enough of the surrounding facts and circumstances to enable this court to determine the merits of the bills in disclosing the supposed error. It is now a fairly well established rule in this state that a bill of exception should be made so full and certain in its statement as that, in and of itself, it will disclose all that is necessary to manifest the supposed error. See Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., p. 131, sec. 207, and 4 Tex. Jur. p. 295, sec. 207, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b274-5\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b274-6\">GRAVES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Appellant in his motion takes exception' to the statement in our original opinion herein where we said that: \u201cThe question of her (Mrs. Pitman\u2019s) credibility and the weight to be given to her testimony was within the <em>exclusive </em>province of the jury, and this court wquld not be justified in disturbing their finding on such fact,\u201d his argument being based upon the fact that this court has reversed many cases upon the lack of, or insufficiency of, the evidence. Evidently the lack of testimony, or the insufficiency of testimony, to make out a case has been confused with the credibility of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">We think that the position in which Mrs. Pitman testified she saw appellant\u2019s body upon that of the little ten year old girl, the condition of appellant\u2019s body and his organ when he got up from over the child\u2019s body, the child\u2019s statement,\" contradictory as it may be in portions thereof, as well as the doctor\u2019s statement showing a bruised condition of the child\u2019s private parts, with mucus tinged with blood, \u2014 doubtless had weight with the jury in arriving at their conclusion of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">We think the facts are sufficient upon which to base the jury\u2019s verdict of an assault with intent to rape, and the motion is therefore overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
