A. Landrum with his malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-19\">The statement of facts herein, other than that which consists-of the indictment and answer of the sheriff, is wholly in a question and answer form and, as such, cannot be considered by us. See Hill v. State, 55 S. W. (2d) 835; Turman v. State, 60 S. W. (2d) 231; Henry v. State, 111 S. W. (2d) 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>In an absence of such statement of facts there is nothing presented to show the excessiveness of bail demanded herein by relator, nor any inability to give the amount of bail fixed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
