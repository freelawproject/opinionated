D. Jones v. State, our No. 22921, this day decided. (Page 546 of this volume), there being only the difference in the names of the accused and description of the property. In this case, as in the Jones case, both the affidavit and warrant fail to show that the place desired to be searched was possessed, occupied by, or in charge of, or in control of the appellant, but merely denominates the same as \u201cthe premises of W. G. Gleghorn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">This allegation in the affidavit, was insufficient upon which to base a seach warrant, and the testimony obtained by reason of such search should not have been-admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
