The State controverted appellant\u2019s motion. There appears in the record an. agreed stipulation between the State and appellant that after recognizing all legal excuses of those who did actually appear there y\u00e9t remained a sufficient number to constitute a jury panel of 32 jurors for each of the two criminal district courts with a surplusage of 16. Said stipulation further contains the statement that \u201cNo juror was excused by the court except for legal cause satisfactory to the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">We observe that the record wholly fails to show if any of the jurors who were present served on the jury that tried appellant.
