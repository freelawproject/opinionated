He now appeals, arguing that the court committed <em>Booker </em>error because it sentenced him in violation of the Sixth Amendment; that is, it sentenced him under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme on the basis of facts not found by the jury or admitted by him. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Because appellant did not present this argument to the district court, we review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005). To find plain error, we must conclude that (1) the district court committed error that (2) was plain or obvious, (3) affected the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d in that he suffered prejudice, and (4) \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). As in <em>Rodriguez, </em>we find that the court erred and that the error was plain or obvious. Appellant has not shown that his substantial rights were affected, though, because he has not established from the record before the district court that he would have received a lesser sentence had the court considered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory as opposed to mandatory. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301. Because appellant fails to satisfy plain error\u2019s third element, we need not consider the fourth element.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Appellant has failed to show plain error. His sentences are therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\">. Although appellant objected to the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the amount of drugs and obstruction of justice, he does not raise those issues on appeal. To the extent that he attempts to raise any sufficiency-of-the-evidence issues in his statement, \"[ajlternatively, the government did not meet its burden of proof,\u201d he has failed to offer any supporting arguments. As such, appellant has abandoned those issues. <em>See United States v. </em>Cunningham, 161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir. 1998) (stating that defendant abandoned a preserved issue by offering no arguments on the issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b379-16\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AnY\">concurring specially.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">As I explain in my dissent to the court\u2019s refusal to rehear <em>Rodriguez </em>en banc, the error in a case such as this \u2014 where the district court enhances the defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of facts not admitted by the defendant or found by a jury \u2014 is structural error, and the third prong of the plain-error test is, therefore, inapplicable. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>406 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). Accordingly, the court should consider whether the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The court declines to do that because, as I agree, it is <em>Rodriguez </em>bound.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
