Williams, Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b439-8\">Before TJOFLAT, BIRCH and BARKETT, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b439-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">On July 9, 2004, the district court accepted appellant\u2019s guilty plea to three offenses: a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 for conspiring to obstruct justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (Count 1); obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (Count 2); and making a false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (Count 4). Prior to sentencing, the court\u2019s probation office prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSI\u201d) which for Sentencing Guidelines purposes, grouped the offenses together, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.2, 301.3(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and gave the offenses a base offense level of 14. The PSI enhanced that level by 3 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2 (b)(2) because the \u00a7 1503 offense resulted in a substantial interference with the administration of justice, and reduced it by 2 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) for acceptance of responsibility. The resulting offense level of 15 coupled with a criminal history category of VI yielded a Guidelines imprisonment range of 41 to 51 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">After receiving the PSI, defense counsel objected to the \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(2) offense-level enhancement on the Sixth Amendment ground articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), that precludes a sentencing court from enhancing a defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of facts neither admitted by the 'defendant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He renewed the objection at appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing, and the court overruled it. Then, after hearing from the parties and affording appellant his right of allocution, the court sentenced appellant to prison for 48 months on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">Appellant now challenges his sentences, contending that the court\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>violation requires that we vacate his sentences and remand the case for resentencing. <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>rationale now applies to the federal guidelines sentencing system. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014 , 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court therefore erred in overruling appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment objection. Given this circumstance, the question becomes whether the Government, on the basis of the record of appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing, has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to appellant\u2019s sentences. Put another way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the Government must show that the court would not have imposed lesser sentences had it treated the Guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Our examination of the transcript of the sentencing hearing- \u2014 especially the colloquy between the court and defense counsel \u2014 convinces us that the court would have imposed the same 48 months\u2019 prison sentences, if not longer terms of imprisonment, had it treated the Guidelines as advisory. Given appellant\u2019s conduct in committing the instant offenses, his extensive criminal record and likelihood of recidivism, and the fact that he was awaiting the imposition of sentence in state court for probation violation, the Government urged the court to sentence appellant at the higher end of the Guidelines sentence range (of 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment). Defense counsel requested the court to run appellant\u2019s sentences concurrently with the sentence he would be receiving in state court for probation violation, and added his view of an appropriate disposition by saying, \u201cif the Court is so inclined, we would be willing to agree to a sentence within the higher end as the government suggests of the guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In sum, we conclude that the error in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant\u2019s sentences are, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-11\">. Under these Guidelines sections, the offense level applicable to the group is the offense level for the most serious offense of the group \u2014 here the \u00a7 1503 obstruction-of-justice offense which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(a), a base offense level of 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-16\">. Appellant denied that he had engaged in the conduct warranting the \u00a7 2j 1.2(b)(2) offense-level enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
