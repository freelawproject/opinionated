Davis argues that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs and provided inadequate medical care. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-18\">According to the complaint, Davis was examined for a foot condition by several doctors, who gave him different diagnoses \u25a0and prescribed various pain medications and antibiotics. Doctors also x-rayed his foot. Davis complains that he. was not permitted to see a foot specialist at a hospital outside the prison. We conclude that Davis\u2019s complaints about his medical care and the lack of further opinions from specialists do not rise to the level of deliberate indifference. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105-07, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985). At most, Davis\u2019s allegations amount to claims for medical malpractice, which is insufficient for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
