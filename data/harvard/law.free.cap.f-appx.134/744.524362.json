Cervantes argues that her procedural due process rights were violated when the BIA overruled the determination of the immigration judge (IJ) with respect to her applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-22\">Section 242 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2000), strips this court of jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of both Cervantes\u2019s applications for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) and waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), because these statutes implicate purely discretionary determination of the Attorney General. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004). Nevertheless, this court retains jurisdiction only to consider whether Cervantes has established a substantial constitutional due process violation. <em>See Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 277-78 &amp; 278 n. 11 (5th Cir.2001). To prevail upon a due process challenge in a petition for review, the alien must establish substantial prejudice. <em>DeZavala v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 879, 884 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-23\">Cervantes argues that she was denied the procedural due process guarantees in two ways. First, she argues that the BIA lacked the authority to issue an independent, adverse, and discretionary decision to that of the IJ\u2019s ruling. Cervantes\u2019s argument is meritless because the BIA is authorized to conduct a de novo review of the IJ\u2019s order. <em>See Castillo-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>929 F.2d 181, 183 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-24\">Second, she argues that the BIA rendered an adverse, independent, and discretionary ruling to that of the IJ based upon her veracity which was not at issue at her immigration hearing. She asserts that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>was not given an opportunity to respond to the veracity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Cervantes\u2019s argument fails because the determinations of adjustment of status and waiver of inadmissibility are purely discretionary, and therefore the denial of such relief does not constitute the deprivation of a liberty interest. <em>See Assaad, </em>378 F.3d at 475. Further, the record reflects that issues concerning Cervantes\u2019s veracity, such as conflicting information that she gave in police reports, were considered by the IJ. Finally, Cervantes makes no showing of substantial prejudice in the BIA\u2019s review process. <em>See DeZavala, </em>385 F.3d at 883. Accordingly, Cervantes\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b770-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
