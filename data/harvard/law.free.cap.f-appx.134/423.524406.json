Brown asserted Comcast had engaged in criminal racketeering, in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, <em>et seq., </em>(\u201cRICO\u201d), involving acts of mail fraud related to Brown\u2019s cable television show, consisting of \u201cfalse\u201d invoices, a \u201cfalse\u201d renewal notice, \u201cmisdirection of account payments,\u201d and a \u201cfalse notice of contract expiration.\u201d In his second amended complaint, Brown further noted that a previous action against Com-cast, filed in Florida State Court, No.2004CA-000191, (\u201c2004 State Case\u201d), had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-27\">The district court found that <em>res judicata </em>barred Brown\u2019s present action because: (1) \u201c[t]he predicate acts of mail fraud in [Brown\u2019s] allegations for the instant [RICO] claim were alleged as a cause of action for mail fraud in state court\u201d; (2) the Comcast defendants in the present action also were named in the 2004 State Case; and (3) the 2004 State Case was dismissed on the merits. In his brief, Brown frames the issue as whether <em>res judicata </em>applies only to cases that were \u201cactually litigated WITH A <em>HEARING </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>AND COURT TRANSCRIPT AND ACTUAL <em>SERVICE OF PROCESS. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss <em>de novo.\u201d Shields v. BellSouth Advertising and Pub. Co., Inc., </em>228 F.3d 1284, 1288 (11th Cir.2000). The barring of a claim on the basis of <em>res judicata </em>is a determination of law, which is reviewed <em>de novo. Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir. 1999). <em>\u201cRes judicata </em>bars the filing of claims which were raised or could have been raised in an earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A federal court \u201cgive[s] preclusive effect to the judgment of a state court provided that two conditions are met: first, that the courts of the state from which the judgment emerged would do so themselves; and second, that the litigants had a \u2018full and fair opportunity\u2019 to litigate their claims and the prior state proceedings otherwise satisfied \u2018the applicable requirements of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shields, </em>228 F.3d at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In considering whether to give preclusive effect to a state court judgment, the district court must apply state law. <em>Vazquez v. Metropolitan Dade County, </em>968 F.2d 1101, 1106 (11th Cir.1992). \u201c[Ujnder Florida law, <em>res judicata </em>bars a second suit when a court of competent jurisdiction has entered final judgment in the first suit and the following four conditions are met: identify of the thing sued for; identify of the cause of action; identity of the parties; and identify of the quality in the person for or against whom the claim is made.\u201d <em>Sewell v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>94 F.3d 1514, 1518 (11th Cir. 1996). \u201cFlorida law defines identify of causes of action as causes sharing similarity of facts essential to both actions.\u201d <em>Saboff v. St. John\u2019s River Water Mgmt., Dist., </em>200 F.3d 1356, 1360 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Because Brown previously filed a state action, which was dismissed with prejudice, (1) against the same parties, (2) based upon the same cause of action, and (3) seeking the same relief, the district court did not err by finding that the present federal action was barred based on <em>res judicata. </em>Accordingly, we affirm its dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
