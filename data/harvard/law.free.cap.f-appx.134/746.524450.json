Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Because the merits of Jones\u2019s appeal are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith, we determine both issues, denying IFP and dismissing the appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-23\">Jones argues that the district court failed to provide reasons for its certification. Any deficiency in this regard, however, was cured by the district court\u2019s issuance of an amended order setting forth its reasons. Jones was provided with an opportunity to file a supplemental brief following the issuance of the amended order, but he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-24\">Jones argues, without citation to the record or to authority, that the district court abused its discretion by resolving issues rather than finding issues. He also contends that the district court decided the case on the basis of incorrect facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-25\">Jones\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-26\">The dismissal of Jones\u2019s appeal by this court counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Jones has accumulated at least two additional strikes based on the dismissal of a previous civil rights complaint and appeal as frivolous. <em>See Jones v. Butler, </em>No. 00-60598, 2001 WL 498673 (Apr. 12, 2001)(un-published). Jones has now accumulated at least three strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, Jones is BARRED from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b772-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
