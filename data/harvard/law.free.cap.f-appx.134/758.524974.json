Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 - \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Villarreal did not raise this issue in the district court, his argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005). Villarreal makes no showing, as required by <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>that the district court would likely have sentenced him differently under an advisory sentencing scheme. Similarly, there is no indication from the district court\u2019s remarks at sentencing that it would have reached a different conclusion. Thus, Villarreal has not met his burden to show that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence under a mandatory guideline scheme was plain error. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-19\">Villarreal also argues <em>for </em>the first time on appeal that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Villarreal acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b785-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
