After a trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-18\">The presentence report (PSR) did not recommend an adjustment for Areche\u2019s role in the offense. The probation officer noted that although there were \u201cthree other participants in this offense, the defendant\u2019s role is not considered either aggravating nor mitigating.\u201d The Government objected, arguing that Areche should receive a four-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). The district court sustained the Government\u2019s objection. The court found that \u201cthere were at least five or more participants involved in the criminal activity and that the Defendant directed at least one of them, Hugo Quevedo.\u201d The court further found that Areche\u2019s \u201cinvolvement as a leader of a criminal activity was otherwise extensive.\u201d In addition to assessing the four-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, the court imposed a two-million dollar f\u00edne. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-19\">Areche first argues that DEA Agent Robert Zafra should not have been allowed to testify that it was Areche\u2019s voice that could be heard on the recorded conversations recounted by Zafra. Areche argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>that the identification testimony violated the attorney-client privilege because it was admittedly based on Zafra\u2019s listening to conversations between Areche and his counsel at trial. Areche acknowledges that because he did not object to Zafra\u2019s testimony on the basis of the attorney-client privilege, review of his argument is for plain error. To show reversible plain error, Areche must show (1) an error, (2) that is clear and obvious, and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 558 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Zafra\u2019s testimony was not based on the content of any confidential communication between Areche and his attorney, but merely on the sound of Areche\u2019s voice during normal conversation in the courtroom. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s failure to disallow Zafra\u2019s testimony based on the attorney-client privilege was not plain error. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>121 F.3d 971, 975 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Areche also argues that Zafra\u2019s identification testimony was insufficient under Fed.R.Evid. 901. Because Areche made a timely objection to the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling in this respect, review of the district court\u2019s ruling is for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Lampton, </em>158 F.3d 251, 259 (5th Cir.1998). Zafra\u2019s testimony satisfied the requirements of Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(5). <em>Id. </em>Areche\u2019s contention that Zafra\u2019s identification of his voice was equivocal goes only to the weight of the testimony, not its admissibility. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the identification testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Areche next argues that the district court erred by increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). He argues that the his role in the conspiracy was limited to being \u201cthe source of the cocaine only\u201d and that a buyer-seller relationship is insufficient to qualify for the enhancement. We review a district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Lowder, </em>148 F.3d 548, 552 (5th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for the increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level by four levels \u201cif the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). \u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the [organizer or leader] of one or more other participants.\u201d <em>Id., </em>commenting); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 247 (5th Cir.2001). In distinguishing a leadership or organizational role from one of mere management or supervision, factors the court should consider include: (1) the exercise of decision-making authority; (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense; (3) the recruitment of accomplices; (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense; (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. <em>Id., </em>comment.(n.4); <em>see United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 396 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">At the sentencing hearing, the Government asserted that \u201cthe telephone conversations that Your Honor heard which were admitted in evidence at [Areche\u2019s] trial made it clear that Quevedo took di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>rections from this Defendant.\u201d The Government\u2019s reliance on the introduction of the taped conversations is flawed, however, because the tapes were never introduced into evidence. Moreover, although Areche was a supplier to Quevedo, Agent Zafra acknowledged that Quevedo had another supplier who could deliver 21 kilograms of cocaine. <em>Compare United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 474 (5th Cir.2004), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1003, 160 L.Ed.2d 1006 (2005)(defen-dant was an \u201cexclusive supplier\u201d for the criminal activity). Further, it was another conspirator, Craig Hector Rivera, not Areche, who paid the participants, including Areche. <em>Compare Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d at 474 (defendant directed and paid several couriers). In sum, we conclude that the record is devoid of facts showing that Areche organized or led Quevedo. Accordingly, Areche\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the matter is REMANDED for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Ronning, </em>47 F.3d 710, 713 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Areche also challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-million dollar f\u00edne. He argues that the court imposed the fine because remained silent rather than cooperate with the probation officer. \u201cIt is undisputed that the guidelines place the burden of proving an inability to pay a fine squarely on the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Fair, </em>979 F.2d 1037, 1041 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a). The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing, when read as a whole, indicate that the court\u2019s reason for imposing the fine was the burden set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a), not Areche\u2019s failure to cooperate with the probation office. The Fifth Amendment thus was not implicated. Areche contends, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 21, 159 L.Ed.2d 851 (2004). Although Areche\u2019s brief was written prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, Areche noted the pendency of <em>Booker </em>and he asserted that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>might validate his argument. Because we must vacate Areche\u2019s sentence due to the misapplication of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), we do not reach this argument. <em>See United States v. Southerland, </em>405 F.3d 263, 270 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
