Gonzalez neither filed a timely notice of appeal, nor sought a timely extension of time for filing one. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1) &amp; (4). Instead, over seven months after the district court imposed sentence, Gonzalez filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for an out-of-time appeal, claiming that, contrary to his request, his attorney had not filed a notice of appeal. The district court granted the motion but did not re-enter the original judgment. Gonzalez then filed a notice of appeal with our court. Because the judgment was not reentered, the Government filed an unopposed motion to remand and hold the appeal in abeyance. That motion was granted. The district court then re-entered the judgment, and this appeal proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">\u201c[A] district court does <em>not </em>have the authority to create appellate jurisdiction simply by ordering an out-of-time direct criminal appeal. Compliance with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure is imperative.\u201d <em>United States v. West, </em>240 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2001) (emphasis in original). <em>West </em>addresses the proper procedures for granting an out-of-time appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See id. </em>at 459-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We therefore VACATE the district court\u2019s order granting the out-of-time appeal, and REMAND the case. On remand, the district court should determine, in the light of <em>West, </em>and with regard to the advice requirements of <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), whether it will construe the motion for an out-of-time appeal as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Should the district court construe Gonzalez\u2019s motion for an out-of-time appeal as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court should provide the \u201csecond or successive\u201d warnings mandated by <em>Castro. See Castro, </em>540 U.S. at 383, 124 S.Ct. 786. The district court should also instruct Gonzalez to include all 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 claims presently available to him in his current motion to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, </em>211 F.3d 862, 867-70 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">\n<em>VACATED and REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b722-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
