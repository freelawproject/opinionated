Rubio-Rubio argues that the district court erred by imposing his sentence under the mandatory guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Rubio-Rubio did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>to plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). The district court erred in imposing Rubio\u2019s sentence under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, and this error was obvious after <em>Booker. See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 734 (5th Cir.2005). However, Rubio-Rubio has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights as he has not shown that the record shows the district court judge would have imposed a different or lesser sentence under a <em>Booker </em>advisory regime. <em>See id. </em>at 734. Therefore, he has not met the requirements to show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
