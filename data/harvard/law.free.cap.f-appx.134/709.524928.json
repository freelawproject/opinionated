Strahan contends, as he did at sentencing, that his sentence, as applied to the facts of his case, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">Strahan asserts that under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinions in <em>Ramirez v. Castro, </em>365 F.3d 755 (9th Cir.2004) and <em>Rios v. Garcia, </em>390 F.3d 1082 (9th Cir.2004), the district court should have considered the following facts: (1) he was merely present in his house when the transaction occurred and he did not profit from the transaction; (2) the weapons involved in the transaction were kept outside of his home in a storage shed; and (3) his only past crime was a misdemeanor assault case, for which he received a probated sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">However, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinions are persuasive authority at most. Strahan does not point to any language in <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003), <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003), or any other Supreme Court or Fifth Circuit opinion requiring such in-depth analysis. In this circuit, we look to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991), and <em>Hutto v. Davis, </em>454 U.S. 370, 102 S.Ct. 703, 70 L.Ed.2d 556 (1982), as benchmarks for making the threshold determination whether a defendant\u2019s drug offense and sentence were grossly disproportionate. <em>See United States v. Cathey, </em>259 F.3d 365, 368-69 &amp; nn. 13-14 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">Strahan\u2019s fifteen-year sentence for conspiring to distribute 168 grams of methamphetamine is not grossly disproportionate to his crime, and thus it does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. at 1001-05, 111 S.Ct. 2680; <em>Davis, </em>454 U.S. at 370, 374-75, 102 S.Ct. 703; <em>Cathey, </em>259 F.3d at 367-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-11\"> Pursuant, to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
