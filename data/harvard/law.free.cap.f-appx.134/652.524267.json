He contends that the district court should have questioned his competence in view of his conflicts with his attorneys, his refusal to cooperate with the probation officer, his attempt to withdraw his guilty plea even though he might have received a life sentence had he gone to trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his attorney\u2019s expression of concern regarding his competence, and information regarding head injuries and possible brain damage. Thomas\u2019s appellate counsel also represents that Thomas has engaged in \u201cirrational\u201d behavior during the course of his representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">Considering the absence of any indication of a prior history of irrational behavior, Thomas\u2019s lucid responses during district court proceedings, matters reflected at the Rule 11 and motion to withdraw hearings, and the lack of any prior medical opinion on competency, the district court did not abuse its discretion in not ordering a competency hearing sua sponte.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Messervey, </em>317 F.3d 457, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>463 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"ACJ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aq33\">. Thomas was ultimately sentenced to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ANa\">. We note that the district court remarked in passing during the hearing to withdraw the guilty plea that \"I can\u2019t force you to have a [psychological] examination. While this statement may be overly broad as a general matter, the circumstances of this case are not such as to have required or clearly warranted a mandatory psychological evaluation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
