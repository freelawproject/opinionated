Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that petitioners fail to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-23\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because petitioners fail to show that they are eligible for asylum, they cannot meet the higher standard for. withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-24\">We also find that petitioners fail to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). We find that petitioners fail to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-25\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-18\"> Denan is the lead petitioner in the instant case, as Endranto is basing his eligibility for relief on Denan\u2019s alleged persecution. Endranto is therefore a derivative beneficiary of Denan\u2019s asylum application. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
