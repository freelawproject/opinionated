This motion was denied by the district court April 3, 1997, and was affirmed by this court March 19,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-24\">The present \u00a7 2255 motion was filed September 3, 2002, again seeking relief from the same criminal conviction and was denied by the district court on October 31, 2002, as successive, Calloway not having received previous authority from this court to file the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-25\">A Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s order of October 31, 2002, was denied by the district court on January 16, 2003, because the \u00a7 2255 petition was successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-26\">On appeal from the decision of the district court of October 31, 2002, we considered the Rule 59(e) motion to have been untimely and thus the appeal was not considered on its merits, rather on another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-27\">Upon a petition for rehearing we have determined that our decision was erroneous in denying the Rule 59(e) motion as untimely. So we consider the petition for rehearing on its merits and reconsider the merits of the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-28\">This \u00a7 2255 petition was filed in this case September 3, 2002, in case no. 2:92crll3. The petition stated on its face that it was a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, thus there was no misconstruction or labeling issues under <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The \u00a7 2255 motion was correctly denied by the district court as successive: \u201cAs Calloway\u2019s first habeas petition was decided on the merits, his second petition qualifies as a \u2018second or subsequent\u2019 petition, despite his claims to the contrary.\u201d See <em>United States v. Edward Calloway, </em>No. 2:92cr113 (E.D.Va. Jan. 16, 2003) (order denying motion to alter or amend judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The district court even advised Calloway that he must receive an authorization from this court, giving our mailing address, before the district court might consider the \u00a7 2255 motion for relief on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We affirm the judgment of the district court for the reasons stated in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Calloway must get leave of .this court before he may proceed under \u00a7 2255. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
