His challenge to federal jurisdiction is without merit. There is no authority to support his argument that the term \u201cresidence\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 228(a)(3) has the same meaning as \u201cdomicile.\u201d In fact, the only courts to have considered the issue have found to the contrary. <em>See United States v. Namey, </em>364 F.3d 843 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 302, 160 L.Ed.2d 126 (2004); <em>United States v. Venturella, </em>391 F.3d 120, 131 (2d Cir.2004). Moreover, the clear language of the statute reveals that the issue was where Ashley resided and not where her parents claimed to be domiciled. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 228(a)(3). Clonce\u2019s inquiry into Mar-sack\u2019s domicile was irrelevant and was properly excluded. Fed.R.Evid. 401, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-22\">Clonce argues that in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this case should be remanded for resentencing. The Government concedes this issue. Because there does not appear to be anything in the record \u201cthat would prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced [Clonce] differently had it acted under an advisory Guidelines regime,\u201d Clonce is entitled to a remand for resentencing. <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 2005 WL 852416, *11 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-25\">Clonce\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 228 is without merit. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>115 F.3d 1222, 1226-30, 1232-33 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-26\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
