Carter\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that, in her view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Carter has been notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-24\">The only issue Carter raises on appeal is whether his sentence should have been below the applicable sentencing guidelines range of eight to fourteen months. A defendant is generally precluded from appealing a district court\u2019s refusal to award a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990). Moreover, because the Guidelines\u2019 Chapter Seven policy statements are purely advisory,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> this court reviews a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release and authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-25\">The district court correctly determined Carter\u2019s sentencing range of eight to fourteen months, and his twelve month sentence was within that range. As the sentence was not imposed in violation of law and the sentencing guidelines were properly applied, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-26\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Carter\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b666-19\"> Because the sentencing guidelines relating to revocation of supervised release have always been advisory, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>Ch. 7, Pt. A, the sentence in this appeal is not impacted by the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
