Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014,\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005). The district court below previously granted Defendant War-rick A. Giffin\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, based upon Griffin\u2019s successful attacks on state court convictions that contributed to the calculation of his federal sentence. The government appealed and we reversed the grant of Griffin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and remanded this case. <em>See United States v. Griffin, </em>99 Fed.Appx. 878 (2004). Griffin then sought a writ of certiorari, and the Supreme Court vacated our opinion and remanded the case to us for consideration in light of <em>Johnson. See United States v. Griffin, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1823, 161 L.Ed.2d 714 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-29\">On July 25, 1997, Griffin and two armed co-defendants robbed a bank, escaping with approximately $23,000. A federal grand jury indicted Griffin, and he pled guilty to bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) scored five prior convictions, which resulted in a category V <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>criminal history. Based upon an offense level of 29, Griffin faced a guidelines range between 140 and 175 months\u2019 imprisonment. On February 27, 1998, the district court sentenced Griffin to 120 months, reflecting Griffin\u2019s substantial assistance to the Government under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The ultimate sentence was later reduced to 100 months under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Griffin subsequently filed a direct appeal, which this Court dismissed on July 6, 1999, for the Defendant\u2019s failure to pay the appellate docketing and filing fees. <em>See United States v. Griffin, </em>No. 98-83202-C (July 6, 1999). In 2001, Griffin then filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in the Superior Court of Wayne County, Georgia. In that application, Griffin challenged his 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1997 state convictions, which had been calculated into the final score to determine his federal criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">On March 19, 2003, the state court vacated Griffin\u2019s 1992, 1993, and 1997 convictions due to the State\u2019s inability to produce any documents showing that Griffin had been represented by counsel, fully informed of his rights before waiving counsel, or given any notice of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">On March 29, 2003, ten days after the Superior Court order and nearly five years after his federal conviction, Griffin filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, seeking recalculation of his criminal history category from V to II, based upon the vacated state convictions. The Government objected on the premise that the motion was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The magistrate judge rejected the Government\u2019s argument, and found that \u00a7 2255\u2019s limitations period had been equitably tolled while Griffin challenged his state court convictions. As such, Griffin\u2019s motion was timely, and the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and granted Griffin habeas relief. The district court resentenced Griffin to time served and ordered his immediate release from custody on July 25, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Shortly after Griffin\u2019s release, we decided <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>340 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir.2003), and the Government asked the district court to reconsider its decision, arguing that <em>Johnson </em>required a contrary result. The district court denied the Government\u2019s motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">In its appeal to this Court, the Government asserted that <em>Johnson </em>required: (1) that a state court\u2019s vacatur of prior convictions is not a \u201cfact\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255 II 6(4); and (2) that equitable tolling was inapplicable where the petitioner knew the facts supporting his attack on his prior state convictions at the time his federal sentence became final. <em>Johnson, </em>340 F.3d 1219, 1226-28. We agreed, and reversed the grant of Griffin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and remanded the case to the district court. <em>See United States v. Griffin, </em>99 Fed.Appx. 878 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Since our decision in Mr. Griffin\u2019s case, the United States Supreme Court has decided <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005). While the Supreme Court affirmed our decision in <em>Johnson, </em>it did so on other grounds; necessitating a reevaluation of Griffin\u2019s case because this Court\u2019s previous opinion in <em>Johnson </em>controlled the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that when a prisoner collaterally attacks his federal sentence on the ground that a state conviction used to enhance that sentence has since been vacated, \u00a7 2255\u2019s one-year limitations period begins to run when the petitioner receives notice of the order vacating the prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1582. While this effectively tolls \u00a7 2255\u2019s limitations period, the clock only stops if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>prisoner sought the state court vacatur with due diligence after entry of the judgment in the federal case in which the sentence was enhanced. <em>Id. </em>at 1582.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In contrast to our opinion in <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court determined that the state-court order vacating the prisoner\u2019s prior conviction is a matter of \u201cfact\u201d supporting his \u00a7 2255 claim, discovery of which triggers the refreshed one-year limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 1578-79. Therefore, had the prisoner acted diligently <em>from, the date of entry of judgment by the district court </em>in his federal case to obtain the state court order vacating his predicate conviction, the one-year limitation period would have run from the date he received notice of that vacatur. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court affirmed Johnson\u2019s sentence because he did not show due diligence. Although he knew that his conviction subjected him to the career offender enhancement, Johnson neglected to attack the predicate for enhancement for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">For Griffin, the question now turns on whether he met the requisite showing of due diligence to effectively toll \u00a7 2255\u2019s limitation. Judgment was entered against Griffin on March 3, 1998. Griffin did not seek vacatur of his state court convictions until early 2001 \u2014 approximately three years after entry of his federal conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under <em>Johnson, </em>such a delay is unreasonable, and as the Supreme Court articulated, \u201cwe have never accepted <em>pro se </em>representation alone or procedural ignorance as an excuse for prolonged inattention when a statute\u2019s clear policy calls for promptness\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1582. On this record, we think Griffin \u201cfell far short of reasonable diligence in challenging the state conviction[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we reverse, once again, the grant of the Griffin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion after our reconsideration in light of <em>Johnson, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court indicated that even a 21-month delay was unreasonable: \u201d[E]ven if we move the burden of diligence ... Johnson would have still delayed unreasonably, having waited over 21 months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1582.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
