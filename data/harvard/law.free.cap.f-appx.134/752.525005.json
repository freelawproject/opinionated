He challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of his offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. He does not address his waiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>er, pursuant to his plea agreement, of his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The record demonstrates that Garcia\u2019s appeal waiver was informed and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292-93 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567 (5th Cir.1992). The only appeal rights reserved by Garcia were the right to appeal any upward departure imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 and the right to raise constitutional challenges regarding the effectiveness of counsel or regarding prosecutorial misconduct. Garcia\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s calculation of his offense level are not appeal bases excepted from the waiver. <em>See United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 223-24 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Although the Government asserted the appeal waiver in its brief, defense counsel did not file a reply brief. He has therefore failed to address the threshold issue before this court. Garcia\u2019s appeal is therefore without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b778-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
