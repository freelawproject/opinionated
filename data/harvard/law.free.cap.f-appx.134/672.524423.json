He contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, in part because the photographic array from which his photograph was selected was impermissibly suggestive; that the district court erred by rejecting his proposed instruction regarding circumstantial evidence; and that the district court erred by sentencing him as an armed career criminal, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">Farkas raised his challenge to the photographic array for the first time in his motion for a new trial. We review Farkas\u2019s contention under the plain-error standard. <em>See United States v. Loney, </em>959 F.2d 1332, 1341 &amp; n. 22 (5th Cir.1992). Farkas has shown no error, plain or otherwise \u2014 the markings underneath the photographs did not render the array impermissibly suggestive. <em>See Passman v. Blackburn, </em>652 F.2d 559, 569 (5th Cir.1981). In addition to the photographic array, the testimony of the pawn shop manager about Farkas\u2019s firearm transaction provided sufficient evidence to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Farkas was the individual who conducted the transaction. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">Farkas requested an instruction that in cases depending on circumstantial evidence, a defendant is entitled to an acquittal if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, gave equal or nearly equal support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence. Farkas\u2019s proposed instruction could have suggested that a standard other than the reasonable-doubt standard applied to circumstantial evidence, and that circumstantial evidence should be viewed differently from direct evidence. The district court did not abuse its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>rejecting the instruction. <em>See United States v. Dien Duc Huynh, </em>246 F.3d 734, 738 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The Government provided Farkas with adequate notice of its intention to seek sentencing as an armed career criminal, when it filed a post-verdict notice with documents attached that reflected Farkas\u2019s many state-court convictions. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Neal, </em>180 F.3d 115, 125-26 (4th Cir.1999). Finally, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply to findings of prior convictions used to sentence a defendant as an armed career criminal. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that <em>this </em>opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
