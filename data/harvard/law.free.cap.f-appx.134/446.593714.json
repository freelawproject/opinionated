United States, </em>Nos. 05-117 C, 05-118 C, and 05-188 C and <em>Hurt v. District of Columbia, </em>05-119 C, dismissing Tyrone Hurt\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction. Hurt moves for summary reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">Hurt filed four complaints, each seeking one billion dollars in punitive damages, in the Court of Federal Claims. Hurt alleged violations of his Fifth Amendment due process rights in addition to violations of his Fourth and Eighth Amendment rights by the District of Columbia and employees of the District of Columbia Board of Parole. He also alleged medical malpractice by a named individual and referred to \u201call cases concerning negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-17\">The Court of Federal Claims, in four decisions, dismissed concluding, inter alia, that it lacked jurisdiction over the District of Columbia and its employees, over punitive damages claims, over cases sounding in tort, and over constitutional claims not based on an appropriate money-mandating statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-18\">Summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed. Cir.1994) (summarily affirming the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 dismissal of a complaint). Having reviewed the papers and Hurt\u2019s brief, it is clear that the trial court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Hurt\u2019s claims and dismissal was warranted. Thus, because no substantial question exists regarding the outcome of Hurt\u2019s appeals, the court summarily affirms the judgments of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing Hurt\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-19\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b824-20\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b824-21\">(1) The United State\u2019s motion to summarily affirm the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 judgments is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-22\">(2) Hurt\u2019s motion for summary reversal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-23\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
