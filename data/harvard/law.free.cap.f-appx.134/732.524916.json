George has appealed his sentence.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-22\">George contends that the district court erred in increasing \u201e his offense level be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>cause the offense involved more than 50 victims. The adjustment was appropriate under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(B)) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">George contends that the district court erred in determining the amount of the loss. The district court\u2019s finding regarding the intended loss with respect to the unused pre-approved credit card applications was not clearly erroneous and was not unreasonably determined. <em>See United States v. Saacks, </em>131 F.3d 540, 542-43 (5th Cir.1997); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.2(C)) (2002). It was sufficient that the financial institutions were put at risk of sustaining a loss. <em>See United States v. Sowels, </em>998 F.2d 249, 251 (5th Cir.1993). The district court did not clearly err in determining the actual and intended loss. <em>See Saacks, </em>131 F.3d at 542-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">George contends that his sentence was imposed illegally and that the Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We review this issue for plain error. By determining facts related to the victim-related adjustment and the amount of the loss, the district court committed clear or obvious errors under the rule in <em>Booker. See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(U.S. Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). George has not shown, however, that the errors affected his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\"> George contended in his original brief that the district court erred in refusing to suppress evidence seized during a search of his residence, pursuant to a warrant that was issued on an inadequate affidavit of probable cause. George concedes in his reply brief that he waived this issue by pleading guilty. <em>See United States v. Jessup, </em>305 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
