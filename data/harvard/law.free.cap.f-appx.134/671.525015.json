He appeals the district court\u2019s sua sponte denial of his pro se \u201cMotion to Correct Clerical Error,\u201d purportedly filed pursuant to Fed. R.Crim. P. 36. In the motion, Baker sought federal sentencing credit for almost five years of time during which he was apparently confined in a Texas state prison for a state conviction. He urged the district court to change the 1997 judgment to reflect that his federal and state sentences ran concurrently. In this appeal, he continues to argue that the withholding of such credit violates various constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-27\">Rule 36, Fed.R.Crim.P., permits a district court at any time to \u201ccorrect a clerical error in a judgment, order, or oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>er part of the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Clerical error exists only when \u201cthe court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u201d <em>United States v. Steen, 55 </em>F.3d 1022, 1025-26 (5th Cir.1995). Rule 36 and its civil counterpart, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a), are not vehicles for redressing \u201csubstantive rights.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1026 n. 3; <em>Sherrod v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>132 F.3d 1112, 1117 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Section 2241, 28 U.S.C., is the appropriate vehicle for obtaining credit for prior custody. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>753 F.2d 455, 456 (5th Cir.1985). Contrary to Baker\u2019s assertions, \u201c[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the [federal] court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3484(a). A federal prisoner is entitled to credit for a state sentence \u201conly when it was exclusively the product of such action by federal law-enforcement officials as to justify treating the state jail as the practicaRequivalent of a federal one.\u201d <em>United States v. Dovalina, </em>711 F.2d 737, 740 (5th Cir;1983) (internal quotation njarks . and. citation' omitted). Baker has no entitlement \u2014 statutory, constitutional, or otherwise \u2014 to have his federal prison sentence run concurrently with a state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
