Simpson asserted that, in early 2001, the DOC instituted office staffing changes that left her as the only specialist in her office. Simpson subsequently asserted in an affidavit that she worked at least five hours unpaid overtime per week for over a year to meet the job obligations caused by the increased workload.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Based on Simpson\u2019s allegations of working unpaid overtime, the DOC reported this conduct to the state inspector general\u2019s office (\u201cOIG\u201d), which investigated her failure to disclose the alleged overtime on her attendance and leave reports. The DOC terminated Simpson in August 2008 after the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The Public Employees Relations Committee (\u201cPERC\u201d) held a post-termination hearing. The hearing officer determined that Simpson had not worked the overtime she claimed and thus did not falsify her time sheets. But the hearing officer opined that Simpson therefore had filed a false affidavit alleging she had worked unpaid overtime. The officer also determined that Simpson had refused to answer questions about her job duties and had failed to follow instructions during the investigation interview. The officer concluded that discipline, including termination, was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">Simpson supplemented her complaint to add a claim that the DOC terminated her in retaliation for her engaging in a protected activity. The district court granted summary judgment on the claim of retaliatory termination. The district court determined that Simpson had not rebutted as pretextual the DOC\u2019s proffered reasons for her termination: that she had engaged in misconduct by falsifying either her time sheets or her affidavit and that she did not cooperate with the investigation about the time sheet discrepancy. But the district court allowed the claim about retaliatory increased workload to proceed to a jury trial. After the close of Simpson\u2019s case, the district court granted the DOC\u2019s Fed. R.Civ.P. 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Simpson argues that the district court erred in granting the DOC\u2019s Rule 50 motion: she contends a jury should have been permitted to decide the degree to which her workload increased after the staffing changes in her office and to decide whether the DOC intentionally increased her workload. But Simpson has not provided us with transcripts of the trial. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b) places on the appellant the burden of ensuring that the record on appeal \u2014 including the appropriate transcripts \u2014 is provided to this Court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 10(b); <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir.2002) (writing that a <em>pro se </em>litigant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u201cmust provide trial transcripts in the appellate record to enable this court to review challenges to sufficiency of the evidence\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>538 U.S. 930, 123 S.Ct. 1589, 2219, 155 L.Ed.2d 325 (2003). And without transcripts of the trial, we cannot review whether the district court erred in granting the DOC\u2019s Rule 50 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So, due to Simpson\u2019s failure to provide the necessary trial transcripts, we must affirm the district court\u2019s grant of the DOC\u2019s Rule 50 motion on her claim of retaliatory increased workload. <em>See Loren, </em>309 F.3d at 1304.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Simpson also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her retaliatory termination claim. She asserts (1) that she established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation and (2) that she rebutted as pretextual the DOC\u2019s reasons for her termination by presenting affidavits and testimony showing the actually was terminated for filing EEOC charges and a lawsuit, not for filing false timesheets or a false affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo; </em>and we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Kelley v. Hicks, </em>400 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitied to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">To evaluate claims of Title VII retaliation based on circumstantial, rather than direct, evidence of discrimination, we use the burden-shifting framework in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir.2002). Simpson first must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. The DOC then must offer, a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment acts. If the DOC successfully rebuts the presumption, the burden shifts back to Simpson to discredit the proffered nondiseriminatory reason as pretextual. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">We assume without deciding that Simpson can establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. And the DOC offered legitimate, nondiseriminatory reasons for her termination: her submission of false time sheets and her later failure to cooperate with the OIG investigation. The DOC circuit administrator underscored the seriousness of a claim of unrecorded overtime: this exposed the DOC to liability for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. That the PERC determined that Simpson had not worked the alleged overtime does not save Simpson from summary judgment: a necessary inconsistency exists between Simpson\u2019s affidavit claiming she worked overtime, and the time sheets reflecting no overtime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simpson has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>rebutted as pretextual the DOC\u2019s reasons for her termination. She points to the affidavits of a coworker, Donald Campbell, and a supervisor, Larry Sullenger, that the DOC \u201cmade it known\u201d that she would be terminated because she filed the EEOC charges and lawsuits. Sullenger\u2019s affidavit contains nothing more than conclusory allegations that Simpson was terminated for an illegal reason. <em>See Leigh v. Warner Bros., Inc., </em>212 F.3d 1210, 1217 (11th Cir.2000) (writing that conclusory allegations in affidavit are insufficient to defeat motion for summary judgment). Campbell indicated that in an October 2000 telephone conversation with Stephanie Curd, an assistant attorney general for the State of Florida, Curd stated DOC administrators \u201chate[d]\u201d Simpson for filing lawsuits and that these administrators said eventually they would fire Simpson. But Simpson was not fired until nearly three years after this conversation. And Curd\u2019s comments indicated nothing more than her own opinion of the DOC\u2019s attitude toward Simpson: these comments do not address the DOC\u2019s proffered reasons for her termination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In sum, Simpson has not met the DOC\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for her termination \u201chead on\u201d and rebutted them. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1088 (11th Cir.2004) (Title VII discrimination case). The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the DOC on Simpson\u2019s retaliatory termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">. Simpson has provided only the 18-page transcript of the oral argument on the Rule 50 motion. But she has not submitted the transcripts showing the testimony and evidence presented at trial, on which the district court based its ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\">. Simpson suggests that the magistrate judge should not have denied her motion to compel production of caseload printouts for other specialists: these printouts allegedly would have substantiated her claim. The magistrate judge abused no discretion in denying this motion: the magistrate determined that the motion was untimely and that the DOC attested that no such documents were in its possession. <em>See Hinson v. Clinch County, Ga., Bd. of Educ., </em>231 F.3d 821, 826 (11th Cir.2000) (no abuse of discretion for district court to deny motion to compel production due to plaintiff\u2019s delay in filing motion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-14\">. The DOC has submitted supplemental authority: the state court of appeals\u2019 affirmance of the PERC decision upholding Simpson\u2019s termination. The DOC contends that Simpson is collaterally estopped from arguing that she did not commit the violations that led <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>to her termination. But the district court already had considered the PERC decision in determining that nondiscriminatory reasons existed for Simpson's termination. And even though the state court decided that cause existed for Simpson\u2019s termination, this does not preclude Simpson from arguing that her termination \u201cwas the product of ... retaliation.\u201d <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">. We do not consider Simpson\u2019s contention that she established pretext because the DOC failed to terminate a specialist who committed, and was sentenced to probation for, a violent sexual battery. Simpson presented this evidence to the district court only after her trial: it was not before the court when the court ruled on the summary judgment motion. <em>See Clinkscales v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>831 F.2d 1565, 1570 (11th Cir.1987) (stating that appellate court does not consider evidence not part of record properly before district court in ruling on summary judgment motion). Simpson also refers to trial testimony that allegedly supports her argument on pretext. But we do not consider this evidence: it was not before the district court when it ruled on the DOC\u2019s summary judgment motion, and in any event, she has not provided us with trial transcripts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
