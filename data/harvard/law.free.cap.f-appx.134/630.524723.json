Haughie seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion to cure an alleged defect in the review process of his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 367-70 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Haughie has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Haughie\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability, deny Haughie\u2019s motion for documents, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
