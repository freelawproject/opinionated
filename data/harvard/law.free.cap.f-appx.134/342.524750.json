On November 16, 2004, we affirmed his conviction and sentence. Notably, Banks did not challenge the constitutionality of his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) before the district court or this court. Nor did he move for rehearing. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated our opinion and remanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Because Banks did not raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence before the district court or this court, any possible claim based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely </em>has been abandoned. <em>See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that appellant abandoned his <em>Booker </em>claim on appeal by not raising a timely constitutional challenge to his sentence in his initial brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
