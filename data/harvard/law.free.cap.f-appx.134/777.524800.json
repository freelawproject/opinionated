The motion is GRANTED. Gallegos pleaded guilty to illegal reentry into the United States following deportation and was sentenced to a 36-month term of imprisonment. He argues that his sentence is unconstitutional because it was enhanced for a prior felony conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Gallegos concedes that his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, but he raises the issue to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\">We reject Gallegos\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. See <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v.

R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
