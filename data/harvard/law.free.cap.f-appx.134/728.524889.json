Marquez-Gomez, </em>No. 04-50154, 2004 WL 1854540 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (unpublished). Following our judgment, Marquez-Gomez filed a petition for certiorari, in which he challenged for the first time the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines as applied to him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court granted Marquez-Gomez\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We now reconsider the matter in light of <em>Booker </em>and decide to reinstate our previous judgment affirming Marquez-Gomez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Because Marquez-Gomez did not raise any <em>Booker-related </em>challenges to his sentence until his petition for certiorari, we will not review his claim absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Our cases make it clear that an argument not raised in appellant\u2019s original brief as required by FED. R. APP. P. 28 is waived.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Marquez-Gomez\u2019s claim would fail under the plain-error test discussed in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir.2005), and he therefore clearly has not met the even more exacting test required to show the presence of extraordinary circumstances, which requires appellant to show a \u201cpossibility of injustice so grave as to warrant disregard of usual procedural rules.\u201d <em>McGee v. Estelle, </em>722 F.2d 1206, 1213 (5th Cir.1984) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, we decline to consider the merits of his <em>Booker </em>challenge. Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we REINSTATE OUR JUDGMENT affirming Marquez-Gomez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b754-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
