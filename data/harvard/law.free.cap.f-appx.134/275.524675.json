No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-31\">Defendant raises for the first time on appeal a single issue: whether the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>court committed reversible constitutional error under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , when it imposed a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2 based on judicially determined facts that were neither charged in the indictment nor admitted by Defendant during the Fed. R. Crim.P. 11 plea proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Blakely </em>concluded that a state mandatory guideline system violated a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment constitutional rights when a sentence enhancement was imposed based on facts found by a judge that were not admitted by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 2534-38. And in <em>Booker v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , the Supreme Court concluded that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Because Defendant raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review his claim only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir.2005). On plain error review, a defendant must show \u201cerror\u201d that is \u201cplain\u201d and that \u201caffect[s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Olmo, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). It is only after these conditions have been satisfied that an appellate court has <em>discretion </em>to notice a forfeited error. <em>Id. </em>An appellate court <em>may </em>remedy error that is plain and affects substantial rights only if \u201cthe error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (quoting <em>Olano, </em>113 S. Ct. at 1776).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">In <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2005) <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(U.S. Feb. 23, 2005) (No. 04-1148), we recognized that an enhancement imposed under a mandatory guidelines system based on facts found by the judge that went beyond those admitted by the defendant or found by the jury constituted <em>Booker </em>error. <em>Id. </em>at 1298-99. And, because of <em>Booker, </em>we concluded that that error is now plain. So Defendant has satisfied the first two requirements for plain error relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Defendant fails, however, to satisfy the third requirement: that the error \u201caffected substantial rights.\u201d As we explained in <em>Rodriguez, </em>the <em>Booker </em>error is not the use of extra-verdict enhancements; it is \u201cthe use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. To show the prejudice required for plain error relief, a claimant must show a \u201creasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">Defendant has not met his burden of showing that the <em>Booker </em>error in his case affected the outcome of his sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 1301, 1306. Defendant proffers nothing to show that a reasonable probability exists that the sentencing judge would have imposed a more lenient sentence had the guidelines been applied in an advisory and non-binding fashion. <em>See id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-10\">. Hampton filed written objections to his PSI and disputed again at sentencing the facts that supported the cross-reference of the gun possession offense to the guideline for aggravated assault, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2; he concedes that did not raise in the district court the constitutional issue now raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
