SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>The petition for rehearing is GRANTED. The opinion, 120 Fed.Appx. 547 (5th Cir.2005), is WITHDRAWN, and the following opinion is substituted:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">* <em>% </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Peter Johnson appeals the dismissal, for want of subject matter jurisdiction, of his age discrimination suit. Because Johnson cannot allege facts sufficient to sustain a cause of action against this defendant, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Johnson, while fifty-seven years old, attended a job fair in Houston hosted by Aramco Services Company (\u201cASC\u201d) and applied through ASC for a job as a Seismic Field Crew Supervisor working in Saudi Arabia with Saudi Arabian Oil Company (\u201cSAO\u201d). SAO is a Saudi Arabian entity with its principal office in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and ASC, SAO\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, is incorporated in Delaware. ASC states that it provides SAO with a range of services, including assistance with recruiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">ASC apparently recruits \u2014 albeit infrequently \u2014 for entities other than SAO. Support for this is found in the record in the form of ASC\u2019s letter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) in which it states, \u201cASC, among others, recruits employees for positions with the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (\u2018Saudi Aramco\u2019) and infrequently recruits for other entities.\u201d Johnson\u2019s unrefuted affidavit asserts that an ASC employee informed him that ASC acts as a recruiter for additional entities including its own subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">According to Johnson, he was later informed that he would not be selected for the job, allegedly because of his advanced age. He filed a complaint with the EEOC, was granted a right to sue letter, and sued ASC and SAO alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>ASC moved for dismissal based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), or alternatively for summary judgment, arguing \u201cthe court cannot apply extra-territorially the ADEA ... to a foreign corporation who employs U.S. citizens to work abroad.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court summarily granted the motion to dismiss \u201cwith prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Ramming v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-17\">Lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be found [on] any one of [the following bases]: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts.... In examining a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the district court is empowered to consider matters of fact which may be in dispute. Ultimately, a motion <em>to </em>dismiss <em>for </em>lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be granted only if it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle plaintiff to relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-19\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">The ADEA provides, in part, that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for an employment agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>cy to fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate against, any individual because of such individual\u2019s age, or to classify or refer for employment any individual on the basis of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(b). Bridling this proposition is the notion that no federal statute applies extra-territorially unless Congress has expressly indicated its intent for such an application. <em>See, e.g., EEOC v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., </em>499 U.S. 244, 248, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991). This canon of statutory construction \u201cserves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ADEA does not evince any such intent; to the contrary, the plain language of \u00a7 623(h)(2) generally prohibits such applications. Age discrimination claims, consequently, are not cognizable with respect to foreign corporations who employ American citizens to work aborad.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Based on the presumption against extraterritorial application, even Johnson concedes that SAO is not a covered employer under the ADEA. Nevertheless, because ASC is a U.S. corporation, the same principle does not necessarily immunize it from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Johnson asserts that ASC, functioning as an employment agency, may be liable for its own discriminatory practices under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(b). Johnson\u2019s complaint avers that ASC, through its screening and referral process that classified him according to his age, violated the ADEA \u2014 independently of SAO\u2019s discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">ASC correctly notes, however, that SAO is not a covered employer under the ADEA. Consequently, goes the argument, recruiting organizations such as ASC cannot be considered an employment agency for purposes of the act if the foreign corporation for whom the recruiter works is not a covered employer under the ADEA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Johnson responds by citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.3, which states that an employment agency that <em>\u201cregularly </em>procures employees for at least one covered employer [ ] qualifies under section 11(c) of the [ADEA] as an employment agency with respect to all of its activities whether or not such activities are for employers covered by the act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Consequently, if ASC \u201cregularly\u201d recruits for any covered employer or employers, the fact that SAO is not a covered employer will not immunize it from its conduct with respect to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">If we were to apply the regulation, we would need to determine precisely what is meant by the phrase \u201cregularly procure.\u201d We need not do so in this case, however, because when read in light of Congress\u2019s unequivocal admonition against extra-territorial application of the ADEA,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the regulation cannot impose liability on ASC. Where \u201cCongress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Where no such gap exists, however, or where the questioned agency regulation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u201cmanifestly contrary to the statute,\u201d the agency regulation will not trump the plain language of the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In this case, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.3, upon which Johnson relies, is in obvious tension with the ADEA\u2019s own general prohibition against its extra-territorial application. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(h)(2). As we noted above, absent an express indication of Congressional intent to apply a statute extra-territorially, such an intent will not be inferred. <em>See Arabian Am. Oil Co., </em>499 U.S. at 248, 111 S.Ct. 1227. In the case of the ADEA, this presumption is made conclusive by \u00a7 623(h)(2)\u2019s express prohibition of the application of the ADEA \u201cwhere the employer is a foreign person not controlled by an American employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The regulation on which Johnson relies attempts to impose liability in the very sort of manner that \u00a7 623(h)(2) prohibits. If we were to accept Johnson\u2019s position, the general anti-age discrimination prohibitions of \u00a7 623 would apply even though the employer is admittedly foreign and not controlled by an American employer. Because such a conclusion would be contrary to the plain text of \u00a7 623(h)(2), \u00a7 623(b)\u2019s limitations on the activities of employment agencies cannot apply to ASC.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The EEOC interpretation in question was first adopted in 1972 by the Department of Labor and was subsequently adopted by the EEOC, after notice and comment, as its own in 1981.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 623(h)(2), limiting the extra-territorial application of the ADEA, on the other hand, was not enacted until 1984. Neither the Department of Labor nor the EEOC, therefore, had the opportunity to consider Congress\u2019s admonition against extraterritorial application of the EEOC when adopting the questioned regulation. In this case, the plain language of the statute must be applied irrespective of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">In light of the foregoing, Johnson has failed to allege facts sufficient to sustain an ADEA cause of action against ASC. The judgment of dismissal is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-21\">.
