On appeal, Patino argues he satisfied the standard for asylum based on: (1) his membership in El Coraje, a conservative political party; or (2) his involvement, at the Institute for the Development of Antiogquia (\u201cIDEA\u201d), in an internal audit investigation which revealed IDEA, a governmental agency, had provided funding to the FARC through a money laundering scheme. Upon thorough review of the record, as well as careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error and affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">When the BIA issues an affirmance without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final order subject to review. <em>See Mendoza v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). As the fact-finder, it is the IJ\u2019s duty to determine credibility, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ. <em>See Vasquez-Mondragon v. INS, </em>560 F.2d 1225, 1226 (5th Cir.1977) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The IJ\u2019s factual deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>mination that an alien is not entitled to asylum must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mazariegos v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). Under this highly deferential standard of review, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable fact-finder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Because Patino\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), this case is governed by the permanent provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), as amended by IIRIRA. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>304 F.3d 1303, 1309 (11th Cir.2002). An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particulars social group, or political opinion....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>378 F.3d 1260, 1264 (11th Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, \u2018\u201c[mjere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution must be on account of, or because of, one of the statutorily listed factors, such as his political opinion. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. at 816. The petitioner must establish this causal connection by \u201cpresenting specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted). We have approved of a \u201ccountry-wide requirement\u201d in which a refugee must first pursue an \u201cinternal resettlement alternative\u201d in his own country, or establish that this is not possible, before seeking asylum here. <em>Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1326-27 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">\u201c \u2018[A]n imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed,\u2019 may constitute a ground for a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 of political persecution within the meaning of the INA\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (quoting <em>Morales v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 323, 331 (1st Cir.2000)). To prevail on a theory of imputed political opinion the asylum applicant must show that the \u201c[pjersecutor falsely attribute[d] an opinion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>[him], and then persecuted] [him] because of that mistaken belief about [his] views.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Even if the asylum applicant establishes that the persecutor imputed a political opinion to him, he would still have to demonstrate that he has a well-founded fear of persecution because of that imputed opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that Patino was not entitled to asylum, based on either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, on account of a political opinion. The only evidence of Patino\u2019s alleged past persecution attributable, with any degree of specificity, to the FARC consisted of some threatening phone calls and an incident during which some people wearing FARC armbands intercepted Patino\u2019s car on the road, physically assaulted him, and ordered him to retract certain parts of his IDEA audit report. The IJ found that, while Patino may have held a political opinion and \u201ceven gone so far as being a member of a political organization [El Coraje],\u201d there was <em>no </em>evidence \u201cthat the FARC had any interest whatsoever in his membership ... nor is there even any indication that the FARC had any interest in his political opinion at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">As for Patino\u2019s participation in the audit of IDEA, and the FARC\u2019s threats and the incident of physical violence against Patino, the IJ determined that the FARC had acted not based on Patino\u2019s political opinion, but simply to stop him from conducting the audit and revealing the money laundering scheme through which the FARC was receiving some of its funds. The IJ found the FARC\u2019s alleged conduct was insufficient to demonstrate past persecution, and nothing in the record compels us to reverse that finding. <em>See Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027. In fact, these alleged acts appear to be merely \u201ca few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d which is insufficient to establish past persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted). Threats or harassment, alone, do not constitute persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Vatulev v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 1207, 1210 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Mikhailevitch v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 384, 390 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">As for a well-founded fear of future persecution, because Patino did not present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he ... will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1231 (quotation omitted), we are not compelled to conclude that Patino has established a case for asylum on that basis. Notably, after Patino\u2019s attempts to sanitize his audit report were unsuccessful, he left his job at IDEA. Although he obtained a visa for travel to the United States within the same month as leaving IDEA, he did not leave Colombia for approximately three months, during which he lived incident-free, with no subsequent interaction with the FARC. Moreover, the record contains no evidence that Patino abandoned his political beliefs or affiliation with El Coraje during that same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Quite simply, nothing in the record indicates that the FARC persecuted Patino on account of his political opinions, or his affiliation with El Coraje, or that the FARC, imputing a political opinion to Patino, perceived Patino\u2019s involvement in the IDEA audit as a political statement against the FARC. We are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Patino failed to meet his significant burden of proving either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of his political opinion. And, we cannot say the record evidence would compel a reasonable fact-finder to reach a contrary conclusion on this petition for asylum. <em>See Elias-Zacha</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>rias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. at 815 n. 1; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-10\">. We review only the denial of INA relief in the form of asylum. In his order, the IJ also denied asylum and withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d). To the extent that Patino has not already abandoned his arguments on the CAT claims \u2014 he primarily challenges the denial of INA relief in his brief \u2014 we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Patino did not exhaust those claims by raising them before the BIA. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (\"[a] court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d). This exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional, and precludes review of a claim that has not been presented to the IJ or the BIA. <em>See, e.g., Fernandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001). Moreover, based on our conclusion that Patino did not establish a case for asylum, we need not, and do not, consider whether he satisfied the higher standard for withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-16\">. To the extent Patino\u2019s brief also includes arguments challenging the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration, in a December 3, 2004 Order, we dismissed his appeal as to that order for lack of prosecution. Accordingly, we will not address those arguments in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-17\">.
