The district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). Moore appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-23\">This court reviews the denial of a Fed. R.CivP. 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enter., Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir. 1994); <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). Under this standard, \u201c[i]t is not enough that the granting of relief might have been permissible, or even warranted \u2014 denial must have been so <em>unwarranted </em>as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-24\">Moore raises numerous arguments challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint that are largely irrelevant to the central issue on appeal, i.e., whether the district court abused its discretion in denying his Fed.R.CivP. 60(b) motion. After having reviewed the record and the briefs on appeal, we conclude that Moore has failed to show that the district court\u2019s deni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>al of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion was so unwarranted as to constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The appellee asks this court to dismiss this appeal as frivolous. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Moore\u2019s complaint counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Moore that, should he accumulate three strikes, he will be unable to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b765-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
