In this appeal, appellant contends that the district court should have granted his Fed. R.Crim.P. 29(a) motion for judgment of acquittal on Count Five. This is so, he says, because no reasonable jury could have found that he participated in the detonation of pipe bombs behind a Publix supermarket and near a Walgreens pharmacy for the purpose of detracting the police while he robbed an AmSouth Bank and that such conduct was \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 that bank robbery within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">Section 924(c)(1)(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-17\">Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-18\">(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-19\">(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). By definition, the term \u201cfirearm\u201d includes a bomb. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3)(D) and (4)(A)(i), and a bank robbery is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See e.g., United States v. Hunt, </em>187 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246 (11th Cir.2002), we \u201canalyze[d] ..., for the first time, the sufficiency of the evidence required to support a conviction for possession of a firearm in \u2018furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252. Noting that \u201cfurtherance\u201d means \u201ca helping forward,\u201d we concluded that \u201ca conviction under this portion of \u00a7 924(c) requires that the prosecution establish that the firearm helped, furthered, promoted, or advanced the drug trafficking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We explained that Congress intended that the government be required to \u201cillustrate through specific facts, which tie the defendant to the firearm, that the firearm was possessed to advance or promote the criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Explaining further that \u201cthere must be \u2018a showing of some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation,\u2019 \u201d we concluded that \u201cthe evidence against Timmons (bullet proof vest, crack cocaine on the stove and under the' cushions of the couch, two fully loaded firearms on top of the oven and ammunition inside the oven in the living room of his apartment) was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that Timmons was guilty of possessing the firearms \u2018in furtherance of drug trafficking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In this case, the Government\u2019s case established (1) that the destructive devices were possessed in order to advance the bank robbery, and (2) connected appellant to the destructive devices, such that a reasonable jury could have concluded that the evidence established his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
