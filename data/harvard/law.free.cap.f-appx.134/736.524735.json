Harper filed a civil complaint against the City of Houston for $10,000,000, alleging unspecified \u201cracial profiling\u201d and \u201ccorruption.\u201d The district court dismissed his complaint because it violated an injunction entered December 23, 2002. Harper has filed a motion in this court seeking leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-22\">Harper\u2019s financial affidavit establishes that he is unable to pay the costs of his appeal without undue hardship or deprivation of life\u2019s necessities. <em>See Adkins v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 339, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948). However, Harper does not address the reason for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint, and Harper has failed to establish a nonfrivolous ground for appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>(5th Cir.1982); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). His IFP motion is DENIED. As the appeal contains no nonfrivolous issues, it is DISMISSED. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Harper is warned that any future frivolous filings will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited, circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
