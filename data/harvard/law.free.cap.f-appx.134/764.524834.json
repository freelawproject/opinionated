California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Jaramillo-Gonzalez was informed of counsel\u2019s motion but did not file a response. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. We have not considered on its merits Jaramillo-Gonzalez\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel because the record is not adequately developed. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-21\">Without prejudice to Jaramillo-Gonzalez\u2019s right to file a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
