Russell has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">On February 9, 2005 Russell filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the judgment of the United States Court of Federal Claims entered on the docket sheet 63 days earlier, on December 8, 2004, in <em>Russell v. United States, </em>No. 04-1614C.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">An appeal from a judgment of the Court of Federal Claims must be filed within 60 days of entry of judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). In this ease, the notice of appeal was due no later than February 7, 2005. Because Russell\u2019s notice of appeal was filed 63 days after entry of the order appealed from, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S. Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (\u201cIt is well settled that the requirement of a timely notice of appeal is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Sofarelli Associates, Inc. v. United States, </em>716 F.2d 1395 (Fed.Cir.1983) (appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction where notice of appeal is untimely). <em>See also </em>Fed.R.App. P. 26(b) (appellate courts may not extend the time otherwise permitted for filing a notice of appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">(1) Russell\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
