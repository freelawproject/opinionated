In his civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Geer alleged retaliation in violation of his First Amendment rights due to termination from his employment as an ethics prosecutor for the Bar. On appeal, Geer argues that the district court erroneously concluded that his claim failed because he spoke primarily on matters of private interest, not primarily on matters of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Geer\u2019s allegations centered around a decision by his supervisor to remove him as prosecutor in an ethics proceeding against a Florida attorney. The attorney\u2019s defense counsel had telephoned Geer\u2019s supervisor and asked that Geer be removed from the case, allegedly making defamatory statements concerning Geer\u2019s lack of impartiality and competence. A series of communications resulted from the supervisor\u2019s decision to remove Geer from the case, consisting of an in-person meeting between Geer and the supervisor on November 7, 2001, and three e-mails that Geer sent to the supervisor and others on November 8, 9, and 15, 2001, respectively. Geer claims that he was fired on November 16, 2001, as a result of his speech in these communications, in violation of his First Amendment free speech rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, viewing all evidence and inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Burton v. Tampa Housing Auth., </em>271 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). The non-moving party must \u201cgo beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions of file, designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d in order to avoid summary judgment. <em>Graham v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., </em>193 F.3d 1274, 1281-82 (11th Cir.1999) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cThe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">Although a state<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> may not demote or discharge a public employee in retaliation for speech protected by the First Amendment, the employee\u2019s speech right is not absolute. <em>Bryson v. City of Waycross, </em>888 F.2d 1562, 1565 (11th Cir.1989). In order to prove a claim of retaliation for engaging in speech protected by the First Amendment, an employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: \u201c(1) the employee\u2019s speech is on a matter of public concern; (2) the employee\u2019s First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ment interest in engaging in the speech outweighs the employer\u2019s interest in prohibiting the speech to promote the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees; and (3) the employee\u2019s speech played a \u2018substantial part\u2019 in the employer\u2019s decision to demote or discharge the employee.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Burke County, Ga., </em>239 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2001). The first two factors are questions of law. <em>Id. </em>at 1219-20. Failure to establish any one of these three elements is fatal to a plaintiffs claim. <em>Mason v. Village of El Portal, </em>240 F.3d 1337, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u201cBecause an employee\u2019s speech will rarely be entirely private or entirely public, the main thrust of the employee\u2019s speech must be determined\u201d when determining if the speech is on a matter of public concern. <em>Maggio v. Sipple, </em>211 F.3d 1346, 1352 (11th Cir.2000) (quotations omitted). A court must determine whether the employee spoke primarily as a citizen on behalf of the public or primarily as an employee upon matters of personal interest. <em>Id. </em>This is decided by examining the \u201ccontent, form, and context\u201d of the speech, as revealed by the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>Although not dispositive, a court may consider the employee\u2019s attempts to make his concerns public. <em>Morgan v. Ford, </em>6 F.3d 750, 754 n. 5 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The record as a whole reveals that in the November 7, 2001 meeting with his supervisor and in his three subsequent e-mails, Geer\u2019s speech centered primarily on the harm he felt defense counsel\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements had done and would continue to do to his personal business reputation. Geer complained primarily that his supervisor\u2019s decision validated counsel\u2019s allegations and harmed him professionally. Furthermore, Geer did not speak to the media and did not attempt to get his story published. Therefore, because the \u201cmain thrust\u201d of his speech was private in nature, the speech was not protected by the First Amendment. <em>See Maggio, </em>211 F.3d at 1352. Because his speech was not protected by the First Amendment, Geer\u2019s retaliation claim failed as a matter of law. <em>See Anderson, </em>239 F.3d at 1219. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the Bar, as no genuine issues of material fact existed and it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Burton, </em>271 F.3d at 1276-77. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">.
