On appeal, Spradley does not address any of the facts or issues asserted by the defendants in the motion for summary judgment. He fails to challenge the decision of the district court in granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), arguments must be briefed to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Spradley failed to brief any of the issues raised in the granting of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, he has abandoned any issues before this court. <em>Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999). Spradley\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Spradley previously filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action which was dismissed by the district court as frivolous. <em>Spradley v. Batiste, </em>No. 96-22-B-1 (M.D.La. Jan. 31, 1996). The dismissal of the prior \u00a7 1983 action and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Spradley is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
