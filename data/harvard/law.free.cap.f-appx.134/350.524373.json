At sentencing, the district court denied a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, finding that Sterling was held responsible only for the amount of drugs with which he was involved, and that he was a trusted member of an ongoing conspiracy, and sentenced Sterling to eighty-seven months imprisonment to be followed by three years supervised release. Sterling appealed, raising two issues: (1) his sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); and (2) the district court clearly erred by denying a reduction for role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">After this court affirmed Sterling\u2019s sentence, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated our opinion and remanded in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Upon reconsideration, we conclude that Sterling cannot show plain error in the imposition of his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005) (acknowledging that a <em>Booker </em>error was plain, but holding that, in order to show that his substantial rights were affected under plain error review, the appellant must show that his sentence would have been different but for the court\u2019s use of the mandatory guidelines). Here, there is no evidence in the record to show that Sterling\u2019s sentence would have been different but for the mandatory guidelines. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir.2005) (finding error that affected substantial rights when the district court stated that the sentence was \u201ctoo severe,\u201d \u201cunfortunate,\u201d and a sentence at the low end was \u201cmore than appropriate\u201d). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-14\">. Because Sterling did not raise a <em>Booker </em>challenge before the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
