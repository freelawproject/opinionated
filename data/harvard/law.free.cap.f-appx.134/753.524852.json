Drew is effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>In state court, Drew pleaded guilty to charges of assault, recklessly causing bodily injury to an elderly person, and the unauthorized practice of law. As Drew did not allege that a specific federal law protects the criminal conduct with which he was charged, he has not shown that removal of the criminal actions was appropriate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. <em>See City of Greenwood, Miss. v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 824-28, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966). Furthermore, as Drew filed his notice of removal over a year after he pleaded guilty and was sentenced, his notice of removal was untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Because Drew has failed to show that his case presented nonfrivolous issues for appeal, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. Drew\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Drew\u2019s remaining outstanding motions are also DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\n<em>IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
