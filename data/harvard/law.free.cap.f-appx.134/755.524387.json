The district court found that Smith committed perjury at the detention hearing when he testified that he had not used marijuana after his pretrial release on January 28, 2004. The district court specifically found that Smith\u2019s false testimony was material; intentional; not by accident, mistake, or because of some misunderstanding; and an attempt to influence the court into ruling in his favor. These findings are plausible in light of the record as a whole and, thus, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that an enhancement for obstruction of justice was warranted. <em>See United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 752 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cPost-[United <em>States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ], we continue to apply the same standard of review to claims of erroneous fact-finding with respect to the application of adjustments, i.e., we review for clear error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Smith also contends that the district court\u2019s denial of a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 was without foundation because it was based on the district court\u2019s finding that Smith testified falsely at the detention hearing. As previously stated, the district court\u2019s finding that Smith committed perjury on a material matter at the detention hearing was plausible in light of the record as a whole. Further, Smith has failed to demonstrate that this is one of the extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 apply. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.4); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574-75 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, the district court\u2019s determination that Smith was not entitled to a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 was not without foundation. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1081, 124 S.Ct. 942, 157 L.Ed.2d 757 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>No. 04-50118, 407 F.3d 742, 2005 WL 950130, *6 (5th Cir. Apr.26, 2005) (applying deferential standard of review to district court\u2019s denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 post-Booker).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Smith also contends that the district court improperly included third-party conduct in determining the amount of loss attributable to him without making the particularized findings required when a jointly undertaken criminal activity is involved. However, contrary to Smith\u2019s contention, the district court did not include third-party conduct in determining the amount of loss attributable to him as relevant conduct. Instead, Smith was held accountable for relevant conduct in which he was directly involved. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A). Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in determining the amount of loss attributable to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Finally, Smith contends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>Booker. </em>Because Smith did not raise a Sixth Amendment objection in the district court, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Although Smith\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on facts that were neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, he has not demonstrated that this plain error affected his substantial rights. Smith has failed to point to any evidence in the record indicating that the same sentence would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>been imposed had the district court known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. The record itself gives no indication that the district court would have reached a different result under an advisory guidelines scheme. The district court found that a sentence in the middle of the guideline range was appropriate. Given the lack of evidence indicating that the district court would have reached a different conclusion, Smith has not demonstrated that his substantial rights were affected, and, thus, he has failed to establish plain error. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b781-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
