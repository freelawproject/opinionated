On appeal, Hines argues that the district court improperly imposed a four-level enhancement to his base offense level for possession of a firearm while committing another felony. Although Hines signed a sentence appeal waiver, he argues that his claim falls within an exception to the appeal waiver, namely that he may appeal his sentence because it exceeds the applicable guideline sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the knowing and voluntary nature of a sentence appeal waiver. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir.1993). A sentence appeal waiver may be enforced, so long as it was knowingly and voluntarily made. <em>Id. </em>at 1350. To prevail upon its contention that the sentencing claim is waived, we have indicated that \u201c[t]he government must show that either (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant concerning the sentence appeal waiver during the Rule 11 colloquy, or (2) it is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Hines does not dispute that the appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary. Although he argues that the issue he seeks to raise falls within the exception to the appeal waiver for a sentence that exceeds the sentencing guidelines range, Hines actually is arguing that the district court incorrectly calculated his sentencing guidelines range. Accordingly, we conclude that the claim is barred by the sentence appeal waiver. <em>See Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1350. Moreover, Hines\u2019s sentence did not even exceed the guideline range that he argues should have been applied. Accordingly, we affirm Hines\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
