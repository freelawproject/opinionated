Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the decision of the Board and the evidence of record and conclude that Taylor fails to show the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-25\">Nor can Taylor show he was entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1281(b)(3) (2000). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). In addition, we find no due process violation as a result of the Board\u2019s affirmance under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) (2005). <em>See Settenda v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 89, 98 (1st Cir.2004) (if due process requirements are met when a single Board member issues an affirmance without opinion, such requirements are also met when the Board member issues a brief explanatory order); <em>cf. Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 281 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that the streamlined affirmance without opinion procedures under 8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) comport with the requirements of due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">We deny Taylor\u2019s motion to reconsider staying removal pending appeal as moot, and the motion to supplement the record. We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-20\"> Taylor raises no claim on appeal regarding the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, he has abandoned this claim. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
