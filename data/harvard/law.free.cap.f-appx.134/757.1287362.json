He argues that his counsel\u2019s representation of him in connection with the aiding and abetting charges constituted a constructive denial of counsel under <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-20\">The general rule in this circuit is that a claim of ineffective assistance will not be considered on direct appeal \u201cwhen, as here, it was not raised in the district court, because there has been no opportunity to develop record evidence on the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 527 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). We conclude that a motion brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 would be preferable to direct appeal for deciding Dragon\u2019s <em>Cronic </em>claim. <em>See Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED without prejudice to Dragon\u2019s right to raise this claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1113-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
