In substance, the statement made by defendant amounted to an admission that he had received the property in question into his possession \u201cknowing the same to have been stolen\u201d (see. 496, Pen. <em>Code); </em>and inasmuch as other evidence in the case established the fact that the stolen property was found in an automobile belonging to defendant before he had had time, after the burglary was committed and preceding his attempted arrest and subsequent flight from the burglarized premises, to convey the property from the scene of the burglary, the relevancy of the questioned evidence may not be doubted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">(2) The trial court did not err, nor abuse its discretion, in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">The judgment and the order denying the motion for a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
