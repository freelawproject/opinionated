J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adh\">Upon conviction, defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for life. The sole ground of appeal, relied upon by the defendant, relates to the issue of fact raised by the plea of \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d She contends that the evidence, without conflict, proved that she was insane at the time when the offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Trial by jury was duly waived. At the conclusion of the trial on the plea of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d it having been fully established and conceded that the defendant killed\" her husband, the court proceeded to hear evidence on the second plea. It was stipulated that all of the evidence taken on the first plea should be considered by the court on the plea of \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d The defendant then introduced the testimony of two physicians. These physicians gave to the court their opinion, based upon careful examination of the defendant, concerning the mental condition of the defendant at the time of the murder. Even on that testimony alone, it cannot successfully be maintained that the court\u2019s finding that the defendant was sane is without support in the evidence. For instance, Dr. Steele, after describing his investigations said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe she was insane, no. ... I think she was in an abnormal or unusual mental condition, but not insane.\u201d Q. \u201cDid you think at that time that she could distinguish right from wrong in the medical sense or in the legal sense ... ?\u201d Ans. \u201cProb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ably not right at the time. I believe she did afterwards.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, p. 172.) Again he said: \u201cShe was not insane but she was acting probably without full consciousness of just what she was doing, without thought. . . . Without clear thought.\u201d On cross-examination: Q. \u201cYou found no evidence of any mental disease that you could diagnose?\u201d Ans. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Again (on page 175) : \u201cNow, there is no question in your mind that at that time [immediately after the homicide] she realized the nature and quality and the consequences of her act, is there? . . . \u201d Ans. \u201cI think she did, yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The other expert witness, Dr. Parkin, could not find evidence of any definite mental disease, or disease of the nerves or brain of the defendant. Judging of the question on the basis of defendant\u2019s own statements to the witness, bethought that probably, when the homicide was committed, the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cmotivated from the unconscious,\u201d and that at that time \u201cher judgment was in abeyance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">From the foregoing, it plainly appears that the defendant was not of unsound mind, or insane, in any way or degree that can relieve her from responsibility for the crime committed by her. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hoin, </em>62 Cal. 120 [45 Am. Rep. 651]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sloper, </em>198 Cal. 238, 245 [244 Pac. 362], and cases there cited; 14 R. C. L., p. 598 et seq.) While some of the statements in the testimony of these expert witnesses express an opinion (not very confidently held), that the defendant, at the very moment of the act of homicide could not \u201cdistinguish right from wrong,\u201d they do not attribute this condition to any disease of the brain or mind. In effect they do not go beyond a belief that, assuming the truth of defendant\u2019s declarations, she was so far carried away by her jealousy and passion that, for the time being, she ceased to be guided by her judgment. This all savors of the doctrine of \u201cirresistible impulse,\u201d which the law rejects as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Houser, J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
