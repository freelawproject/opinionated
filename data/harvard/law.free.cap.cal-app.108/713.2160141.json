The defense as to each of such notes was that \u201csaid note was given to plaintiff\u2019s assignor upon the express condition that plaintiff\u2019s assignor should pay to defendant, or for his account, the full face value thereof, to-wit, the sum of $600 ($1,000); that plaintiff\u2019s assignor then and there agreed to pay to defendant, or for his account, said sum of $600 ($1,000), and that plaintiff\u2019s assignor failed, and has ever since failed, to pay to defendant, or for his account, said sum of $600 ($1,000), or any part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>thereof, and that the consideration for said note has completely and totally failed\u201d. Judgment was rendered in favor of defendant, and plaintiff appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">It is first urged by appellant that the answer interposed by defendant \u201cdid not raise an issue of failure of consideration\u201d. But whatever objection may be made regarding the form of the answer presented by defendant, its obvious meaning is that, although admitting the execution of the note in question, defendant never received any consideration whatsoever therefor. In any event, the record discloses that the parties to the litigation, as well as \"the judge of the trial court, so understood the allegation of defendant, and the case was tried on the issue of fact presented thereby. In such circumstances plaintiff is in no position to now complain for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Appellant\u2019s further complaint, to the effect that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding and ensuing judgment of the trial court, is likewise unavailing. Although the testimony given by the several witnesses regarding what consideration, if any, was received by defendant for the notes upon which the action was based, was somewhat conflicting one with the other, the record discloses ample evidence to support the conclusion reached by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
