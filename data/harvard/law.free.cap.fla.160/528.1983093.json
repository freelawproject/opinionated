Gilbert, the decedent\u2019s widow, on December 17, 1946, filed in said County Judge\u2019s Court her verified petition showing that she was without money or property except her interest in said estate; that it was necessary for her support that the widow\u2019s allowance provided by Section 733.20, F.S. 1941, F.S.A., be made for her and prayed that such allowance be made. After due notice, hearing was had thereon and, at said hearing, the County Judge entered order directing the Administrator to pay the widow $100.00 on January 1, 1947, and a like amount on the same day of each month thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>with the provision that not more than $1200.00 should be paid the widow under said order. The Administrator paid the widow eight monthly payments of $100.00 each pursuant to said order.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Mary L. Gilbert filed in said County Judge\u2019s Court her election to take dower in the estate of her husband, Z. R. Gilbert, deceased; thereafter the widow\u2019s petition for assignment of dower was filed, order of said County Judge\u2019s Court was entered adjudging the widow\u2019s right to dower and appointing dower commissioners, the dower commissioners qualified by taking oath, performed their duties and filed in said County Judge\u2019s Court their report showing they had allotted and set off to the widow as her dower real property having an appraised value of $10,890.00 and constituting one-third in value of the real property of said estate and personal property having an appraised value of $1183.71 and constituting one-third in value of the personal property of said estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Upon the widow\u2019s application for confirmation of the dower commissioner\u2019s report and the administrator\u2019s application to charge against the widow\u2019s dower the $800.00 previously paid the widow under the order of said County Judge\u2019s Court of December 28, 1946, referred to above, and to discontinue the monthly payments being made under said order, the said County Judge\u2019s Court entered its order confirming the dower commissioner\u2019s report as to the real property and vesting in the widow the fee simple title to said land, requiring the administrator to pay over to the widow $1464.21, as dower in personal property and mesne profits, denying the administrator\u2019s application to charge the widow\u2019s dower with the $800.00 paid her under the order of December 28, 1946, aforesaid and discontinuing further payments under said order.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The widow was given possession of said real property and $646.21 of her dower in personal property (and mesne profits) was paid over to her, the administrator, by agreement of the parties, retaining possession of the remaining $800.00 until such time as the question of who is entitled thereto is determined on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Upon appeal to the Circuit Court it was decreed that the above mentioned order be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201creversed and set aside, and the said County Judge is hereby directed to enter an order in said cause authorizing and directing the said administrator to charge the said sum of $800.00 to the said Mary L. Gilbert and to deduct said sum from the amounts payable to her for dower and mesne profits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Whereupon the judgment of the Circuit Court was brought here for review by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Since 1864 we have had statutory provisions relating to the widow\u2019s rights of quarantine and other provisions relating to personal property to be set aside to her for the benefit of the widow and her dependents. See Secs. 5497-5498, C.G.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The \u201cF. S. 1941,\u201d as did the Probate Act of 1935, failed to carry forward Sec. 5497-5498, C.G.L., but Sec. 733.20 (d) \u201cF.S. 1941,\u201d as amended in 1945, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201c733.20 Order of payment of expenses of administration and claims against the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201c (d) Class four. If necessary for support, a family allowance of one year\u2019s support for the widow or minor children of said decedent, or both, in addition to the homestead and exempt personal property. Upon petition of the widow, if any, or of the legal guardian or of the person having the care and custody of a minor child or children, upon notice to the personal representative, a reasonable allowance shall be fixed by the county judge in personal property or money, or both, for the support of said widow and minor children, considering the needs of the family and the value of the estate. Said allowance or the portion thereof payable in money shall be payable in equal periodic payments to be fixed by the county judge and shall be payable to the widow, if any, for the support of herself and the minor child or children, if any. If there is no widow, then the same shall be payable to the legal guardian or to the person having the care and custody of any minor child or children. Upon the petition of any person interested in the estate, the county judge may increase, decrease, discontinue or modify the allowance; but in no event shall such allowance exceed the sum or value of twelve hundred dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>And in 1945 it was also provided by law that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">\u201cThe widow of an intestate shall be entitled to receive and retain all wearing apparel and such household goods and farming utensils, provisions and clothing as may be necessary for her maintenance and that of the family, to be set apart by the county judge either upon her petition or upon the petition of the personal representative, with citation or notice to the other, special regard being had for the ability of the widow and children to provide for and maintain themselves. Such articles shall not be considered as part of the widow\u2019s dower or inheritance in any case. As amended, Laws 1945, c. 22783, Sec. 1.\u201d \u2014 Sec. 731.36, F.S.A. 1941, F.S.A. (Supp.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The foregoing statutes were an outgrowth of and based' upon the same reason as was the widow\u2019s right of quarantine at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Woerner states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\"><em>\u201cQuarantine of Dower. </em>Under the provisions of Magna Charta, a widow \u2018shall tarry in the chief house of her husband by forty days after the death of her husband, within which days her dower shall be assigned to her ... And she shall have in the meantime her reasonable estovers of the common.\u2019 Lord Coke interprets this language to mean that dower shall be speedily assigned, \u2018to the end the widow might not be without livelihpod;\u2019 and that estovers' signifies \u2018sustenance, or aliment, or nourishment; . . . that is, things that concern the nourishment or maintenance of man in <em>victu et </em>vestitu, wherein is contained meat, drink, garments, and habitation.\u2019 Lord Coke says that it was certainly the law of England before the Conquest, that the woman should continue a whole year in her husband\u2019s house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Woerner states, in reference to the provisions for alimony for the family of a deceased husband, that it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201c ... is the right of the surviving members of his family to the necessary means of subsistence, raiment, and shelter during the period immediately succeeding his death, which the law enforces not only against any inconsistent testamentary disposition, but equally against creditors, heirs, and distributees, whose rights, like those of legatees, are controlled by and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>postponed to the provisions made for the surviving family in this respect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">That:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cThey owe their existence to a humane and benevolent consideration of the distress and helplessness of widows and orphans newly bereft of their protector and supporter, and to a wise public policy, recognizing the true relation of the State to the family as its organic, constituent element. \u2018By the enactment of such laws,\u2019 says BATCH, J. of the Supreme Court of Utah, \u2018the legislature, under a wise public policy, seeks to guard and protect the family which constitutes the foundation of the State itself, during the trying period of affliction and ' need caused by the death of the one who directed the family affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">That:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201cThese provisions for the protection of the family constitute no gift to the widow to repair any seeming injustice in the Statute of Distribution or the will of her husband, but are intended to furnish to her and her minor children the means of temporary maintenance out of the estate of the deceased husband until their interest therein can be sent out to them, not only protecting so much against the claims of creditors, but also against the heirs, or distributees, legatees, and personal representatives. . . . The beneficiaries are \u2018entitled to an allowance as a matter of right, on grounds of public policy.\u2019 These allowances do not come to the widow or family by inheritance through the deceased\u2019s estate but from the law through the order of court. Neither do they form part of the widow\u2019s distributive share as next of kin, unless so expressed by the statute.\u201d \u2014 Sec. 77 \u2014 Woerner\u2019s \u201cThe American Law of Administration (Including Wills)- \u2014 p. 234-5-6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">\u201cNature of Allowance.- \u2014 The widow\u2019s allowance is sometimes treated as a debt of the deceased and is usually accorded a preference over certain other claims against the estate. The \u2022view has also been taken that the allowance to the widow is one of the expenses of the administration rather than an interest in the estate of her deceased husband. It is not, strictly speaking, under homestead or exemption laws. With some ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ceptions, it has been generally held that where there is provision for only one form of allowance for the widow, this will not be deducted from her distributive share of her husband\u2019s estate, and where there are several different forms of allowance, at least one of these (though often several, or all of them) will not be deducted from the widow\u2019s distributive share of the estate. It has also been held that the right to an allowance may be accorded to the widow in addition to her right of dower.\u201d \u2014 21 Am. Jur. 560-61 \u2014 Ex. &amp; Adm. \u2014 Sec. 315, citing an annotation in 98 A.L.R. 1325.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">\u201cOut of What Property Allowance Made. \u2014 The allowance to a decedent\u2019s widow or family is normally payable out of the assets of his estate and is usually made from the personal property of the estate.\u201d \u2014 (lb.)\u2014Sec. 320 \u2014 p. 563.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201cA widow\u2019s statutory right of quarantine, which is, in some jurisdictions, an incident of dower and existent only until dower is assigned, expires when her right to have dower assigned is lost by lapse of time.\u201d \u2014 (lb.)\u2014Sec. 321 \u2014 p. 564.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Under the law the widow is entitled to dower in her deceased husband\u2019s estate and is also entitled to such alimony or allowance from the estate as may be awarded by order of court. The question is: What effect will the \u201ccarry over\u201d award have on the award of her dower ?</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Neither the County Judge nor the Circuit Court ruled, nor is it contended on this appeal, that the widow was entitled to an allowance after the award of her dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The purpose of the statutory provisions was to provide for the widow and dependents during the emergency and until they might receive their share of the estate, and the statute has very wisely provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">\u201cUpon the petition of any person interested in the estate, the county judge may increase, decrease, discontinue or modify the allowance; but in no event shall such allowance exceed the sum or value of twelve hundred dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The widow was entitled to a dower interest of one-third of the personal property of her husband\u2019s estate and also, when allowed by order of court, a \u201ccarry-over\u201d allowance. Both are statutory allowances. It was not the intent of the law that same be an advancement against her dower, neither was it the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>intent of the law that this burden be borne entirely by those receiving the remainder of the estate. Any allowances pursuant to Section 733.20, supra, were independent of dower. After payment of such alimony allowances they should be deducted from the corpus out of which her dower is due and the dower calculated, using the remainder after the deduction as. a basis. When the personal estate has been depleted by the widow\u2019s applying for and receiving a portion of the estate, under Section 733.20, supra, she will be estopped to complain that the dower is calculated after deduction of such payments to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">It does not appear that the County Judge did err by his judgment, and the Circuit Court judgment appealed from be and it is reversed, with directions that judgment of the County Judge be revised so that dower will be computed on. the net estate after the deduction of the amount allowed for quarantine money.</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-5\">THOMAS, C.
