The appellants contend that the evidence clearly shows that the deceased\u2019s domicile was in Manatee County, Florida, on said date, while the appellee contends that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u25a0unequivocally established his domicile in Hillsborough County, Florida, on the date of his death. The County Judge\u2019s Court of Hillsborough County, Florida, heard evidence on the issue and held that Lorenzo was domiciled in Hillsborough County on May 9, 1947, and on appeal the Circuit Court affirmed the ruling of the County Judge\u2019s Court. The case is here on appeal from the order of affirmance entered by the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">On appeal here in this class of litigation, it is our duty to examine the evidence and all exhibits and determine if there is substantial competent evidence to support the findings of the Probate Court and that he did not misinterpret the legal effect of the evidence as a whole. If as a result of the examination it is found that there is no substantial competent evidence to support the findings of the Probate Judge and that he misconstrued the evidence taken as a whole, then the findings of the Probate Court must be reversed, otherwise affirmed.

Nelson, ...... Fla. ......, opinion filed April 30, 1948, not yet reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">We have carefully studied the record certified to this Court; the briefs have been read; the cited authorities have been examined; oral arguments have been heard at the bar of this Court, and we find that the appellants have failed to establish error as required by our adjudications, therefore it is our duty to affirm the order of the Circuit challenged on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b569-9\">THOMAS, C.
