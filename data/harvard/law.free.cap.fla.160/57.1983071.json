(a) The Supreme Court may hear, consider and determine cases and exercise all its powers and jurisdiction as a single body in which case a majority of the members of the Court shall constitute a quorum for the dispatch of business; or it may exercise its powers and jurisdiction in divisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">\u201c(b) ... A division shall consist of three members of said court exclusive of the Chief Justice, and the judgment of a division concurred in by the Chief Justice shall be the judgment of the Court unless such case involves . . . the determination of a State or Federal constitutional question wherein shall be brought into controversy the constitutionality of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Federal or State statute, rule, regulation or municipal ordinance . . . whereupon it shall require the consideration of two divisions and the Chief Justice.\u201d\u2014 (Article 5, Florida Constitution) .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Section 4 (b) of Article 5 places a limitation on a division\u2019s considering some constitutional questions but leaves it within the power of a division to consider other constitutional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The Constitution provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u201cThe judgment of a division concurred in by the Chief Justice shall be the judgment of the court unless such case involves the determination of a State or Federal question wherein shall be brought into controversy the constitutionality of a Federal or State statute, rule, regulation or municipal ordinance, whereupon it shall require the consideration of two divisions <em>and the Chief Justice.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The language of the Constitution dealing with a \u201cconstitutional question\u201d wherein the constitutionality of a Federal or State statute, rule, regulation or municipal ordinance \u201chas been brought into controversy\u201d was prompted by the Federal Act conferring appellate jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court of the United States, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u201cA final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit could be had . . . where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any State, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treatises, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court upon a writ of error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">28 U.S.C.A., Sec. 344 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Under our Constitution the appellate \u201ccase\u201d presenting the \u2022 question of the constitutionality of a statute, rule, etc., does not depend upon a \u201cdecision in favor of its validity\u201d in the lower court. It provides in effect that when the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>aggrieved by a holding in <em>favor of or against </em>the validity of such statute, rule, etc., procures its review by the Supreme Court, then such constitutional question \u201cbrought into controversy\u201d by the assignments of error on appeal cannot be reviewed by a \u201cdivision\u201d alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Ordinarily the \u201ccase\u201d made on appeal in order to \u201cinvolve the determination of a constitutional question\u201d wherein \u201cthe constitutionality of a statute, rule, etc.,\u201d is \u201cbrought into controversy\u201d must depend upon the lower court\u2019s holding such statute, rule, etc., either valid or invalid and the party adversely affected <em>must </em>have an assignment of error invoking the review of such ruling in order that it may be \u201cbrought into controversy\u201d on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><em>Constitutional questions </em>\u2014 by <em>\u201cdivision\u201d </em>\u2014 when.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">It will be noted that this section of the Constitution leaves open for consideration by a division any question for the <em>construction and interpretation </em>of any clause of the Constitution, as well as of a statute, rule, regulation or municipal ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">When the case involves the constitutionality of the statute, rule, regulation or ordinance and also questions independent of such constitutionality, and the decision of the lower court is not shown to have been adverse to the constitutionality of the statute, rule, regulation or ordinance, then there arises the question of whether or not the case on appeal involves the constitutionality of such statute, rule, regulation or ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Under such circumstances the Court will be confronted with difficulties similar to those experienced by the United States Supreme Court when the decision of the lower court rests upon both a Federal and a non-Federal question. (See Am. Jur., U. S. Court\u2019s Sec. 171.5, p. 802).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The Chancellor, in making his ruling herein, specifically held the ordinance \u201cvoid\u201d and appellant assigned as error that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">\u201cThe Court erred, to the damage and prejudice of the plaintiffs, and each of them, by the order appealed from, in holding that section 6 of ordinance numbered 497 of the City of Miami Beach is unreasonable and void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Section 4(a) supra of our Constitution provides that the Supreme Court may \u201cexercise its powers and jurisdiction\u201d as a \u201csingle body,\u201d in which event a majority of four may constitute a quorum or it may \u201cexercise its powers and jurisdiction in divisions\u201d and the \u201cjudgment of a division concurred in by the Chief Justice shall be the judgment of the court,\u201d unless the appellate case involves the constitutionality of an ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Since the equity of the bill does not depend upon the validity of the ordinance and inasmuch as the case as submitted has had the consideration of four members of this Court who have all concurred and the merits of the appeal have been fully considered by all of them, which would satisfy the ex-actions of the Constitution in the form and substance if the hearing had been in the name of and as a single body, the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-6\">THOMAS, C. J., TERRELL, CHAPMAN, ADAMS and SEBRING, JJ\u201e concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b105-12\"> (The Chief Justice is spoken of as a unit and a division is likewise spoken of as a unit. This was necessary because of the provision that a division should consist of three members exclusive of the Chief Justice. The Constitution excluded the Chief Justice from a \u201cdivision,\u201d therefore he had to be added in order to exact his consideration).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
