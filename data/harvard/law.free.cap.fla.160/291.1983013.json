The only material allegations of the bill are that appellee has spent $11,000 in the purchase and improvement of his place of business; that he was a holder of a license to sell beer and that the Director-apellant gave him notice of revocation of his beer license upon specific charges; that pursuant thereto a hearing was had before the Director and the Director revoked the license \u201cwithout any basis in fact or in law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-16\">A suit in equity cannot be used for the purpose of procuring a review of the proceedings of a board, commission or commissioner. Common law certiorari is the appropriate method of judicial review of such proceedings when there is no prescribed method. See State Beverage Department v. Willis, 32 So. (2nd) 580, and other authorities therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The bill is without equity, and the decree appealed is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b338-4\">THOMAS, C.
