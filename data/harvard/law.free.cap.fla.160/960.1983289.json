It thus appears that the election was so irregularly conducted as to justify the City Council to order the call of another election. The time for such election as prescribed by the statute has passed, but time was not of the essence of the act. The law was directory as to \u201ctime\u201d for holding the election. However, a properly conducted election is of the essence, and the failure to properly conduct an election within the prescribed time will not be allowed to defeat the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>The judgment appealed is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1008-4\">THOMAS, C.
