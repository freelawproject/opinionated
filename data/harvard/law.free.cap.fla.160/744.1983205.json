The law simply prescribes a longer sentence for a second or subsequent offense </em>for the reason that the prior convictions taken in accordance with the subsequent offense demonstrates the incorrigible and dangerous character of accused thereby establishing the necessity for enhanced restraint. Bishop, Crim. Law (9th Ed.) Sec. 993a. The imposition of such enhanced punishment is not a prosecution of or punishment for the former conviction. The Constitution forbids such action. <em>The enhanced punishment is an incident to the last offense alone. </em>But for that offense it would not be imposed. . . . \u201d \u2014 Cross v. State, 96 Fla. 768, 119 So. 380.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">This holding appears to comport with the general law on the subject, for in American Jurisprudence it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">\u201cThe charge of being a second or subsequent offender does not involve accusation of a crime other than, or separate from, the offense principally charged. <em>The statutes do not create a separate offense. </em>The increased penalty for a second or subsequent conviction is intended to be held up as a warning to first offenders and to act as a deterrent to their criminal tendencies.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). \u2014 25 Am Jur. 260 \u2014 \u201cHabitual Criminals\u201d \u2014 Sec. 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>We also quote from 25 American Jurisprudence 263, \u201cHabitual Criminals,\u201d Section 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">\u201cThe enhanced punishment under such statutes is an incident of the subsequent offense only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The following quotation from 24 Corpus Juris Secundum 1143, \u201cCriminal Law,\u201d Section 1958 (a part of Chapter 19, entitled \u201cSuccessive Offenses and Habitual Criminals\u201d) is also in point, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">\u201cHowever, <em>statutes authorising a more severe penalty to be inflicted on one who is a persistent offender do not create an offense, </em>nor inflict additional punishment for the prior offense, nor do they authorize a conviction on a charge of being an habitual criminal; <em>they merely prescribe punishment for the subsequent offense which is to be more severe, </em>because the offender\u2019s persistence in the perpetration of crime evinces a depravity which merits greater punishment.\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">The Attorney General submits that the governing statute, Section 775.11, specifically provides for the filing of the information charging the two convictions <em>\u201cAT ANY TIME after sentence or conviction </em>for the second felony. We quote from Section 775.11, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\"><em>\u201cIf AT ANY TIME after sentence or conviction </em>it appear that a person convicted of a felony has previously been convicted of crimes as set forth either in Section 775.09 or Section 775.10 the prosecuting attorney of the county in which such conviction was had, shall file an information accusing said person of such previous convictions ...\u201d (Capitalization and underscoring ours).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Stated generally, the power of the Court to modify sentences is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">\u201cPower of court. \u2014 It seems to have been recognized as one of the earliest doctrines of the common law that the record of a court may be changed or amended at any time during the same term of the court in which' a judgment is rendered. That this power has been often exercised by the Courts in England is manifest from cases in which it appears that judgments and sentences, during the same term in which they have been entered, have been vacated and others substituted without doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>or question. This rule of the common law is substantially in force at the present time in this country, so that during the same term of court at which a sentence is imposed and before the defendant has begun serving such sentence, the trial judge may modify it either in form or substance.\u201d \u2014 15 Am. Jur. 128 \u2014\u201cCriminal Law\u201d \u2014 Sec. 473.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-4\">\u201cIt seems to be well established that a trial court is with-, out power to set aside a sentence after the defendant has been committed thereunder and impose a new or different sentence increasing the punishment, even at the same term at which the original sentence was imposed. A judgment which attempts to do so is void, and the original judgment remains in force.\u201d \u2014 15 Am. Jur. 130 \u2014 \u201cCriminal Law\u201d \u2014 Sec. 474.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Doubtless the purpose of the use of the language \u201cat any time,\u201d etc., was to overcome the limitations of the general law on the court as to term time and the limitation imposed in the event that execution of the sentence has commenced and the trial court had otherwise lost jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The appellee, instead of commencing proceedings in the trial court because of an improper sentence against him as an alleged fourth offender, instituted habeas corpus proceedings in the jurisdiction of his confinement and an appropriate judgment in the habeas corpus case would have been that petitioner be remanded to the trial court for the entry of a proper sentence. However, promptly upon the entry of the judgment on habeas corpus, proceedings were had in the trial court which imposed the original sentence for the entry of a sentence against the appellee as a second offender; resulting in the judgment now on review by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Whether or not in this jurisdiction there is any limitation of time on the Court\u2019s power to impose a sentence as provided by Section 775.09, supra, it is our conclusion that under the facts and circumstances it has not expired in this instance. It does appear, however, that whatever sentence is to be imposed should be nunc pro tunc, as of and for the date of October 30, 1939, and that the appellee-defendant should have credit for time served since then, as an execution thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to \u25a0quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>The order appealed is:</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b795-6\">THOMAS, C.

It is my view, however, that under section 775.09 and 775.11, Florida Statutes, 1941, F.S.A., a person may be proceeded against as a second offender without regard to whether he has or has not served the sentence imposed under the judgment of conviction for the second offense upon which the charge as a second offender under the statute is predicated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b795-11\">THOMAS, C.
