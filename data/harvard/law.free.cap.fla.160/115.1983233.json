We have given all the testimony appearing in the transcript careful consideration ; the briefs filed in the cause have been read, and the authorities cited examined. It is our view, and we so hold, that we are not justified, as a matter of law, in interfering with the decree appealed from and accordingly the same is affirmed. See Travis v. Travis, 81 Fla. 309, 87 So. 762; Webb v. Webb, 145 Fla. 267, 199 So. 343; Windham v. Windham, 152 Fla. 362, 11 So. (2nd) 797.</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-12\">THOMAS, C.
