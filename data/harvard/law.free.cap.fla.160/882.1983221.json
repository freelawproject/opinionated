A portion of the latter amount was for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in taking depositions on behalf of defendant. Appellant moved to quash that part of the execution relating to attorneys\u2019 fees. His motion was overruled and this appeal was prosecuted. &gt; The items to which the motion to quash was directed were, (1) $35.00 awarded Allaben &amp; Wiarda, Attorneys of Grand Rapids, Mich., for representing plaintiff in the taking of depositions, (2) $50.00 awarded a Mr. Chase, Attorney of California for a similar purpose and (3) $50.00 awarded Gay &amp; Behrens, New York Attorneys for a like purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">The point for determination is whether or not attorneys\u2019 fees for the taking of depositions to be used as evidence in a case may be taxed as costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">This court is committed to the doctrine that attorneys\u2019 fees cannot be taxed as costs in any cause unless provided for by contract, agreement or by terms of the statute. Webb v. Scott, 129 Fla. 111, 176 So. 442; State v. Barrs, 87 Fla. 168, 99 So. 668. No express provision of statute and no contract is shown to support the amounts allowed as attorneys\u2019 fees here.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">It is also contended that the item of $13.00 expended in taking the deposition of J. A. Fite in behalf of appellees should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>be rejected because it was not placed in evidence at the trial and was never made a part of the record. In our view the position of appellant on these points is well taken and finds ample support in the cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The judgment appealed from is accordingly reversed as to the items complained of. In all other respects it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Reversed in part, affirmed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b930-6\">THOMAS, C. J., CHAPMAN and SEBRING, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
