The wife answered by charging, .in substance, the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The cause was referred to a special master who found the husband\u2019s charges proven; the wife\u2019s without proof and recommended a divorce for the husband. He also found that while the parties were previously residents of New York a decree in favor of the wife had been entered from bed and board and as to that decree the husband was in default several hundred dollars. Accordingly the master recommended the payment of $25.00 per week alimony until the further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The chancellor was of the opinion that the husband\u2019s own wrongful conduct induced the wife\u2019s misbehavior. He Overruled the master\u2019s recommendation and denied relief to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We are confronted with a situation where the master, who saw and heard the witnesses, came to one conclusion and the chancellor reached another. We have most carefully considered the entire record and we are unable to find reasonable justification in the chancellor\u2019s conclusion to reject the master\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The decree is therefore reversed with directions to enter a decree not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b581-9\">TERRELL, CHAPMAN and BARNS, JJ., and WISE-HEART, Associate Justice, concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b581-10\">THOMAS and SEBRING, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
