It is not contended that the city was without power to make the assessments challenged here, but that the arbitrary manner 'in which the power was exercised, coupled with the irregularities or procedural defects or the failure and neglect of the ofici\u00e1is of the city to observe or conform to the plain requirements of the applicable law, necessitates a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">It is not disputed that the appellant by the dismissal order is required to pay assessments on lands which appear by him to have been dedicated to the use of the public. As to the lands so dedicated by the appellant the value of the assessments on the dedicated portions should be calculated and the amount determined and deducted from the total amount of the taxes found to be due.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The order of dismissal appealed from is so modified as to authorize a calculation as above stated and a credit allowed therefor. Each of the parties shall pay one-half of the costs of this appeal. The order of dismissal is modified as above set out and stands affirmed as modified.</p>\n<judges id=\"b709-8\">THOMAS, C.
