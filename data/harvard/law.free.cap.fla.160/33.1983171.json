If it is one final in nature and wherein time has commenced to run, whereby the trial court will lose jurisdiction to further consider or reconsider, then for purposes of appeal or writ of error it is a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Of course an order that the demurrer be sustained, that a non-suit be granted, or that defendant have judgment, is insufficient; in these instances more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The limitations for taking an appeal or writ of error are with the object that the successful party will know when his litigation has ended and, also, that it be ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In Cook v. Cook, 18 Fla. 634, the plaintiff\u2019s case was dismissed by the Clerk for his failure to file a declaration, and the trial judge denied a motion of plaintiff to set aside judgment of dismissal, and it was held that same constituted a final judgment of dismissal, and it was held that same constituted a final judgment to support a writ of error to a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">A judgment <em>non prosequitur </em>that \u201cplaintiff take nothing\u201d and \u201csuit stand dismissed\u201d held to support writ of error to final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Hewitt v. International Shoe Co., 110 Fla. 37, 148 So. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">A non-suit without an order of dismissal is not sufficient to support a writ of error to a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Goldring v. Reid, 60 Fla. 78, 53 So. 503.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">\u201cWhere in a suit at law it is determined by the Judge of the Circuit Court in which the case has been instituted that such Court is without jurisdiction to proceed therein, and that the cause should therefore be dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s costs, and an order of dismissal is accordingly entered, dismissing the suit at law solely because of the Circuit Court\u2019s finding of its own lack of jurisdiction and for no other cause, such an order being final in its nature, may submit a writ of error. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF\">State ex rel., George P. Garrett v. John B. Johnson, Circuit Judge, 112 Fla. 112, 113, 150 So. 239, 151 So. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Jurisdiction in the Supreme Court may attach only after a judgment final in its nature has been entered by the trial court and after time has commenced to run when the trial court will not longer have power to exercise its jurisdiction over the subject matter of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">When the judgment appealed is a judgment on demurrer to a declaration as is final in its nature and is such as to end the pendency of the case in the trial court as between the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>pellant and the appellee, then it is such a final judgment as is appealable. The rule stated in Ropes v. Lansing (1903), 46 Fla. 231, 35 So. 863, does not apply because therein there was no final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The judgment appealed as between the parties to the appeal is a final judgment ending the pendency of the case in the trial court as between the parties to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-6\">THOMAS, C.
