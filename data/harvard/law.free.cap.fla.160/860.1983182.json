Said $2,500.00 in bonds in possession of plaintiff, having been purchased with the money of plaintiff, is his separate property and should be retained by him as an offset pro tanto of government bonds and cash squandered by defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">The Chancellor by his final decree recited that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-15\">\u201c(4) The report of the Special Master in Chancery, John C. Gramling, is accepted, approved, ratified and confirmed, except as to the portion of the same which is overruled in this decree\u201d \u2014 and did thereupon \u201cdecree\u201d among other things that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP8x\">\u201c(2) the report of the special master in Chancery, John C. Gramling, is accepted, approved, ratified and confirmed,, except as the same is overruled and departed from herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>It appears from such decree that the Chancellor made no order and intended to make none, disturbing Dr. Brunner\u2019s possession of the $2500.00 in U. S. Bonds. He had them when the suit started and the Chancellor did nothing to interfere with his possession of what he claimed his money paid for. To change his legal status in respect thereto a specific decree was essential. The decree being silent on the point, the master\u2019s report with respect to the disposition to be made of the bonds was \u201coverruled and departed from\u201d in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The Chancellor\u2019s final decree was appealed by the wife and was affirmed except as to an enlargement of alimony. See Brunner v. Brunner 159 Fla. 762, 32 So. (2nd) 736. This act of enlargement of alimony was not made conclusive for all time but prompted by equitable consideration of the transitional shift in the affairs of her life then transpiring by reason of the divorce decree.</p>\n<judges id=\"b907-7\">TERRELL, CHAPMAN, ADAMS, BARNS, SEBRING and HOBSON, JJ. concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b907-8\">THOMAS, C.
