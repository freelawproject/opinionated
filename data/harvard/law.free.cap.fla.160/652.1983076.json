See Heath v. Heath, 103 Fla. 1071, 138 So. 796; McMillan v. McMillan, 120 Fla. 209, 162 So. 524. It is also our conclusion that with respect to certain property purchased entirely with the husband\u2019s funds and placed in the joint names of both husband and wife, the presumption of a gift to the wife has been overcome by conclusive evidence within the purview of Kollar v. Kollar, 155 Fla. 705, 21 So. (2nd) 356, and that accordingly the case, on this point, is ruled by Hargett v. Hargett, 156 Fla. 730, 24 So.
