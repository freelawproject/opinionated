The bill seeks the foreclosure of a purchase money mortgage executed by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">It is important for petitions for certiorari to show with particularity the harmful error. If the matters supporting the charge of error are too lengthy to be copied into the petition in haec verba, then they should be plead according to their tenor and effect with appropriate page references to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The petitioners\u2019 answer to the Bill as contained in Paragraphs 1 to 10 goes to a traverse of bill and no wise attempts to set up any facts in the nature of an avoidance, nor does the \u201canswer\u201d (in form) attempt to set up any facts relating to a superior right in the defendants over the rights of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Within the \u201canswer\u201d is contained a claim in the \u201cform\u201d of a counterclaim, the substance of which goes directly to the avoidance vel non of plaintiff\u2019s bill. The chancellor sustained the plaintiff\u2019s-appellee\u2019s motion to strike this \u201ccounterclaim,\u201d of which review is likewise sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>From 1915 until the adoption of the \u201c1931 Chancery Act (Ch. 63, F.S.A.) a motion to strike was permitted as a means of testing the sufficiency of an answer presenting an affirmative defense or counter-claim, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201cIf an answer set up by an affirmative defense, set off or counterclaim, the plaintiff may, upon five days\u2019 notice, or such further time as the court may allow, test the sufficiency of the same by motion to strike out.

Commercial Credit Holding Company (1932), 104 Fla. 595, 140 So. 470 (per Justice TERRELL).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">But we now have <em>no </em>such practice, and our statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">\u201cThe defendant in his answer shall in short and simple terms set out his defenses to each claim asserted by the bill, . . .

The test is not whether the answer states a defense but whether the matter is relevant or material :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">\u201cIf the matter contained in an answer in an equity cause is relevant, or can have any influence in the decision of the subject matter of the controversy, it is not impertinent.\u201d\u2014 Trustees of Internal Improvement Fund v.

In striking same, we conclude the chancellor erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\n<em>Re: Striking counterclaim:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The defendants, after having stated their defense to the Bill by \u201cAnswer\u201d presented further pleadings in the \u201cform\u201d of a <em>counterclaim.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The matters contained in this pleading hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ing the \u201cform\u201d of a counterclaim are in substance matters responsive to the Bill in the nature of an avoidance which might properly have been set forth in the Answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The chancellor struck a part of defendants\u2019 answer denominated as a \u201ccounterclaim\u201d wherein defendants admit the execution by the defendants, Schupler and wife, of the purchase money mortgage and notes plead by the bill of foreclosure (in which transaction the husband, Schupler, acquired title) and pleads that such, as a contract, was of no binding force and effect on the wife except as a release of dower;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Joseph Schupler lost his title by a tax foreclosure by Palm Beach County, pursuant to Ch. 194, F.S. 1941, F.S.A.;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the wife, out of \u201cher separate estate\u201d purchased the property from the county and thereby acquired a title free and clear of all prior liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In our practice the \u201cmotion to strike\u201d parts of an answer is a substitute for an \u201cexception.\u201d See Sec. 63.23, F.S.A., supra. It should not be treated as a demurrer because under the former practice, as well as under the present practice, a demurrer to answer was a thing unknown to chancery practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u201cObjections to affirmative defense. Exceptions to the answer do not perform the office of a demurrer in presenting the question whether the facts averred in the answer constitute a defense to the case made in the bill; and as it is not permissible to file a demurrer to an answer, if it is desired to submit the case on the questions of law arising on the answer, the only method is by setting down the case for hearing on bill and answer. If the defense is not good, the proof of it will be of no avail, and the complainant will have the full benefit of his objections at the hearing.\u201d- \u2014 -Fletcher\u2019s \u201cEquity Pleading and Practice,\u201d p. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Two-fold Nature of Answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201cAn answer in cases where relief is sought, properly consists of two parts, and serves a double purpose; First, that of answering the case as made by the bill; and, secondly, that of stating to the court the nature of the defense on which the defendant means to rely.\u201d \u2014 Fletcher\u2019s \u201cEquity Pleading and Practice,\u201d p.' 318.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">It appears very evident that the pleader has confused defensive matters in avoidance with counterclaim, when, in fact, the distinction is great.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Upon motion of plaintiff, the court struck the counterclaim. Our statute for testing the sufficiency of a counterclaim provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">\u201c ... if an answer asserts a counterclaim and prays affirmative relief any cross-defendant may, upon due notice, test the sufficiency of the same by motion to dismiss the counterclaim. If found insufficient but amendable the court may allow an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>amendment upon terms, or dismiss the counterclaim.\u201d \u2014 Sec. 63.41, F.S.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">\u201cMotions to strike have long been recognized as one means of attacking pleadings for frivolity and impertinence and for palpable and serious defects in form. . . . \u201d \u2014 Kooman\u2019s \u201cFlorida Chancery Pleading and Practice,\u201d p. 250.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">\u201c . . . But a pleading in proper form should not ordinarily be stricken for insufficiency.

A bill or counterclaim in proper form duly filed should not be stricken for insufficiency. Its sufficiency as a pleading should be tested by motion to dismiss. The summary disposition of pleadings by motion to strike is the exercise of a necessary but delicate power which should be cautiously applied. A motion to dismiss goes to the bill or counterclaim as an entirety for insufficiency, while a motion to strike is applicable to such pleadings where the whole or any part thereof is wholly irrelevant or for any reason improper. ... \u201d \u2014 Kooman\u2019s \u201cFlorida Chancery Pleading and Practice,\u201d p. 253.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">In equity, maxims governing the action of the chancellor are that \"a court of equity ought to do justice completely, and not by halves\u201d and that \u201cequity will not enter a partial or incomplete decree.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">\u201cThe rule is that equity will not enter a partial or incomplete decree. Having taken cognizance of a cause for any purpose, a court of equity will ordinarily retain jurisdiction for all purposes, decided all issues which are involved by the subject matter of the dispute betwe\u00e9n the litigants; award relief which is complete and finally disposes of the litigation ...\u201d \u201419 Am. Jur., Equity, Sec. 127, pp. 126-127. See also key number series on Equity Key No. 39.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u201cIt is a settled principle of equity that once it takes jurisdiction it will retain the same for all purposes to give full, complete and adequate relief as between all parties touching the subject matter involved therein. The powers of a court of equity are and should be coextensive with the rights of the parties in the subject matter involved.\u201d \u2014 Deggs v. First State Bank of Eustis, et al., 145 Fla. 438, 441, 199 So. 564. (Per Justice ADAMS).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In order that equity might do complete justice, defenses should be fully stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u201cBesides answering the case made by the bill, the defendant must state in his answer all the circumstances of which he intends to avail himself by way of defense; for he is bound to apprise the complainant by his answer of the nature of the case he intends to set up, and he cannot avail himself of any matter which is not stated in his answer, even though it should appear in his evidence. A complainant has a right to be informed by the-answer, not only of all the facts to be proved, but of the use to be made of them, and of the nature of the conclusions intended to be drawn from them.\u201d \u2014 Fletcher\u2019s \u201cEquity Pleading and Practice,\u201d p. 323.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">\u201cIn deciding whether matters objected to are pertinent or not, all substantial doubts are to be resolved in favor of their pertinency, and nothing should be expunged which the defendant has a right to prove, and which, if proved, can have any influence either in deciding whether the complainant is entitled to any relief to which he may be entitled, even down to the question whether he shall have relief with or without costs.\u201d \u2014 Fletcher\u2019s \u201cEquity pleading and Practice.\u201d p. 344.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">When Cross-Bill (or Counterclaim) improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">\u201cWhere the matters of the cross-bill are equally available as against the complainant by an answer to the original bill a cross-bill is unnecessary. Sanderson\u2019s Adm\u2019rs. v. Sanderson, 17 Fla. 820, 834; 16 Cyc. 327.\u201d \u2014 Herrin v. Abbe, 55 Fla. 769, 772, 46 So. 183.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">\u201cThis is subject matter of defense to the original suit, and not the proper subject for a cross-bill. 14 Ga. 167; 20 Ga. 472; 3 Sand. Chy. 273; 34 Ala. 15.\u201d \u2014 Sanderson\u2019s Adm\u2019rs. v. Sanderson, 17 Fla. 820, 834.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Our statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">\u201cThe defendant in his answer shall in short and simple terms set out his defenses to each claim asserted by the bill____Sec. 63.34, F.S., 1941, F.S.A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">At one time it was necessary to file cross-bill or counterclaims in order to present affirmative defenses, but, as the courts and statutes became more liberal in allowing all defenses to be presented by \u201canswer,\u201d they naturally became more strict in allowing cross-bills or counterclaims. It is evident that it is a better public policy to have two pleadings than four, on the same controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Taylor v. Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation, 141 Fla. 703, 193 So. 758, seems to have been given some consideration as applicable. That case as presented to this Court was on appeal of a decree granting a writ of assistance to the mortgagee-purchaser at foreclosure sale upon a hearing upon a rule to show cause, and the defendant\u2019s answer. It was an adjudication of the equities after the procedural process leading to the hearing had been completed. The respondent made her \u201canswer\u201d setting forth her claim in respect to plaintiff\u2019s claim. No motion to strike the answer was involved there, as it is here.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In the case at bar, the stricken pleadings of the defendant appear to allege the only title on which plaintiff, if he be successful, can impose his mortgage lien, and these same stricken pleadings allege as a predicate for their establishment by evidence the title and claim which the defendant\u2019s wife has as against the plaintiff\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The questions before the chancellor and before this Court are of necessity the same. It is <em>not </em>a question of what are the equities as between the parties, for that cannot be determined on the paper pleading, viz: A \u201cmotion to strike.\u201d The ultimate equities have not been decreed. There has been no final hearing on final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Of course the substantive law will be taken into consideration in passing upon procedural matters but the procedural process is only a means of arriving at a pleading statement of the parties, in order that each may be advised of adversary claims and also to advise the chancellor. The law does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>exact that sufficiency of an answer of a defendant in equity which, if proven, would <em>require </em>a decree in favor of the defendant. This is not true as to pleas in law actions and there are no demurrers to answers in equity as to pleas in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We are not now and cannot at this time with propriety pass on the ultimate equities. The cause should be allowed to proceed on the pleadings before the chancellor for the adjudication of Mrs. Schupler\u2019s equities. After the chancellor passes on them at final hearing, as was done in the Taylor case, then we might, but not before; we must be patient and let this cause proceed as did the Taylor case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Equity regards the substance, and not the form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\u201cThe maxim, \u2018equity regards substance rather than form,\u2019 is expressed in various ways and stresses the intent or spirit of the case. \u2018A court of equity,\u201d it is said, \u2018will look to the circumstances and not to the form of the transaction.\u2019 Again: \u2018Equity looks to the substance and not the shadow, to the spirit and not the letter ... It' seeks justice rather than technicality, truth rather than evasion, common sense rather than quibbling.\u2019 And again: \u2018It has always been recognized as the right, if not always as the absolute duty, of a court clothed with the equitable jurisdiction which is here properly invoked, to apply its x-rays to all masks and covers and see through to the real substance.\u201d \u2014 19 Am. Jur., Equity, Sec. 459.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">If such is to be a guiding principle for the determination of the substantive rights of the parties, equity, moved by the same principle, might as well lend a like hand concerning procedural processes. Under the former practice, upon the overruling of a \u201cplea,\u201d the chancellor was permitted to order that such plea stand for an answer. (See Fletcher, (lb.) 313). \u201cEquity seeks to do justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Prompted by the circumstances and the maxim \u201cequity regards substance rather than form\u201d in ruling on the motion to strike the so-called counterclaim, it would have been appropriate for the chancellor to have denied the motion and to have ordered that the same stand as a part of the answer unless said defendants should within a sp\u00e9cified time file an amended counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>For the Court to have allowed the so-called counterclaim to stand as a part of the defendants\u2019 \u201canswer\u201d would not have been to adjudicate it to be a defense to the Bill of Complaint, and we do not so adjudicate it. The sufficiency of the answer as a defense may be tested by setting the cause down for a hearing on a \u201cmotion for decree on bill and answer\u201d as provided by Sec. 63.40, F.S.A., upon which hearing the allegations of the answer, according to their legal effect, will predominate and control over the allegations of the bill. See Whitaker v. Eddy, 109 Fla. 535, 147 So. 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">It was error to strike the counterclaim, and certiorari is granted and said other quashed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b129-6\">TERRELL, CHAPMAN and SEBRING, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b129-7\">THOMAS, C.
