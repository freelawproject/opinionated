The bill alleges that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>pellants are in doubt as to the true construction of the will and codicils, especially the following paragraphs of the will, dated December 7, 1943, concerning the termination of the trust, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">\u201c \u2018FIFTH (4). The trust herein created shall terminate and be determined upon the death of my beloved wife, Lola M. Townsend, or of my son, F. M. Townsend, or of my son, W. C. Townsend, or of my daughter, Elizabeth Johns, or of my daughter, Christeen Warren, or of my daughter, Winnie L. Platt, whichever shall last occur.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">\u201c \u2018SIXTH. Upon the termination of the trust, herein above created, the corpus of the trust fund, if any then remain, shall vest in and be distributed per stirpes among my lineal descendants then in being, i. e. the then surviving issue of deceased children shall take their deceased parent\u2019s share by right of representation.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 and the following paragraph in the first codicil dated April 18, 1944, -to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201c \u2018SIXTH. I ratify and confirm the devise of my said last will and testament \u201cSIXTH\u201d in all respects, except that it is my will and I direct that, upon the termination of the trust fund as herein provided, my granddaughter Viola Patterson, or the heirs of her body then surviving her, take such share as she or they would take if she were my daughter rather than my granddaughter\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u201cThe necessity that a construction be made contrary to the allegation of the petition will not require the dismissal thereof.
