Thereupon on affidavit a publication was had, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201cW. C.

On the 25th day of February, 1947, a purported decree pro confesso was entered. Thereafter, on the 26th day of March, 1946, the chancellor heard the testimony offered by the defendant below, and respondent here, and entered a judgment against the petitioner in the sum of $18,800.00, and awarded execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-17\">On January 12,1948, the petitioner here moved the chancellor to vacate and declared null and void the $18,800.00 judgment upon the ground that the suit had abated and on the ground that it does not appear by the record that the petitioner was duly notified of the hearing on the petition or had an opportunity of opposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-18\">If the notice of publication was for the purpose of original process, then the order of the chancellor was in error, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>alimony cannot be awarded upon process by publication only and, if the proceedings were based upon .the respondent\u2019s petition as a step in the cause, then in that event the notice was insufficient because it merely required the plaintiff \u201cto appear,\u201d when he had already appeared eighteen years before by the filing of his bill and, if it was intended as a notice of a hearing the notice was insufficient because it did not give the time or place of a hearing or the purpose thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The petition for certiorari is granted and the decree of the chancellor of March 26, 1947, is quashed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b678-5\">THOMAS, C.
