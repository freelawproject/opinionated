In four assignments of error, he urges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">\u201cI. The trial court\u2019s order to pay the county for the cost of his court-appointed counsel is void because the second sentence of R.C. 2941.51(D) and the sixth sentence of R.C. 120.33(A)(4) are the only authority that purport to authorize such a recoupment order and those provisions deny equal protection and due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">\u201cII. Even if the recoupment provision is not unconstitutional, the trial court abused its discretion by arbitrarily ordering repayment of appointed counsel fees by an indigent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">\u201cIII. Even if the order is a fine, the trial court had no authority to order a fine in addition to the term of incarceration imposed for a misdemeanor and the court abused its discretion by imposing the maximum ($1,000) fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">\u201cIV. Mr. Crenshaw was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by Art. I, Sect. 10 of the Ohio Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when defense counsel failed to object to the order to pay a \u2018fine\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>We find that the trial court erred by ordering appellant to pay attorney fees through the assessment of a $1,000 fine. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Appellant was arrested following a police chase by vehicle and on foot on January 19, 2000, which began when the police attempted to apprehend appellant on an arrest warrant issued by the Ohio Adult Parole Authority. An indictment was issued March 29, 2000, charging appellant with \u201coperating a motor vehicle so as to willfully elude or flee a police officer after receiving a visible or audible signal from a police officer to bring his motor vehicle to a stop.\u201d The indictment included a specification that \u201cthe operation of the motor vehicle by the offender caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Appellant was found guilty following a jury trial, although the jury found that appellant\u2019s behavior did not create a substantial risk of serious physical harm. The court immediately proceeded to sentence appellant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. The court is going to sentence you pursuant to [R.C.] 2929.11 through 14, although this is a misdemeanor, that statute really doesn\u2019t \u2014 the guidelines don\u2019t necessarily apply to a misdemeanor. It is for felony sentencing. But we\u2019ll use those guidelines nonetheless. And we find that you have shown [sic] to be a recidivist in crime; that you haven\u2019t profited from your previous convictions; that you \u2014 the evidence here was \u2014 is undisputed that, as you noted a minute ago, that you were acting in a dangerous fashion. Somebody could have been killed here. It was dangerous. And you deserve a sentence far more than I\u2019m giving you. But the statute prevents you from receiving your just deserved [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">\u201cSo you are going to serve a full six months in the county jail. He\u2019s going to serve a full six months in the county jail, six months actually spent in the county jail. Credit for time served. And it is not to be run concurrent. He\u2019s not to be released to prison until he serves his six months in the county jail. Or if the prison authorities take him beforehand, they are to return him to the county jail until \u2014 and he\u2019s to be held until six full months are spent here. No credit for good time. Six full months, 180 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">\u201cIn addition, we are going to fine you a thousand dollars, court costs, costs of the defense. We are going to give you six months when you are released from jail to pay those court costs and the fine. And instruct the clerk of courts to notify the court upon six months after your release, and if the court finds you have indeed been out \u2014 six months out of jail and haven\u2019t paid that fine and court costs, a thousand dollars plus the court costs, plus the attorney fees, and you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>haven\u2019t applied for an extension of time under extenuating circumstances or made payments in some good-faith showing, the court is going to issue a contempt warrant, which means you\u2019ll be rearrested eventually. You\u2019ll be back on the capias.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The court entered the following sentencing order on May 31, 2000:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">\u201cThe court considered all required factors of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201cIt is therefore ordered and adjudged that the defendant is sentenced to the Cuyahoga County Jail for a term of 6 months to be served apart and aside from any other sentence defendant has received before or may receive after this sentencing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">\u201cDefendant to receive jail time credit, sheriff to calculate and apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">\u201cDefendant is to pay court costs and is to pay attorney fees assessed as fine of $1,000.00 within 6 months from defendant\u2019s release from jail. * * * Clerk\u2019s Office to notify this court of non-payment within allotted time * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">\u201cDefendant advised of appeal rights. Defendant indigent. Court appoints public defender\u2019s office as appellate counsel. Transcript to be ordered at state\u2019s expense if defendant decides to appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">LAW AND ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">In keeping with the principle that we should decide constitutional questions only when necessary to resolve the case, we will address the assignments that allege nonconstitutional errors first. These assignments are dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">In the second and third assignments of error, appellant urges that the court abused its discretion by ordering him to pay attorney fees for his appointed counsel or, alternatively, by ordering him to pay a fine in addition to the sentence of imprisonment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">Appellant was convicted of a first degree misdemeanor. Under R.C. 2929.21, the maximum penalties for such an offense were a definite term of imprisonment of not more than six months or a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or both. R.C. 2929.22 sets forth the factors the trial court was required to consider in imposing sentence for a misdemeanor. R.C. 2929.22 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-16\">\u201c(A) In determining whether to impose imprisonment or a fine, or both, for a misdemeanor, and in determining the term of imprisonment and the amount and method of payment of a fine for a misdemeanor, the court shall consider the risk that the offender will commit another offense and the need for protecting the public from the risk; the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history, character, and condition of the offender and the offender\u2019s need for correctional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>or rehabilitative treatment; * * * and the ability and resources of the offender and the nature of the burden that payment of a fine will impose on the offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\u201c(E) The court shall not impose a fine in addition to imprisonment for a misdemeanor unless a fine is specially adapted to deterrence of the offense or the correction of the offender, the offense has proximately resulted in physical harm to the person or property of another, or the offense was committed for hire or for purpose of gain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">\u201c(F) The court shall not impose a fine or fines that, in the aggregate and to the extent not suspended by the court, exceed the amount that the offender is or will be able to pay by the method and within the time allowed without undue hardship to the offender or the offender\u2019s dependents, or will prevent the offender from making restitution or reparation to the victim of the offender\u2019s offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">R.C. 2941.51(D) includes a provision for the payment of appointed attorney fees by the party represented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">\u201c[I]f the person represented has, or reasonably may be expected to have, the means to meet some part of the cost of the services rendered to the person, the person shall pay the county an amount that the person reasonably can be expected to pay. * * *\u201d See, also, R.C. 120.05.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The trial court\u2019s assessment of attorney fees as a fine conflates R.C. 2929.21, 2929.22, and 2941.51 and is invalid under any of these provisions. First, R.C. 2941.51 does not authorize the assessment of attorney fees as part of a criminal defendant\u2019s sentence. Rather, the court must enter a separate civil judgment for the fees or part thereof that the court finds the defendant has the ability to pay. <em>State v. Trembly </em>(2000), 137 Ohio App.3d 134, 144, 738 N.E.2d 93, 100. Hence, a requirement that the defendant pay his court-appointed attorney fees as part of his sentence cannot be condoned under R.C. 2941.51, particularly where the court made no findings as to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">The sentence imposed in this case fell within the statutory maximum terms for a first degree misdemeanor. Generally, we must presume that a sentence that falls within statutory limits was imposed lawfully, unless the defendant-appellant comes forward with evidence to rebut the presumption. The simple fact that the court does not expressly allude to any of the statutory sentencing factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the court considered the proper criteria. See, <em>e.g., State v. Carty </em>(Nov. 2, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 77520, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>unreported, 2000 WL 1643861; <em>Strongsville v. Cheriki </em>(Mar. 4, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 73800, unreported, 1999 WL 126947. Here, however, the court\u2019s express announcement that it was assessing attorney fees as a fine demonstrates that the court failed to consider the proper statutory criteria. Cf. <em>Galion v. Martin </em>(Dec. 12, 1991), Crawford App. No. 3-91-6, unreported, 1991 WL 261835 (affirming imposition of fine while reversing assessment of court-appointed attorney fees as costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Under R.C. 2929.22, the court is prohibited from imposing a fine in addition to a term of imprisonment for a misdemeanor unless (1) the fine is specially adapted to deterrence of the offense or the correction of the offender, (2) the offense resulted in physical harm to another\u2019s person or property, or (3) the offense was committed for hire or for the purpose of gain. The only potential ground for imposing a fine in this case might be (1): neither (2) nor (3) is applicable. Because a fine for the purpose of paying court-appointed attorney fees would apply only to indigent offenders, we cannot conclude that such a fine is specially adapted to the deterrence of the offense or the correction of the offender. Therefore, the imposition of the fine in addition to a term of imprisonment was not authorized by R.C. 2929.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Other reasons support our conclusion that attorney fees for court-appointed counsel cannot be collected as a fine. First, as noted above, the recoupment of court-appointed attorney fees is a civil obligation under the statutes. The court cannot convert this into a criminal obligation (for which the defendant is subject to imprisonment if he does not comply) by the simple expedient of assessing attorney fees as a fine. <em>Galion v. Martin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Second, fines are general obligations; .unlike an order to pay costs or restitution, fines are not earmarked for a specific purpose. Thus, fines are paid into the county treasury to the credit of the general fund, R.C. 2949.11, while costs are paid to the clerk of court, and restitution is paid to the victim. With respect to the civil recoupment of court-appointed attorney fees, a portion of the fees recouped under R.C. 2941.51(D) must be paid to the State Public Defender; there is no statutory means to accomplish such a transfer of a portion of a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">For these reasons, we find that the court erred by imposing a fine for the payment of attorney fees. Accordingly, we reverse the court\u2019s judgment to the extent that it imposes a $1,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Appellant does not challenge the remainder of his sentence, which requires that he be confined in the Cuyahoga County Jail for a term of six months and pay court costs. Therefore, these portions of the judgment remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b129-11\">Diane Karpinski, A.J., and Patricia A Blackmon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-12\">. In addition, R.C. 2951.02(C) allows a court to order a defendant to pay the fees for a court-appointed attorney as a condition of probation. See <em>State v. McLean </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 392, 622 N.E.2d 402. We note that appellant was not placed on probation, so this section is inapplicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
