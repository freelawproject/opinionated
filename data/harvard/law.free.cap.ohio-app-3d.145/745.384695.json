Because the trial court erred in applying R.C. 5301.232(B), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">On September 27, 1999, plaintiffs-appellees, Marcia E. Kent and Lawrence Kent (\u201cKents\u201d)-, filed a declaratory judgment action in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. The Kents requested that the court determine the validity and priority of mortgages held by Huntington and KeyBank on the Kents\u2019 Drexel Avenue property in Bexley, Ohio. Answers, counterclaims, and cross-claims were filed by both Huntington and KeyBank.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">The case concerns two mortgages: one held by Huntington and one held by KeyBank. On September 10, 1991, the Kents granted an open-end mortgage on their Drexel Avenue property to Huntington to secure a line of credit up to $200,000. On September 24, 1991, Huntington recorded the mortgage with the county recorder\u2019s office. Approximately three years later, on October 20, 1994, the Kents granted an open-end mortgage on the same property to KeyBank\u2019s predecessor, Society National Bank (\u201cSociety\u201d), in exchange for $375,000. The \u25a0second mortgage was recorded on October 25, 1994, with the county recorder. As part of the Kents\u2019 transaction with Society, Society allegedly issued a payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>of approximately $174,564 to Huntington, purportedly canceling, or nearly canceling, the Kents\u2019 indebtedness to Huntington.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">After October 1994, the Kents borrowed additional money from Huntington that now allegedly totals approximately $190,000. Huntington and KeyBank dispute whether the additional money was borrowed pursuant to the Kents\u2019 1991 personal line of credit agreement with Huntington that was secured by the 1991 open-end mortgage, or whether the additional money was borrowed pursuant to another agreement between the Kents and Huntington.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">On March 30, 2000, Huntington filed a motion for summary judgment against KeyBank concerning Huntingdon\u2019s cross-claim against KeyBank and KeyBank\u2019s cross-claim against Huntington. KeyBank responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment. On' October 31, 2000, the trial court rendered a decision overruling Huntington\u2019s summary judgment motion and sustaining KeyBank\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court entered judgment accordingly. Huntington appeals, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 1: The trial court erred in granting Keybank\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2: The trial court erred in denying Huntington\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">An appellate court\u2019s review of summary judgment is conducted under a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>Coventry Twp. v. Ecker </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 38, 41, 654 N.E.2d 1327; <em>Koos v. Cent. Ohio Cellular, Inc. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 579, 588, 641 N.E.2d 265. Summary judgment is proper only when the parties moving for summary judgment demonstrate (1) no genuine issue of material fact exists, (2) the moving parties are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion'and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence most strongly construed in its favor. Civ.R. 56; <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), the moving party bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record demonstrating the absence of a material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The moving party, however, cannot discharge its initial burden under this rule with a eonclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case; the moving party must specifically point to evidence of a type listed in Civ.R. 56(C), affirmatively demonstrating that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmov-ing party\u2019s claims. <em>Id.; Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 674 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>1164. Once the moving party discharges its initial burden, summary judgment is appropriate if the nonmoving party does not respond, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Civ.R. 56, with specific facts showing that a genuine issue exists for trial. <em>Dresher, supra, </em>at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Vahila, supra, </em>at 430, 674 N.E.2d 1164; Civ.R. 56(E). See, also, <em>Castrataro v. Urban </em>(Mar. 7, 2000), Franklin App. No. 99AP-219, unreported, 2000 WL 254315.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Huntington\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in granting KeyBank\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. Specifically, Huntington notes that the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>applied R.C. 5301.232(B) to resolve the matters in contention between Huntington and KeyBank.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Under its analysis and application of R.C. 5301.232(B), the trial court found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201c[T]he Court finds that under 5301.232(B), Huntington\u2019s mortgage loses its priority status over that of KeyBank due to the fact that (1) Huntington received notice of KeyBank\u2019s mortgage, and (2) Huntington was not contractually obligated to make any advances to Plaintiffs subsequent to the expiration of the five year Draw Period [that was specified in the Kents\u2019 1991 agreement with Huntington]. Consequently, KeyBank\u2019s mortgage is first and best and holds priority over that held by Huntington. However, the Court does not find that Huntington\u2019s mortgage is either satisfied or released, but rather, it simply loses its priority status with respect to the mortgage held by KeyBank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Huntington\u2019s agreement with the Kents is an open-end mortgage pursuant to R.C. 5301.232(A), and Huntington was not obligated to make advances to the Kents after the expiration of the five-year draw period under the Kents\u2019 1991 agreement with Huntington, the trial court\u2019s application of R.C. 5301.232(B) nonetheless is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">R.C. 5301.232(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-10\">\u201cA mortgage complying with division (A) of this section and securing unpaid balances of loan advances referred to in such division is a lien on the premises described therein from the time such mortgage is delivered to the recorder for record for the full amount of the total unpaid loan indebtedness, including the unpaid balances of such advances that are made under such mortgage, plus interest thereon, regardless of the time when such advances are made. <em>If such an advance is made after the holder of the mortgage receives written notice of a lien or encumbrance on the mortgaged premises which is subordinate to the lien of the mortgage, and if such holder is not obligated to make such advance at the time such notice is received, then the lien of the mortgage for the unpaid balance of the advance so made is subordinate to such lien or encumbrance. </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Under R.C. 5301.232(B), if Huntington was not obligated to advance money to the Kents after the expiration of the five-year draw period, and if Huntington advanced money to the Kents after receiving written notice from KeyBank of KeyBank\u2019s subordinate mortgage, then KeyBank\u2019s mortgage would have priority over Huntington\u2019s advancements that were made after the expiration of the five-year draw period.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">For a written notice to be valid under R.C. 5301.232(B), it must conform to the requirements of R.C. 5301.232(D), which include (1) signature of the holder of the lien or encumbrance, (2) description of the property, the date, and the involved parties, (3) the recorder\u2019s file number, or the volume and initial page of the record, (4) the amount of the claim, and (5) service according to statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In its decision, the trial court determined that \u201cHuntington itself has never disputed that it received payments from KeyBank contemporaneous with the filing of its [KeyBank\u2019s] mortgage, or that it was notified of KeyBank\u2019s respective subsequent open-ended [sic] mortgage.\u201d Although Huntington arguably may have been notified of KeyBank\u2019s mortgage through its receipt of payments from KeyBank, there is no evidence in the record indicating that KeyBank complied with the written notice requirements of R.C. 5301.232(D). Because KeyBank did not comply with the mandatory requirements of R.C. 5301.232(D), the trial court erred when it determined that Huntington received proper notice. See <em>Leader Mtge. Co. v. Slattery </em>(July 12, 1996), Lake App. No. 95-L-146, unreported, 1996 WL 648739 (\u201cR.C. 5301.232[D] does not elevate subordinate lienholders where the senior lienholder has actual notice, the section explicitly requires that before a subordinate lienholder can be so elevated, notice complying with subsection [D] <em>must </em>be given by the party claiming such priority status\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Moreover, Huntington was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s independent application of R.C. 5301.232, as it deprived both Huntington and KeyBank of an opportunity to submit evidence, as well as brief the issues, related to R.C. 5301.232. Accordingly, Huntington\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Huntington\u2019s second assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in denying Huntington\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Although the evidence does not indicate that KeyBank complied with the notice requirement in R.C. 5301.232(D), that omission does not necessarily mean that Huntington is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">The trial court determined Huntington\u2019s priority status under R.C. 5301.232(B). As noted, however, the trial court\u2019s priority determination was in error because, based on the evidence before the trial court, KeyBank failed to give proper written notice pursuant to R.C. 5301.232(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>If on remand the trial court accepts Huntington\u2019s argument that the 1991 open-end mortgage was still in force and Huntington\u2019s advancements to the Kents after the expiration of the five-year draw period were made pursuant to the 1991 open-end mortgage, then Huntington may prevail as a matter of law if Huntington was obligated to make these advancements. See R.C. 5301.232(B); see, also, <em>Colonial Mtge. Serv. Co. v. Southard </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 347, 10 O.O.3d 481, 384 N.E.2d 250, syllabus (\u201cPursuant to R.C. 5301.232[B], an otherwise subordinate lien will not receive priority over an advance made by the holder of an open-end mortgage if the mortgage holder is obligated to make such advance at the time the notice of lien is received\u201d). If, however, the trial court determines that Huntington was not obligated to make advancements to the Kents pursuant to the 1991 open-end mortgage and credit line agreement, then the trial court must determine whether under R.C. 5301.232(D) proper notice was provided by KeyBank to subject Huntington\u2019s advancements to subordinate status under R.C. 5301.232(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Last, we note that the trial court did not make any determinations concerning other issues, including the current status of Huntington\u2019s 1991 open-end mortgage. As the trial court noted, \u201cthe Court does not find that Huntington\u2019s mortgage is either satisfied or released, but rather, it simply loses its priority status with respect to the mortgage held by KeyBank.\u201d In the event R.C. 5301.232(B) does not apply, a determination of Huntington\u2019s 1991 open-end mortgage status will be necessary to adjudicate KeyBank\u2019s claims. If the trial court accepts KeyBank\u2019s contentions that (1) Huntington\u2019s 1991 mortgage was satisfied when KeyBank made payments to Huntington in 1994, and Huntington failed to release the 1991 mortgage, or (2) Huntington\u2019s advancements to the Kents that were made after the five-year period were based on another agreement, then the trial court will be required to make a determination about the status of Huntington\u2019s 1991 open-end mortgage and Huntington\u2019s advancements. Because the trial court limited its analysis to a priority determination under R.C. 5301.232 and did not determine these other issues, we decline to address them in the first instance. Huntington\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Having overruled Huntington\u2019s second assignment of error, but having sustained its first assignment of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b788-8\">Brown and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
