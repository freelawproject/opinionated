Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred by dismissing plaintiffs case, <em>sua sponte, </em>for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and by denying plaintiffs motion for a specific finding of fact and law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">\u201cSecondiAssignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying plaintiffs motion for judgment on the pleadings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">PPG Industries, Inc. (\u201cPPG\u201d), defendant below and cross-appellant herein, posits the following additional assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">\u201cThis action should not have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the common pleas court had the authority to remand the case to the Industrial Commission for clarification or correction of a clerical error pursuant to Section 4123.512 of the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">A review of the record reveals the following facts pertinent to this appeal. David Valentine began work for PPG in 1969 and spent almost thirty years with the company as a lab technician and \u201cenvironment specialist/clean-up worker.\u201d Valentine dealt with hazardous chemical spills on the jobsite. During the course of his employment, Valentine was exposed to numerous toxic chemicals including various hydrocarbon compounds linked to cancer. In 1997, he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiform (a type of brain tumor) and underwent surgery as well as aggressive chemotherapy. Unfortunately, Valentine died on May 29, 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Valentine\u2019s widow, Linda Valentine (appellant), filed a claim for death benefits pursuant to R.C. 4123.59. The matter was heard on March 29, 2000, and the district hearing officer issued a report several weeks later. The hearing officer found that the conditions of the decedent\u2019s employment \u201ccreated a risk of contracting the fatal condition of Glioblastoma [multiform] due to chemical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>exposure in a greater degree and in a different manner than in the public generally * * *\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the hearing officer relied on the sworn statement of Dr. Miner \u201cthat the decedent-claimant\u2019s long-term exposure to chemicals in his employment is causally related to his condition of glioblastoma multiform and resultant death.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">PPG appealed and the matter was reviewed by a staff hearing officer on May 23, 2000. The staff hearing officer rendered his report several weeks later and it is this report that has formed the basis for the controversy in the instant appeal. The report begins by stating that \u201c[t]he order of the District Hearing Officer, from the hearing date 03/29/2000, is <em>affirmed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) However, the staff hearing officer then appears to contradict himself by ruling against the claimant (appellant). The reports provides, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u201cAs to the merits of the case, the decedent, as the District Hearing Officer indicated, was a laboratory technician and environment specialist/clean-up worker for the employer. The decedent\u2019s work did require him to be exposed to a wide variety of chemicals including hydrocarbons. Based on this type of exposure, Dr. Miner, a neurosurgeon who treated the decedent, stated pursuant to his 8/30/99 report the following in terms of the relationship of decedent\u2019s brain cancer and his employment, * * I do believe, that his long-term exposure to these chemicals as you described puts him at high risk and <em>could well </em>be the causative agent in his tumor\u2019 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">\u201cDr. Bontrager, a family physician, on 11/12/99, did file a review after <em>only </em>reviewing widow-claimant\u2019s medical evidence, and he stated it was medically reasonable to assume claimant\u2019s death was caused by the documented exposure to carcinogenic agents at work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u201cOn the other hand, the employer had the file reviewed by Dr. Bigner, an expert in brain tumors, on 2/4/00. Dr. Bigner stated that there is only one known cause of primary brain tumors, ionizing radiation, and there is no evidence the decedent was exposed to this agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">\u201cHe went on and stated that it was [his] opinion that \u2018* * * that exposure to chemicals or environmental agents in the work place of David Valentine played no role in the development or progression of his illness nor did exposure to any such chemicals or environmental agents increase his risks of developing Grade IV astrocytoma.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">\u201cDr. Buncher, an epidemiologist, on 3/27/00, stated that epidemiological studies of this workplace (Circleville, Ohio) and a prior study of this industry showed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>increase in brain cancer was found or even suspected. Based on these studies, he opined that there was no reason to believe that there was any increase risk of brain cancer in decedent\u2019s workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201cThe reports of Drs. Bigner and Buncher are found persuasive because previous scientific studies showed no risk of increased brain cancer where decedent worked, and even though the decedent was exposed to harmful chemicals, only one agent, ionizing radiation, has definitely been shown to cause brain tumors, and the decedent was not exposed to this agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\"><em>\u201cDr. Miner\u2019s report was not persuasive </em>because he didn\u2019t state the decedent\u2019s chemical exposure actually or even probably caused his brain cancer, only that it \u2018could well be\u2019 a causative agent. That lack of certainty is a fatal defect of that report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201cDr. Bontrager\u2019s report was not relied on because he only reviewed claimant\u2019s evidence (p. 25 of transcript). Without considering all medical reports and evidence, his report is viewed as deficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">\u201cIn view of the aforementioned analysis, <em>it is found that there is insufficient proof on file to causally relate decedent\u2019s death to his occupational exposure at work in terms of an injury or occupational disease.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Despite the inconsistent language used in this report, all of the parties appear to have construed it as a reversal of the district hearing officer and a denial of benefits. An appeal was taken to the Industrial Commission but, on July 27, 2000, that body issued an order refusing to take any further action in the matter. Appellant then commenced the action below on August 8, 2000, as an appeal pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. Appellant alleged in her complaint that the decedent (her husband) had sustained an injury arising out of the course of his employment and asked that she be allowed to participate in \u201cthe benefits provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d PPG and the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) both denied that appellant was entitled to any benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Thereafter, the parties engaged in a contentious discovery battle during which time appellant either first noticed the contradictory language in the staff hearing officer\u2019s report or applied a different interpretation of the language. In any event, on November 3, 2000 appellant\u2019s counsel demanded payment of benefits based on the report\u2019s language that \u201caffirmed\u201d the district hearing officer\u2019s order and award of benefits. PPG filed a motion to stay discovery until the apparent contradiction(s) in the report could be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">On December 20, 2000, the trial court conducted a pretrial conference. The court apparently directed the parties to draft an agreed entry to remand the case to the Industrial Commission for clarification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The two sides could not agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>and so, on January 4, 2001, appellant asked for \u201cjudgment on the pleadings\u201d or, in the alternative, a \u201cdetermination of law\u201d that the staff hearing officer\u2019s report was a \u201clegal nullity\u201d such that the trial court would not have jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s appeal in the first place. Appellant argued that the report\u2019s only reasonable interpretation was to affirm the district hearing officer\u2019s ruling. Appellant therefore concluded that she was entitled to judgment in her favor as a matter of law. Alternatively, appellant argued that the \u201cinherent contradiction\u201d in the report made it such that it was logically incapable of being interpreted in favor of either party and was, thus, a \u201clegal nullity.\u201d Appellant maintained that under those circumstances, the trial court should make a \u201cruling of fact and law,\u201d finding that the order of the Industrial Commission was void and remand the case \u201cto complete the administrative adjudication\u201d of the appeal from the district hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">PPG responded with its own memoranda and. proposed that the case be remanded to the Industrial Commission for a clarification of its previous order. The company argued that appellant\u2019s proposed alternative would essentially \u201cstraight jacket\u201d the Industrial Commission and require it to hold an additional hearing in which appellant could take a proverbial \u201csecond bite at the apple,\u201d this time using additional discovery that she obtained during the course of her appeal to the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">On January 21, 2001, the trial court denied both appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and her request for \u201calternative relief.\u201d At the same time, however, the court also dismissed her appeal <em>\u201csua sponte, </em>for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Initially, we note that we will jointly consider the assignments and cross-assignment of error because they all involve the related issues of (1) whether the trial court properly dismissed this case and (2) how best to address the inconsistencies in the staff hearing officer\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">We begin our analysis by noting that appeals from the Industrial Commission to the courts of common pleas are governed by the provisions of R.C. 4123.512. The jurisdictional requirements of -this statute are generally satisfied by filing a timely notice of appeal that is in substantial compliance with the dictates of the statute. See 94 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1999) 431, Workers\u2019 Compensation, Section 346. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court gave no explanation for its judgment dismissing the matter. Our review does not reveal any problems with the notice of appeal, and we find no other jurisdictional defect readily apparent from the record. We therefore agree with appellant and PPG insofar as they both argue that the dismissal was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Presumably* the trial court\u2019s dismissal resulted from the contradiction in the staff hearing officer\u2019s report.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We note at the outset, however, that we are unaware of any authority that would sanction the dismissal of a workers\u2019 compensation appeal because of a contradiction in the order being appealed. None of the parties in this case has cited any authority for that proposition and we have found nothing to that effect in our own research. Generally speaking, a judgment may be so vague and uncertain as to be null and void. See 62 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1985) 352, Judgments, Section 27. One might argue that the same proposition would apply here in a workers\u2019 compensation case as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We, however, are simply not persuaded that the staff hearing officer\u2019s order was so inconsistent or contradictory as to call into question its meaning or validity. To be sure, one sentence in the report purports to affirm the district hearing officer\u2019s findings. That affirmance, however, is but one sentence in a rather extensive report. The staff hearing officer\u2019s report reviews all of the evidence adduced at the administrative level and ultimately concludes that the opinions of Drs. Bigner and Bunch deserve more weight than that of Dr. Miner. Finally, the hearing officer explicitly concludes that <em>\u201cthere [was] insufficient proof on file to causally relate decedent\u2019s death to his occupational exposure at work in terms of an injury or occupational disease.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">This language constitutes a ruling against appellant and we conclude that the staff hearing officer\u2019s use of the word \u201caffirmed\u201d at the beginning of the order (in reference to the district hearing officer\u2019s order) was merely a scrivener\u2019s error. Obviously, this word was intended to be \u201coverruled\u201d rather than \u201caffirmed.\u201d To hold otherwise would require us to completely ignore the opinion, which comports neither with sound jurisprudence nor good common sense. We would further emphasize that our interpretation of the staff hearing officer\u2019s order also coincides with the interpretation given it by appellant and PPG through several stages of these proceedings. Appellant clearly believed that the staff hearing officer had ruled against her or she would not have appealed to the Industrial Commission and then to the trial court. Likewise, PPG and BWC both filed answers that admitted to appellant\u2019s allegations that her claim for death benefits had been denied by the staff hearing officer. We doubt whether PPG and BWC would have done so had they not also interpreted the ruling as adverse to appellant. All parties concerned thus came to the same conclusion as we do here \u2014 that the order in question denied appellant her claim for death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">That said, and because no other apparent jurisdictional deficiency warrants a dismissal of the claim, we believe that the interests of justice are best served by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanding this case for further proceedings. This would include a trial <em>de novo </em>on the merits of appellant\u2019s claim that she is entitled death benefits. See R.C. 4123.512(D) (the trier of fact shall determine the right of the claimant to participate in the fund upon the evidence adduced at the hearing on the action); see, also, <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 26, 584 N.E.2d 1175, 1179; <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 484, 6 OBR 531, 534, 453 N.E.2d 721, 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">BWC asserts, however, that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and leave the parties precisely in the position where they were left after the trial court\u2019s judgment. We find that result to be untenable. Appellant has a statutory right to appeal her case to the common pleas court and, as she argues in her brief, that right would be denied if the trial court\u2019s decision were allowed to stand. BWC counters that the only issue in an appeal under R.C. 4123.512 is whether the claimant has a right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. The agency argues that because appellant and PPG both asked the trial court to interpret the meaning of the staff hearing officer\u2019s report, they went outside the jurisdiction of the common pleas court and the appeal was correctly dismissed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">We do not believe that we need to address the underlying premise of BWC\u2019s argument (that the common pleas court lacked jurisdiction to interpret the meaning of the staff hearing officer\u2019s order). The fact remains that appellant\u2019s complaint asked for a determination of her \u201cright to participate in the benefits provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d That prayer for relief was not altered simply because she later sought an interpretation of the staff hearing officer\u2019s order. Appellant asked for a determination of her rights under the law, and she is legally entitled to have her case heard in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Appellant agrees that the judgment should be reversed but argues that we should either confirm the purported holding of the staff hearing officer (that she was granted the right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for death benefits) or require the trial court to include in its jurisdictional ruling \u201ca concise statement as to the legal basis for the * * * determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reject both of these alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">First, as noted earlier, we do not believe that the staff hearing officer ruled in appellant\u2019s favor. Our reading of the order is that no causal connection between decedent\u2019s cancer and the conditions of his employment has been established. Therefore, appellant is not entitled to judgment in her favor as a matter of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>We also decline to order the trial court to issue a \u201cconcise statement\u201d as to why it dismissed the appeal. As noted above, in our review we found that the appeal should not have been dismissed. We see no reason to order the trial court to issue any explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Appellant claims that another defect exists in the staff hearing officer\u2019s report. Specifically, she contends that the order was signed \u201cRobert Pellit by AK.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant cites R.C. 4121.36(B)(3), which requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that a staff hearing officer\u2019s decision contain the signature of the \u201cappropriate hearing officer.\u201d She concludes that \u201cabsolutely no indication [exists] in the record as to the identity of the individual \u2018AK\u2019 \u201d and that the aforementioned statute was not complied with, thereby rendering the order a \u201clegal nullity.\u201d We decline to address this issue for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\"> First, appellant did not raise this particular issue in the trial court. Generally, a court of review will not consider arguments for the first time on appeal. See <em>Skeini v. Johnson </em>(Dec. 28, 2000), Gallia App. No. 00CA03, unreported, 2000 WL 33226286; <em>Minix v. Collier </em>(Aug. 4, 2000), Scioto App. No. 99CA2690, unreported, 2000 WL 1154055. Second, this particular issue has not been raised as an assignment of error but rather as a portion of an argument in support of appellant\u2019s brief in response to the cross-appellant\u2019s arguments. Suffice it to say that appellate courts determine appeals on the basis of assignments of error rather than arguments on individual issues. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(b); see, also, <em>Reed v. Smith </em>(Mar. 14, 2001), Pike App. No. 00CA650, unreported; <em>Woods v. Owners Ins. Co. </em>(Feb. 1, 2000), Ross App. No. 99CA2486, unreported, 2000 WL 133850 Finally, it does not appear that the specific order upon which appellant bases this argument is actually contained in the record. The staff hearing officer report that was included as part of the petition and complaint was an unsigned copy, and included the notation that the signed copy was contained in the claim file. Copies of that \u201csigned copy\u201d are attached as exhibits to several of the briefs, but we have not found any of them as part of the original papers below. We are precluded by App.R. 12(A) from considering exhibits attached to briefs that were not made a part of the trial court proceedings. See <em>Isbell v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 313, 318, 619 N.E.2d 1055, 1058; <em>Merillat v. Fulton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 459, 463, 597 N.E.2d 1124, 1127. For all these reasons, we decline to address appellant\u2019s argument concerning the allegedly defective signature on the staff hearing officer\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">PPG agrees that the trial court\u2019s judgment should be reversed but argues that the case should be remanded to the Industrial Commission for clarification or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>correction of the staff hearing officer\u2019s report. Appellant and BWC counter in their briefs that a trial court has no authority to remand a case to the Industrial Commission for further proceedings. See <em>Green v. B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 223, 226, 619 N.E.2d 497, 499; <em>Marcum v. Barry </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 536, 540, 602 N.E.2d 419, 422; <em>Williams v. Truck &amp; Bus Div. of GMC </em>(Nov. 9, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 18455, unreported, 2000 WL 1675879. PPG responds that courts have remanded cases to the Industrial Commission in other instances. See <em>Borbely v. Prestole Everlock, Inc. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 67, 71, 565 N.E.2d 575, 579; <em>Cook v. Mayfield </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 200, 206, 543 N.E.2d 787, 793; <em>Daniels v. Bethesda Hosp., Inc. </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 272, 277, 699 N.E.2d 964, 967. Fortunately, we need not resolve these apparent conflicts in authority at this time. In view of our conclusion that the staff hearing officer\u2019s order should be construed as a ruling adverse to appellant, we see no need to remand this case to the Industrial Commission. The matter may simply proceed on appeal as contemplated by R.C. 4123.512(D) and as originally contemplated by the parties when the case below was first commenced.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">For these reasons, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit and is overruled. However, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, as well as PPG\u2019s cross-assignment of error, are well taken and sustained to the limited extent discussed herein. We remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b312-7\">Harsha, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b312-8\">Kline, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-14\">. \"Primary brain tumors (PBT)'' were described below as \"a relatively rare form of cancer\" accounting for only \u201c2-3% of all new cancers diagnosed * * * per year.\u201d Glioblastoma multiform (\"GBM\u201d) comprises roughly twenty-two to thirty percent of new PBTs diagnosed each year.

However, as aptly noted in the briefs, \"the Industrial Commission is <em>not </em>a party in the instant litigation.\u201d Even if the staff hearing officer\u2019s report was ambiguous, and further assuming that we did have jurisdiction to remand the case for clarification in the first place, there is nothing to ensure that the Industrial Commission would, in fact, take further action pursuant to our remand. We conclude that the best course of action is to remand this case for proceedings on a trial <em>de novo </em>pursuant to R.C. 4123.512(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
