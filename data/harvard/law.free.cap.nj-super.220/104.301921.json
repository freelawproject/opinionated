He was stopped while operating his vehicle at approximately 2:48 A.M. on April 17, 1983. In response to questions asked at the State Police station, defendant acknowledged having consumed three Bloody Marys between 11:00 P.M. and 2:45 A.M. Two breathalyzer readings were then taken, the first at 3:15 A.M. and the second at 3:25 A.M. Both indicated a blood alcohol concentration of .12%. The statute under which he was convicted prohibits any person \u201cwith a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol in the ... blood\u201d from operating a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Defendant argues that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a) violates the requirements of due process by imposing a mandatory presumption of intoxication. The argument is stopped short, however, by the fact that the statute does not create a presumption. It flatly prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle by any driver whose blood alcohol concentration equals or exceeds .10%, and the penal consequences for violations thereof apply without regard to whether the operator\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired. We find no lack of clarity in the terms of the statute, nor discern any constitutional impediment to their enforcement.
