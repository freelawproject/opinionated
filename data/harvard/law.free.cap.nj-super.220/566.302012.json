Ble waived a probable cause hearing, and a final revocation hearing was conducted on July 3, 1986 at the Youth Correctional Institution Complex at Bordentown, to which Mannson had been returned as a parole violator. Mannson was represented by counsel, and the arresting officer testified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Mannson\u2019s supervising parole officer did not appear for the proceedings, leading the hearing officer to indicate that a hearing summary would be prepared on the record established. Thereafter, the hearing officer stated that \u201c[t]his hearing is concluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In his subsequent written summary and opinion prepared for the Young Adult Panel of the Parole Board, the hearing officer concluded that, \u201c[a]s there was no Parole Officer available to present evidence ... there [was] no clear and convincing evidence\u201d sufficient to sustain any of the violations. However, on July 15, 1986, the Young Adult Panel of the Parole Board decided not to render a final determination and remanded the matter to a hearing officer with directions \u201cto reconvene Mr. Mannson\u2019s hearing with a parole officer present in order to review subject\u2019s contested technical parole violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">A continued hearing was scheduled for August 1, 1986, but was subsequently adjourned. The hearing was ultimately conducted on September 11, 1986, before a different hearing officer. On that day, Mannson\u2019s counsel objected to the continued proceedings, and the counsel who had represented him at the July 3, 1986 proceedings testified as to events which occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>that day. After hearing that testimony and testimony from the supervising parole officer concerning his non-appearance on July 3, 1986 and regarding Mannson\u2019s lack of reporting while on parole, the hearing officer found sufficient evidence to sustain three of the allegations that Mannson violated the conditions of parole. Following review of the hearing officer\u2019s summary and opinion, the Young Adult Panel of the Parole Board revoked Mannson\u2019s parole on October 3, 1986 and ordered that he serve 12 additional months before parole eligibility. Mannson\u2019s appeal to the full Parole Board was unsuccessful. He now appeals to us from the final determination of the Parole Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">On this appeal, Mannson argues that (1) the Administrative Procedure Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 <em>et seq., </em>does not apply to the New Jersey State Parole Board, which relied upon that Act in permitting evidence to be taken at a \u201creconvened\u201d or second parole revocation hearing; (2) that \u201cby holding a second final parole revocation hearing,\u201d Mannson was denied due process of law, and (3) that the conduct of the \u201creconvened\u201d or \u201csecond final parole revocation hearing,\u201d violated the constitutional protection against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">It is true, as Mannson argues, that the decision to reconvene the revocation hearing was justified in light of <em>In re Kallen, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>14 (1983), a decision of our Supreme Court permitting reopening of an administrative proceeding, and that <em>Kallen </em>was decided with respect to proceedings arising under the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is also true, as Mannson contends, that the parole revocation procedure is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.48(d), but that does not mean that an administrative agency cannot \u201creconvene\u201d or \u201creopen\u201d an administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>We find no prohibition to the \u201creopening\u201d or \u201creconvening\u201d of an administrative proceeding, even if not subject to express legislative authorization, provided that no constitutional or statutory rights are violated. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Kallen </em>\u201ccourts long have had the power to reopen the record to admit additional evidence prior to the entry of a final judgment. Since administrative agencies have the inherent authority to reopen, modify, or rehear even final orders, <em>a fortiori, </em>they like courts, possess the right to reopen or continue hearings prior to the entry of a final order.\u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 24 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">At the time that the proceedings were reopened or reconvened, there had been no final determination on the revocation charges as the hearing officer\u2019s summary and opinion had not yet become the subject of a final determination by the Parole Board panel which was authorized to revoke parole. While the hearing officer has certain powers to continue parole and to release the offender, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.62f, once a final hearing is conducted it is the appropriate Parole Board panel which must make the ultimate determination with respect to revocation of parole. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.63(d); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-7.16(a). <em>See also In re Trantino Parole Application, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>347, 364-366 (1982), where the Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he Parole Board retains the right to reconsider and redetermine a prior decision in appropriate circumstances, subject, of course, to limitations relating to fairness and reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364 (citation omitted); <em>In re Kallen, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">As Mannson notes, <em>In re Trantino Parole Application, supra, </em>dealt with a determination concerning release of a prisoner on parole, and not with a parole revocation proceeding, and there are obvious differences between parole release and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>rescission, on the one hand, and parole revocation on the other, <em>see e.g., In re Trantino Parole Application, supra; see also Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>471, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2593, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>484 (1972); <em>New Jersey State Parole Board v. Byrne, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>192 (1983); <em>New Thompson v. Jersey State Parole Board, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>107 (App.Div.1986); <em>O\u2019Neal v. New Jersey State Parole Board, </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174 (App.Div.1977), appeal dismissed 75 <em>N.J. </em>590 (1977). But those differences, although giving rise to different constitutional and statutory protections, do not require disparate determinations relating to the power of the Parole Board to \u201creconvene\u201d or \u201creopen\u201d proceedings in the absence of controlling legislation or basic unfairness. The question before us is whether Mannson was deprived of any rights embodied in the federal or state constitutions or in the statutes of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><em>Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, </em>and its progeny guarantee that a parolee receives due process of law in connection with the parole revocation process. <em>Morrissey </em>embodies minimum standards required before revocation can be perfected. Those standards include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">(a) written notice of the claimed violation of parole;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">(b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">(c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">(d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">(e) a \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 hearing body such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">(f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole. <em>[Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>at 489, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2604, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 499.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">We cannot conclude that the \u201creconvening\u201d of a parole revocation hearing before a hearing officer, and prior to any final determination or adjudication on the merits, violates any due process rights embodied in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>or any principle of fundamental fairness. <em>See In re Kallen, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 25-27; <em>see also Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>539, 94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>S.Ct. </em>2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); <em>Jenkins v. Fauver, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>239 (1987).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We also reject Mannson\u2019s argument that the double jeopardy guarantee prohibits the taking of additional evidence after completion of the initial hearing before the hearing officer. It is clear that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy clause does not apply to parole revocation proceedings. See <em>e.g. Jonas v. Wainwright, </em>779 <em>F.2d </em>1576, 1577 (11th Cir.1986), <em>cert. </em>den. \u2014 U.S.-, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>115, 93 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>62 (1986); <em>Garcia v. United States, </em>769 F.2d 697, 700 (11th Cir.1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although addressing the application of the double jeopardy clause to simultaneous revocation of parole and prosecution for a new offense based on the same transaction, the Seventh Circuit recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">The double jeopardy clause protects a defendant in a criminal proceeding against multiple punishment or repeated prosecutions for the same offense. <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>600, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976); its protections are not triggered by the revocation of parole. A parole revocation proceeding is an administrative proceeding designed to determine whether a parolee has violated the conditions of his parole, not a proceeding designed to punish a criminal defendant for violation of a criminal law. A criminal prosecution is a judicial proceeding that vindicates the community\u2019s interests in punishing criminal conduct. <em>U.S. v Whitney, </em>649 F.2d 296, 298 (5th Cir.1981). Because the two proceedings serve different ends, the finding that the defendant no longer merits parole does not foreclose the criminal justice system from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>punishing the defendant for that conduct. <em>[United States v. Hanahan, </em>798 <em>F.</em>2d 187, 189-190 (7th Cir.1986)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">As our state constitutional protection against double jeopardy is co-extensive with the federal constitution or is to be interpreted consistent with its broader provision, <em>see e.g. State v. Barnes, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>362, 370 (1980); <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>395, 404 (1976), defendant\u2019s claim under the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. I, II11, must likewise fall. <em>See also In re Kallen, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 24, n. 6, <em>In re Trantino, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 364; <em>Atkinson v. Parsekian, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>143 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Accordingly, the final determination revoking defendant\u2019s parole is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">As Manson had not been convicted of the new charges at the time of the hearing, the revocation was not based on the new charges themselves. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.60-30:4-123.62h.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Kallen, </em>that case concerned \u201cthe relationship between state administrative agencies and the Office of Administrative Law.\u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In a footnote following this statement, the Court stated, \"[s]ince the AU\u2019s initial decision was not a final decision, Kallen\u2019s claims of double jeopardy and res judicata are inapplicable,\" citing <em>In re Trantino Parole Application, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>347, 364 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\">AIthough more than 60 days elapsed between detention on the parole revocation charges and the final revocation hearing, initial proceedings were adjourned at the request of the Office of the Public Defender which asked in May of 1986 that \u201cthis hearing be postponed pending further word from our office\" and which asked that the \u201creconvened\" proceedings be postponed until a transcript of the original hearing was prepared, and thereafter, until \"a mutually convenient time\" so that an Assistant Deputy Public Defender could \"appear as a witness for Mr. Mannson.\u201d Accordingly, there is no express argument that the timing of the hearing and final revocation deprived defendant of due process or that the proceedings were adjourned for more than 120 days at the request of the Parole Board or the hearing officer. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Moreover, there was no final adjudication on the merits. <em>Cf. e.g., Swisher v. Brady, </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>204, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2699, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>705 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
