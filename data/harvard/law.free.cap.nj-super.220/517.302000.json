The parties stipulated that defendant, who was 20 years old, had taken one sip from a cup of beer purchased by a friend at a church fair on June 4, 1986. The municipal court judge found defendant guilty as charged and imposed the penalty mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-81, namely, suspension of defendant\u2019s driving privileges for six months and a fine of $100. Defendant appealed to the Law Division where the Assignment Judge, finding that the incident constituted a <em>de minimis </em>infraction, dismissed the complaint pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-11. The State appeals, and we affirm substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Haines in his written opinion of January 5, 1986 for the Law Division, published at 216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231 (Law Div.1987).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
