The plaintiff insurer, Hanover Insurance Company (Hanover), sought a declaratory judgment that it was not required to provide underinsured benefits in this case. A judge in the Superior Court refused to grant Hanover its requested declaratory relief and found Hanover liable for such coverage. This decision was affirmed by the Appeals Court, see 40 Mass. App. Ct. 1112 (1996), and we granted Hanover\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The facts are undisputed. On January 26, 1991, Hilary Shedd, the insureds\u2019 eighteen year old daughter, was killed when a drunk driver struck the rear of the automobile in which Hilary was a passenger. The drunk driver\u2019s vehicle was insured under a policy which provided liability insurance for bodily injury in the amount of $100,000 per person. This entire policy limit was tendered to the Shedds in settlement of a wrongful death action brought in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">At the time of the accident, Hilary was riding in an automobile which was registered to her and covered by a Massachusetts automobile insurance policy issued by the Arbella Mutual Insurance Company. Under this policy, and pursuant to Massachusetts law (G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L [1] and [2]), underinsured motorist coverage was not compulsory and Hilary elected to have \u201czero\u201d limits for this optional coverage. At this same time, Matthew Shedd, Hilary\u2019s father, owned an automobile insured under a Massachusetts automobile insurance policy issued by Hanover, which included Hilary as an additional named insured. Pursuant to this policy, Shedd had elected to obtain underinsured motorist coverage up to a limit of $250,000 per person. Following settlement of their wrongful death action, the Shedds presented their claim to Hanover for underinsured motorist coverage. Subsequently, Hanover filed an action for declaratory judgment, disclaiming liability for the Shedds\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The outcome of this case turns on the meaning of provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>sions under which Shedd was provided underinsured coverage in his policy. The language at issue reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\u201cWe will pay damages to or for: . . . Any household member . . . while occupying an auto not owned by you . . . We will not pay damages to or for any household member who has a Massachusetts auto policy of his or her own providing similar coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">To be precise, this case turns on whether Hilary\u2019s own Massachusetts auto policy provided \u201csimilar coverage\u201d so as to preclude her estate from obtaining damages pursuant to her father\u2019s policy. We have examined this same language twice in the recent past. See <em>Dullea </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., ante </em>37 (1997); <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 144 (1994). It is language which is unique to Massachusetts standard form policies issued in 1990, which forms have since been amended so that damages are precluded \u201cfor any household member who has a Massachusetts auto policy of his or her own.\u201d Because Shedd\u2019s Hanover policy became effective in September, 1990, Hanover\u2019s coverage duties are determined according to the language then in use.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The outcome in this dispute is not controlled by our decisions in either <em>Smart </em>or <em>Dullea. </em>In both of those cases, we denied the claimants\u2019 attempts to assert underinsured motorist coverage under policies which were not the policies held by the injured parties. In <em>Smart, </em>the plaintiff, who was the administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate and the decedent\u2019s mother, sought underinsurance coverage pursuant to her own policy which provided underinsurance limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. The decedent had purchased his own Massachusetts automobile insurance policy which provided underinsured motorist coverage of $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident. The decedent had checked a box for such coverage on his application for insurance and it was provided although no premium was charged for this underinsurance coverage. <em>Smart, supra </em>at 145. In <em>Dullea, </em>the injured plaintiff had purchased a policy which automatical provided underinsured motorist coverage of up to $10,000 per person with no premium charged for such coverage. The plaintiff did not elect to purchase additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>underinsured motorist coverage and sought benefits under her uncle\u2019s policy which provided higher limits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In both cases, we found that the injured parties had their own policies which provided \u201csimilar coverage\u201d and were thus precluded under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (5), from claiming coverage under the higher limits provided pursuant to policies held by their respective household members. See <em>Dullea </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra </em>at 39 n.4; <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra </em>at 149-150.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">By choosing an underinsured motorist coverage limit of \u201czero,\u201d Hilary Shedd affirmatively elected not to procure any such coverage and she received no such coverage. Cf. <em>Dullea </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra </em>at 40-41 (\u201c[t]he plaintiff had the option and chose not to buy <em>additional </em>coverage; that was her election\u201d [emphasis added]). This is precisely the question which We left open in <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra </em>at 149 n.6, when we stated that \u201c[w]e express no view on what the result would have been if [the decedent] had elected to have no underinsured motorist coverage under his policy.\u201d The plain language of Shedd\u2019s policy stated that household members could not acquire coverage under his policy if they had their own policy \u201cproviding similar coverage.\u201d Shedd\u2019s policy provided for underinsured motorist coverage. Hilary\u2019s did not. There was no similar coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We acknowledge Hanover\u2019s contention that allowing recovery under Shedd\u2019s policy in this case contradicts the statutory intent of the 1988 automobile insurance amendments which were aimed at holding \u201ceach named insured responsible for the extent of his or her underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>Dullea </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra </em>at 40, citing <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra </em>at 149-150. And yet we will not interpret the disputed policy language against the insured when we find that language to be clear and unambiguous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>even if inconsistent with the authorizing statutory framework. Cf. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bearce, </em>412 Mass. 442, 448 (1992), quoting <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 453 (1985) (where policy language was favored to the insurer, \u201cno matter how explicit the [policy] language may be, it cannot prevail if it is contrary to the statutory language or the legislative policy of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L\u201d). The Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) authorized this language in automobile policies for the year 1990, and the Shedds were entitled to rely on the common meaning of the language used in the policy they purchased from Hanover. They might reasonably have believed its provisions for underinsured motorist coverage would protect each household member named therein. As it is our responsibility to \u201cconsider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered,\u201d <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990), we will respect this justifiable reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">As we have noted, the commissioner revised this language in subsequent years to give unambiguous effect to the Legislature\u2019s intention, but during the year in which this reliance may have been created by the official charged with translating the intent of the Legislature into the language of insurance policies put out among the public, it would be unjust to solve the problem created by the commissioner\u2019s misleading draftsmanship by sacrificing the reliance of the public whom the commissioner is charged to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\">After Hanover commenced this action, both parties submitted motions for summary judgment to determine how the \u201cproviding similar coverage\u201d language effected entitlements to underinsured motorist coverage. On January 20, 1994, the judge denied both motions, but held that, if Hilary was determined to be a household member for the purposes of the Hanover policy, then her estate was entitled to recover damages pursuant to the Hanover underinsured motorist coverage which Shedd had purchased, to the extent that damages exceeded the $100,000 already recovered from the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. The extent of the Shedds\u2019 wrongful death damages has not yet been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Following discovery on the \u201chousehold member\u201d issue, both parties stipulated to Hilary\u2019s status as a household member so that judgment could be entered for the Shedds and the case would be ripe for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In both cases, the plaintiffs pointed out that the limited underinsured motorist coverage provided by the injured parties\u2019 Massachusetts insurance policies was of negligible worth because the limits ($10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident) were precisely calibrated to equal the compulsory liability limits in Massachusetts. In <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 144 (1994), the plaintiff argued that because every insured motor vehicle would have liability at or above these limits, the purported underinsured motorist coverage at issue would never come into play. <em>Id. </em>at 146. While conceding that the underinsured motorist coverage available was very limited as a practical matter, <em>id. </em>at 147. we rejected this argument and found that such coverage \u201cwas not illusory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
