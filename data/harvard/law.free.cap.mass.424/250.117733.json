L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E. This statute provides that an employee over age sixty-five, who has been out of the labor market for at least two years and is eligible for social security benefits, or benefits from a public or private pension paid for in part or entirely by an employer, will not be entitled to total or partial incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35, unless the employee can establish that, but for the injury, he or she would have remained active in the labor market. The statute goes on to create a rebuttable presumption of noneligibility for benefits for affected employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The employee\u2019s appeal was filed in the single justice session of the Appeals Court pursuant to that court\u2019s rule 2:04, and was reserved and reported by the single justice to a panel of that court. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. We reject the employee\u2019s arguments that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E, violates the equal protection and due process provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, that the statute is substantive in nature and therefore cannot be applied retroactively to his case, and that the statute is preempted by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 et seq. (1994), the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). We also reject the employee\u2019s request that the case be remanded for further evidence and findings on the issue of the application of the statute to him. Consequently, we affirm the decision of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The background of the case is as follows. The employee began to work for the town of Stoughton in 1978. He worked mostly as a custodian at the Stoughton police department, where his duties included cleaning and maintaining the facility. On September 27, 1988, the employee injured his shoulder while working on an overhead light fixture. As a result of the injury, surgery was performed on the employee\u2019s injured shoulder, and he received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from October 15, 1988, through October 29, 1991. On the latter date, after the employee had been out of the labor force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>for more than two years, he was sixty-five years of age. Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 66, set forth below,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an administrative judge terminated the employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits based on findings that the employee came within the provisions of \u00a7 35E, and he had not overcome the presumption created by the statute. The employee appealed from the administrative judge\u2019s decision to the reviewing board where two members of the three-judge panel rejected all his arguments. The third judge dissented on the basis that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E, was preempted by the ADEA. This appeal followed the reviewing board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">1. <em>Equal protection. </em>As an act of the Legislature, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E, is presumed constitutional. <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 576 (1991). \u201cFor the purpose of equal protection analysis, our standard of review under . . . the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is the same as under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>396 Mass. 740, 743 (1986). The employee is not a member of a \u201csuspect\u201d or \u201cquasi-suspect\u201d class simply because he is over sixty-five years old,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his interest in receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits obviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>does not involve a fundamental right. The statute, therefore, will overcome an equal protection challenge if it is rationally related to a legitimate State interest. <em>Take Five Vending, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>415 Mass. 741, 748 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">There are at least two rationales for the Legislature\u2019s enactment of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E. First, the statute is a benefit coordination provision. The workers\u2019 compensation law was designed to provide wage-loss protection to employees who are injured on the job and incur a loss of earning capacity from the injury. <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 256 (1994). Workers\u2019 compensation restores to the injured employee a portion of the wages made unavailable because of lost earning capacity. Social security and public or private pension programs are also designed to provide wage-loss protection, but do so on account of advanced age. Like workers\u2019 compensation, benefits from these sources provide an employee with a percentage of preretirement income. Without a benefit coordination provision, the combined payments from \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d through the receipt of both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and social security and pension payments could exceed the employee\u2019s preinjury average weekly wage. In furtherance of a legitimate State interest, the Legislature could rationally have enacted G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E, to coordinate benefits and thereby prevent the stacking of benefits derived from statutory and other schemes designed to serve a common purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The Legislature could also have enacted the statute to reduce the cost of workers\u2019 compensation premiums for employers who are paying into multiple benefit systems such as workers\u2019 compensation, social security, and pensions. Because \u00a7 35E makes it more difficult for employees eligible for social security or pensions also to collect workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the burden on employers is alleviated. This also provides a rational basis for the statute. For these reasons, there is universal agreement that statutes like G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E, promote legitimate governmental goals and do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>not violate rights of equal protection. See <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>404 U.S. 78, 82-84 (1971); <em>Rosa </em>v. <em>Warner Elec. Contracting, </em>849 P.2d 845, 848 (Colo. Ct. App. 1992), aff'd, 870 P.2d 1210 (Colo.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 814 (1994); <em>Acosta </em>v. <em>Kraco, Inc., </em>471 So. 2d 24, 25 (Fla.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1022 (1985); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>3 Kan. App. 2d 648, 653 (1979), aff'd, 227 Kan. 645, appeal dismissed, 449 U.S. 914 (1980); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>H.R. Beal &amp; Sons, </em>649 A.2d 1101, 1103 (Me. 1994); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>164 Mich. App. 580, 599 (1987), vacated on other grounds sub nom. <em>Pankow </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>432 Mich. 892 (1989); <em>McClanathan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>186 Mont. 56, 66 (1980); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Department of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>120 Wash. 2d 461, 478-481 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">2. <em>Due process. </em>The employee argues that \u00a7 35E contravenes the procedural due process protections contained in the Fourteenth Amendment and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because he reads the statute as preventing him and his family from testifying to rebut the presumption contained in the statute. The procedural due process protections involved in this area are subject to the same analysis under both the Federal and State Constitutions. <em>Liability Investigative Fund Effort, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Medical Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>418 Mass. 436, 443, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1058 (1994). The basic test is whether the challenged statute affords the aggrieved party \u201cthe opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976), quoting <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965). The statute clearly satisfies this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The employee misreads \u00a7 35E in concluding that he and members of his family are barred from testifying to defeat the presumption. The statute only provides that \u201c[t]he presumption of non-entitlement to benefits . . . shall not be overcome by the employee\u2019s uncorroborated testimony, or that corroborated only by any of his family members, that but for the injury, such employee would have remained active in the labor market.\u201d Testimony by the employee and his family members concerning his life, environment, and present and future work goals is certainly permissible under \u00a7 35E and should be considered by the administrative judge. We note that the reviewing board has held that \u201c\u00a7 35E does not say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>that an administrative judge should ignore all of an employee\u2019s testimony which bears on whether he intended to retire at age sixty-five. Indeed, much of that testimony is also relevant to the issue of diminution of earning capacity and motivation to return to work. Section 35E by its plain language simply says that the employee\u2019s testimony that he would have continued to work past age sixty-five \u2014 <em>standing alone </em>\u2014 will not carry the day and rebut the presumption of retirement. Either party may bring in witnesses or documents to verify or disprove the employee\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Harmon\u2019s Paint &amp; Wallpaper, </em>8 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 432, 437 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The statute\u2019s establishment of a rebuttable presumption also does not violate due process. Presumptions are simply rules of evidence that fall within the general power of government to adopt. <em>DiLoreto </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>383 Mass. 243, 248 (1981), quoting <em>Mobile, Jackson &amp; Kansas City R.R. </em>v. <em>Turnipseed, </em>219 U.S. 35, 42-43 (1910). The presumption disappears as soon as the employee introduces appropriate evidence to contradict it. See <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, ante </em>16, 19-25 (1996) (upholding G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A [2], which confers prima facie status to report of independent medical examiner, against procedural due process challenge). We conclude that the employee\u2019s due process challenge lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">3. <em>Retroactivity. </em>The employee argues that St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 66, which amended \u00a7 35E to add the presumption, is substantive in nature, and because he was injured before the effective date of the amendment, the earlier version of the statute, which did not contain the presumption of non-entitlement, applies to his case. There is no merit to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Section 107 of St. 1991, c. 398, provides a specific description of procedural and substantive portions of the amendments made to G. L. c. 152. Section 107 states that \u201c[ejxcept as specifically provided by [\u00a7\u00a7 103-106], inclusive, of this act, all sections of this act shall, for purposes of [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A], be deemed to be procedural in character.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Legislature did not designate the change adding the presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>tion in \u00a7 35E as a substantive provision in \u00a7\u00a7 103-106. \u201cTherefore, the plain language of \u00a7 107 indicates that the Legislature intended [the amendment to \u00a7 35E] to be a procedural provision. As a procedural provision, [the amended \u00a7 35E] has \u2018application to personal injuries irrespective of the date of their occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>418 Mass. 848, 851 (1994), quoting G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">4. <em>The ADEA. </em>The employee argues that the ADEA preempts G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not agree. The ADEA applies only to \u201cemployer practices\u201d that \u201cdiscriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623 (a). The ADEA thus concerns age-based discrimination against employees resulting from activities within the employer\u2019s control. The workers\u2019 compensation law is a uniform system of compensation that is mandated by governmental action, and the application of its terms and provisions is not controlled, or subject to control, by an employer. The provisions of G. L. c. 152 are not a discretionary component of the contractual employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>relationship that exists between the employer and employee and cannot be modified by the employer. As such, the provisions of G. L. c. 152 are not part of \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\u201d that an employer can establish. We conclude that the ADEA does not apply to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35E. See <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Department of Transp., </em>442 So. 2d 961, 962 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983), aff'd, 468 So. 2d 904 (Fla.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>474 U.S. 861 (1985); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>164 Mich. App. 580, 599 (1987).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">5. <em>Requested remand. </em>Lastly, the employee argues that the case should be remanded to the board with directions to remand it to the administrative judge for further proceedings in light of the reviewing board\u2019s <em>Harmon </em>decision, <em>supra. </em>The <em>Harmon </em>case was decided after the administrative judge\u2019s decision, but the <em>Harmon </em>decision was available to the employee when his appeal was before the reviewing board. The employee did not argue to the reviewing board that the case should be remanded for further findings or the presentation of additional evidence, and consequently, the reviewing board did not consider the issue. We also decline to consider it. See <em>Maguire\u2019s Case, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 338 n.1 (1983), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The decision of the reviewing board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 35E, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 66, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">\u201cAny employee who is at least sixty-five years of age and has been out of the labor force for a period of at least two years and is eligible for old age benefits pursuant to the federal social security act or eligible for benefits from a public or private pension which is paid in part or entirely by an employer shall not be entitled to benefits under sections thirty-four or thirty-five unless such employee can establish that but for the injury, he or she would have remained active in the labor market. The presumption of non-entitlement to benefits created by this section shall not be overcome by the employee\u2019s uncorroborated testimony, or that corroborated only by any of his family members, that but for the injury, such employee would have remained active in the labor market.

L. c. 152, \u00a7 75B, which concerns the rights of qualified handicapped persons so his reliance on that statute is not helpful to him. In any event, handicapped individuals are not members of a \u201csuspect\u201d class. See <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Tulsa, </em>977 F.2d 1415, 1420 (10th Cir. 1992); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>Lussier </em>v. <em>Dugger, </em>904 F.2d 661, 671 (11th Cir. 1990); <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>857 F.2d 559, 565 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>Edward B. </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>814 F.2d 52, 55-56 (1st Cir. 1987); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>650 F.2d 760, 766 (5th Cir. 1981).

The Attorney General\u2019s brief cites numerous Federal decisions holding that the provisions of ADEA requiring the filing of administrative claims before a court action is instituted are a bar to a court\u2019s consideration of a claim under ADEA. In a situation like this, where an insurer is seeking to terminate an employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits by reason of the effect of a State statute, requiring exhaustion of the employee\u2019s administrative remedy will serve no practical purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\">We note additional support for this conclusion in the applicable EEOC regulations, to which we look for guidance. See <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB </em>v. <em>Vinson, 477 </em>U.S. 57, 65 (1986). The Department of Labor\u2019s interpretation of the ADEA implicitly supports the argument that its prohibitions are limited to employment practices within the control of employers and do not encompass governmental actions such as workers\u2019 compensation laws. See <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Department of Transp., </em>442 So. 2d 961, 962-963 (Fla. Dist. Ct.

The courts in <em>O\u2019Neil </em>and <em>Peck </em>cite the original ADEA regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 860.1 et seq. (1983). Regulations governing the ADEA are now codified at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 et seq. (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
