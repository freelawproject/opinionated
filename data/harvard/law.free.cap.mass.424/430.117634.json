(JRC), the patients at JRC, their parents and guardians, and the office for children (OFC).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After trial, the judge concluded that the department had violated the settlement agreement; enjoined the department from failing to comply with the terms of the agreement; appointed a receiver to administer, manage, and operate the department in all of its relationships with JRC; and awarded attorney\u2019s fees to JRC, counsel for the parents, and counsel for the class of patients.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted the department\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>This contempt action has its origin in a lawsuit brought in 1986 by JRC, the class of all patients at JRC, their parents and guardians, against OFC alleging that OFC had engaged in bad faith regulatory and licensing activities and violated the civil rights of the patients. On June 4, 1986, the judge entered a preliminary injunction enjoining OFC from enforcing its orders and concluded in extensive findings that the director of OFC had engaged in bad faith regulation of JRC, and that her termination of JRC\u2019s treatment procedures was without medical support, leaving the program an \u201cempty shell for those [patients] who require aversives as part of their treatment.\u201d The judge farther found that the director of OFC attempted to hide the lack of clinical support for her decision by altering her own agency\u2019s laudatory report of JRC, and by sending an evaluation team, biased against the use of aversive therapy, to conduct an \u201cobjective\u201d evaluation of the JRC program. The judge therefore found that the director\u2019s orders constituted arbitrary treatment decisions that \u201cplayfed] \u2018Russian Roulette\u2019 with the lives and safety of the [patients] at [JRC].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The preliminaiy injunction was upheld by a single justice of the Appeals Court, who ruled that there was ample evidence to support both the judge\u2019s entry of injunctive relief and her conclusion that the director of OFC acted in \u201cbad faith in [her] handling of the status of [JRC\u2019s] license and its treatment programs.\u201d Subsequently, the plaintiff class, JRC, and OFC entered into the settlement agreement which forms the basis of this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge approved the settlement agreement on January 7, 1987, and incorporated it as an or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>der of the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 1993, JRC brought this contempt action, alleging that the department had repeatedly violated the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The following facts are derived from the judge\u2019s findings, which she made after a thirteen-day trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In 1991, JRC applied to be recertified in the use of \u201cLevel III\u201d aversive behavior modification techniques.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ment assigned a team to evaluate the application and to make a site visit to JRC. The team visited JRC on December 9 and 10, 1991, reviewed voluminous materials, and met with a number of employees at JRC. An assistant general counsel of the department who was a member of the team prepared a report dated December 21, 1991. The report recommended that JRC be recertified to employ aversive procedures, subject to five conditions which were characterized as \u201cminor.\u201d The report included compliments about JRC which \u201cconcluded that the programs at JRC were in conformity with [the department] regulations and the directives of the Bristol County Probate Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Almost six months after the report was submitted, the department\u2019s director of quality assurance notified the executive director of JRC that the department had \u201caccepted the recommendations of the team.\u201d The department, however, did not grant certification to JRC at this time even though that was the recommendation of the review team.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">One month after JRC received the letter stating that the recommendations of the review team had been accepted, the department\u2019s director of quality assurance sent another letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>to JRC\u2019s executive director stating that two new behavioral programs, the \u201cSpecialized Food Program\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the \u201cGED Program,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had been brought to her attention and needed to be reviewed as part of the recertification process. A second review team, which also included the department\u2019s assistant general counsel, was sent to JRC for a site visit and concluded that JRC had complied with all five prior conditions of certification in the December 21, 1991, report and that there were no adverse health effects from either the \u201cGED-4\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or the Specialized Food Program. The judge found that \u201c[i]t was clear that the team found JRC to be in full compliance with the regulations.\u201d Indeed, the team reported that \u201cthere is no reason to change the previous recommendation that JRC retain its certification to employ Level III interventions in behavior modification programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Despite the recommendations of the review teams, the department did not certify JRC. No one in the department spoke to the assistant general counsel about the 1993 report, and, to his knowledge, no one in the department spoke to any members of the team concerning the 1993 report. The commissioner, however, asserted that the 1993 certification team report was not complete because it had not been signed by one member of the review team who had since left the department. The judge also found that neither the 1991 report nor the 1993 report was ever read by the commissioner or the assistant commissioner for quality assurance. Nevertheless, some of the information found in the certification team reports was used in communications to parents, funding agencies, and the court. Despite using this information, however, the commissioner \u201cnever revealed the existence of or sent a copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of the 1991 or 1993 certification reports to the Court Monitor, JRC, the funding agencies of JRC, the parents of JRC [patients], or the Court.\u201d Rather, the department, led by the commissioner, began a regulatory barrage of JRC that was to last two years.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">On August 6, 1993, the department mailed the first of several letters to JRC. While the letter purported to grant \u201cinterim certification\u201d to JRC, the judge found that \u201cit was in reality the first volley in a series of actions designed to put JRC out of business.\u201d The letter, which followed the favorable report of the 1993 review team by just a few weeks, stated that the department had found \u201ccontinued and repeated noncompliance [by JRC] with the requirements of [department] regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Following the August 6, letter, JRC requested a meeting with the department and the court monitor pursuant to a provision in the settlement agreement. Between 1987 and at least as late as March, 1993, JRC and the department utilized a court monitor appointed pursuant to the settlement agreement to settle disputes. However, following the August 6, letter, the department declined to meet with JRC if the court monitor was to participate. After JRC\u2019s attempt at mediation failed, JRC then responded to the August 6, letter on August 27, 1993, by delivering a written point-by-point refutation of the allegations contained in the letter of August 6, accompanied by three cubic feet of documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">On August 31, 1993, the department sent JRC another letter stating that the department had learned from a source \u201cother than JRC\u201d that there were problems with misfirings of the GED. JRC, the commissioner wrote, was \u201cin violation of [the department] regulations\u201d but the department would \u201cgive [JRC] further opportunity to provide information.\u201d The letter set forth a number of conditions that JRC was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>meet to receive interim certification. One of the conditions, condition 1, restricted the use of certain procedures at JRC. The judge found that this \u201cdirectly contradicted orders of this Court\u201d and that the commissioner \u201cadministratively overruled outstanding orders of this Court\u201d in violation of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Another condition of the letter, condition 10, required JRC to notify all funding sources that there must be in place within sixty days an emergency plan to address the funding and logistics of any unexpected medical, personal, or programmatic situations which JRC deemed were beyond its capacity to address. The condition went on to state that the plans \u201cmust provide evidence of the funder\u2019s ability to immediately provide all needed services for such clients so as to ensure that the client is not substantially endangered.\u201d The commissioner testified that this condition was based on prior situations where JRC had unexpectedly discharged patients. The commissioner, however, could only identify one such discharge that had occurred in 1991, and he acknowledged that other providers had unexpectedly terminated patients and that no similar condition had ever been imposed on a provider. The judge found that this condition was purposely designed to obstruct JRC\u2019s intake of new patients by alarming funding agencies and was in fact part of a plan to place JRC into receivership or to put JRC out of business..</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On September 20, 1993, JRC, the department, and the court monitor reached an agreement whereby JRC would not have to comply with condition 10. Despite this agreement, however, the department mailed copies of the August 6, and August 31, 1993, letters to all of JRC\u2019s funding agencies. The letter contained condition 10, despite the agreement modifying condition 10 that had been reached between JRC and the department. Moreover, the judge found that \u201c[i]t was not customary practice to keep funding agencies advised of the certification process. [The] [commissioner could not explain why it was important to send these letters out [and] could not offer an explanation as to why funding agencies were not advised in this mailing that [condition 10 had been modified.\u201d The judge concluded that the mailings were made in bad faith with the intent to interfere with JRC\u2019s relationships with its funding agencies. In addition, on September 22, 1993, the department filed an unsolicited \u201cReport to the Court\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>concerning JRC\u2019s \u201cstatus.\u201d Although the document contained numerous reports concerning JRC, including the August 6, and August 31, letters, it did not contain the two favorable certification reports. The judge also found that the report contained \u201cblatant false statements and material omissions\u201d and that the department failed to include the favorable certification recommendation because \u201cthey would have contradicted [the department\u2019s] report to the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">On September 24, 1993, the department sent JRC another certification letter addressed to JRC\u2019s executive director indicating that certification would be granted conditionally until December 15, 1993. The letter, which was also sent to funding agencies, stated that there were fourteen abuse investigations arising from complaints by former JRC staff and patients. In addition, the letter stated that the allegations were \u201cquite serious on their face, and include claims that [JRC\u2019s executive director] personally [was] involved in, or responsible for, abuse against specific [JRC] clients.\u201d The commissioner testified, however, that revealing information about abuse charges prior to having them substantiated was a departure from the department\u2019s acknowledged practice. In addition, the commissioner conceded that, although the allegations were investigated and not substantiated, the department never sent out a letter so advising the funding agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On December 15, 1993, the commissioner sent JRC yet another letter which stated that \u201c[y]our failure to report a death in 1991 made it impossible for me to fulfil my responsibilities .... [JRC] has in the past failed to report deaths and serious injuries as required by law.\u201d Again, a copy of this letter was sent to funding agencies. The commissioner admitted in his testimony that his reference to \u201cdeaths\u201d was an error and reasoned that it was a typographical error. The judge concluded that the error was intentional, finding that no patient had died at JRC in 1991, and the only death remotely involved was the death of a patient in 1990 which was reported by JRC and that, contrary to the commissioner\u2019s testimony, the document did contain sufficient information for an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In addition to sending out numerous letters to JRC regarding the certification process, from at least September 7, 1993, until the spring of 1994, the commissioner instituted \u201cTuesday Morning Meetings.\u201d These meetings were attended at times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>by a \u201clarge group\u201d of individuals and at other times by a \u201csmall group\u201d of individuals. The commissioner and the assistant commissioner for quality assurance testified that the meetings were held strictly to deal with issues of certification. These meetings did not, in fact, deal strictly with certification. Rather, the judge concluded that a plan was developed at the September 7, 1993, meeting to disrupt the operations of JRC by every conceivable means, including interfering with the financial operations of JRC and disrupting JRC\u2019s relationships with funding agencies and parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">One of the work plans from the Tuesday morning meetings stated that December 15, 1993, was \u201cD-Day\u201d for JRC. The December 15 date coincided with the date JRC\u2019s temporary certification was expected to expire and fell just a few days after the department expected to receive a report from an \u201cindependent\u201d consulting firm (Rivendell review team), which had been selected by the department to conduct an independent review of JRC. Such a review was suggested by the assistant commissioner for quality assurance to the commissioner because she alleged that prior evaluations, including the certification reports of 1991 and 1993, were insufficient. The judge, however, found that the Rivendell review team was anything but \u201cindependent\u201d because the head of the Rivendell review team had previously signed a document entitled \u201cCall to Action by Amnesty International,\u201d which equated the use of aversives with political torture. The judge found that attachments to the \u201cCall to Action\u201d were directed at JRC and made \u201cserious and outrageous claims of mistreatment\u201d by JRC. In addition, the judge concluded that the assistant commissioner for quality assurance\u2019s allegation that reports of prior review teams were not sufficient was \u201cnot truthful [because] she acknowledged that she had not even seen the 1993 certification report until sometime in April 1995.\u201d Moreover, the judge concluded that the \u201crequest for a proposal\u201d (RFP) process whereby the assistant commissioner for quality assurance solicited bids for the independent program review was inconsistent with the Commonwealth\u2019s policy because the RFP contained only a ten-day turn-around time and was only sent to a select group of recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In January of 1994, the department arranged a meeting with a New York agency that funded patients at JRC. JRC learned of the meeting and requested that a guardian ad litem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>be allowed to attend. After agreeing to this request the department canceled the meeting. JRC then requested in writing that it be notified of any future meetings or telephone conferences with the New York agency. Nevertheless, department ofiicials held a telephone conference with representatives of the New York agency without notifying JRC. On February 28, 1994, the New York agency wrote to the parents of all New York patients at JRC and told them that alternative placements for their children would be offered in New York. The judge concluded that \u201cthe meeting with New York officials was a continuation of the [cjommissioner\u2019s campaign of interfering with JRC\u2019s relationship [s] with its funding agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On February 9, 1994, the department sent JRC a letter requiring JRC to comply with twelve more conditions by May 8, 1994. If JRC fully complied, the department agreed to certify JRC for two years. One of the conditions was that JRC rewrite all of its behavior modification treatment plans (approximately fifty-five) and allow two new psychiatrists and physicians to conduct independent psychiatric and medical evaluations on every JRC patient (approximately sixty patients) within eighty days. The commissioner did not read the reports of these psychiatrists, and not one of the evaluations recommended the discontinuation of Level III treatment procedures. Moreover, the judge found that the commissioner could not identify any credible reason for the imposition of the condition regarding medical evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In the spring of 1994, the department and JRC began six weeks of intensive negotiations regarding the conditions of certification contained in the February 9, 1994, letter. An agreement was reached on July 5, 1994, in which the department extended JRC\u2019s certification to December 31, 1994. The department also agreed that the rewritten behavior modification plans would be submitted on a weekly basis. The assistant commissioner for quality assurance and a psychologist at JRC developed a prototype treatment plan based on one of JRC\u2019s most difficult patients. This treatment plan, which was approved by the assistant commissioner for quality assurance, became the model by which every other treatment plan was to be written. The department, however, later alleged that the behavior modification plans submitted by a psychologist at JRC did not comply with department regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The allegation that the plans did not comply with department regulations was made in a letter dated January 20, 1995. This letter also purported to extend JRC\u2019s certification, provided that six new conditions were satisfied, one of which required JRC to discontinue Level III interventions for six individuals, including an individual in a related case, <em>Guardianship of Brandon, post </em>482 (1997), a patient at JRC who had been the subject of a recent five-day treatment plan review by a Probate Court judge. The January 20 letter also required that JRC discontinue the Specialized Food Program. JRC requested mediation of the dispute but there was no response until April 7, 1995, when a department official stated that the department remained \u201copen to addressing . . . any issue JRC may have regarding the certification process.\u201d That response, however, was meaningless because the department decertified JRC on March 23, 1995, effective July 1, 1995. On March 24, 1995, a preliminary injunction was entered enjoining the department from decertifying JRC.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The judge interpreted the settlement agreement to require that \u201cdecisions on treatment were reserved for the Court.\u201d She also found that part B of the settlement agreement appointed a court monitor who was to undertake a general monitoring of JRC\u2019s programs and to arbitrate any disputes between the parties. Finally, the judge noted that part L of the settlement agreement required the parties to discharge their obligations under the terms of the agreement in good faith. The judge concluded that, on the basis of these facts, \u201c[t]he provisions of the court-ordered settlement agreement are clear and unequivocal commands which are binding on the defendant. . . . The defendant is in contempt having clearly and undoubtedly disobeyed the Order of this Court.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">1. <em>The contempt finding. </em>In order to hold a party in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>contempt, the judge must find \u201ca clear and undoubted disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command.\u201d <em>Warren Gardens Hous. Coop. </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>420 Mass. 699, 700 (1995), quoting <em>United Factory Outlet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>361 Mass. 35, 36 (1972). See <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>342 Mass. 462, 464 (1961). Where the order is ambiguous or the disobedience is doubtful, there cannot be a finding of contempt. <em>United States Time Corp. </em>v. <em>G.E.M. of Boston, Inc., </em>345 Mass. 279, 282-283 (1963). The burden of proof in a contempt \u2018action is on the complainant to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Quality Eng\u2019g, </em>381 Mass. 208, 212 (1980). Questions of law, including the judge\u2019s interpretation of the settlement agreement, are afforded plenary review, <em>Warren Gardens Hous. Coop. </em>v. <em>Clark, supra </em>at 701; the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the contempt finding is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Wattendorf, </em>353 Mass. 315, 317 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The department argues that, even if the judge\u2019s findings of fact were grounded in the evidence, they would not support a judgment of contempt because they do not show any \u201cclear and undoubted disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command.\u201d Rather, the department argues that the judge misinterpreted the settlement agreement, and that in any case, the terms of the settlement agreement are too vague and ambiguous to support a finding of contempt. We, therefore, look to the settlement agreement to determine whether the judge properly interpreted it and whether it contains a clear and unequivocal command to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">a. <em>The settlement agreement. </em>Part A of the settlement agreement provides: \u201cAversive procedures are permitted for use at [JRC] <em>only </em>when authorized as part of a court-ordered \u2018substituted judgment\u2019 treatment plan for an <em>individual </em>client\u201d (emphasis added). The judge concluded, and we agree, that this provision clearly provides that the courts were to make the ultimate decision regarding individual treatment programs. See <em>Matter of McKnight, </em>406 Mass. 787, 790 (1990) (stating JRC and department had \u201csettlement agreement concerning . . . authorization, by way of substituted judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ment, of the use of aversive procedures on clients at [JRC]\u201d). Thus, a petitioner seeking authorization to use aversive treatments must present evidence that an individual would, if competent, consent to the aversive treatment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, </em>398 Mass. 288, 295 (1986).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If the judge so finds, an order is entered authorizing the use of such treatments. <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 757 (1977) (\u201c[s]hould the probate judge then be satisfied that the incompetent individual would, as determined by the [substituted judgment proceeding], have chosen to forgo potentially life-prolonging treatment, the judge shall issue the appropriate order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">This requirement is consistent with the department\u2019s regulations, which also provide that a judge, through substituted judgment proceedings, must authorize aversive treatments if an individual cannot give informed consent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, it has long been established that the courts are the appropriate bodies to make such decisions for individuals who cannot make those decisions for themselves. See <em>Matter of Spring, </em>380 Mass. 629, 635 (1980) (stating that \u201cwe disapprove^ the delegation of the ultimate decision-making responsibility to any committee, panel or group, ad hoc or permanent\u201d); <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 759 (\u201c[S]uch questions of life and death seem to us to require the process of detached but passionate investigation and decision that forms the ideal on which the judicial branch of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>government was created. Achieving this ideal is our responsibility and that of the lower court, and is not to be entrusted to any other group purporting to represent the \u2018morality and conscience of our society,\u2019 no matter how highly motivated or impressively constituted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">That the settlement agreement reserved to the judge the ultimate decision on an individual\u2019s treatment does not mean, however, that the department gave up its regulatory authority over JRC\u2019s programs and facilities.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, there is no provision in the agreement that provides the department gave up any regulatory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In fact other provisions of the settlement agreement provide the contrary. The plain language of part C of the agreement provided that the Department of Mental Health (the department\u2019s predecessor) was to license JRC\u2019s facilities.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The settlement agreement also requires that JRC continue to follow all applicable regulations concerning periodic review of individualized educational plans and individual service plans. We note also that, to read the agreement as a delegation of all regulatory authority, would implicate serious constitutional issues.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The settlement agreement, like the regulations, recognizes the judge\u2019s authority to protect the legal rights of the patients by making the ultimate treatment decisions for individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>while reserving to the department regulatory authority over JRC\u2019s program and facilities. This distinction between individual treatment plans and treatment programs, however, need not conflict. Any significant changes relating to an individual\u2019s treatment, such as the decertification of the program, can be brought to the attention of the judge, who can then modify the substituted judgment order. See <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 730-731 n.3 (\u201cwe emphasize that upon receiving evidence of a significant change either in the medical condition of Saikewicz or in the medical treatment available to him for successful treatment of his condition, the probate judge may issue a further order\u201d). See <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>New England Sinai Hosp., Inc., </em>398 Mass. 417, 442 n.41 (1986) (\u201cthe new judgment should, of course, include a provision for modification . . . should any significant change or developments ensue\u201d). Indeed, to ensure that treatment plans authorized by the judge are properly implemented, we have stated that a \u201cjudge may delegate to a guardian the power to monitor the treatment process to ensure that the substituted-judgment treatment plan is followed.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489, 504 (1983). The settlement agreement itself provided that the court monitor would report to the judge regarding JRC\u2019s adherence to the treatment plan; thus, the department\u2019s arguments that such a reading of the settlement agreement would allow JRC to implement aversive treatments without regulation are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We recognize, of course, that \u201c[a] court . . . may not properly exercise the functions of the executive branch of State government.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Isaac, </em>419 Mass. 602, 605 (1995), quoting <em>Matter of McKnight, </em>406 Mass. 787, 792 (1990). See <em>Guardianship of Anthony, </em>402 Mass. 723, 727 (1988). Indeed, it is fundamental that a judge\u2019s order should and could not ignore the department\u2019s authority regarding certification requirements or compliance with applicable regulations. To do so would violate the principles of separation of powers by usurping an executive function. <em>Charrier </em>v. <em>Charrier, </em>416 Mass. 105, 110 (1993). It is not usurping an executive function, however, to require that the judge\u2019s order, authorizing the use of certain treatments entered at the time a program is certified to use aversive treatments, cannot be unilaterally overridden by an executive agency. Indeed, allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ing the department to ignore a judge\u2019s order would intrude on the function of the courts, for there is no doubt that the ability to enter orders is necessary to the very existence of the court and essential to the maintenance of the court\u2019s authority. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>394 Mass. 624, 631 (1985) (\u201ccourt must have power to carry out its obligation[s]\u201d). It is just this sort of intrusion that art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights prohibits. <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. 53, 56 (1989). Thus, requiring the department to seek to modify the original treatment orders before instituting any change respects the power and authority of both the executive and judicial branches of government.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Thus any unilateral interference by the department in a court-ordered treatment would support a contempt finding. It is not decisive that the agreement did not mention the department by name, for by becoming a party to an agreement that clearly provided that <em>only </em>the judge was to make these decisions, the department was bound not to interfere with individual treatment plans authorized by the judge. See <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, </em>374 Mass. 79, 89 (1977) (rejecting argument that legal liability cannot attach for failure to comply with implicit requirements). Cf. <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Capital Site Mgt. Co., </em>423 Mass. 172, 178 (1996) (\u201cA person who was not a party to an action in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>an order was entered may in certain circumstances be found to be in contempt of that order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">b. <em>Bad faith. </em>Having concluded that the department\u2019s interference with individual treatment plans can support a finding of contempt, we look next at the findings of the department\u2019s bad faith regulatory practices. The agreement states that \u201ceach party shall discharge its obligations under the terms of this agreement, in good faith.\u201d The department argues that, because no other provisions in the agreement speak to how the department is obligated to regulate JRC, there can be no violation of the good faith clause. Indeed, according to the department, any findings relating to the certification process are \u201cimmaterial\u201d and cannot support a finding of contempt because, absent such a provision, there cannot be a \u201cclear and undoubted disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command.\u201d <em>United Factory Outlet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>361 Mass. 35, 36 (1972). We disagree, leaving aside the implication of the argument that there is no obligation on the part of the department apart from the agreement to regulate in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">It should be kept in mind also that, in the litigation that the agreement sought to settle, the court had found that the department\u2019s predecessor had engaged in bad faith regulation of JRC. It is in this context that part L of the settlement agreement must be read. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of Chicago, </em>799 F.2d 281, 292 (7th Cir. 1986) (good faith provision cannot be read in vacuum). Where, as here, the agreement as a whole contemplates that the department will continue to regulate JRC, see note 17, <em>supra, </em>and contains a good faith provision, the provision applies to the regulation of JRC by the department and is not so ambiguous as to preclude a finding of contempt. Indeed, while we have refused to hold a defendant in contempt if, in order to do so, we would have to expand the scope of an underlying order beyond its plain meaning, <em>Peggy Lawton Kitchens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>403 Mass. 732, 734-735 (1989), we have upheld findings of contempt where an order, although subject to some legal interpretation, has nonetheless provided sufficient notice to the party bound by the order that its actions could form the basis for contempt. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>342 Mass. 462, 464-465 (1961) (\u201clawful\u201d operation of business, while confusing term, nonetheless sufficient basis for contempt proceedings). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u201cgood faith\u201d provision, while subject to some legal interpretation, is certainly not so ambiguous as to fail to put the department on notice that improper regulation of IRC could subject it to contempt proceedings. Indeed, good faith provisions are implied in all contracts, <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 471 (1991), and ensure that the substance and purpose of the agreement is given effect. <em>Warner Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>406 Mass. 354, 362 n.9 (1990), quoting <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>361 Mass. 24, 33 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Not only is a contempt finding appropriate because the department did not regulate IRC in good faith, a contempt finding is appropriate where \u201csteps are taken to subvert the decree.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of Chicago, supra </em>at 296. Thus, while judges will not read into an order additional terms, <em>Peggy Lawton Kitchens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hogan, supra </em>at 734-735, judges will not allow a party to do indirectly what an order makes clear he cannot do directly. <em>Stodder </em>v. <em>Rosen Talking Mach. Co., </em>247 Mass. 60, 68 (1923) (\u201c[cjourts will not permit defendants to evade responsibility for violating an injunction, by doing through subterfuge a thing which is not in terms a violation, yet produces the same effect by accomplishing substantially that which they were enjoined from doing\u201d). See <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, supra </em>at 89-90 (where defendants enjoined from taking affirmative action to encourage labor strike, provision of order enjoining them from condoning such action was sufficiently clear to put them on notice that failure to act in appropriate situations would render them liable). To allow such behavior would undermine the efficacy of court decrees and allow anyone to flout the judicial branch. In the instant case then, it would be absurd to conclude that, although the agreement was intended to settle claims that the department\u2019s predecessor was improperly denying the patients needed aversive therapy, the department could, through bad faith regulatory practices, ensure that no individual could receive aversive therapies at IRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">While we agree that part A and part L of the settlement agreement provided \u201cclear and unequivocal command [s]\u201d that would support a finding of contempt, we doubt whether the \u201cimpermissibly obstructed\u201d language of part C and the arbitration provisions of part B-2 can be similarly character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ized. Because we conclude that contempt was justified apart from these provisions, we do not rely on these provisions of the settlement agreement in reaching our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We reach our decision, as we must in a contempt action, based on the plain language of the settlement agreement. See <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of Provincetown </em>v. <em>Eder, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1011 (1981). We note, however, that the circumstances and history surrounding the settlement agreement and the ensuing relationship between the department and JRC supports our reading of the settlement agreement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The action that resulted in the settlement agreement was brought because the parents and guardians of JRC patients alleged that OFC was denying individual patients their constitutional rights to certain treatments and was not regulating JRC in good faith. The settlement agreement sought to remedy this situation while allowing the department to continue to fulfil its statutory duties to regulate mental health facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In sum, we have considered the many arguments the department makes with respect to the settlement agreement, and conclude that the settlement agreement was not, in significant respects, too ambiguous to support a finding of contempt. Indeed, while we are sensitive to the fact that \u201c[ajmbiguity lurks in generality and may thus become an instrument of severity,\u201d <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, supra </em>at 89, quoting <em>McComb </em>v. <em>Jacksonville Paper Co., </em>336 U.S. 187, 297 (1949) (Frankfurter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>J., dissenting), such danger is not presented by upholding the contempt findings in this case. Finally, we note that the settlement agreement has been in effect since 1986. If the department had felt that the agreement did not clearly define what it could or could not do, the proper remedy would be for the department to have brought an action asking for clarification of the order. <em>Id. </em>at 91, citing <em>Coyne Indus. Laundry of Schenectady, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>359 Mass. 269, 275-276 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">c. <em>Whether the judge was warranted in finding contempt. </em>Having concluded that the settlement agreement provided clear and unequivocal commands, the next question is whether there was \u201cclear and undoubted disobedience\u201d of those commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In general, a judge\u2019s findings of facts in a contempt proceeding are reviewed using the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). The department argues, however, that, while the clearly erroneous standard is generally the applicable standard, the circumstances of this case call for the standard to be applied more strictly. We disagree. While it is true that stricter scrutiny may be warranted in cases where the judge\u2019s findings fail to evidence a \u201cbadge of personal analysis,\u201d in the instant case, the findings of the judge \u201cso revised [JRC\u2019s] proposed findings and conclusions \u2018that it is clear that the findings are the product of [her] independent judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 465 (1991), quoting <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>381 Mass. 234, 237, 238 (1980). Contrary to the department\u2019s claim, the judge did not adopt the proposed findings of IRC and make \u201cvirtually no changes of any substance in adopting these findings.\u201d Rather, IRC proposed many findings that the judge refused to adopt, and she heavily edited many of the findings suggested by IRC. The judge also rejected certain characterizations suggested by IRC. Moreover, she accepted proposed findings of fact from both IRC and the department, and while the judge incorporated few, if any, of the department\u2019s proposed findings, that is a proper exercise of her role as fact finder as long as her findings are supported by the evidence. Indeed, the conclusions of law section of the judge\u2019s decision \u201cleaves no doubt that the judge adopted the findings proposed . . . because they accurately expressed [her] decision after [her] consideration of the evidence and [her] evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Edinburg </em>v. <em>Cavers, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 219 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>What the clearly erroneous standard means is that \u201c[the judge\u2019s] findings \u2018come here well armed with the buckler and shield.\u2019 \u201d <em>First Pa. Mtge. Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, </em>395 Mass. 614, 621 (1985), quoting <em>Matter of Multiponics, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 709, 723 (5th Cir. 1980). We are \u201cbound by [her] findings of fact which are supported by the evidence, which include inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Subaru of New England, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 396, 405 (1982). Thus, we shall not \u201creview questions of fact found by the trial judge, where such findings are supported \u2018on any reasonable view of the evidence, including all rational inferences of which it was susceptible.\u2019 \u201d <em>First Pa. Mtge. Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, supra </em>at 624, quoting <em>T.L. Edwards, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>371 Mass. 895, 896 (1976). Moreover, while there is substantial documentary evidence before us, there is also significant oral testimony, including oral testimony about those documents, and \u201c[w]hen the evidence is of mixed character \u2014 live and documentary \u2014 it is settled that the clearly erroneous standard applies to both categories.\u201d <em>Cornwall </em>v. <em>Forger, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 338 (1989). Finally, our standard of review also does not change because of the subject matter of the findings and the severity of the relief predicated on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">With the appropriate standard in mind, we now review the evidence to determine whether a finding of contempt was warranted. It is not necessary for us to review all 304 findings that led to the contempt order. Rather we think it appropriate to review some of the most egregious behavior of the commissioner and the department that warranted the contempt finding and the remedies imposed by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">d. <em>Part A of the settlement agreement. </em>The judge found that the department violated part A of the agreement by, inter alia, ordering JRC by letter dated January 20, 1995,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> to discontinue use of court-authorized procedures for six JRC patients.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The department argues that the judge mischaracterized the condition in the letter requiring JRC to discontinue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Level III interventions for the six patients. Rather, the department argues that the letter gave JRC the choice of revising the treatment plans either to conform to the department\u2019s regulations (and to apply for recertification) or to exclude Level III aversives. The department also argues that the existing treatment plans were to remain in effect until new plans were approved in accordance with the department\u2019s regulations, including those regulations that required a substituted judgment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">It is true that the letter of January 20, 1995, gave an option; the option, however, was not the department\u2019s to give. The settlement agreement (and the department\u2019s own regulations, 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.14 [4], [5]) makes clear that the judge was to make the ultimate decision regarding the treatment plan of individuals. See <em>supra </em>at 18-20. As discussed previously, if the department had new information, i.e., that the program was no longer certified, the proper course would be to bring that new information to the judge. It was not to contradict the judge\u2019s orders which authorized certain treatments and order JRC, who had authorization to use aversive therapies for individual patients, to go back to the judge with new treatment plans or to modify treatment plans so as to exclude aversive therapies. Indeed, the letter mandated that if, after thirty days, JRC did not apply to be recertified in the use of Level III interventions for the six individuals, JRC must begin modifying the treatment plans to exclude Level III aversives. That the department may or may not have been acting in good faith is irrelevant \u2014 good faith is not a defense to a charge of contempt. <em>United Factory Outlet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>361 Mass. 35, 38 (1972) (\u201cgood faith,\u201d \u201cabsence of wilful disobedience,\u201d and \u201clack of intent to violate a decree do not constitute a valid defence for a corporation charged with civil contempt\u201d). Thus, the judge\u2019s conclusion that the department violated part A of the settlement agreement by interfering with the treatment plans of six individuals is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">e. <em>Part L of the settlement agreement. </em>The judge found that part L of the settlement agreement was violated when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>commissioner \u201cdeparted from ordinary Department practice by . . . holding weekly meeting[s] with high-level staff to discuss JRC.\u201d At these meetings, \u201ca plan was formulated to disrupt the operations of JRC by every conceivable means \u2014 to allege that clients were being abused; to interfere with financial operations; to disrupt JRC\u2019s relationships with funding agencies, as well as parents; and other activities which have absolutely no bearing on the legitimate exercise of regulatory authority.\u201d Moreover, the judge concluded that the commissioner, who testified that the meetings were held strictly to deal with the recertification issue, tried to conceal the true purposes of these meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Clearly, a finding that the department developed and acted on a plan to interfere with JRC and put it out of business would warrant the conclusion that the department was regulating JRC in bad faith, for it \u201ccarries an implication of a dishonest purpose, conscious doing of wrong, or breach of duty through motive of self-interest or ill will.\u201d <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Millis Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal, Inc., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 998, 999-1000 (1981), citing <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Beacon Participations, Inc., </em>297 Mass. 398, 416-417 (1937). Indeed, if the judge\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, then \u201cbad faith can reasonably be inferred from the evidence.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>University of Mass. Medical Ctr., </em>417 Mass. 104, 110 (1994). The department argues, however, that the judge erred in concluding that the commissioner attempted to conceal the subject of these meetings from the judge and that the judge\u2019s findings on this subject form the basis for her conclusions of perjury, government malfeasance, and attorney misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Our review of the evidence leads us to conclude that the judge was warranted in finding that the commissioner did in fact testify that the meetings were held to deal strictly with certification issues.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Regardless, however, whether the commissioner attempted to conceal the subjects of these meetings, it is clear that the testimony at trial warranted a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the department had developed and acted on a plan to put JRC out of business and was regulating JRC in bad faith, and it is this conclusion that warrants a finding of contempt and the imposition of a receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Work plans and notes taken at these meetings included the notations \u201cDecember 15 - [JRC] D-Day\u201d and \u201cwhat would [JRC] have to do to <em>not </em>be certified: two areas a capacity to obey laws and efficacy of treatment\u201d (emphasis in original). There was also an agenda item on the issue of how Rhode Island was able to remove patients from JRC and \u201cturn over its clients to [another facility].\u201d In addition, the work plan agenda also reveal that the commissioner, contrary to department policy, was to brief a District of Columbia official on the status of an investigation of a patient at JRC before the investigation was complete, and that the commissioner\u2019s special assistant was to develop other contacts with out-of-State funding agencies. Indeed, the commissioner and his special assistant were assigned the task of researching whether Washington, D.C., had alternate placement plans for the JRC patient. The work plans also reveal that the department was researching former JRC staff and planned to distribute profiles on seven Massachusetts citizens who had transferred out of JRC. Based on this evidence, the judge\u2019s conclusion was not clearly erroneous that the work plans reflected a strategy to interfere with JRC\u2019s relationships with funding agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">There was also ample evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that the department planned to interfere with JRC\u2019s financial operations. The work plans reveal that, at these meetings, the commissioner undertook the task of confirming JRC\u2019s fiscal status even though the commissioner testified that a review of JRC\u2019s fiscal status had nothing to do with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>certification. An attorney, who was retained by the department to assist with JRC\u2019s certification application and was made a special assistant attorney general, was instructed to run title searches on all JRC property in order to determine whether there were any undisclosed related party transactions, even though the commissioner testified that he had no basis to believe there were any such transactions and conceded that the issue is the responsibility of the division of purchased services and not the department. The commissioner also testified that whether JRC property was leased or owned, had nothing to do with the issue of certification yet the assistant commissioner for quality assurance was assigned the task of determining whether JRC\u2019s property was leased or owned.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Finally, the work plans reveal that the department attempted to interfere with the rate at which JRC was reimbursed by the division of purchased services by arguing that the department and JRC should negotiate a rate for reimbursement rather than having the rate set by the division of purchased services and by arranging an unlawful \u201cpre-meeting\u201d between the department, the division of purchased services, and the Department of Education before JRC met with the division of purchased services and the Department of Education officials for a pricing meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Based on the testimony and the \u201cwork plans\u201d of the Tuesday morning meetings, there is no doubt that the judge\u2019s conclusions that the Tuesday morning meetings involved activities which had nothing to do with the certification (or regulatory) process and that the department developed a plan to put JRC out of business through interfering with JRC\u2019s relationships with funding agencies and JRC\u2019s fiscal operations are not clearly erroneous. Indeed, the work plans reveal that less than two months after the second review team had recommended that JRC be recertified, the department wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>a receivership petition prepared in case JRC went out of business.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, while the department argues \u201cdespite whatever the [cjommissioner and his staff may have discussed, planned, or desired, they did not close down [JRC], put it into receivership, or put it out of business,\u201d there is ample evidence to support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the commissioner interfered with JRC\u2019s operations without justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Further evidence of the department\u2019s plan to shut down JRC is found in its imposition of \u201ca severe and essentially constant burden on the JRC staff by having to respond to an unrelenting stream of bad faith regulatory demands and other bad faith conduct.\u201d Examples of the regulatory barrage launched by the department include demanding that JRC psychologists rewrite fifty-two behavior modification treatment plans that had previously been approved by the judge, requiring JRC to respond to fifty-six medical and forty-two psychiatric evaluations written by the psychiatrists and physicians retained by the department to examine all of the JRC patients \u201cwithout an analysis or even regard to whether any of these were clinically indicated,\u201d requiring JRC to provide a \u201clist of aversive techniques and an existing description of how such techniques are used at JRC\u201d even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>though this information was already given to a review team,\u201d and instigating more than fifty abuse investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The department argues that there was a good faith basis for requiring JRC to conduct independent psychiatric and medical reviews for all its patients. It was appropriate for the judge to conclude otherwise. The commissioner testified that no psychiatrist gave him any information which suggested a need for psychiatric evaluations or information that the Ghent\u2019s behavioral problems could be treated psychiatricahy. Moreover, the commissioner could not identify any physicians who had advised the department that there were unmet medical needs, and concurred that all JRC patients were in good health. Perhaps most telling, the commissioner testified that he had never read any of the reports written by the psychiatrists that the department had retained to examine JRC patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In addition to requiring JRC to respond to numerous requests for documents, the judge concluded that the regulatory barrage included numerous visits to JRC by department officials and others which distracted JRC staff from working with patients. Indeed, the judge found that, from late October through the end of December 1994, \u201cJRC was besieged with visits .... From August of 1993 to December of 1994, there were over 400 visits .. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">One such visit was by the Rivendell review team during the week of March 20, through March 25, 1994. The judge concluded that the \u201cselection of Rivendell was the antithesis of a fair, unbiased and independent review. [The department\u2019s] selection of Rivendell was purposeful and is an example of bad faith.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The judge was warranted in concluding that the selection of the Rivendell review team constituted bad faith regulation of JRC. Given that the team leader was the first individual signatory to the \u201cCall to Action\u201d which equated aversive therapies to political torture, the judge\u2019s conclusion that the Rivendell review team was incapable of doing an unbiased review was not clearly erroneous. Indeed, the attachments to the \u201cCall to Action\u201d made serious claims of mistreatment by JRC. The judge, having heard testimony that the assistant commissioner for quality assurance had received a copy of the \u201cCall to Action\u201d which equated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>use of aversives with political torture, was not required to believe the assistant commissioner for quality assurance\u2019s testimony that she believed the Rivendell team leader was impartial. See <em>Hawthorne\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Warrenton Realty, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 200, 201 (1993) (judge in best position to evaluate credibility of witnesses); <em>First Pa. Mtge. Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, </em>395 Mass. 614, 621 (1985) (due regard given to opportunity of judge to assess credibility of witnesses). Moreover, the judge\u2019s disbelief of the assistant commissioner for quality assurance\u2019s testimony was not the only basis for her conclusion that the selection of Rivendell was made in bad faith. The judge also found that the Rivendell review team was selected without the department receiving the resumes of the professionals involved. In addition, the judge found that the assistant commissioner for quality assurance requested that Rivendell modify the original RFP that it had submitted and that the original RFP stated that \u201c[t]he assembly of a sufficiently qualified team at such short notice is close to impossible.\u201d Moreover, the original RFP revealed that the bid submitted by the Rivendell team was one and one-half times higher than the only other bid. Our review of the evidence demonstrates that none of these findings was clearly erroneous, and that the judge was warranted in concluding that the department was regulating IRC in bad faith.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The department argues that the judge impermissibly imposed the burden on the commissioner to prove that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>acted in good faith and that, where the defendant is a State official, \u201cwho is attempting to carry out his statutory duties as he understands them, contempt sanctions are not an appropriate means of redressing any violation of his obligation to act in good faith,\u201d and raises serious separation of powers problems. The department argues that the judge should have assumed that the commissioner would henceforth act in accordance with the law as judicially construed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the judge did not impermissibly shift the burden to the department to prove that the commissioner acted in good faith. While the judge did at times ask the commissioner what his good faith reason was for taking certain actions, these questions generally came after affirmative evidence suggesting bad faith had been admitted, and reflected the judge\u2019s efforts to get the commissioner\u2019s response.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Moreover, the judge, in finding bad faith, did not merely rely on her disbelief of the testimony of the commissioner and other witnesses of the department. Contrast <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 219, 223-224 (1992). The work plans and other documents, as well as the testimony, provided the judge with an ample basis for making the findings she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Finally, the department\u2019s argument that contempt sanctions are inappropriate has no merit. It is, of course, generally true that, absent a statute imposing an affirmative obligation to act in good faith, \u201cacts of administrative officers cannot be attacked in judicial proceedings on the ground that in fact those officers were not governed by the highest standards of impartial and unselfish performance of public duty,\u201d <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>405 Mass. 390, 397-398 (1989), quoting <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Watertown, </em>330 Mass. 150, 154 (1953), for there is every presumption that public officials are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>motivated to act honestly and appropriately. <em>LaPointe </em>v. <em>License Bd. of Worcester, </em>389 Mass. 454, 459 (1983). Here, however, there was an independent agreement incorporated as an order of the court that required the department to act in good faith, and it is well settled that contempt sanctions are an appropriate mechanism by which \u201cthe power of the court [can] secure to the aggrieved party the benefit of the decree.\u201d <em>United Factory Outlet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>361 Mass. 35, 36 (1972). Moreover, while \u201c[t]he tradition of judicial deference to agency decision making represents an important social policy decision that public agencies are generally in a better position than courts to make particular technical decisions . . . this policy rests on an assumption that public agencies will act properly when making the decisions,\u201d <em>Matter of McKnight, </em>406 Mass. 787, 807 (1990) (Liacos, C.J., dissenting), and in the instant case, there was ample evidence to rebut any presumption that the department was acting in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">2. <em>Evidentiary errors. </em>The department argues that, not only are the findings of fact clearly erroneous, certain evidentiary errors warrant reversal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">a. <em>Failure to extend discovery. </em>The department argues that the judge erred in denying a motion to extend discovery, which would have given it the opportunity to depose JRC\u2019s accountant on matters germane to JRC\u2019s financial condition.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We disagree. \u201cThe conduct and scope of discovery is within the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>Co., KG, 399 </em>Mass. 790, 799 (1987). The department must show that the denial constituted an abuse of discretion which resulted in prejudicial error. <em>Symmons </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keeffe, </em>419 Mass. 288, 302 (1995), and cases cited. No such showing has been made. The department had notice that JRC\u2019s accountant was going to testify about its financial condition and had the opportunity to question him on cross-examination.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The judge was not required to extend discovery. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Honeywell, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 803, 809 (1991) (judge properly admitted testimony of witness introduced on the first day of trial where no prejudice resulted from late disclosure). See also <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>380 Mass. 285, 288 (1980). Thus, we conclude there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">b. <em>Admission of evidence. </em>Next, the department argues that the judge erred by not allowing it to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence under the curative admissibility doctrine. We disagree. \u201cThe curative admissibility doctrine allows a party harmed by incompetent evidence to rebut that evidence only if the original evidence created significant prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, 399 </em>Mass. 811, 813-814 (1987) (failure to permit defendant to cross-examine police officer about defendant\u2019s statements prejudicial). The department failed to show that the evidence presented by JRC, even if it were inadmissible, created significant prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">During the hearing, JRC offered testimony relevant to the harm caused to two patients when the specialized food program was canceled. The judge denied the department\u2019s motion for an order requiring the guardians of those two patients to consent to an examination so that it could rebut JRC\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The department claims that this was prejudicial because the testimony regarding the harm to these two patients was the basis for the finding of harm. We conclude that there was no significant prejudice because the judge made numerous findings of harm on independent grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Second, JRC offered testimony that the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>regulated other providers differently. The department argues that the judge erred by not allowing it to introduce evidence regarding its regulation of other providers on relevance grounds. The curative admissibility doctrine, however, does not apply because JRC\u2019s evidence was not inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We conclude there was no abuse of discretion on evidentiary issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Having concluded that the judge was warranted in finding the department to be in contempt of the settlement agreement, we must now consider whether the judge ordered the appropriate remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">3. <em>Receivership. </em>The judge appointed a receiver to administer, manage, and operate the department in all of its relationships with JRC. The department contends that the judge erred because the facts do not justify a receivership. A narrower and more plausible contention is that the judge exceeded her authority in fashioning the receiver\u2019s powers. We shall consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">a. <em>Facts justify a receiver. </em>The Probate Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, which pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, has general equity jurisdiction. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>416 Mass. 629, 633 (1993). A court with equity jurisdiction has broad and flexible powers to fashion remedies. <em>Matter of McKnight, </em>406 Mass. 787, 791 (1990). Public officials who fail to abide by legal standards are not immune to these remedies. See <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </em>402 U.S. 1 (1971) (remedies to eliminate school segregation); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>379 Mass. 703 (1980) (receiver appointed to run public housing authority); <em>Blaney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>374 Mass. 337 (1978) (specific guidelines on treatment of prisoners). A court with equity jurisdiction has the discretion to appoint a receiver to take over the main functions of public officials. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 735-737. See <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Medford Community Ctr., Inc., </em>384 Mass. 163, 169 (1981); <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>540 F.2d 527, 533 (1st Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1042 (1977).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u201c[A] receivership must be thoroughly justified on the facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>is always to be considered a remedy of \u2018last resort,\u2019 and therefore is not often applied in practice.\u201d <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 733-737. The test is one of reasonableness in the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 735-736. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>McDonough, supra </em>at 533. In <em>Perez, </em>a combination of circumstances justified a receivership: \u201crepeated or continuous failure of the officials to comply with a previously issued decree; a reasonable forecast that the mere continued insistence by the court that these officials perform the decree would lead only to \u2018confrontation and delay\u2019; [and] a lack of any leadership that could be expected to turn the situation around within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 736. See <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>McDonough, supra </em>at 533. The judge may also consider bad faith and wasting of resources. See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 724-725, 737; <em>New England Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olympia Theatres, Inc., </em>287 Mass. 485, 492 (1934), cert. denied sub nom. <em>E.M. Loew\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>New England Theatres, </em>294 U.S. 713 (1935). In general, the more indurated the problems and less likely that intermediate steps will work, the greater the justification for a receivership. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We conclude that a receivership was justified in the circumstances of this case. The findings that the department repeatedly violated the settlement agreement, interfered with court-authorized treatment orders,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> bypassed the court-appointed monitor,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and knowingly misled the judge,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> warranted a conclusion that the department was unwilling to comply with a judicial decree. The department\u2019s refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing in the contempt action indicated that less stringent remedies would only invite further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>confrontation and delay. Finally, the numerous findings that the commissioner, the general counsel, and senior staff acted in bad faith demonstrated a leadership which was unwilling to comply with the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">JRC devoted an enormous amount of time, effort, and money to fight off the department\u2019s indirect attacks on aversive therapies through needless and excessive regulatory demands. Furthermore, the judiciary spent a considerable amount of its limited resources trying to put an end to the war. Innocent patients, meanwhile, have been caught in the cross fire.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The department\u2019s intransigent conduct has wasted the resources of JRC, and the courts; it has also hurt the patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We recognize that direct judicial intervention into the operation of a State agency is not to be undertaken lightly, but in this case it was necessary because there was no reasonable alternative. See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 736. See also <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>McDonough, supra </em>at 533. Thus, the judge did not abuse her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">b. <em>Scope of the receiver\u2019s powers. </em>We consider now whether the judge exceeded her authority in fashioning the receiver\u2019s powers. The department contends that the receiver\u2019s powers (1) offend the principles of separation of powers expressed in art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights, and (2) are overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">We begin by pointing out that appointing a receiver is not a per se violation of the separation principle. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 739. When necessary, the role of the judicial branch in civil cases is to provide remedies for violations of the law, including violations committed by the executive branch. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, appointing a receiver to restore legality to a State agency which has failed, over a long period of time, to comply with the settlement agreement and abused its regulatory authority by acting in bad faith, does not derogate the separation principle. \u201cTo the contrary, when the executive persists in indifference to, or neglect or disobedience of court orders, necessitating a receivership, it is the executive that could more properly be charged with contemning the separation principle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739-740.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The department correctly points out that the judiciary lacks the authority to order a State agency to do anything that it is not required to do as a matter of law. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>394 Mass. 624, 629-630 (1985). See also <em>Charrier </em>v. <em>Charrier, </em>416 Mass. 105, 110 (1993). Along the same lines, we give great deference to a State agency\u2019s exercise of its discretionary functions. <em>Matter of McKnight, </em>406 Mass. 787, 792 (1990). This deference, however, does not extend to unreasonable conduct or where an agency is found to be acting contrary to its legal duty. See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 739-740; <em>Blaney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 342. Thus, to the extent that the receiver\u2019s powers are narrowly tailored to remedy the department\u2019s violations and restore legality to the situation, they do not violate the separation of powers principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Next, we consider the department\u2019s argument that the receiver\u2019s powers are overly broad. \u201cThe law leaves to the sound discretion of the trial judge the issuance and scope of equitable relief.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>416 Mass. 558, 566 (1993). As with all judicial remedies, the receiver\u2019s powers should be no more intrusive than reasonably necessary to address the problem. <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Medford Community Ctr., Inc., </em>384 Mass. 163, 170 (1981). We are particularly careful in applying this standard where public officials are the object of the remedy. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 729-730.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The receiver was authorized to direct the ordinary affairs of the department with respect to relationships with JRC, its patients, and its families.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The judge did not give the receiver plenary powers over the department, rather the receiver\u2019s powers were confined to matters related to JRC.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The judge deemed these powers necessary to provide relief for JRC and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>restore legality to this relationship.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Once a judge has taken the extraordinary step of appointing a receiver, that judge surely must give the receiver sufficient power to meet the requirements of the situation. <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. 398, 414 (1981). The receiver must have enough power to enforce the judge\u2019s decrees, make them completely effective, and thus restore legality. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 734-735. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>315 Mass. 335, 346 (1943). To the extent that the receiver\u2019s powers are tailored to fit this objective, the judge did not exceed her authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We agree with the commissioner, however, that not all of the receiver\u2019s powers are confined to restoring the department\u2019s relationship with JRC. Certain enumerated powers bestowed on the receiver reach beyond the problems between JRC and the department. First, the judge gave the receiver the authority to \u201capprove and execute <em>all </em>contracts that [the department] enters into\u201d (emphasis added). Second, the judge gave the receiver the power to exercise considerable authority over the department\u2019s staff, including the power to \u201chire, promote, transfer, discipline, suspend, or discharge all employees of [the department].\u201d These provisions are overly broad because they gave the receiver authority over discretionary functions unrelated to JRC. See <em>Matter of McKnight, supra </em>at 792. Therefore, these provisions are struck. These considerations, however, do not affect our conclusion that the judge did not otherwise exceed her authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The judge ordered the department to pay $1,098,086.59 in attorney\u2019s fees. We conclude that the judge erred because she was without statutory authority to order the payment of attorney\u2019s fees in these circumstances.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u201c[C]osts against the Commonwealth, its officers, and agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>cies shall be imposed only to the extent permitted by law.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (d), 365 Mass. 820 (1974). Consequently, express statutory authority is required to levy costs on the Commonwealth. See <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>409 Mass. 89, 90 (1991); <em>M.C. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>399 Mass. 909, 912 (1987); <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>373 Mass. 720, 722 (1977). This requirement arises out of the general rule of law that the Commonwealth \u201ccannot be impleaded in its own courts except with its consent, and, when that consent is granted, it can be impleaded only in the manner and to the extent expressed . . . [by] statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>329 Mass. 661, 664 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">As a general rule in Massachusetts, a litigant must bear his own expenses including attorney\u2019s fees, except where a statute permits the award of costs, a valid contract of stipulation provides for costs, or rules concerning damages permits recovery. <em>Waldman </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>413 Mass. 320, 322 (1992); <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 721-722. Attorney\u2019s fees are included in costs, but successful litigants can recover attorney\u2019s fees only in a very restricted class of cases. <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Fuss (No.1), </em>372 Mass. 64, 70 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In civil contempt actions, attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded as an element of the cost of enforcing the order of the court. <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Quality Eng\u2019g, </em>381 Mass. 208, 215-216 (1980). However, this rule does not negate rule 54 (d), that an award of costs against the Commonwealth requires specific affirmative authority. See <em>M.C. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra; Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 722, 725 n.8; Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Specific authority to impose costs against the Commonwealth is found in G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 14, which provides: \u201cIn civil actions and in proceedings which are instituted by, or in the name of, the commonwealth, and not at the relation, in behalf, or for the use, of a private person, the commonwealth shall be liable for costs as is an individual.\u201d However, this statute does not extend liability for costs to ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>tions naming the Commonwealth as a defendant.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">General Laws c. 12, \u00a7 111, does provide for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in an action brought under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H. The 1986 preliminary injunction action raised claims under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Some courts have held that, in the context of the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1994), postjudgment monitoring of consent decrees is compensable. See <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Dukakis, </em>786 F.2d 16 (1st Cir. 1986); <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>Sununu, </em>752 F.2d 727, 738-739 (1st Cir. 1984). See also <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>478 U.S. 546, 559 (1986). However, we decline to impose postjudgment costs on the Commonwealth without express authority. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>University of Mass. Medical Ctr., </em>423 Mass. 584, 586-587 (1996) (no postjudgment interest against Commonwealth without express authority); <em>Onofrio </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>411 Mass. 657, 659 (1992) (postjudgment interest not recoverable against Commonwealth).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u201cThe rules of construction governing statutory waiver of sovereign immunity are stringent.\u201d <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 91, quoting <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 38, 42 (1981). \u201cConsent to a suit must be expressed by the terms of a statute, or appear by necessary implication from them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no provision for postjudgment costs in G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111. The fact that the Legislature specifically authorized attorney\u2019s fees in cases brought under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H, does not lead to the conclusion that attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded against the Commonwealth for postjudgment work. See <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 91. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have performed in an exemplary manner and deserve to be fully compensated for their efforts. Nevertheless, in the absence of express statutory authority which declares otherwise, we are unable to affirm the award of attorney\u2019s fees against the Commonwealth. See <em>id. </em>at 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The case is remanded to the Probate Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The settlement agreement dated December 12, 1986, provided in part: \u201cOn or before July 1, 1987, the licensing responsibility for [JRC] shall be transferred from [OFC] to [the Department of Mental Health] in accordance with an interagency agreement. . . .\u201d On July 1, 1987, however, the department assumed the legal responsibility for licensing JRC, St. 1986, c. 599, and on October 24, 1988, moved that the settlement agreement be modified to clarify that \u201cit has also assumed [the Department of Mental Health\u2019s] obligations under the Settlement Agreement.\u201d The judge treated the department\u2019s motion as a motion to intervene under Mass.

Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Retardation (No. 2), post </em>471 (1997). In addition, the department petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par., for interlocutory relief from or modification of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The single justice modified the injunction and later, in response to. a request for clarification, enjoined JRC from using certain challenged \u201cLevel III\u201d aversive treatments. The single justice also heard an appeal from the Probate Court judge\u2019s order pursuant to a \u201cglobal motion\u201d filed by guardianship counsel on behalf of fifty-two JRC patients in each of their individual guardianship cases requesting the Probate Court judge to issue orders requiring JRC to cease using certain Level III aversive procedures. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>single justice of the Appeals Court allowed the patients\u2019 petition and incorporated by reference the previous order that had been entered and clarified, as the orders dealt with the same aversive treatments. A single justice of this court denied JRC\u2019s request for relief from the order of the single justice of the Appeals Court. JRC then appealed to the full panel of the Appeals Court, and we granted the department\u2019s application for direct appellate review. That appeal is also the subject of another case decided today. <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ.

Regs. \u00a7 5.14 (4) (f) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Before a program can be certified, a comprehensive evaluation is made of a program. As part of the evaluation, a program must provide \u201ca comprehensive statement of the program\u2019s policies and procedures for the development and implementation of plans employing Level III Interventions, including a description of the program\u2019s actual use, or proposed use, of such procedures, and of the program\u2019s policies and practices regarding the training and supervision of all staff involved in the use of such procedures.\u201d 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.14 (4) (f) (3). The department then reviews the program, and has access to written plans designed for patients that are reviewed to ensure that they comport with applicable regulations, the physical facility, and the professional credentials of the program\u2019s employees. In addition, the department also has the opportunity to observe the treatment employed by the program. 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.14 (4) (f) (6). In short, a decision to certify a program is an acknowledgment that the program is complying with all applicable regulations. 115 Code Mass.

The commissioner spoke to the producer of the show and was concerned that the show might depict the department as not doing its job in regulating JRC. While the commissioner testified that he never did anything in anticipation of that program, documents revealed that the commissioner had taken certain actions with the television program in mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">See note 4, <em>supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ing that JRC had violated the settlement agreement. The department does not appeal from the decision denying the counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The department argues that the judge\u2019s \u201centire application of the law of contempt to the facts of this case\u201d consisted of these two sentences and that therefore the judge did not make clear what conduct by the department constituted \u201cclear and undoubted disobedience\u201d of the settlement agreement. This argument is without merit. The judge made extensive factual findings, many of which referenced the provisions in the settlement agreement that had been violated by such actions. In addition, in the order denying the department\u2019s motion to stay the judgment pending an appeal, the judge further specified which of her factual findings constituted violations of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">We note also that the judge denied the department\u2019s counterclaim alleg-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Evidence considered at a substituted judgment hearing includes the ward\u2019s expressed preferences regarding treatments, the ward\u2019s religious convictions, the impact on the ward\u2019s family, the probability of adverse side effects, and the prognosis with and without treatment. <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>411 Mass. 666, 673 (1992), and cases cited. In addition to the information ordinarily presented at a substituted judgment proceeding, the settlement agreement mandated that JRC present eleven additional pieces of information as well, including evidence of the client\u2019s present and past psychological and medical circumstances, target behaviors to be treated by means of aversive procedures, the clinical reasons why nonaversives or less intrusive aversive procedures are inappropriate, and the professional disciplines of the staff members who will implement such aversive or extraordinary procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The regulations state that \u201ca Behavior Modification plan employing Level II or Level III Interventions may not be implemented unless it has been consented to in accordance with the following requirements.\u201d 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.14 (4) (e). The \u201crequirements\u201d provide that, if an individual is not capable of giving informed consent, a judge, through a substituted judgment proceeding, must authorize aversive treatments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The judge made no explicit finding regarding whether the settlement agreement contemplated that JRC would no longer be regulated by the department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The court monitor testified that, while the licensing process and the certification process evolved into two separate concepts after the settlement agreement was reached, with licensing pertaining to the operation of facilities and certification pertaining to a facility\u2019s use of Level III aversives, he discussed certification with the department because \u201cthe [settlement [ajgreement required that [JRC] become licensed and because certification was part of the overall licensing process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\">We do not consider whether the portion of the agreement providing that it was the court monitor, not the department, that was to oversee compliance with all other applicable State regulations except those related to Level III aversives and undertake general monitoring of JRC\u2019s treatment and educational program constituted an impermissible delegation of regulatory authority. The findings of the judge with respect to this portion of the settlement agreement are not necessary for our decision here; we note, moreover, that neither side disputes that JRC was required to be certified according to the department\u2019s regulations, and it is that certification process and its relationship to the settlement agreement that is before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Contrary to the department\u2019s argument, its own regulations do not contemplate its having such unilateral power over individual treatment plans. While the department argues that language in the policy section of the applicable regulations stating that \u201c[t]he use of such procedures for a particular individual will be allowed for a particular client only after a rigorous review and approval by clinicians, human rights committees, and the department\u201d and that \u201csuch procedures are only to be used in programs which are specially qualified and certified to use such procedures with appropriate care . . . [and] the application of a procedure for clients even after it has been approved must be strictly monitored by the program as well as by the [department itself\u2019 demonstrate its power over individual treatment plans, we conclude that the language is consistent with our reading of the regulations \u2014 if that monitoring reveals any problems, that information should be brought to the judge who has authorized the use of aversive treatments. 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.14 (1) (c). Moreover, although the department claims to have certified the use of aversive therapies on individual patients at various facilities, the assistant commissioner for quality assurance conceded that there is no authority in the regulations for approval of Level III procedures \u201cin the absence of a certification as a program.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">For example, in March of 1992, the department\u2019s general counsel responded to a letter inquiring about JRC\u2019s use of behavior modification procedures with respect to two patients and stated that \u201cthe [department is currently bound by a settlement agreement with respect to this program. All so-called aversive interventions used at [JRC] must be approved by the Bristol County Probate Court; the [d]epartment\u2019s involvement in the actual treatment is limited.\u201d In addition, after initially granting certification to JRC on April 20, 1989, the department attached to the initial grant of certification a memorandum which addressed the potential conflict between substituted judgment orders of the Probate Court and the department regulations. The memorandum noted that the department\u2019s treatment plans should not be amended until after a substituted judgment hearing before the Probate Court, and stated that such interpretation of the regulations \u201cis necessary to prevent conflicting decisions by departmental hearing officers and the Probate Court, [because] obviously an executive branch hearing officer cannot overrule a court decision.\u201d The memorandum also noted that such a practice was \u201cconsistent with departmental practice in [other] cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The letter stated: \u201cThis certification excludes authorization for [JRC] to continue to use indefinitely Level III interventions for six individuals &gt;&gt;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\">One of the individuals had been the subject of a recent five-day treatment plan review by the Probate Court.

Rather, the department tries to sidestep the issue, arguing only that the commissioner never claimed not to have discussed these issues and therefore cannot be found to have acted in bad faith. The department\u2019s argument ignores that it is not solely the commissioner\u2019s denial or admission of these actions that warranted a finding of contempt \u2014 it was the actions themselves that demonstrated the department was regulating the JRC in bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The department argues that the information regarding the receivership petition revealed by the work plans is protected by the attorney-client privilege. We agree with the judge that the information is not protected by the privilege. The attorney-client privilege protects communications made between a lawyer and a client for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. See <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., ante </em>109, 115 (1997); <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge </em>v. Praught, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 296 (1993). We must, however, construe the privilege narrowly. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>377 Mass. 772, 775 (1979). Thus, while the department analogizes to <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 383 (1981), where the Supreme Court recognized that for a corporate lawyer to function effectively, it is often necessary for the lawyer to obtain information from middle and lower-level employees in order to advise the corporation appropriately, <em>id. </em>at 394, that case is inapposite where, as here, there has been no showing that all of those present at the meeting provided the department\u2019s counsel with information she needed in order to advise the department, nor has there been a showing that all those present at the meeting were seeking legal advice. Rather, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the meeting was a general policy meeting. Thus, while the documents would be protected from mandatory disclosure during the time the policy was being developed, G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d); Babets </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., </em>403 Mass. 230, 237 n.8 (1988), after the policy decision has been made there is no privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 238-239.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The judge also noted that the Rivendell review team requested indemnification from the department for its review of JRC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Other examples of the department\u2019s putting its plan into action include the letters sent by the department to the funding agencies which contained misleading and false information. The department argues that the commissioner had a good faith basis for all of the statements and the conditions contained in the various letters. While we need not review all of the letters, we note, for example, that the letter of August 6, stated that the department had found \u201ccontinued and repeated noncompliance with [the department] regulations.\u201d Our review of the evidence leads us to conclude that the judge\u2019s finding that the letter was sent in an attempt to interfere with JRC\u2019s relationships with funding agencies was not clearly erroneous. Indeed, this statement was in direct conflict with the report of the 1993 review team that had been submitted just a few weeks prior to the August 6 letter and the 1991 report, both of which the commissioner testified that he had not read at the time he sent the letter. Moreover, the commissioner was asked, \u201c[W]ould it be fair to state that you . . . did not review the reports of your certification team, you did not review the court orders of the Bristol County Probate Court and you did not review any of the evaluations of the psychologists who had been appointed by the [department]; is that a fair statement?\u201d He responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Thus, it is clear that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ample evidence to support the inference that the letter was sent in bad faith as part of the plan to put JRC out of business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">For example, on the first day of trial, the assistant general counsel testified that the 1993 review team\u2019s report and the 1991 review team\u2019s report were not submitted to the judge on September 22, 1993, when the department submitted other information. The judge, on learning that these favorable reports had not been presented to her stated: \u201cMy mind is always open to what you present me. But I\u2019m faced with misrepresentations to the Court and I welcome an explanation as to why it should not be characterized in that way and I am looking forward to it and I hope that it\u2019s presented soon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Pursuant to Mass.
