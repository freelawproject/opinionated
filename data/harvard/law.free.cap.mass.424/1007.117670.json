As we held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunigan, </em>384 Mass. 1, 3-5 (1981), and thereafter in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boncore, </em>412 Mass. 1013, 1014 (1992), no appeal lies from the denial by a single justice of an application for leave to appeal in these circumstances. We stated in those cases that the Commonwealth\u2019s sole remedy would be to file a petition before the full court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and we cautioned that we would exercise our power under that statute only in exceptional circumstances. <em>Dunigan, supra </em>at 5. We also made clear in <em>Boncore </em>that we would be unwilling to indulge the Commonwealth in future cases such as this where it follows the wrong procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 1014 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reference to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, in its notice of appeal is not an adequate substitute for a petition properly filed before the full court. While there may be some similarities in the appeal and petition procedures, there are also substantial differences. A petition can be disposed of comparatively quickly, and, unlike an appeal, may be resolved with an order and not necessarily an opinion, and without the need for full briefing and oral argument. The filing of an appeal, as the Commonwealth has done here, effectively negates the single justice\u2019s role as gatekeeper, renders meaningless the rule and statute, and unnecessarily delays the resolution of the matter. Cf. <em>Leaster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 547 (1982) (holding that no appeal lies from a single justice\u2019s order as a gatekeeper pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kuszewski, </em>385 Mass. 802 (1982) (holding that Commonwealth may appeal to full court after a single justice grants defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal and orders that motion to suppress be allowed).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
