The plaintiff brought an action in the Superior Court against Safety Insurance Company (Safety) and Metropolitan Prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>erty and Liability Insurance Company (Metropolitan), claiming that, under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (1994 ed.), she was entitled to underinsured motorist benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge allowed the defendants\u2019 joint motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff sought review of this decision in the Appeals Court, and we granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The following facts are not in dispute for the purposes of summary judgment. On October 25, 1990, the plaintiff sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident involving an automobile in which she was a passenger and an automobile owned and operated by Iroina Ferriera. The plaintiffs damages exceeded the \u201cper person\u201d bodily injury limit on Ferriera\u2019s automobile insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">At the time of the accident, the plaintiff owned her own automobile and thus was the named insured on a Massachusetts automobile insurance policy. The policy coverage selection page purported to provide underinsured motorist coverage of up to $10,000 per person, but no premium was charged for that coverage. The plaintiff did not elect to purchase additional underinsured motorist coverage, leaving that section blank on her application for insurance. The plaintiff is not seeking benefits under her own policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Safety issued an automobile insurance policy to Michael Krochmal, the plaintiff\u2019s uncle, who resided with her in the same household. Metropolitan issued a policy to Maureen Ouellette, the owner of the automobile occupied by the plaintiff at the time of the accident. The plaintiff is seeking underinsured benefits from these policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>Because this case was decided on their motion for summary judgment, the defendants must establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974); <em>Golub </em>v. <em>Milpo, Inc., </em>402 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>397, 400 (1988), and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 719 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In recent years, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage have been the subject of numerous decisions of this court and several legislative enactments. The extent and existence of such coverage is largely a matter of statutory interpretation. See <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 144 (1994); <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co., </em>419 Mass. 138 (1994); <em>Depina </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 135 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra, </em>we decided that \u201ca person who is a named insured may look for underinsured motorist coverage only to the policy or policies on which he or she is the named insured, at least if that policy provides some underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149. The purpose of the 1988 automobile insurance reform was to reduce insurance rates. <em>Alguila </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>416 Mass. 494, 499 (1993). To accomplish this objective, the Legislature made underinsured motorist coverage optional and prohibited the practice of stacking uninsured and underinsured coverage on different policies. See <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra </em>at 148; <em>Alguila </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The only difference between this case and the <em>Smart </em>case is that here the plaintiff did not \u201celect\u201d underinsured motorist coverage on her application. Seizing on this difference, the plaintiff argues that, under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2), she did not have underinsured motorist coverage because she did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u201celect\u201d to have coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, she contends that G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (5), allows her to recover underinsured motorist benefits from someone else\u2019s policy because her own policy did not provide underinsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The plaintiffs argument ignores the statutory intent, as elucidated in <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra, </em>of having each named insured responsible for the extent of his or her under-insured motorist coverage. Under the plaintiffs interpretation, members of the same household could obtain underinsured motorist coverage, at no cost, by refusing to \u201celect\u201d coverage, if one member purchased such coverage. \u201cIn eliminating the stacking of underinsured motorist claims, the Legislature did not prescribe that there be only one policy providing underinsured motorist coverage in each household. On the contrary, it prescribed that a person who seeks under-insured motorist benefits look to his or her own policy, if there is one, at least one providing some underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra </em>at 150. A limited amount of underinsured motorist coverage was provided by the policy in question. The plaintiff had the option and chose not to buy additional coverage; that was her election. We decline to attach to her failure to elect such coverage a signif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>icance that would run counter to the legislative intent and to the logic of our related decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The complaint also included counts against both companies based on G. L. c. 93A (1994 ed.). Summary judgment was also granted for the defendants on these claims. The plaintiff did not press these claims below, does not argue them on appeal, and, therefore, they are waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b58-10\">The plaintiff cannot recover under her own policy because her underinsured motorist coverage limits are less than the bodily injury limits on Ferriera\u2019s policy. G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2) (1994 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The plaintiff alleges that whether she had underinsured motorist coverage was a material fact in dispute. The plaintiff was the named insured on a Massachusetts automobile insurance policy. She left the underinsured motorist coverage section of her application blank. Nevertheless, her insurance policy provided her with underinsured motorist coverage of up to $10,000 per person without charging a premium. On these facts, whether G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, prohibits the plaintiff from recovering underinsured motorist benefits from any other policy is a question of law. See <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 144 (1994); <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co., </em>419 Mass. 138 (1994); <em>Depina </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 135 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\">See St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 1, noting the Legislature\u2019s expectation that the automobile insurance rates after the 1988 amendments would reflect savings attributable, among other things, to \u201cmaking underinsured coverage optional\u201d and \u201cchanging the \u2018trigger\u2019 for compulsory and non-compulsory underinsured coverages\u201d and \u201cthe prohibition on \u2018stacking\u2019 underinsured coverages in separate policies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2) (1994 ed.), reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201c(2) For the purpose of [uninsured motorist] coverage, <em>if </em>the policyholder or obligor <em>elects </em>to purchase [underinsurance coverage], the term \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 shall also include protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of insured motor vehicles, trailers or semitrailers, to which a bodily injury liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident and its bodily injury liability bond amount or policy limit is less than the policy limit for uninsured motor vehicle coverage and is insufficient to satisfy the damages of persons insured thereunder and only to the extent that the uninsured motor vehicle coverage limits exceed said limits of bodily injury liability subject to the terms of the policy\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\">In <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins.
