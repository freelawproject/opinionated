See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass. 156, 160 (1980). He sent a notice of appeal to the Superior Court clerk\u2019s office more than a month after his motion had been denied, but it was not accepted for filing and was returned to him by the clerk\u2019s office for reasons that are not clear on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">In September, 1995, the petitioner filed a petition in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, requesting either a reversal of the Superior Court\u2019s denial of his motion or, as an alternative, an order requiring the Superior Court clerk\u2019s office to accept for filing his notice of appeal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>single justice denied that petition without a hearing, from which the petitioner now appeals.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b961-8\"><em>William Morales, </em>pro se, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The single justice correctly denied the G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition since the petitioner had other means available by which to obtain the relief he sought. See <em>Martineau </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>423 Mass. 1007 (1996); <em>Maza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>423 Mass. 1006 (1996); <em>McGuinness </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>420 Mass. 495, 497 (1995). He could have filed, and still may file, a motion in the Superior Court to compel the clerk of that court to accept for filing his notice of appeal and to process the appeal. <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>416 Mass. 1010, 1010-1011 (1994). <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Clerk of the First Dist. Court of Essex, </em>352 Mass. 466, 467-468 (1967), and cases cited. \u201cIn the absence of an order from a judge, the clerk should not have refused to docket the petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal,\u201d <em>Callahan, supra </em>at 1010, regardless of whether the clerk may have believed that no appeal was available to the petitioner or that his notice of appeal was untimely or otherwise defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The petitioner may now attempt to refile his notice of appeal, and if, contrary to what we have said, the clerk again refuses to accept the notice for filing, the petitioner may file a motion to compel the clerk to accept the notice and process the appeal. The Commonwealth and the appellate court are, of course, free to raise on appeal the threshold question whether the appeal is timely and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the single justice affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
