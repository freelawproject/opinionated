L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, a trust fund (created by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65) provides payment in certain circumstances to a workers\u2019 compensation insurer that has paid compensation to an injured worker who had a known physical impairment that was due to some previous accident, disease, or congenital condition. In 1988, at the time of the injury in this case, \u00a7 37 provided that the trust fund reimburse \u201can amount equal to [75 %] of all compensation paid subsequent to that paid for the first [104] weeks of disability.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, as amended through St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">In this case, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna) paid compensation for which it was entitled to reimbursement from the trust fund when it entered into a \u201clump sum agreement\u201d (see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48) with the employee, in which Aetna agreed to pay $35,000. The Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Industrial Accidents (department) approved the agreement, which provided that Aetna would pay $5,000 directly to the employee\u2019s attorney, thereby reducing the amount to be paid directly to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The issue in this case is whether Aetna is entitled to reimbursement from the trust fund for seventy-five per cent of the attorney\u2019s fees that it paid. An administrative judge in the department denied Aetna\u2019s petition for reimbursement with respect to attorney\u2019s fees and, on appeal to the reviewing board, that decision was affirmed. Aetna then appealed to the Appeals Court. We transferred the appeal here on our own motion. We affirm the decision of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Section 37 contains a specific definition of \u201ccompensation,\u201d as the word was used in that section, for the purpose of identifying the payments to an employee for which the trust fund must make reimbursement to the insurer. \u201cThe word \u2018compensation\u2019 as used in this section for the purpose of reimbursement hereunder shall include all payments to the employee . . . provided for by sections [30, 30A, 31, 32, 33, 34, 34A, 35, 35A, 36 and 36A].\u201d Aetna\u2019s payment of the attorney\u2019s fee was made directly to the attorney, not to the employee, and, more important, that payment was not provided for in any of the enumerated sections set forth in the language quoted from \u00a7 37. The payment of the attorney\u2019s fee was made pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (6), as amended by St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 8, which provided that, when a lump sum settlement is agreed to, the attorney\u2019s fee \u201cshall be paid from the settlement.\u201d The absence of a reference to \u00a7 13A in \u00a7 37 is fatal to Aetna\u2019s claim. Although the payment to an injured worker\u2019s attorney may be compensation in a general sense under G. L. c. 152, as Aetna argues, it is not compensation pursuant to the specific definition of compensation for the purposes of \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The decision of the Department of Industrial Accidents denying relief against the workers\u2019 compensation trust fund is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
