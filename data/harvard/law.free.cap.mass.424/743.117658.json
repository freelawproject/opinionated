A judge in the Superior Court affirmed the division\u2019s decision. Tarin appealed and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Tarin and Mary Jane Tarin were married on July 11, 1971, and have two children from that marriage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 2, 1993, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court granted the couple a divorce, which became final on August 31, 1993. Tarin is a forty-nine year old man who suffers from Parkinson\u2019s Disease. In July, 1993, while the final judgment of divorce was pending, he entered Mediplex, a nursing home in Lexington, because he had become so incapacitated that he was no longer able to be cared for at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">To understand Tarin\u2019s Medicaid challenge, his financial status in the wake of his divorce is relevant. The Tarins negotiated a separation agreement that the Probate and Family Court incorporated without change into the divorce judgment. The parties agreed that all their assets, whether jointly owned or in his or her name, would go to Mrs. Tarin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Only Tarin\u2019s Social Security and other disability insurance payments totalling $2,846 each month were not transferred to Mrs. Tarin. From that amount Tarin agreed to pay his former wife $407 each week for child support from March, 1993, to June, 1994, and $160 each week thereafter. Tarin\u2019s son and daughter were also each to receive $188 a month in Social Security benefits through their father.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The separation agreement also required Tarin to create an education trust fund for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>his children using his individual retirement account of $6,234.81. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *On May 18, 1993, after the parties had signed the separation agreement, but before their divorce was final, Mrs. Tarin relieved him of this obligation because \u201csetting this money in trust would have a Medicaid ineligibility penalty that [she] was not aware of when [she] signed the original agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Tarin applied for, and received, Medicaid benefits from the division.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On September 20, 1993, after he entered the nursing home and after the Tarins\u2019 divorce became final, the division informed him that the amount that he would have to contribute to his long-term care (\u201cpatient paid amount\u201d) would increase because it was disallowing his claimed deduction for child support payments from his \u201cavailable\u201d income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The sum of the revised \u201cpatient-paid amount\u201d and Tarin\u2019s child support payments is greater than his monthly income; Tarin is unable to pay both.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Tarin appealed from that decision, and an administrative \u201cfair hearing\u201d was held on November 10, 1993. On November 22, 1993, a welfare appeals referee of the Department of Public Welfare upheld the decision and Tarin sought judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. A judge in the Superior Court affirmed the decision. Tarin then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ii</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The meaning of the term \u201cavailable income\u201d is the crux of Tarin\u2019s appeal. We must decide whether the division was correct in determining what income is \u201cavailable\u201d to Tarih for the purpose of calculating the amount that he must contribute to his long-term nursing home care. We begin by describing the statutory scheme and regulations at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Medicaid, enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act, often referred to as the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 et seq., is a cooperative State and Federal program to provide medical assistance to needy individuals. See <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>419 Mass. 644, 646 (1995); <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>394 Mass. 466, 467 (1985). A State that chooses to participate in the Medicaid program must develop and submit for Federal approval a State plan that complies with the Federal Medicaid Act, and its implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.200 (1987). <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n, supra, Haley, supra, Sargeant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>383 Mass. 808, 815 (1981). See <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 37 (1981) (State Medicaid plans \u201cmust comply with requirements imposed by the [Social Security] Act itself and by the Secretary of Health and Human Services\u201d). The division must follow the requirements of Federal law for the. availability of Federal financial reimbursement unless State legislation explicitly directs otherwise. <em>Youville Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>416 Mass. 142, 146 (1993). Consistent with our Legislature\u2019s intent that the State Medicaid program comply with the Federal statutory and regulatory scheme, <em>Haley, supra </em>at 472, the State plan was submitted for and received Federal approval, which is binding until any amendments to the plan receive Federal approval. <em>Id. </em>at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The extensive Federal and State regulations governing the Medicaid program are intricate, and we describe the relevant regulations in broad terms. Federal law requires States participating in the Medicaid program to provide assistance to \u201ccategorically needy\u201d or to \u201cmedically needy\u201d individuals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In each case, a State is required to base its assessment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>financial need only on \u201csuch income and resources as are, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, <em>available </em>to the applicant or recipient\u201d (emphasis added). 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(17)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In determining whether a \u201clong-term-care\u201d case such as Tar\u00edn<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is eligible for Medicaid, and to determine the level of benefits to be provided to him, his marital status is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\"><em>Eligibility for Medicaid. </em>As required by Federal law, all applicants for and recipients of Medicaid must meet certain financial eligibility requirements. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.010 (1995). For an applicant who is <em>married, </em>the division must first assess the \u201ctotal value of the resources\u201d owned by both the person seeking Medicaid and his spouse, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(1)(A), referred to as the couple\u2019s \u201ccombined countable assets.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.180(A)(1) (1996). At the time the division first computes eligibility, it considers all the resources held by each spouse, to be available to the Medicaid applicant, referred to as \u201cthe couple\u2019s current total countable assets.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.180(B)(1) (1996). From the couple\u2019s current total countable assets the division sets aside an \u201casset allowance\u201d which the applicant\u2019s spouse may use for her own maintenance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(2). 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.180(B).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If, after setting aside the prescribed \u201casset allowance\u201d for his spouse, an applicant has \u201cavailable\u201d assets that are greater than the permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>maximum, he must \u201cspend down\u201d the remainder of the married couple\u2019s combined assets until he reaches the one-person asset limit of $2,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.180(B)(3); 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.115 (1995) (asset reduction provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In contrast, in determining the eligibility for Medicaid of a <em>divorced </em>applicant,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the division does not take into consideration any of the assets of his former spouse. Because Tarin transferred all his assets to his former wife in connection with his divorce, he was not required to \u201cspend down\u201d any of these assets to become Medicaid eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">As part of the initial eligibility determination, the division also scrutinizes an applicant\u2019s income to determine whether it is below statutory or regulatory limits. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.831 (1996); 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.010 (1994). Once again, for a <em>married </em>applicant, the division calculates the countable income, taking into account income from all sources.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It then allows certain specified deductions for the maintenance of the applicant\u2019s spouse and any dependent or minor children. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 506.010 (1994). 130 Code Mass. Regs. 506.220(B)-(C) (1996). This calculation results in a net income amount. 130 Code Mass. Regs. 501.500 (1996).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If the net income is above a specified \u201cincome standard\u201d (currently set by the division at $60 a month), 130 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>\u00a7 506.420 (1996), the applicant must \u201cspend down\u201d his net income until it falls below the limit. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.610-506.620 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The division follows the same procedure when evaluating the income eligibility of a <em>divorced </em>applicant, with one exception: because spousal and family maintenance allowance deductions are available to an applicant only \u201cfor the maintenance needs of his or her spouse in the community\u201d and for minor or dependent children who \u201creside with the community spouse,\u201d these deductions are not available to a divorced applicant such as Tarin. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220(B), (C) (1996).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\"><em>Benefits paid by Medicaid. </em>Once an applicant has demonstrated Medicaid eligibility, the division establishes the amount Medicaid will pay on his behalf. In determining how much income Tarin has \u201cavailable\u201d to pay for his nursing home care, the division first calculates his \u201ccountable income.\u201d \u201cCountable income\u201d is defined as \u201call monies, earned or unearned, that are included for eligibility determination.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.200 (1996). The \u201cpatient paid amount\u201d \u2014 the amount paid by the patient \u2014 is his \u201ccountable income\u201d less any expressly allowed deductions for his personal or family needs. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220 (1994). Any qualifying amount due to a long-term care facility which is not satisfied by the \u201cpatient paid amount\u201d is paid for by the Medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">If the recipient is married, the division follows the same procedure used when determining initial Medicaid eligibility, and deducts an amount for spousal and family maintenance needs allowance (if the recipient has minor or dependent children). 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220(A)-(C). If the Medicaid recipient is divorced, the spousal and family maintenance deductions are not available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In summary, as a result of his divorce Tarin\u2019s assets and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>income alone are considered for the purposes of Medicaid eligibility and benefits determination; he need not account for any resources of his former spouse. Correspondingly he may not claim any deductions for any spousal or family allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Tar\u00edn claims, first, that the Medicaid statutes and regulations unconstitutionally discriminate against divorced Medicaid recipients and their children who depend on them for support. Second, he argues that the division misinterpreted the applicable statutes and regulations by determining that the money which he is required to pay for court-ordered child support is \u201cavailable\u201d to him for purposes of calculating his \u201cpatient-paid\u201d amount. We address his statutory claims first.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In Tarin\u2019s view the Superior Court judge was incorrect to rely on the \u201cimprecise\u201d wording of the Medicaid statute and on the rulings of several Federal courts that have interpreted the question of \u201cavailability\u201d at issue here. Because, he says, Massachusetts law is \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d in favor of exempting child support payments as \u201ccountable\u201d income in public benefit cases, he urges us to rule as a matter of law that his child support obligations should not be treated as income \u201cavailable\u201d to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In reviewing the division\u2019s decision our standard is \u201cto determine whether the agency conformed with the controlling statute. . . . We are limited to a determination whether the State action is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>419 Mass. 644, 652 (1995). Neither the Federal nor the State Medicaid statute explicitly prohibits the deductibility of court-ordered child support. In the absence of any specific legislative intent to prohibit such deductions, he says, the division should not be permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">While there is no statutory prohibition, Congress has expressly delegated to the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services the authority to define the meaning of the term \u201cavailable\u201d income. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(B). Where the Secretary has done so, those regulations are \u201centitled to more than mere deference or weight.\u201d <em>Batterton </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 426 (1977). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Secretary\u2019s definition is entitled to \u201clegislative effect\u201d because \u201c[i]n a situation of this kind, Congress entrusts to the Secretary, rather than to the courts, the primary responsibility for interpreting the statutory term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425. See <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 43 (1981) (\u201c[pjerhaps appreciating the complexity of what it had wrought, Congress conferred on the Secretary exceptionally broad authority to prescribe standards for applying certain sections of the [Social Security] Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Federal regulations concerning income exemptions available to Medicaid recipients do not provide an exemption for child support payments when the Medicaid recipient is not living with his spouse. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 435.831-435.832. The division argues, and we agree, the Secretary has made it clear that income \u201cavailable\u201d to a divorced Medicaid recipient may include income used to make court-ordered child support payments. See <em>Himes </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>999 F.2d 684, 689-691 (2d Cir. 1993) (citing Federal Health Care Financing Administration\u2019s State Medicaid Manual Transmittal No. 33); <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Steffen, </em>959 F.2d 119, 122-123 (8th Cir. 1992) (citing the Secretary\u2019s regulations at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.851 and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.401). The State regulations mirror the Federal income exemptions and, like the Federal regulations, do not exempt income received to make child support payments. See 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.230 (1994).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not agree with Tar\u00edn that we should infer a deduction for child support for divorced Medicaid recipients from the absence of any express language prohibiting such a deduction. Provided that the division does not act improperly, judicial deference requires that we not substitute our judgment for that of the agency charged with the administration of the legislative mandate. <em>American Family Life Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 480, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 850 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Three United States Circuit Courts of Appeals that have considered the matter all have upheld the disallowance of deductions for court-ordered child support payments for a Medicaid income availability determination. See <em>Himes </em>v. <em>Shalala, supra </em>at 690-691 (inclusion of child support payments in \u201cavailable\u201d income is \u201creasonable attempt to interpret and apply all sections of the statute\u201d; Secretary\u2019s interpretation \u201cis not at odds with the plain meaning of the statute, is reasonable, and should therefore be accorded the usual deference\u201d); <em>Peura </em>v. <em>Mala, </em>977 F.2d 484, 491 (9th Cir. 1992) (\u201chigh degree of deference\u201d is owed to Secretary\u2019s determination); <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Steffen, supra </em>at 123 (\u201c[although not directly defining the term \u2018available,\u2019 the regulations make it plain that . . . states do not have to exclude [child support] payments from income when determining Medicaid eligibility</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">\n<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Moreover, these Federal courts concluded that the Secretary\u2019s determination to include child support payments in calculating \u201cavailable\u201d income was consistent with the legislative history of the statute. See <em>Himes, supra </em>at 689 (\u201c[w]hen Congress spoke of actually available income, it indicated its concern about the unfounded attribution of income from relatives\u201d never received by needy individuals, a \u201cprevalent state practice\u201d at time); <em>Emerson, supra </em>at 121-123 (\u201cCongress was concerned not with whether income received and then paid out by a Medicaid recipient was available, but rather with whether income deemed received had actually been received by, and therefore was actually available to, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>recipient\u201d); <em>Peura, supra </em>at 491 (legislative history did not \u201cforeclose[j\u201d Secretary\u2019s interpretation; Medicaid statute \u201cis ambiguous on whether the entire amount of court-ordered child-support payments must be considered unavailable income\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We recognize that in both <em>Himes </em>and <em>Emerson </em>the courts were reviewing the Secretary\u2019s determination of a recipient\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d income for the purpose of establishing only eligibility for Medicaid, and not benefit levels, the issue in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, in <em>Peura, </em>the plaintiff, like Tarin, challenged a State\u2019s determination of required payments for nursing home costs. In upholding the Secretary\u2019s determination, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that it was \u201cof little import\u201d that the Secretary\u2019s determination regarding Peura\u2019s child support obligations came \u201cin the context of a post-eligibility determination.\u201d <em>Peura, supra </em>at 487 n.4. See <em>Ussery </em>v. <em>Kansas Dep\u2019t of Social &amp; Rehabilitation Servs., </em>258 Kan. 187 (1995), upholding the inclusion of court-ordered spousal support payments in a Medicaid recipient\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d income in establishing benefit levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We conclude that the division\u2019s decision to include Tarin\u2019s child support payments in his \u201cavailable\u201d income is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Tarin does not argue, and nothing in the record indicates, that the amount he agreed to pay for child support, approved without change by the Probate and Family Court, is necessary to maintain his children adequately. Cf. <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 49 n.21 (1981) (\u201cWe do not . . . decide whether state plans that set aside inadequate sums for the contributing spouse are consistent with other provisions of the statute, such as the requirement that States \u2018reasonably] evaluate] . . . income or resources.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a[a][17][C]\u201d). Tarin argues only that the child support payments are \u201ccourt ordered\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>therefore \u2014 without more \u2014 must be excluded from his \u201cavailable\u201d income. Turin could have agreed to pay his former wife <em>any </em>amount of child support and, in his view, the Medicaid program would be required to allow him to deduct those amounts from his \u201cavailable\u201d income. We agree with the Commonwealth that what Tar\u00edn seeks is in reality a Medicaid \u201csubsidy\u201d for his child support payments. See <em>Peura, supra </em>at 490 (\u201cwe think it unlikely that Congress would intend the full amount of any child-support obligation to be excluded from the \u2018available\u2019 income of a Medicaid applicant or recipient simply because the amount has been ordered by a court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We are not unmindful of the reality in our contemporary society that many marriages end in divorce, and that responsibility for the support of children continues after divorce. We recognize that it is important \u2014 indeed urgent \u2014 for parents to meet their child support obligations. Here, however, Turin asks that one source of Federal funds \u2014 Medicaid \u2014 be used in a way which the Secretary, taking into account all sources of Federal funds including supplemental security income (SSI) and aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) that are available to assist needy children, has determined is not appropriate. If the Medicaid regulations need to be adjusted to counter any particular hardship on needy children of divorced families, that task is for administrators and legislators. They can balance the interests in ways that courts, in deciding on the particular facts of a single case, cannot. We find the regulations at issue consistent with the statutory scheme and with the reasonable exercise by the division of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">We turn now to Turin\u2019s constitutional claims. Turin\u2019s first constitutional argument is based on equal protection grounds. He argues that the distinction recognized by the division between married and nonmarried recipients in determining a recipient\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d income is analogous to a governmental classification based on the \u201cillegitimacy\u201d of children. Because the latter is subject to strict scrutiny for equal protection analysis, he argues, the former should be as well. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">As a preliminary matter, Tar\u00edn incorrectly frames his argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>ment in terms of his children\u2019s equal protection rights. As the legislative history makes clear, it is Tarin who is the intended beneficiary of the Medicaid program, and the proper classification for purposes of equal protection analysis \u201cmust begin with the statutory classification itself.\u201d <em>Califano </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>443 U.S. 282, 294 (1979). While \u201cevery governmental benefit has a ripple effect through familial relationships,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 295, it is Tariffs Medicaid benefits, and not his children\u2019s, which are at issue. Although it may be that the Medicaid subsidies received by Tarin incidentally benefit his children, \u201c[s]ome limits must be imposed for purposes of constitutional analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296. Accordingly we consider the Medicaid regulations at issue in terms of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments, \u201cdo not protect against burdens and disabilities as such but against their unequal imposition.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>423 Mass. 1201, 1232 (1996). In enacting social welfare legislation, \u201ca government does not deny equal protection \u2018merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some \u201creasonable basis,\u201d it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification \u201cis not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>DeCastro, </em>429 U.S. 181, 185 (1976), quoting <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Statutes providing for governmental payments of monetary benefits have been \u201centitled to a strong presumption of constitutionality\u201d when challenged on equal protection and due process grounds. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>DeCastro, supra </em>at 185. See <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Hackney, </em>406 U.S. 535, 546 (1972) (\u201c[s]o long as its judgments are rational, and not invidious, the legislature\u2019s efforts to tackle the problems of the poor and the needy are not subject to a constitutional straightjacket\u201d); <em>ABCD, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>378 Mass. 327, 340-341 (1979) (State welfare statute did not violate equal protection; \u201c[classifications that are less than perfect or that solve only part of a problem have been upheld\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">We conclude that the Secretary and the division have a rational basis for differentiating between divorced Medicaid recipients and those who are married. Congress explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>authorizes State Medicaid programs to \u201ctake into account the financial responsibility\u201d of the spouse, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the division has recognized that \u201c[e]ach spouse has financial responsibility for the other.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.450(A) (1995). Because no contribution is required from an applicant\u2019s former spouse if the applicant is divorced, and because the former spouse\u2019s assets are not included when determining a recipient\u2019s eligibility for benefits, it is rational for the division correspondingly to disallow a deduction for the family\u2019s maintenance needs. Tarin\u2019s own case is illustrative. As a divorced recipient, none of the assets that he transferred to his former spouse was considered by the division in determining either his Medicaid eligibility or his benefit level. All those assets can be used for the benefit of his former wife and their children with no requirement that they be \u201cspent down\u201d to establish his Medicaid benefits. Were we to agree with him, Tarin would in this respect be in a better position than a married Medicaid recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Tarin further argues that the regulation impermissibly impairs his liberty interest in his relationship as a father to his children protected by the due process provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions because the State is interfering with his ability financially to support his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The rights associated with the family \u2014 the right of an individual \u201cto marry, establish a home and bring up children\u201d \u2014 have long been protected as part of the liberty guaranteed by the due process clause. <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923). See <em>Zablocki </em>v. <em>Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374 (1978); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494 (1977); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510 (1925). We recognize that parents \u201cpossess a fundamental liberty interest, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, to be free from unnecessary governmental intrusion in the rearing of their children.\u201d <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Falmouth, </em>420 Mass. 749, 755 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1067 (1996). We have also recognized that \u201cin order to constitute a constitutional violation, the State action at issue must be coercive or compulsory in nature. Coercion exists where the governmental action is mandatory and provides no outlet for the parents, such as where refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>to participate in a program results in a sanction or in expulsion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Here the State\u2019s disallowance of a child support deduction from Tarin\u2019s patient-paid amount does not constitute the invasion of liberty interests that the Constitution forbids. When any parent has a serious, disabling illness, the financial hardship inflicted on his or her children can be, and often is, severe. We recognize that, as an institutionalized person with such an illness, Tarin has reduced opportunities to participate actively in the lives of his children, and that paying for their support is a responsibility that he earnestly desires to continue. But the State is \u201cnot constitutionally obligated to use the Social Security Act to subsidize support payments.\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>DeCastro, supra </em>at 189. Tarin may continue to nurture his children and to participate in decisions concerning their education, their medical needs, or other matters of their care and management. That he may no longer have the financial resources to support them in the manner to which he once agreed does not mean that the State has placed any coercive constitutional burden on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Nathaniel Riley Tarin was bom on April 4, 1977; Kirsten Meredith Tarin was bom on April 12, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\">arin released to his wife all his interest in all bank accounts, both savings and checking; a savings and investment plan; two automobiles; an individual retirement account (IRA) account of $6,143.81; all furniture, furnishings, and contents of the family home (the family home itself is held in trust); securities held in his wife\u2019s name; his wife\u2019s life insurance; and all other tangible and intangible personal property in his wife\u2019s control and possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Tarin claimed that in approving the child support payments to which he had agreed, the Probate and Family Court was \u201ccognizant\u201d of the fact that his two children were receiving these benefits.

The Tarins agreed between themselves that he would pay a substantial portion of his only remaining income to his former wife for child support.
