A split board determined that the partial disability payments Louis was receiving for a previous work-related injury should not be included in the calculation of her average weekly wage used to determine her compensation for a subsequent injury. <em>Louis </em>v. <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, </em>8 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 311 (1994). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We reverse the board\u2019s holding that partial disability benefits cannot be included in an employee\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">Alicia Louis is a seventy year old woman who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>employed by Anthony\u2019s Pier Four Restaurant (Pier Four) for several years as a hostess cashier until she injured her back on January 14, 1982, in the course of her employment. She was admitted to University Hospital with a herniated disc until February 7, 1982, and remained away from work until March 27, 1982, at which time she returned to Pier Four to work part time in a modified capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">At the time of Louis\u2019s initial injury, Pier Four was insured by Public Service Mutual Insurance Company (Public). While Louis was away from work, Public paid her temporary total incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, of $134.18 a week, based on an average weekly wage of $201.26 which Louis had been earning prior to her injury. When she returned to work in her modified capacity, Louis was able to earn an average of $70.22 a week. Louis\u2019s \u00a7 34 benefits were discontinued and Public began paying her partial incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, at a rate of $131.06. When these partial disability benefits were added to Louis\u2019s weekly earnings of $70.22, Louis was able to receive an amount equal to her previous earnings of $201.26.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">On August 1, 1986, Louis sustained further injuries as a result of a fall she suffered in the course of her part-time employment. The fall damaged Louis\u2019s knees, lower back, and cervical spine, forcing her to leave her employment permanently. At the time of Louis\u2019s second injury, Pier Four was insured by American Mutual Insurance Company (American Mutual), which began paying Louis temporary total incapacity benefits under \u00a7 34 at the rate of $58.34, an amount which equalled two-thirds of Louis\u2019s previous part-time earnings of $70.22.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Public continued to pay partial incapacity benefits under \u00a7 35 \u201cuntil the statutory maximum was reached on or about March 1992.\u201d <em>Louis, supra </em>at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">On August 1, 1991, Louis exhausted her temporary total incapacity benefits under \u00a7 34 which were limited to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>compensation period of not more than 260 weeks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that time, Louis entered a claim against American Mutual for permanent and total incapacity benefits under \u00a7 34A in addition to a claim she entered against Public for \u00a7 34A benefits arising out of her original injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The claims for \u00a7 34A benefits initially arose in a prehearing conference on February 24, 1992, before an administrative judge who denied the claim against Public and ordered American Mutual to pay Louis \u00a7 34A benefits at the rate of $58.34 a week, based on an average weekly wage of $70.22. Both American Mutual and Louis appealed, although American Mutual subsequently withdrew its appeal. On March 4, 1993, another administrative judge filed his decision. According to the judge, the single issue for determination was, \u201cwhether the partial disability payments collected by the employee at the time of her second injury should be included in the calculation of her average weekly wage\u201d used to determine benefits under \u00a7 34A. The judge answered this question in the negative, holding that such inclusion was not permitted under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. A divided panel of the board affirmed the judge\u2019s decision, suggesting that \u201c[although the result reached here creates a disincentive for an employee to return to work,\u201d an ameliorative solution would have to await legislative action. <em>Louis, supra </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">An employee\u2019s average weekly wage is defined in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1), as \u201cthe earnings of the injured employee during the period of twelve calendar months immediately preceding the date of injury, divided by fifty-two.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This case presents an issue of first impression, as we have not previously determined whether partial disability payments received by an employee following a work-related injury should be included in the calculation of an employee\u2019s average weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>wage for purposes of compensating that employee when she incurs subsequent injury in the course of her employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Louis correctly points out that the board\u2019s decision \u201cworks to unjustly penalize an employee who in good faith returned to work in an effort to minimize her disability.\u201d The difficulty in this case resides in the fact that, like <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, ante </em>126 (1997), this case addresses a potential uncertainty in our workers\u2019 compensation scheme which has long been unresolved: What is the appropriate level of compensation for an employee who is receiving partial compensation for a previous injury if that employee is subsequently injured in the course of less-remunerative employment? See L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 343, at 403 (2d ed. 1981). The board rejected Louis\u2019s argument that her average weekly wage for \u00a7 34A benefits should be computed by referring back to the average weekly wage on which her partial incapacity benefits were based as well as her argument that the nature and terms of her employment made it impracticable to compute an average weekly wage under \u00a7 1 (l)\u2019s basic provision. We also reject these contentions. In the circumstances before us, using the employee\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of her first injury to compute average weekly wages at the time of a subsequent injury does not comport with the instructions of \u00a7 1 (1) which direct us to determine an employee\u2019s average weekly wages by examining the employee\u2019s earnings \u201cduring the period of twelve calendar months immediately preceding\u201d the injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But see <em>Stone\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 658, 661 (1945). Nor does \u00a7 1 (1) justify a finding of impracticability where the employee was employed in the same position for nearly four years before the second injury, making a twelve-month wage calculation easily ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">What we decline to affirm is the board\u2019s holding that partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>incapacity benefits do not fit within the \u00a7 1 (1) definition of average weekly wage. We have noted before that while \u00a7 1 (1) makes reference to \u201cthe earnings of the injured employee,\u201d it \u201cdoes not detail the categories of benefits factored into the determination of such \u2018earnings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Borofsky\u2019s Case, </em>411 Mass. 379, 380 (1991). In the past we have read this provision to include tips, <em>Powers\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 515, 520 (1931); commissions, <em>Perkins\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 294, 301-302 (1932); and room and board, <em>Palomba\u2019s Case, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 881 (1980). We have adopted an \u201cinterpretive approach\u201d to this section, recognizing that \u201cour workers\u2019 compensation act \u2018sets up a system of money payments for the loss of earning capacity sustained by an employee by reason of a work-connected injury,\u2019 \u201d <em>Gunderson\u2019s Case, </em>423 Mass. 642, 644 (1996), quoting L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 301, at 344 (2d ed. 1981), and it should \u201cbe interpreted in the light of its purpose and, so far as reasonably may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). In 1991, following our decision in <em>Bor of sky\u2019s Case, supra, </em>which held that health insurance benefits were not a component of an employee\u2019s average weekly wage, \u00a7 1 (1) was amended to include language that \u201csuch fringe benefits as health insurance plans, pensions, day care, or education and training programs provided by employers shall not be included in employee earnings for the purpose of calculating average weekly wages under this section.\u201d St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 13. The board reviewing Louis\u2019s claim rejected partial disability payments as a component of average weekly wage with the explanation that such benefits \u201care not \u2018earnings\u2019 but a substitute therefor.\u201d <em>Louis, supra </em>at 313. It is precisely because these benefits are awarded to compensate the employee for earnings they would have received, but for an industrial injury, see <em>Don Francisco\u2019s Case, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 460 (1982), that we are willing to include these \u00a7 35 benefits within the definition of \u00a7 1 (1). Not only do these benefits \u201cbear a close analogy to wages paid by [the employer],\u201d <em>Powers\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 519, but they are provided by our workers\u2019 compensation statutes as a direct substitute for such wages \u2014 not fringe benefits by any interpretation, but compensation provided to meet an employee\u2019s fundamen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>tal needs which propelled her to seek employment in the first place.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">American Mutual argues that this inclusion would impose an unjust burden on an insurer who relied on the employee\u2019s stated wage when it calculated the employer\u2019s contractual premium and thus would expose the insurer to risks it did not contemplate. While this may be true, such a risk is always a possibility under the Massachusetts successive insurer rule which requires the insurer on the risk at the time of a subsequent injury to compensate an employee for the incapacity which results from a series of industrial accidents, even if those injuries occurred while another insurer was on watch and the ultimate incapacity is substantially worsened by virtue of the earlier injury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 133; <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., </em>370 Mass. 674, 675 (1976). Recognizing that this rule may require insurers to pay more than they initially contemplated, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 37 of the workers\u2019 compensation act which provides second insurers with a possibility of reimbursement for up to seventy-five per cent of the compensation they are required to provide when an employee with a known physical impairment which is likely to be an obstacle to employment suffers <em>\u201ca </em>personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>injury for which compensation is required by this chapter and which results in disability that is substantially greater by reason of the combined, effects of such impairment and subsequent injury.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37 (1994 ed.). Although the reimbursement provided by this section is not available until the insurer has paid benefits for two years, the insurer capable of spreading risks is certainly better equipped to bear this burden than the employee who has lost her means of earning a livelihood. Section 37 expresses a legislative policy to encourage employees to return to work and helps alleviate disincentives which might prevent their being rehired. See <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 133. Including partial incapacity benefits within an employee\u2019s average weekly wage comports with the purpose behind \u00a7 37 and \u201cthe policy that the industry should bear the burden of industrial accidents.\u201d <em>Mizrahi\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 733, 736 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The board rejected Louis\u2019s proposal because it determined Louis\u2019s dilemma required a legislative solution. We have held that Louis\u2019s average weekly wage can be understood more inclusively without resort to the Legislature, but we note that our present holding is not likely to effect as favorable a solution for some other workers who may find themselves in this same predicament in the future. While including partial disability benefits in her average weekly wage allows Louis to attain her entire preinjury 1982 weekly wage, subsequent amendments to G. L. c. 152 have altered the scenario for others. When Louis was first injured, \u00a7 35 required an insurer to pay the injured employee \u201ca weekly compensation equal to the entire difference between his average weekly wage before the injury and the average weekly wage he is able to earn thereafter.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, as appearing in St. 1981, c. 572, \u00a7 2. Today \u00a7 35 limits an employee who is partially incapacitated to sixty per cent of this difference, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35 (1994 ed.), reducing the extent to which partial disability benefits can help ease the combined losses resulting from successive injuries. Additionally, partial disability benefits eventually run out, and that was the case even before the more recent revisions. Under our current statute, an employee can receive such compensation for not more than five years (260 weeks). <em>Id. </em>Thus, if an employee suffers a subsequent injury after these benefits have run out so that these benefits have not been a part of her earnings \u201cduring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the period of twelve calendar months immediately preceding the date of injury,\u201d the injured employee will not be able to include them as a component of her average weekly wage, and her benefit will be calculated only according to the reduced wages of her subsequent employment, whether it was less remunerative than the position she filled prior to her initial injury or not. A more comprehensive solution will have to await legislative attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The sum actually exceeded Louis\u2019s former earnings by two cents. Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, as appearing in St. 1981, c. 572, \u00a7 2, partial incapacity benefits were meant to fill \u201cthe entire difference between [the employee\u2019s] average weekly wage before the injury and the average weekly wage he is able to earn thereafter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\">American has since become insolvent and, under the provisions of G. L. c. 175D (1994 ed.), its obligations were assumed by the Guaranty Fund/ Helmsman Management. We shall refer to the second insurer as American Mutual throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">This section has since been amended so that a claimant can receive benefits under \u00a7 34 for a period of not more than 156 weeks. St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 59.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The section also includes alternative provisions for calculating an employee\u2019s average weekly wage if the injured employee lost more than two weeks of work during the previous year or the length of employment was so short that a calculation under the basic provision would be impractical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The board was faced with this issue once as an ancillary issue in <em>Hunnicutt </em>v. <em>General Dynamics, </em>5 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 215 (1991), but did not have to address it because the board found the employee had not been entitled to partial disability benefits at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\">In <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, ante </em>126 (1997), we determined that it was appropriate to refer back to Sliski\u2019s skills, abilities, and employment prospects at the time of his first injury. Reference back to Sliski\u2019s initial injury was appropriate under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51 (1994 ed.), which addresses the situation of young employees injured early in their careers and instructs us that an employee\u2019s benefits are \u201cnot [to] be limited to the circumstances of the employee\u2019s particular employer or industry at the time of injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The board was concerned lest the interpretation of \u00a7 1 (1) we give now would force us to include social security disability benefits, private disability insurance, veteran\u2019s disability benefits, disability pensions, or other similar forms of monetary payment an employee might be receiving at the time of injury in the calculation of an average weekly wage. We reject this concern, recognizing that while these other revenue sources resemble partial disability benefits to the extent that they insure an employee against economic hardship and disability, this similarity is not enough to place them within the compass of \u00a7 1 (1). Our workers\u2019 compensation act explicitly states that \u201c[ejxcept as expressly provided elsewhere in this chapter, no savings or insurance of the injured employee <em>independent of this chapter </em>shall be considered in determining compensation payable thereunder, nor shall benefits derived from any other source than the insurer be considered in such determination\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 38 (1994 ed.). Partial disability benefits, however, are explicitly created by c. 152 and contemplated by the workers\u2019 compensation act as a form of substitute earnings and are thus appropriately included within an employee\u2019s earnings for purposes of the act\u2019s definition of average weekly wage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The board\u2019s dissenting member aptly recognized that the majority\u2019s position appears to violate the intent of the successive insurer rule by \u201ceffectively limit[ing] compensation carrier responsibility to the effects of the final injury.\u201d <em>Louis </em>v. <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, </em>8 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 311, 316 (1994) (Fischel, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
