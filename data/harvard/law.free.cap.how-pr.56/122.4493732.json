Taking the* most favorable view of the .case for the petitioner, on the papers presented, he can only be said to have established that he claims to be a creditor at large of the' defendant. As such creditor he has ho status in a court of equity ( <em>Dunleavy </em>agt. <em>Tallmadge, </em>32 <em>N. Y., </em>457; <em>McCartney </em>agt. <em>Bostwick, </em>32 <em>N. Y., </em>53; <em>McDermott </em>agt. <em>Strong, </em>4 <em>John. Ch., 687; Reuben </em>agt. <em>Joel, </em>3 <em>Kernan, </em>488; <em>Crippen </em>agt. <em>Hudson, </em>3 <em>Kernan, </em>161; <em>Becks </em>agt. <em>Burdett, </em>7 <em>Paige, </em>305).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The case of <em>The Railroad Company </em>agt. <em>Howard </em>( 7 <em>Wall. Rep., p. </em>392) was an action by creditors who had recovered judgments against the company and had issued executions thereon which had been returned <em>nulla bona (See p., </em>397).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The case does not, therefore, avail the petitioner. So in the case of <em>Schenck </em>agt. <em>Ingraham </em>(5 <em>Hun Rep., p. </em>397) the petitioners had recovered judgment and an execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">If the case of <em>Dambman </em>agt. <em>The Empire Mill and others </em>is to be construed as maintaining an adverse position to that just stated, it is in, conflict with numerous, decisions of the court of appeals of this state and the latter decisions must control me in the. disposition of this motion. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>if the plaintiff has the first or specific lien which he claims, as he is not a party to the foreclosure suit, no rights which he may possess can be affected by the judgment in that action. The suggestion was made upon the argument that as Mr. \u25a0 Me Henry\u2019s claim was a large one he has an exceptional interest in protecting what is denominated as the general creditor\u2019s fund. I do not concede the force of this argument. If the petitioner has not proven his debt by obtaining a'judgment, he cannot be regarded in equity as a creditor and neither the insignificance nor the magnitude of his claim can alter the principle governing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">There is another consideration which maybe properly entertained in disposing of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">It appears from the papers before me that the plaintiff as a coplaintiff with others has a suit now pending in which the validity of all the proceedings in the foreclosure suit brought by the Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Company is questioned. . This includes of course the decree. The .plaintiff will have an ample opportunity to establish in that suit the invalidity of the decree of foreclosure, and if the irregularities exist which he alleges he can be relieved after evidence shall have been received in the usual formal manner incident to a tidal, of a cause upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Here I am asked to allow the petitioner to intervene upon affidavits alone and to stay the sale under a decree which on its face is regular and legal. I regard the petitioner on the papers before me as having failed to establish such a standing in court as authorizes him to intervene in the above-entitled actions, and his motion' must, therefore, be denied with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
