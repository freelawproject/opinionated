The order directed that service be made upon the parties to be examined or upon their attorney. Service was made upon the attorney alone. The defendants, who resided at Port Wayne, Indiana, failed to appear for examination at the appointed time and place. The plaintiffs, thereupon, applied for an order striking out the defendants\u2019 answer as a-punishment for their failure to appear. Upon the argument, which was had at special term before Daniels, J., the defendants\u2019 counsel objected, that the service of the order for examination was incomplete and that it should have been served upon the parties to be examined as well as upon their attorney, as had been held in <em>Riddle </em>agt. <em>Gram </em>(5 <em>Weekly Dig., </em>277). The objection was overruled and the defendants\u2019 answer was stricken out, unless within five days the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ants consented to appear and submit to an examination under the original order theretofore made. The defendants declined to give such consent and appealed.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJz\">Note.\u2014A ruling to the same effect was made by the Saratoga special term of the supreme court (7 <em>Weekly Digest, </em>312), in which judge Bocees <em>(onp. </em>314) says: \u201c Without further elaboration of this subject here I will remark that I have carefully considered the case of <em>Biddle </em>agt. <em>Oram </em>(5 <em>Weekly Dig., </em>277) and am entirely satisfied with the line of reasoning there adopted.\u201d [Rep.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-5\"><em>John E. </em>Brodsky, for appellant, cited and relied upon <em>Biddle </em>agt. <em>Qram </em>(5 <em>Weekly </em>Digest, 277).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-6\"><em>Ira Leo </em>Bamberger, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The general term reversed the order of the special term upon the ground that the service of the order for examination upon the attorney alone was not sufficient to warrant the order striking out the defendants\u2019 answer.
