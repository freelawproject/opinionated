This will require a deposit of United States securities to the amount of $85,000. We have ordered the purchase of part of this sum, but it is not convenient for the bank to spare funds for the whole amount on such short notice. Mr. Starin and I have thought it best to ask you to lend the bank so much of your United States five-twenties as may be needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>for the purpose named; the bank will replace the securities soon, and before any interest will be due thereon. In addition to the security of the bank for the return of the securities within the time specified, you may consider me as hereby pledging my personal responsibility for the performance on the part of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Very truly yours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">\u201cR.

Beardsley decided to take for the use of the bank $44,000 of them to be deposited with the comptroller of the currency, and the remaining $11,000 were placed by the cashier in his private box, kept in the vault, and they were afterwards used by him for his own purposes. The plaintiff was not informed, until years afterwards, that the whole of the $55,000 of bonds were not used by the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">During several years the plaintiff was credited in his bank account with not only the interest on the $55,000 of bonds, but also of an additional amount of $19,500 of bonds that plaintiff had on deposit in the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-10\">Soon after these bonds were borrowed, and before the time fixed for the return of the same to the plaintiff, the Cayuga County Rational Bank, which in the meantime had been organized, placed in the hands of its cashier (Starin), available securities to an amount sufficient to purchase bonds to put in the place of those borrowed, and the cashier did purchase and put them in the place of those borrowed,, but did not restore any of those borrowed of the plaintiff, although he told the president from time to time that he was purchasing bonds for that purpose, and at one time told him he had purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the whole quantity required to replace the bonds borrowed, except $10,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">The cashier appropriated to \"his own use the whole of the plaintiffs bonds, except about $3,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">The plaintiff called at the bank on several occasions between the time the bonds should have been replaced and the discovery of their misappropriation by the cashier, and was, on each occasion, told the bank was using them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-7\">When the plaintiff learned of the loss of the bonds he called at the bank and the president told him his bonds had been replaced by the bank and, therefore, stolen by the cashier, and for that reason insisted that the bank was not liable, and Starin and other officers of' the bank made the same statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-8\">A compromise was finally proposed, and after some negotiation was agreed upon, that the bank and Starin should be released upon paying to the plaintiff $30,000 in cash and the notes of Starin, payable on demand, for $63,300 with divers collaterals, and, thereupon, the plaintiff executed and delivered the following release, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-9\">\u201c Whereas a controversy has existed, and does now exist, between Benjamin Gould and The Oayuga County National Bank in relation to the liability of said bank to said Gould, by reason of certain transactions in regard to certain United States securities, which controversy has been amicably settled between the parties by the payment by said bank to the said Gould of the sum of $25,000, now, in consideration of said sum from said bank, I do hereby release and discharge said bank'from all liability or claim by reason of any matter or thing growing out of the matters above referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-10\">\u201cAubuex, <em>Ma/rch </em>13, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-11\">(Signed) \u201cBENJAMIN GOULD.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-12\">As Starin was insolvent and liable to be proceeded against as a bankrupt, and if so proceeded against within four months from the delivery to plaintiff of the property as collateral to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>his note the transfer would he held void, the attorney of the plaintiff required the promise of the president of the bank, and of another creditor of said Starin, that neither the bank nor such other creditor would proceed against Starin in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">After the execution of this release, and in October, 1873, the plaintiff learned that it was not true that his bonds had been replaced, as was asserted by the officers of the bank and by Starin, and he then renewed his claims against the bank on the ground that he had been induced to release the bank and Beardsley, relying upon the representation that the bonds had been replaced and afterwards misappropriated by Starin, which representation was false and fraudulent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\">The action was brought for the value of the bonds and interest thereon. The defendants in their answer deny all the material allegations of the complaint, and as affirmative defenses set up the release and statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\">On the trial the plaintiff was examined as a witness in his own behalf and was asked by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel whether, in all his negotiations, it was upon the basis of the fact that the bonds had been returned to the bank and afterwards taken away by the cashier ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-8\">The question was objected to by the defendants\u2019 counsel and rejected by the court, to which ruling the plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-9\">At the close of the evidence defendants\u2019 counsel asked the court to nonsuit the plaintiff, or to direct a verdict for the defendants, and he asked it upon the release and discharge which had been put in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-10\">The court nonsuited the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked the court to submit to the jury the question whether the -settlement was or was not procured by the officers of the bank in bad faith, and also the question whether the bank paid any thing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-12\">The court refused said requests, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The court then ordered the case to be heard at general term in the first instance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-5\"><em>Rolldn Tracy </em>and <em>II. R. Selden, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab_\">The motion to dismiss the complaint was granted on the sole ground that the receipt given in evidence constituted a bar to the cause of action. If that receipt was obtained by fraud it constituted no bar. The compromise of a doubtful claim, or claim honestly disputed, is binding upon the parties, but only upon the condition that no fraud has been practiced by either party to produce the compromise <em>(Steuart </em>agt. <em>Ahrenfeldt, </em>4 <em>Denio, </em>189; <em>Farmers' Bank </em>agt. <em>Blair, </em>44 <em>Barb., </em>652, 653; <em>Steele </em>agt. <em>White, </em>2 <em>Paige, </em>478). That receipt was obtained by a most palpable and wicked fraud, <em>i. e., </em>by the representations of the bank officers that the bonds had been returned to the bank and had afterwards been taken away. It had been decided prior to the time of settlement and giving of that receipt that national banks were not authorized to receive bonds on special deposit for safekeeping, and were not liable for the misappropriation by their officers of securities so deposited ( <em>Wiley </em>agt. <em>First Nat. Bank of Brattleboro, </em>47 <em>Vermont, </em>546; <em>approved by </em>Allen, J., <em>in First National Bank </em>agt. <em>Ocean National Bank, </em>60 <em>N. Y., </em>279, 294; <em>Weekler </em>agt. <em>First National Bank of Hagerstown, </em>42 <em>Maryland, </em>581). Hence, the necessity for such representations. The general rule that notice to the agent is notice to the principal applies to corporations as well as to individuals <em>(McEwen </em>agt. <em>Mont. Co. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>101; <em>Cumberland Coal Co. </em>agt. <em>Sherman, </em>30 <em>Barb., </em>560; <em>Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, </em>299).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-6\"><em>W.

Assume that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>representations were made and that those representations were false and fraudulent, then the plaintiff cannot set up that the release was void for fraud while at the same time he holds on to the consideration upon which that release was given <em>(Story on Contracts, vol. </em>1, <em>section </em>623 <em>[fifth ed.]; Mason </em>agt. <em>Bovet, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>69; <em>Jennings </em>agt. <em>Gage, </em>13 <em>Ill., </em>610; <em>Tisdale </em>agt. <em>Buckmore, </em>13 <em>Me., </em>461; <em>Cocks </em>agt. <em>Rucks, </em>34 <em>Miss., </em>105 ; <em>Evans </em>agt. <em>Gale, </em>17 <em>N.

The vault was under their control, and it was the proper place to deposit the bonds if they had been returned. It was not pretended that any search was ever made by any officer of the bank. When they told the plaintiff that the bonds had been returned they stated that which they did not know to be true, and of which they had no knowledge except what they derived from Starin.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Starin\u2019s testimony on the trial shows that if he told the other officers of the bank that plaintiff\u2019s bonds had been returned he told them an untruth, they had not been and he knew it.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The bank cannot escape the consequences of a false representation made to a person dealing with it, and who by relying upon it is injured, by proving that its officers, or some of them, were told the falsehood by some other agent or officer of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The party has the right to rely upon the representation as being a matter within the personal knowledge of the person making it, unless the channel through which the information was received was disclosed to him before he entered into the contract or assumed the liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The plaintiff had the right to assume that the officers making the representation as to the return of his bonds had personal knowledge of the fact, and especially had he the right to assume they were not making it upon the faith of the statement alone of the cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">This was especially true as to the president. He was employed to watch over the interests and business of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>bank, to see that neither the cashier or other officers stole or \u25a0squandered its property or wronged those doing business with it.</p>\n<p id=\"A3A\">It was solely his duty to see that the bonds of the plaintiff were returned. The amount was large. The bank was liable if they were not returned as was he himself. The plaintiff could not hesitate to believe his statement, earnestly and repeatedly made, that the bonds had been returned. He was speaking as the chief financial officer of the- bank, and his statement was the statement of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The counsel of the plaintiff knew, if he did not, that the bank was not liable for the bonds if they had been returned to the bank and thereafter unlawfully appropriated by Starin or any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">If he believed the officers of the bank it was not liable, and his-only recourse was against Starin; to him must he look for whatever indemnity he should obtain for the wrong done him.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Starin was unable to do more than make good a small part of the loss, and as he was largely indebted to other, persons and to the bank itself a compromise became a matter of the highest necessity and importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">That the representation influenced the plaintiff in agreeing to the compromise and consequent release cannot, it seems to me, be doubted, but if the evidence did not establish the fact to the satisfaction of the court and jury the plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered to prove by the plaintiff that in all his negotiations as to the compromise he acted upon the basis of the fact that all the bonds had been returned and afterwards taken away by the cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">This evidence the court rejected, and it seems to me improperly. If not necessary to prove the fact offered the evidence was quite material, establishing the fact, as it would tend to do, that the plaintiff relied upon the representation, and was influenced by it, in entering into the compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">It is- essential, in order to establish a fraudulent representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tion, that it was made with intent to deceive the person to whom it was made <em>(Kerr on </em>Fraud, 55).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">This intent is established when it is shown that the representation is false within the knowledge of the person making it, or that he had no reasonable ground for believing it to be true, and makes -it with the view to induce another to act upon it who does so accordingly to his prejudice though he may not have been instigated by a morally bad motive <em>(Kerr, </em>55, 56).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The representations of Starin came directly within the principle above laid down by Kerr. He was the second highest officer in the bank, had full knowledge of the falsity of the statement and the bank was bound by it. It was made while the cashier was performing the duties of his office and in reference to the business of the bank, and was made with intent to deceive the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">If the jury had found these facts as it might have been done the plaintiff was entitled to recover. A case was made for avoiding the release, and that out of the way the right to recover was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">It is proper I should say that in preparing the statement of facts that precedes the opinion I made it solely from the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses without any reference to the evidence on the part of the defense, because the case not being submitted to the jury the plaintiff had the right to require the case to be reviewed on the assumption, by the court, that the jury might have believed the version of the transaction between the parties given by his witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">In view of the legal questions which are put forth in this opinion they are, upon the same assumption, that the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses is the correct-version of the acts and dealings of the parties without any reference to the case as presented by the' defendants\u2019 witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">The defendants\u2019 counsel suggests, as an answer to the alleged fraud in the release, that if the fraud was proved and found by the jury that the plaintiff could not recover as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>has not returned the property received hy him as the consideration of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">I do not find that this point was suggested on the trial, and it may be that the plaintiff has an answer to it had it been made. Unless there is an answer to it, it is probably fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">If the fact is, as alleged by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the bank paid nothing as the consideration for the release it would be void and neither the bank nor Beardsley could require any thing to be returned to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">These questions will come up on another trial and can be disposed of in view of the whole evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The nonsuit is set aside and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Taxcott, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Smith, J., does not sit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
