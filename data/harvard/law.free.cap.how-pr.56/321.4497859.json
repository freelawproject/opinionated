The defendant says he has a defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-12\"><em>Levi H. </em>Brown, for motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-13\"><em>Borwi/n &amp; Remington, </em>opposed.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b325-14\">Hardin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap3L\">If a case was made of bad faith or mismanagement, in the prosecution of the action, the court, in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>discretion, might impose costs personally. Such imposition might he made after trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The court, in its discretion, may require security for costs ( <em>Old Code, sec., </em>317; <em>Gedney </em>agt. <em>Purdy, </em>47 <em>N. Y., </em>676; <em>Norris </em>agt. <em>Breed, </em>12 <em>Abb. [N. </em>S]., 185). But when the action is brought and prosecuted in good faith such security will not he required <em>(Olcott </em>agt. <em>Maclean, </em>18 <em>Sup. Ct. R. </em>[11 <em>Hun], </em>394).</p>\n<author id=\"b326-6\">Rapallo, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajf\">says, in <em>Read </em>agt. <em>Waterhouse </em>(52 <em>N. Y., </em>589): \u201c The fact that the trust fund is under the jurisdiction of another tribunal, does not seem to me sufficient to overcome the express provisions of section 317.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">This motion has been put upon the ground that the plaintiff has no funds in his hands and the defendant does not cite a case where the mere absence of funds led the court to exercise its discretion under section 317 of the Code <em>(Darby </em>agt. <em>Condit, </em>1 <em>Duer, </em>599).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The case of Webb (18 <em>Sup. C. R. </em>[11 <em>Hun], </em>124), is not in point. The right of a foreign administrator or executor to sue in our courts was the point there involved. <em>Cummings </em>agt. <em>Edgerton </em>(9 <em>Bos., </em>685) was one where the action was to vex, and declared an unnecessary action by Bobebtsou . J. <em>Ketchonn a/nd Blake </em>agt. <em>dark </em>was a case where an assignee brought an appeal in name of his assignor and he was held to give security for costs (4 <em>John., </em>484 ).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">If the defendant shall be able, in the future progress of the action, to show mismanagement' or -bad faith he may make a motion predicated thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">This motion is denied with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
