The defendant\u2019s answer is a general denial of the allegations in the complaint, and alleges that plaintiff rendered certain services for defendant and one Samuel Ward, as trustees for the bondholders of the Gold Valley Mining Company, and that he has been fully paid therefor. The order of reference was made upon the pleadings, the bil\u00ed of particulars consisting of about sixty items and an affidavit of plaintiff that the trial of the action would involve the examination of a long account.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-13\"><em>T.

The plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars is not an account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>proper, in the legal sense of the term <em>(Dickinson </em>agt. <em>Mitchell, </em>19 <em>Abb., </em>286). Compulsory references are not matters of right, hut of judicial discretion, and the constitutional provision of the right to trial by jury cannot be too faithfully preserved. On the issues in this action, the defendant should have the right of submission to a jury, being for the professional services of a lawyer <em>(Flanders </em>agt. <em>Odell, </em>16 Abb. [N. S.], 247; <em>Martin </em>agt. <em>Windsor Hotel Co., </em>10 <em>Hun, </em>304).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-5\"><em>A. J.

The bill of particulars contains upwards of sixty items involving labor on at least sixty different days, making a \u201clong account\u201d within, the judicial definition and meaning of that expression ( <em>Continental Bank Note Co. </em>agt. <em>The Industrial Exhibition Co., </em>1 <em>Hun, </em>118).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><em>Present, </em>Davis, <em>P.
