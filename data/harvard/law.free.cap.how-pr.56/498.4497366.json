The defendants now apply, under section 1268 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for an order discharging the judgment of record. The plaintiff opposes the motion on the ground that the judgment which was duly docketed in Kings county is a lien upon two pieces of land therein situated, one of which was conveyed by the defendants after the docketing of the judgment and before their adjudication as bankrupts, and the other was conveyed by deed recorded since their discharge; and the plaintiff insists that the application should be denied, because if it is granted it will destroy her judgment lien on said property.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-10\"><em>Thomas D. </em>Robinson, for motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-11\"><em>J.

Bonner, 45 <em>N. Y., </em>379). In short, a judgment creditor has no <em>jus in re </em>but a mere naked power to make his general lien effectual by following up the steps of the law and consummating his judgment by execution and levy on the land <em>(See Conrad </em>agt. <em>Insurance </em>Co., 1 Peters, 387, 443). The new Code <em>(sec. </em>1268) allows the judgment creditor two years after the bankrupt\u2019s discharge to make his general lien effective; and whether he improves the opportunity or not it operates as a sort of statute of limitation and allows the bankrupt, after the two years have elapsed, to apply, upon proof of his discharge, to the court in which the judgment was recovered for an order directing it to be discharged of record; and if, upon the hearing of the motion, it is made to appear that the bankrupt has been discharged from the payment of the judgment, the Code <em>(sec. </em>1268) is mandatory <em>\u201c </em>that an order must be made \u201d granting the application. The defendants have supplied the necessary proofs and are, therefore, entitled to the relief they ask <em>(See Deyo </em>agt. <em>Van Valkenburgh, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>242). The lien of a. judgment recovered in a state court is regulated by the state law which creates and regulates- the nature, duration, effect and mode of discharge of such lien which, when declared, cannot' be restrained or extended by the court. There is nothing in the statute which authorizes a partial or conditional discharge of the judgment, or which authorizes the court, by decree or otherwise, to preserve and continue the lien of the judgment creditors upon any specific property, real or personal. The defendants are, by force of the statute, entitled to an unconditional order discharging the judgment and their motion, therefore, will be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
