The film product is intended to give a brilliantly reflective appearance to the surface to which it is attached while effectively protecting the surface from weathering.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">The product consists of the combination of an oriented transparent film of a polyester condensation product of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol (hereinafter referred to by the trademark \u201cMylar\u201d), a coating of metal such as aluminum applied on one surface of the film by vapor deposition, and a thin adhesive coating applied to the metal for bonding the film and its metal coating to solid surfaces. The adhesive consists of a blend of rubbery butadiene-acrylonitrile polymer, a heat-advancing phenol-formaldehyde resin compatible therewith, and various additional modifiers as desired. It is capable of retaining the film product on various surfaces against severe weathering and against vandalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">Appellants\u2019 specification describes, as an example, the following method of producing the product. The adhesive composition is first coated to a thickness of about 1% mils on polyethylene-coated Kraft paper, which constitutes a carrier web. A one mil thickness of Mylar film is separately vapor coated under vacuum with a minimum amount of aluminum required to produce a visibly opaque metallic layer. The exposed surface of the adhesive on the carrier web is then activated with a minimum application of methylethyl ketone, and is then pressed against the metallized surface of the \u201cMylar\u201d film under squeeze roll pressure. The carrier web is then readily stripped away, leaving the adhesive coating firmly bonded to the metallized film.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">Appealed claims 1, 2, and 8 are directed to appellants\u2019 film product made up of a highly oriented film which is a condensation product of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, having a vapor deposited metal coating thereon, in turn provided with a vandal-proof adhesive coating, for permanently bonding the film product to solid surfaces. Appealed claims 3, 4 and 7 recite articles to which the film products of claims 1, 2 and 8, respectively, are adhesively bonded. Appealed claim 6 calls for an article consisting of a film product as recited in claim 8, which is removably lightly bonded by means of the adhesive coating to a temporary carrier web. Appealed claim 5 relates to the method of producing the film product of claims 1, 2 and 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">The rejection of the claims as unpatentable over the prior art is based on obviousness of the claimed invention and raises an issue which requires an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>pretation of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> More specifically, this rejection requires a determination of what time is meant in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 by its use of the phrase \u201cat the time the invention was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AmxU\">The Primary Examiner\u2019s rejections on art, affirmed by the board, were that all the appealed claims are \u201cunpatentable over\u201d various combinations of references which we can only construe as a rejection for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. These various rejections seem to be correctly summarized in appellants\u2019 brief as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Claims Combination of References</p>\n<p id=\"ARs\">1, 3-8 Clauser article from \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d, June 1948 in view of Van Boskirk Nov. 1952 article from \u201cModern Plastics\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"AFY\">2 Clauser article in view of Van Boskirk Nov. 1952 article, and further in view of Groton et al. 2,-459,739 (granted 1/18/49).</p>\n<p id=\"AVt\">1,3-8 Schneider article from \u201cModern Plastics\u201d, April 1950 in view of Van Boskirk Nov. 1952 article.</p>\n<p id=\"AZl\">2 Schneider article in view of Van Boskirk Nov. 1952 article, and further in view of Groton et al.</p>\n<p id=\"A6y\">1-8 Bosch (German) 720,-879 (dated 4/16/42) in view of Van Boskirk Nov. 1952 article.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-22\">As can be seen from the above summary, the Van Boskirk article is relied upon as a secondary reference in each rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-23\">Clauser and Schneider were relied upon for a teaching of a vapor deposited coating of metal on plastic film where it is desired to produce a mirror or other specularly reflective surface. The substitution of the \u201cMylar\u201d film of Van Boskirk for the plastic film of either basic reference was considered by the examiner and board to be obvious to one skilled in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-26\">During the prosecution of the application, the examiner had withdrawn a rejection based on a patent to Prindle et al.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in view of an affidavit, showing completion of appellants\u2019 invention prior to January 18, 1952, the filing date of the Prindle et al. patent. The examiner refused, however, to accept appellants\u2019 position that Van Boskirk (published in November, 1952) was not a valid reference because of the affidavit, and referred to Section 715 of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure which points out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>that a \u201cRule 131 affidavit is of no avail when all of the references are more than a year earlier than applicants\u2019 filing date\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The claims stand rejected on a combination of at least two printed publications which combination always includes the Van Boskirk publication. The Van Boskirk publication is dated November 1952, at least ten months subsequent to the \u201cprior to January 18, 1952\" date which appellants successfully asserted as their date of invention in the affidavit which the Patent Office accepted \u201cunder the provisions of Rule 131\u201d as sufficient to overcome the Prindle et al. reference and to authorize its withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Van Boskirk, however, was published more than one year prior to appellants\u2019 filing date but since it does not \u201cdescribe\u201d the claimed invention, it is <em>not </em>a statutory bar under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The position of the examiner, affirmed by the board, is, in effect, that the claims are properly rejected under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 if the claimed invention was obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art <em>at the time the application was filed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 was a new provision in the Patent Act of 1952.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Its purpose was to take the place of the case-law requirement of \u201cinvention\u201d which developed during the preceding century.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *The many cases in which the requirement of \u201cinvention\u201d was stated had an underlying concept, namely, that the presence of \u201cinvention\u201d was to be determined as of the time the invention was made. This concept is now expressed in 35 U. 5. C. \u00a7 103<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-19\">As stated in In re Rothermel and Waddell, Jr., 276 F.2d 393, 47 CCPA 866:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-20\">\u201c * * * 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 is very specific in requiring that a rejection on the grounds the invention \u2018would have been obvious\u2019 must be based on a comparison between the prior art and the subject matter as a whole <em>at the time the invention was made.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-21\">See also In re Murray and Peterson, 268 F.2d 226, 46 CCPA 905. The rules promulgated by the Commissioner of Patents<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to give administrative effect to the Patent Act of 1952 do not appear to provide in express terms how an applicant, faced with a rejection for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, is to establish \u201cthe time the invention was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-22\">Appellants\u2019 position is that having established by an affidavit, accepted by the Patent Office as sufficient under Rule 131 to antedate the Prindle et al. patent, that their-date of invention is \u201cprior to January 18, 1952,\u201d they are at least entitled to rely upon this date as the date as of which the question of \u201cobviousness\u201d must be determined under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-23\">The solicitor urges that Rule 131 by its express terms prevents use of an affidavit where the date of the publication is more than one year prior to the filing date of the application. This provision, however, has reference to the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>bar which arises out of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the present case we do not have the question of a statutory time bar which arises under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) by reason of the failure of an applicant to file his application within one year of the date of the <em>anticipatory </em>publication. The question here is whether what is obvious to one of ordinary skill in an art is to be determined as of \u201cthe time when the invention was made,\u201d as specified in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, or whether it is to be determined as of some later date when the application is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We think both logic and reason require us to interpret the provisions of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 in accordance with the legal principles which preceded and are codified in it. The principles established before 1952 required that the time as of which the determination of \u201cinvention\u201d was to be made was \u201cthe time the invention was made.\u201d They apply equally to the determination of obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In the absence of any rules established by the Commissioner as to how this time of invention is to be established by an applicant faced with a rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, we accept as adequate the statement in the affidavit filed herein that the date when appellants\u2019 invention was made is \u201cprior to Jan. 18, 1952\u201d. At that time, the Van Boskirk reference had not been published. It cannot, therefore, be considered as establishing obviousness of the claimed invention under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. Since all the rejections of the claims as \u201cunpatentable over the art\u201d require the Van Boskirk publication, we will not sustain these rejections.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">The other ground of rejection is based on double patenting over claims 10 and 11 of the Keithly patent, owned by the assignee of the application at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Claims 10 and 11 of Keithly, on which the double patenting rejection is here based, call for a flexible sheet material comprising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">(1) \u201ca smooth-surfaced flexible carrier\u201d ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">(2) a thin, opaque, visibly continuous aluminum film, <em>temporarily adhered </em>to the smooth surface of said carrier; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">(3) a non-tacky heat-activatible adhesive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">The carrier to which the aluminum film is \u201ctemporarily adhered\u201d, readily permits the \u201cstripping\u201d of the carrier from the metal film. As stated in the specification, it must be \u201ccompletely and easily removed\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-16\">While, as contended by the board, \u201cMylar\u201d is referred to by Keithly as being applicable as a carrier, Keithly admonishes that \u201cparting layers, such as waxes\u201d are to be used where the \u201cmetal adheres excessively to the unprotected carrier surface.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">Appellants assert they have produced by the present invention what is characterized as \u201ca vandal-proof structure.\u201d Their three-element combination has the several elements so bonded that, when applied to a metal surface and pressed into place, it was, as stated in the specification, after 24 hours at room temperatures, impossible to strip any significant area of the film from the metal, i. e., the installation was vandal-proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">Claims 10 and 11 of Keithly are not directed to such structure, nor is it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>seen how appellants\u2019 structure could be embraced by the Keithly claims. The error of the board appears to us to reside in considering the temporary, flexible \u201ccarrier\u201d of Keithly as being the same as appellants\u2019 claimed transparent film element, which forms a permanent part of the claimed structure. The claims here on appeal, properly construed, define a different and patentably distinct invention from that claimed in Keithly claims 10 and 11, when the latter are thus interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Since we find appellants\u2019 claimed invention to be patentably distinct from the invention to which claims 10 and 11 of Keithly patent No. 2,703,772 are directed, we reverse this ground of rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-24\">. \u201c\u00a7 <em>10S.
