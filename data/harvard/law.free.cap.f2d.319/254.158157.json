No. 764,262, filed September 30, 1958, for \u201cAnimal Feeds Containing Aspirin.\u201d Claims 9-11, directed to such feeds and giving percentage ranges for the propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>tion of aspirin in the feed (0.002% to 0.05%), stand allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The Invention</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Claims 1-4 were also directed to feed but were withdrawn from the appeal at the oral argument. As to them, the appeal is dismissed. This leaves for our consideration only claims 5-8 which are directed to method and read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">\u201c5. The method of stimulating growth of ruminants, poultry and swine which comprises feeding animals rations supplying an effective amount of aspirin for growth stimulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">\u201c6. The method of stimulating growth which comprises feeding ruminants rations supplying an effective amount of aspirin for growth stimulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\"><em>\u201c7. </em>The method of stimulating growth which comprises feeding poultry rations supplying an effective amount of aspirin for growth stimulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">\u201c8. The method of stimulating growth which comprises feeding swine rations supplying an effective amount of aspirin for growth stimulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">It will be seen that claim 5 is generic to the others and that one of the limitations common to all claims is that the method is to be applied to certain animals, namely, <em>ruminants, poultry, and swine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">A second limitation common to the claims, and the essence of the invention sought to be patented, is that the method of stimulating growth resides in feeding the named animals <em>aspirin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">The final limitation relates to the <em>amount </em>of aspirin and the amount is stated in functional terms, <em>\u201can effective amount </em>* * * <em>for growth stimulation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">The \u201cPrior Art\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">Insofar as <em>stimulating </em>the growth of any animals by feeding them aspirin is concerned, there does not appear to be any prior <em>art. </em>A single reference has been cited, somewhat erroneously referred to by the examiner as \u201cprior art,\u201d as will appear, namely,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-19\">\u201cGross \u2014 The Salicylates, 1948, Hill-house Press, New Haven, Conn., page 123.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-20\">The only portion of that work relied on by the examiner reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-21\">\u201cKaiser [1955] gave 10 to 15 gr. of acetylsalicylic acid with magnesium oxide daily to 75 children for periods of 6 months to 1 year. No effect was observed on the rate of increase in weight and height as compared to 75 control children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-22\">\u201cKrantz, Iwamoto and Farson [19.45] fed a basic diet with 0.5 per cent acetylsalicylic acid or 0.2 to 0.5 per cent acetyl-5-bromosalicylic acid to rats for 8 weeks and measured their growth. In the animals given the acetylsalicylic acid there was no retardation of growth, while in those receiving acetyl-5-bromosalicylic acid there was virtually no growth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-23\">Acetylsalicylic acid is, of course, aspirin. See any modern dictionary and Bayer Co., Inc. v. United Drug Co., 2 Cir., 272 F. 505, 11 T.M.Rep. 178. Although aspirin is practically our national drug, it does-not appear from anything of record that its use as a growth <em>promoter </em>for any animal, human or otherwise, has ever been even suggested. As for the reference, we are in complete agreement with the appellant, whose brief states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-24\">\u201cIt seems pretty clear that the Gross reference stands for, and suggests, only one thing as far as the present case goes. That is, that feeding aspirin to children and rats over prolonged periods does not interfere with or retard growth of these two species of animals. As far as aspirin goes, this is the only teaching that can be derived from the reference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-25\">The Patent Office Solicitor attempts to make no more of it. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-26\">\u201cGross refers, on page 123 of a book entitled \u2018The Salicylates\u2019 (R-19), to the effect of aspirin on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>growth and states that Krantz et al. fed a basic diet with 0.5% acetylsalicylic acid to rats for 8 weeks and found no retardation of growth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">And that is all he says.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Our reaction to the disclosure of the sole reference is that anyone reading it would extract from it only the impression that aspirin in reasonable or practical dosages has no affect whatever on animal growth. To anyone interested in finding a drug for inducing weight increase, we would say that the reference definitely \u201cteaches away from\u201d the use of aspirin for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The Rejection</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> The solicitor\u2019s brief does not include a concise statement of the ground \u2022of rejection, which would have been de.sirable. At least it would have been \u2022desirable to include a statement of agreement or disagreement with what appellant says about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Appellant\u2019s brief, however, totally fails to state clearly what the ground of rejection is and so intertwines \u201csuggestions\u201d as to what the examiner did with argument as to obfuscate the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">At the very least, a brief should come to grips with the issue at the outset by presenting a concise statement of what it is that was done by the tribunal below that appellant wishes us to undo. If .appellant fails to do it, the appellee should. See Rule 27(3) (a) of this \u2022court. This function is not best performed by repeating verbatim, as was here done, two pages of \u201creasons of appeal,\u201d written long before the brief, including the usual generalized statements of error and otherwise couched in the usual repetitious terminology. In fact, in complying with our Rule 27(3) (b), it is generally preferable to us and leads to better briefs to include in the brief \u201cSuch of the errors as shall be relied upon\u201d by merely referring to those relied on as they appear in the record, already printed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">In the absence of assistance from \u2022counsel, we turn, therefore, to the record to discover the ground of rejection. The examiner\u2019s final rejection was on the sole ground that claims 1-8 are \u201cunpatentable over Gross.\u201d In his answer on the appeal to the board he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU9B\">\u201cClaims 1-8 are rejected as <em>unpatentable over Gross </em>who discloses * * * feeding rats a basic diet with 0.5 percent acetylsalicylic acid or 0.2 to 0.5 percent aeetyl-5-bromosalicylic acid for 8 weeks. Appellant seeks to distinguish over this teaching by attempting to limit the claims so as to exclude rat feed and feeding rats. It is not clear that the composition of a rat <em>feed </em>would distinguish patentably over the <em>feed </em>of ruminants, poultry or swine. In any event it would appear that <em>no invention </em>would be involved in incorporating aspirin in the feed of other animals for the same purpose taught by Gross, namely <em>studying </em>the effect of the aspirin on the growth of the animals. Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that aspirin is commonly mixed in food in order to administer it to babies. Thus the attempt to exclude rat feed or feeding rats from the claims would not render the claims patentable because of the <em>obviousness </em>of the one <em>feed </em>over the other. These claims define the <em>proportion </em>of aspirin in the feed in <em>functional </em>language and <em>thus </em>applicant <em>seeks to distinguish over the Gross teaching </em>at the exact point of novelty.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">In affirming this rejection, the board restated it by saying, \u201cClaims 1 to 8 have been rejected as <em>unpatentable over Gross. </em>* * * It is the position of the Examiner that the <em>only real novelty </em>over the reference <em>is in the proportions </em>of aspirin as defined in the allowed claims.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) Continuing, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-15\">\u201cThe reference clearly discloses an animal feed including aspirin. We are of the opinion that merely denoting it as a swine feed, for example, rather than a feed intended to be fed to animals generally or to rats <em>does not patentably distin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>guish </em>the claimed composition <em>from the prior art. </em>* * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201c * * *. We do not find that the <em>proportions </em>of aspirin, defined in <em>functional </em>terms are of any patentable significance, beyond the proportions set out in the allowed claims.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In an opinion on reconsideration, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u201cThe prior art clearly discloses feeding rats rations containing aspirin. We remain of the opinion that feeding the same composition to some other animal is not a patentable invention. * * *. We remain of the view that the definition of the proportions in functional terms is of no patentable significance beyond the proportions set out in the allowed claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">What does all this mean ? In the first place, it is to be noted that the board, like the examiner, made no distinction between the claims to a <em>feed, </em>which have been dropped (except for the allowed claims specifying percentages of aspirin), and the claims on appeal which are to a <em>method. </em>Eegardless of this fact, it is entirely clear to us that <em>there is but one rejection </em>and that is, <em>unpatentability over the disclosure of Gross. </em>In considering that rejection, and only for that purpose, the Patent Office has regarded the \u201cfunction\u201d definition of the \u201cproportions\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of aspirin as without significance in helping patentably to distinguish the claims over Gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">At oral argument, in response to a question from the bench, the solicitor stated that the ground of rejection before us is that claims 5-8 are unpatentable over Gross, predicated on 35 U.S.C. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">With the issue thus crystallized, we now proceed to a consideration of the propriety of the rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">In the foregoing rejection it will be seen that the claims were never rejected on the <em>ground </em>that they were functional. The <em>fact </em>that the <em>amount </em>of aspirin was expressed functionally was used only in support of the rejection for unpatentability over Gross. The sole issue we have to decide is obviousness of the claimed method in view of the teaching of that reference. 35 U.S.C. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">It is impossible to say whether the board agreed or disagreed with the examiner\u2019s view that \u201cthe only real novelty over the Gross composition is in the proportions of aspirin as defined in the allowed claims.\u201d The board merely held that the claims with the functional definition of amount did not distinguish from Gross. Our view of the matter, with respect to the method claims, is that the <em>real </em>novelty is as defined in all of the appealed claims \u2014 stimulating the growth of ruminants, poultry, or swine <em>by feeding them aspirin </em>for that purpose. Gross obviously suggests no such method. On the contrary, that reference suggests that such a method is an impossibility, not merely as a theoretical proposition, moreover, but on the basis of laboratory tests and controlled experiments. We therefore disagree with the rejection on Gross, the only rejection made, and also with the corollary proposition that the \u201creal novelty\u201d must reside in the amount of aspirin fed, rather than in the feeding of aspirin for the stated purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">While the Patent Office tribunals made no suggestion that the functional definition of amount in the appealed claims was in any way <em>objectionable, </em>confining their views to the inability of that definition to distinguish over the reference, the solicitor\u2019s brief seems to have misapprehended the situation and indulges in lengthy discussion of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>irrelevancy, namely, the requirement of U.S.C. il-12, ..second-' paragraph/-\u2018 for definiteness .in claims, citingo.rnr; decision in-.i\u2019In re Arbeit, et al.,. 206 F.2d 947; 41 CCPA 719. Neither that statute nor that case has-direct bearing on \u00a1the issue'here.- We.note;, however,--that in the Arbeit ease this- court \u25a0 expressly- approved the use-, of terminology- in/claims, \u25a0to which the Patent -Office had- objected as ..\u201cfunctional;\u2019! \u25a0 Here appellant is -alleging as unobvious the <em>use </em>of aspirin <em>\u25a0for growth \u25a0 promotion, </em>in: named animals, not the <em>amount </em>used, which.may. be, from the least effective amount tq .the ajnount beyond which -no further beneficial effect is, observed. , In other, words.,-(unsuited traditional patent \u00a1claim terminology), enough to, work but not too niuch,.. .\u201cEffective amount\u201d-admirably states .what is -to be derived, from..the,disclqsure of the .specification as: to., amount and we can s.ee nothing \u201ccritical\u201d - about, the .amount in. determining the-existence..of patentable invention. . - . ..</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u2018 Furthermore, and though we feel that there is' no issue here as to the propriety of so-called \u201cfunctional\u201d - definitions -of uncritical <em>amount, </em>it may be helpful to note that such definitions are-not only common but have- been' expressly approved in many cases including the following: Locklin et al. v.

This is irrelevant. The only question here is the allowability of the appealed , claims under the law. We find them allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">The appeal is dismissed as to claims 1-4. _ As to claims 5-8, the decision of the board is, reversed. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-13\">MARTIN, J., concurs in result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\">. It was perhaps proper to speak of \u201cproportions\u201d with respeet to the amount of aspirin in the ration of <em>feed </em>referred to in the <em>feed </em>claims 1-4; but with reference to the method claims on appeal it is a question of <em>amount </em>of aspirin <em>fed to the animal </em>in practicing the method, not \u201cproportions.\u201d All the method claims call for is getting an effective amount of aspirin into the animal <em>in </em>its rations. These claims do not define \u201cproportions,\u201d only amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-5\">. This st\u00e1tement may be a little too broad.

As we said in In re Lundberg, 244 F.2d 543, 44 CCPA 909:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201c * * * The requirement in the second paragraph of section 112 that \u2018the specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention\u2019 has not been at all diminished by the addition of the third paragraph; the latter paragraph must be read in the light of the first and second paragraphs and given an interpretation consistent with their clear meaning. In re Arbeit [et al]. * * * \u201d [206 F.2d 947, 41 CCPA 719].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Section 112 expressly requires that claims particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of the invention. Appellant has done that in his allowed claims.- But the language \u201can effective amount of aspirin for growth stimulation\u201d cl\u00e9arly covers' more than what appellant has in fact invented. To allow a claim of such vagueness and breadth would necessarily preclude others from further development in this field, else risk infringement, and would grant appellant an unjustifiable monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-18\">. 35-U.S.C. 103.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-19\">. 35 U.S.C. 112.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
