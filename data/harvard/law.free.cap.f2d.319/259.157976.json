No. 498,089, entitled \u201cTire Treads and Rubber Stock Therefor.\u201d The claims stand rejected solely as \u201cfailing to define the alleged invention properly.\u201d More specifically, claims 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48 have been rejected as \u201cindefinite and ambiguous\u201d and all claims as \u201cunduly broad and functional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Appellant\u2019s invention relates to a tread stock usable, for example, in vehicle tire treads which are alleged to \u201cimprove the traction of * * * tires when they engage a road or pavement which is wet or which is wholly or partly covered with a water-containing substance, such as snow or ice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Appellant describes his invention as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">\u201cIn accordance with the present invention, a carbohydrate, a protein, or mixture thereof, which is insoluble or which is only slightly soluble in cold water but which forms a colloidal suspension therein, together with one or more inorganic salts which are effective in maintaining the carbohydrate, protein, or mixture thereof, in colloidal suspension in the film of water which forms around the tire tread when the tire engages a wet or icy road or pavement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2are incorporated in a finely divided state in rubber, together with the other compounding ingredients which have previously been utilized in combination with rubber, to form the rubber stock for forming the tire tread.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">Claim 38 is representative and reads as follows:,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"pA0U\">\u201c38. A rubber stock for producing tire treads including as the base portion a major proportion of rubber, a sufficient amount of a vulcanizing agent to vulcanize the rubber, and a reinforcing agent in an amount sufficient to provide a tread stock having high abrasive resistance, said rubber stock also including in addition to the base portion a mixture of a nonadhesive protein and a carbohydrate<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which mixture is substantially insoluble in cold water and which is homogenously [sic] distributed throughout the base portion of the rubber stock, said mixture of carbohydrate and protein being approximately of a particle size that is fine enough to pass through a 300 mesh screen and being present in an effective amount ranging from more than incidental<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>impurities up to 20% by weight of the base portion of the rubber stock, and an inorganic salt that is capable of holding a mixture of said carbohydrate and protein in colloidal suspension in water, said inorganic salt being in a sufficiently finely divided state to form a homogenous [sic] mixture with the base portion of the rubber stock and being homogenously [sic] distributed throughout the base portion of the rubber stock and being present in an effective amount ranging from more than incidental<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> impurities up to 20% by weight of the base portion of the rubber stock and in an amount sufficient to hold the mixture of carbohydrate and protein in colloidal suspension in a film of water which forms around a tire tread composed of the stock when the tread rotatably engages a wet or icy road or pavement and small particles of the base portion of the rubber stock and small particles of the carbohydrate, protein, and the inorganic salt are worn from the tread.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The Definiteness of the Claims</p>\n<p id=\"A6a\">The rejection of claims,38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48 as indefinite and ambiguous was set forth by the examiner in his answer as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">\u201cThe recitation \u2018present in an effective amount ranging from more than incidental impurities,\u2019 limiting the amount of salt, protein and/or carbohydrate present is indefinite and ambiguous since it is neither apparent how much constitutes an effective amount nor is it obviouc what constitutes an incidental impurity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">The board, while ostensibly affirming this rejection, noted that the portion of the claims quoted by the examiner did not make the tire tread stock recited therein distinguishable from that disclosed by Davis et al.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a reference considered by the examiner to be inapposite to the claims now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-17\">After considering the Davis et al. disclosure in detail, we are unable to see its pertinence to the claims in their present form. This conclusion finds support in the failure of the solicitor to do more than note the existence of the Davis et al. reference and mention in a cursory fashion the manner in which the board made use of it in \u201caffirming\u201d the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-18\">The essence of the Patent Office rejection on indefiniteness is that a recitation in the <em>claims </em>of \u201can effective amount ranging from more than incidental impurities\u201d would place an \u201cundue burden * * * upon the public, to determine the operable proportions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-19\">We think the examiner\u2019s rejection of the instant claims as failing to <em>enable </em>the public \u201cto determine operable proportions\u201d is misplaced. Such is the function of the <em>invention description </em>and not that of the claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant stated before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the board that when \u201cany amount of the .non-adhesive protein, carbohydrate, or a\u00a1 mixture thereof, is present, .some effect,\"Will be obtained.\u201d The .Patent Office does not dispute .this statement. As in the case of In re Gay, 309 F.2d 769, 50 CCPA 725, when we, consider wbut: appellant\u2019s invention really is, we find that .appellant has clearly stated <em>in the ..ynfiptgn. description, of his invention </em>that p^rticulur,aspect thereof..is not crucial,,(in.. .this ..instapce that, .one could, vary within .wide, jimits the amounts of non-adhesive protein and/or carbohydrate, and still achieve an operable form of his'invention.' We do not consider pertinent to the instant, rejection, which is not based oh prior art, the obvious fact that' if' 'extremely' small, quanf\u00edti\u00e9s. of carbohydrate ' ari'd/or rion-adhesiVe protein were* \u00fasedtb'e''\u201ceffect \"* [ obtained\u2019'\u2019 vtfould' be extremely' small. , Accordingly, insofar'as ibA'instant rejection oh indefinitehess and ambiguity may be considered to be based on the failure of appellMt to comply with the require-meAts\"of th\u00e9 paraghaph of 35 U.S.G. \u00a7 T12, \u2018 we \u00e1re \"nc\u00edt pfersu\u2019\u00e1'ddd that any' \u201cundue1 burden\u201d\" is pla'\u00e9\u00e9d on the public by \u2019appellant\u2019s disclosure.' We therefore reverse the rejectidnbf1 claims'\u201938, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48 as indefinite and ambiguous. . . \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>The Undue Breadth and Functionality of the Claims </em>\u20181</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">This rejection, was set forth by the examiner in'his answer as follows (emphasis ours)':</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">\u201cThe, recitation \u25a0 \u2018inorganic salt that is capable of holding a mixture of said protein and/or carbohydrate in colloidal suspension\u2019 is unduly broad and. functional. ,\u2018Inorganic salt\u2019 reads on, literally thousands of materials,. :,muny of which .would <em>not be operative, </em>for, applicant\u2019s purpose. For example, some salts <em>could </em>readily react with, the other ingredients in the \u00a1composition while other salts <em>could </em>be corrosive or destructive. of the rubber. This recitation is functional since it merely describes how the salt functions as the surface of the tire wears away. It is well established that claims should set out what .the materials are and not by what they .do. In re Fullam 1947 C.D. 352 [34 CCPA 1018, 161 F.2d 247, 73 USPQ 399].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">The board' .affirmed- this portion of&gt; the examiner\u2019s-rejection,'Stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-13\">\u201cWhile the Examiner has not speeifi-1 cally' listed any salt as being inoperative, his' rejection is not based upon the ground of inoperativeness <em>per se </em>but rather upon'the inordinate breadth of the claimed salts when it is not apparent from the disclosure of only, four-salts what other salts would be suitable to serve the function asserted and required by the claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">(a) Functionality</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">\u201cFunctional\u201d language in claims is not expressly condemned by the patent statutes.

This combination is distinguishable \u201cfrom the old art\u201d in that, inter alia, it is new, i. e., no evidence exists that it describes a \u201cproduct of earlier manufacture.\u201d The tendency of appellant\u2019s combination to remedy the tire skidding problems in the art is not even mentioned in the appealed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">It is true that appellant\u2019s inorganic salt <em>is </em>defined in terms of \u201cwhat it does\u201d rather than \u201cwhat it is.\u201d We note, however, that the Supreme Court, in a seldom quoted passage in the Wabash case, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">\u201cA limited use of terms of effect or result, which accurately define the essential qualities of a product to one skilled in the art, may in some instances be permissible and even desirable * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Appellant in the instant case has made just such a use of terms of result to define an essential quality of his inorganic salts.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Having carefully reconsidered the Wabash case and others, we are unable to agree with the Patent Office Solicitor that the third paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 is necessarily \u201cin derogation of the previous case law\u201d and therefore \u201cmust be strictly construed.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Furthermore, we are also unable to agree with the solicitor when he states that \u201cthe last paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 is by its very language limited to claimed combinations involving mechanical structures or apparatus and methods.\u201d The word \u201ccombination\u201d in this paragraph includes \u201cnot only a combination of mechanical elements, but also a combination of substances in a composition claim, or steps in a process claim.\u201d P. J. Federico, Commentary on the New Patent Act, 35 U.S.C.A. Vol. 1, p. 25 (1954). We agree with that statement in the commentary, which is fully supported by the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">We find particularly appropriate at this point the following words of an eight-man Patent Office Board of Appeals in Ex parte Ball and Hair, 99 USPQ 146, 148:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">\u201c * * * the language of [the third paragraph of] Section 112 is thought to be so clear as not to require any resort to extrinsic evidence in connection with its interpretation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">The board also noted (at p. 148) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak2\">\u201c * * * some measure of greater liberality in the use of functional expressions in the definition of ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ments in proper combination claims is authorized by Section 112, than has been permitted by some of the stricter decisions of the courts in the past.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Inasmuch as it is our opinion (1) that there is no statutory ban on the use of the \u201cfunctional\u201d language employed in the instant claims by appellant; (2) that cases cited in support of the Patent Office\u2019s condemnation of the statements of function used in the instant claims are inapplicable to the situation here; (3) that the use of such functional statements as here appear is specifically sanctioned by the third paragraph of 35 U. S.C. \u00a7 112; and (4) that no objection has been made to the sufficiency of appellant\u2019s invention description to support in nonfunctional terms the functional statements made in the claims, we reverse the rejection of the instant claims as functional.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">(b) <em>Undue Breadth</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The rejection of the claims for \u201cundue breadth\u201d places particular emphasis on (1) an alleged \u201cundue burden upon the public <em>to determine </em>what salts are <em>suitable </em>for obtaining the desired results\u201d (emphasis ours), and (2) an alleged \u201cundue [amount of] experimentation\u201d required of those skilled in the art to determine those salts possessing the \u201cfunction asserted\u201d by the instant claims. The undue breadth rejection phase of the instant ease appears in the following-posture. Appellant has <em>described </em>his invention as <em>comprehending </em>the use therein of <em>any </em>inorganic salt <em>capable </em>of performing a <em>specific </em>function in a specific combination and he has disclosed specifically four such salts which are capable of performing this function. The examiner and the board, believing that not all inorganic salts are capable of performing this function and that one skilled in the art would not know offhand which inorganic salts are capable of so functioning, have rejected the claims as \u201cunduly broad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">It is clear that the instant claims do not comprehend a class of inorganic salts of any greater breadth than is <em>comprehended </em>by the invention description.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is equally clear from this description and appellant\u2019s brief that, in the words of the <em>second </em>paragraph of section 112, \u201capplicant regards as his invention\u201d the combination with his other tread ingredients of <em>any </em>inorganic salt <em>capable </em>of \u201cmaintaining the carbohydrate, the protein, or mixture thereof, in colloidal suspension * * It is exactly this combination which appellant has particularly pointed out and distinctly <em>claimed </em>in compliance with the <em>second </em>paragraph of section 112. If, therefore, as the examiner alleges, many an \u201cinorganic salt * * * would not be operative for appellant\u2019s purpose,\u201d this criticism bears only on the sufficiency of the invention description. But its adequacy under the <em>first </em>paragraph of section 112 has not been questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">We find the arguments of the board and the examiner relating to experimentation necessary to determine the suitability of <em>undisclosed </em>salts to operate in appellant\u2019s claimed combination beside the point. Appellant\u2019s invention is the <em>combination </em>claimed and not the discovery that certain inorganic salts have colloid suspending properties. We see nothing in patent law which requires appellant to discover which of all those salts have such properties and which will function properly in his combination. The invention description clearly indicates that any inorganic salt which has such properties is usable in his combination. If others in the future discover what inorganic salts additional to those enumerated do have such properties, it is clear appellant will have no control over them per se, and equally clear his claims should not be so restricted that they can be avoided merely by using some inorganic salt not named by appellant in his disclosure. The only \u201cundue burden\u201d which is apparent to us in the instant ease is that which the Patent Office has attempted to place on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the appellant, i ;-.The &gt; Patent Office would require him-- tor d\u00f3'research\u00edon.'the \u00a1\u201cliteral-! ly. thousandsV'idf inorganic shits; and tde-&gt; tefmihe &lt;whi\u00f3h .of,\u2019 these) ar\u00e9 teuit'ablebfoirt incorporation')&amp;to\"&gt;hit claimed5 \u2018combina^ tiOn^'.apparently\u2019'.forgetting'.\u00a1th\u00e1t-.\u2019he, has; not 'invented, and/is'-notclaiming,-colloid\u00bb suspending\u00bb agents but;\u2018tire'dread \u2018dtoek' composed of a combination, of \u2018rubber-and &gt; otheri-ingredients.'!'-.'!\u00bb)- vos \u2022;&gt; i</p>\n<p id=\"AMyq\">' We ar\u00e9 botpefshaded th'\u00e1t\u2019\u00d3\u00far;t\u00ed\u00f3\u00f1'clh-\u2019 siot\u00ed\u2019\u00f3h'thik point\u2019is w'r\u00f3ng;'by''de\u00e9\u00edisitihS' of ihi'^'\u00e1\u00f1d'o'th\u00e9i courts re\u00cdating':\"tb,ft'H\u00e9' sufficiency !-'bf j \u2022 mVdiition?11 ih'sclObdr es! 1 'M; c\u00e1ses' Wherdin*- !tli\u00edb' a\u00edp!p,lichnt'\u2018''ib\u00ed\u00ed'dl\u00e1imi'rig-\u00ed ch\u00e9\u00f1iic'\u00e1l <em>cbit\u00fapbU'iidis'^\u00e9c' </em>s'\u00e9. <em>\u2018\u2022\u00edK' </em>11</p>\n<p id=\"AtE\">\u2019The\u201d taient^'diR'ce1 r\u00e9jection\u00e1 oFbiaims' 38-49\u201dhrd'rev\u00e9rsfe'd. k\u2019!';</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">Reversed.,</p>\n<judges id=\"AiM\">Martin, J., concurs in result only</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\">.

The examiner\u2019s reliance on Davis et al., a reference newly cited in his answer, was based on the premise that claims which \u201cmerely recite a stock which includes rubber, a protein and/or a carbohydrate, and an inorganic salt while the specification, at pages 7 and 8, teaches that the alleged invention lies in adding the protein and/or carbohydrate and the inorganic salt to a rubber stock\u201d do not distinguish over \u201cnatural rubber.\u201d Appellant thereupon amended the instant claims to state that the nonadhesive protein and/or carbohydrate in his tire tread stock were \u201cin addition to\u201d such substances which might occur in \u201cthe base portion\u201d of the stock.

OnS'of the primary problems we have in coming to grips with the instant rejection i\u00e1 in what sense the Word \u201cfunctional\u201d is being used. Few words in patent law have acquired more diverse meanings than the word \u201cfunctional.\u201d Ellis, for example, in his1 \u201cPatent Claims\u201d (1949) at \u00a7\u00a7 255-276 discusses at least five. It is for this reason that bandying about and lifting out of context statements referring to .\u201cfunctional\u201d' expressions,' has,1 as \u25a0 Ellis euphemistically\u201d puts \u25a0 it; \u201ccaused confusion.\u201d In'addition'to'Ellis; supra, \u25a0 some of the more recent texts\u2019which- outline the confusion that exists in'\u2019the 'case law with regard to what are \u201cfunctional\u201d statements, and how-they should be treated, are: \u25a0 \u25a0 \u201e</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX3h\">Glascock and - Stringham, Patent Law, pp; - 315-324 (1943) Hoar, - Patent '\u25a0Tactics and Law, pp. 116-118 (3rd ed., 1950) Stringham, Patent Claim Draffcing, pp. 215-243 (1952) Deller\u2019s Walker on Patents, \u25a0 -particularly at \u00a7 168 (as supplemented to 1962).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b311-18\">.--This statement, if\u2019correct, would .lead \u25a0appellant\u2019into somewhat of an- impasse\u2014 statements indicating what an -entity is \u25a0\u201csupposed to do\u201d <em>as well </em>os statements indicating what that entity \u201cdoes\u201d -may <em>both be </em>\u201cfunctional.\u201d- \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">. We do not mean to imply that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 was not in derogation of the result reached in <em>any </em>case decided prior to the enactment of the 1952 Patent Act. See, e. g., Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Walker et al., 329 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 6, 91 L.Ed. 3. We feel, however, that a considerable body of case law, if not the preponderance thereof, before the Halliburton case interpreted broad statements of structure, e. g., \u201cmeans,\u201d plus a statement of function in the manner now sanctioned by the statute. See, e. g., Westinghouse v. Boyden Power Brake Co., 170 U.S. 537, 558, 18 S.Ct. 707, 42 L.Ed. 1136. See also in this regard the February 1952 issue of the American Patent Law Association Bulletin wherein is reprinted at pp. 40-50 an address by the Hon. Joseph R. Bryson, Representative from South Carolina, given on January 24, 1952, to the Philadelphia Patent Law Association. Representative Bryson was at this time Chairman of Subcommittee No. 3 of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, which subcommittee was in charge of the legislation which resulted in the Patent Act of 1952. He stated in part (at pp. 45-46) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-16\">\u201cI should like to say a word on the provision in the bill for functional claiming.
