The board sustained the \u201cExaminer\u2019s rejection of claims 49 and 50 as having no basis in the disclosure as filed.\u201d Claims 49 and 50 were presented by appellants for purposes of interference with U. S. Patent No. 2,803,621 to Schwartz et al. Claim 49 is identical with the only claim in the Schwartz et al. patent. Claim 50 is a modified form of claim 49, claim 50 omitting any reference to \u201ca flexural strength of at least 8000 pounds per square inch, a flexural modulus of at least 2.5X10\u00b0 pounds per square inch, and a tensile strength of at least 4800 pounds per square inch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">The invention in the Schwartz et al. patent is directed to \u201cThermoplastic Fusion Blend of Emulsion-Prepared Polyvinyl Chloride Resin and a Small Amount of Butadiene: Acrylonitrile Copolymer Rubber\u201d and is based solely on the discovery that when a critical, small amount, i. e. 2 to 5 parts by weight, of a butadiene: acrylonitrile copolymer rubber containing a narrow range, i. e. 18% to 22%, of combined acrylonitrile, and 100 parts by weight of solid emulsion-prepared polyvinyl chloride resin are fusion blended, the impact strength of the polyvinyl chloride resin is increased many times over, while the flexural strength, tensile strength, and other desirable properties of the resin remain substantially unimpaired. In general, the compositions of the Schwartz et al. patent \u201care truly rigid, strong materials, having a flexural strength of at least 8000 p. s. i., a flexural modulus of at least 2.5X10\u00b0 p. s. i., and a tensile strength of at least 4800 p. s. i.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">We agree with the examiner that appellants\u2019 specification does not support the recitation of \u201c100 parts of * * * polyvinyl chloride and from <em>2 to 5 parts\u201d </em>of a rubbery copolymer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>sider that the <em>critical, small range of \u25a0 from 2 to 5 parts </em>.is disclosed in the. ap- , .plicatipn. \u25a0.

We also think it clear from the Humphrey et al. and Schaffel et al. patents that a person of ordinary skill in the art would be aware of and expect a variance in the properties of compositions in those patents as a result of the manipulation of (1) the proportions of monomers in the rubbery copolymer and (2) the ratio of the rubbery copolymer and polyvinyl halide.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The Humphrey et al. patent states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIHK\">\u201cThe properties of these films may be minutely adjusted, for particular applications, by manipulation of a number of variable factors such as the <em>selection and proportions </em>of the butadiene-type and acrylonitrile type compounds, of the selection amongst the several vinyl chloride polymers and copolymers, and the <em>ratio in which these materials are incorporated in the films.\u201d </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The Schaffel et al. patent states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At5\">\u201cThe amount of rubbery plasticizer in the vinyl composition may be varied greatly and determines the character of the final product. Small amounts, such as 5 parts or so, of plasticizer in the composition gives a very noticeable plasticizing effect and the rubbery nature of the product is increased as the amount of rubbery plasticizer is increased.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Both the Humphrey et al. and Schaffel et al. patents employ their rubbery co-polymers as plasticizers. Appellants refer to the rubbery copolymer as \u201cplasticizing high polymer or rubber.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It seems clear from the teaching in those patents that if one skilled in the art wants a rigid composition of polyvinyl chloride and a plasticizing rubbery co-polymer of a diolefinie compound (e. g. butadiene), he would minimize the amounts of rubbery copolymer in the composition, whether the amount of diolefinie compound in the rubbery copolymer be 60 per cent as it may be in the Schaffel et al. patent or 85 per cent as it may be in the Humphrey et al. patent. The fact that those compositions would also have impact resistance would be an inherent characteristic of the compositions. It is well settled that a patent cannot properly be granted for the discovery of a result which would flow naturally from the teaching of the prior art. See In re Libby, 255 F.2d 412, 45 CCPA 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">Furthermore, a careful analysis of appellants\u2019 application and affidavits has not convinced us as to any criticality in the specific ranges recited in appellants' claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">Claims 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47 and 48 differ primarily from claims 26, 27 and 43 in range recitations. We can find nothing in the record to show a criticality of such ranges over the compositions disclosed in the Humphrey et al. and Schaffel et al. patents, and consider the selection of those ranges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>to be merely an obvious matter of choice. Likewise we find nothing of patentable significance in method claims 28 and 32. Claims 30 and 31 are drawn to an extruded article and an extruded pipe respectively comprising a composition as set forth in claim 27. However, those claims do not set out any definite structural limitations. We do not consider the recitation of an extruded article or pipe to constitute a feature patentably distinguishable over the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Since we find claims 26-28, 30-32, 35-37, 39 and 41-48 unpatentable over the Sehaffel et al. and Humphrey et al. patents, it is unnecessary to consider the examiner\u2019s rejection of those claims on Patton et al. or his rejection as to the propriety of the definition of the \u201cpurported invention\u201d in those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">For reasons given above, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-19\"><em>. </em>Appellants in their brief withdrew their appeal as to claims 29, 34 and 40. \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-29\">.
