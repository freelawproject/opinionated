Viewed in \u00e1 nursery catalog it would have that meaning. Even in that context, however, it has geographical significance, meaning a beautiful American rose.

We so-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>hold notwithstanding the fact that sufficiently diligent examination of fine print in some advertisements and on a label attached to the machines will advise one that the \u201cAMERICAN BEAUTY\u201d machine heads are in fact made in Japan. The misdescriptiveness of the predominant, if not blatant, mark is not altered by another and much less conspicuous notice on the machine correctly describing geographical origin. As above noted, we also feel that the misdescriptiveness under the circumstances of this case would necessarily be deceptive. It gives a false indication of geographical origin to that segment of the purchasing public which may be interested in the country of origin and in' purchasing American-made goods and it is likely to deceive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">On the basis of the foregoing findings, it is evident that section 2(e) (2) applies to the facts established in this case and prohibits registration of the mark. The case has one other aspect requiring our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\n<em>Singer\u2019s Right to Oppose Registration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The applicant-appellee contends that Singer has not proved that it would be \u25a0damaged by the registration. The factual situation underlying the question thus raised is unique. In broad outline it is as follows. Prior to World War II most of the household sewing machines sold in the United States were also made here. During the war American manufacturers were forced to discontinue production of sewing machines for home use and when the war was over were unable to meet the accumulated demand. In the early 1950\u2019s imports began arriving to meet this demand and by reason of lower prices virtually eliminated the domestic sewing machine manufacturing industry, except for opposer. By 1959, in a total market of one and three quarter millions of sewing machines, over one million .Japanese machines were sold in this country. Many American companies formerly manufacturing sewing machines domestically are now importing them, primarily from Japan, and Singer is almost the only domestic manufacturer, certainly the only one of consequence. Attempting to capitalize on whatever preference there may be among the purchasing public for machines of domestic manufacture, it has directed its advertising toward capturing the customers having such a preference by emphasizing that its sewing machines are made in America by American craftsmen. During a period of two or three years it spent an estimated million dollars on advertising featuring the fact of American manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">It is clear that Singer competes with appellee for the domestic sewing machine market. Quite apart from a number of irrelevant matters considered below on this phase of the case, we think that as such a competitor, emphasizing truthfully the fact of the American manufacture of its product, Singer clearly has standing to oppose the registration to appellee of \u201cAMERICAN BEAUTY\u201d as a trademark for sewing machines of Japanese manufacture on the statutory ground that the mark as used by appellee is primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive. That statutory prohibition being sustained \u2014 as we are sustaining it \u2014 Singer clearly has a sufficient interest to be permitted to oppose and is not an intermeddler. In DeWalt, Inc. v. Magna Power Tool Corp., 289 F.2d 656, 48 CCPA 909, at CCPA p. 918, we pointed out that \u201cdamage\u201d will be presumed or inferred when the mark sought to be registered is <em>descriptive </em>of the goods of the opposer and the opposer is one who has an interest in using the descriptive term in its business, collecting a number of cases supporting the point: We also pointed to a number of cases which indicate that the reason for presuming damage is potential interference with opposer\u2019s rights predicated on the statutory rights flowing from registration. In the present case, granting the registration sought by appellee would create, under section 7(b) of the statute, appellee\u2019s prima facie right to use the mark \u201cAMERICAN BEAUTY\u201d on sewing machines shown to be of foreign manufacture. We believe that appellee is not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>titled to such right and we can imagine :no one in a more appropriate position to raise the question than Singer. The continuing <em>use </em>of \u201cAMERICAN BEAUTY\u201d by appellee in the manner disclosed by the record is very likely to damage Singer 'by bringing about the sale of Japanese-made machines to those who, if not deceived as to their origin, would, instead, .purchase a Singer machine. It follows that a registration which would secure \u25a0and bolster up the continuing right to use the geographically misdescriptive mark \u25a0on Japanese machines, or machines of other foreign manufacture, would dam.age Singer.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">For some reason the majority below \u2022seems to have been of the view that it was incumbent on Singer to prove the existence of a <em>general </em>preference on the part of American sewing machine purchasers for machines of domestic manufacture, which proof was found to be lacking, and the fact that a million Japanese machines had been purchased by \"the American public was apparently considered to be of some significance on the issue we are here discussing. We see no -such significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In nothing we have said do we mean to \u2022disparage Japanese sewing machines. But it cannot be denied, and it scarcely \u25a0requires proof to show, that many purchasers of many articles desire to buy \"those of American manufacture, perhaps \u2022only for reasons personal to themselves. \u2018The majority below, on the basis of the record, said, \u201cit may well be true that .some segment of the American public \u25a0prefers sewing machines of American '.manufacture to Japanese machines.\u201d We think that nothing more is required. That segment is entitled to buy according to its prejudices and preferences without the danger of being deceived or \u2022confused by geographically misdeseriptive marks. We suppose that recognition -of that right is the reason for section 2 \u25a0(e) (2); and being in the statute it \u25a0should be enforced at the instigation of .anyone having a real interest in its enforcement without undue concern over just what the nature of the damage might, in future, be from granting the registration. Such \u201cdamage\u201d is always speculative and not often subject to precise proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The decision of the board is reversed and the opposition is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-12\">.
