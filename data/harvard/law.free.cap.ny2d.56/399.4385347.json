Application of the continuing treatment doctrine to the independent laboratory would be inappropriate and unwise as a matter of policy.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b449-7\">Chief Judge Cooke.</author>\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> In an action for medical malpractice arising from a negligent act occurring before July 1, 1975 and where there has been continuous treatment extending beyond that date, the three-year Statute of Limitations applies rather than the shorter period of CPLR 214-a. The continuing treatment by the physician, however, cannot be imputed to an independent laboratory in the absence of an agency or other relevant relationship between the laboratory and doctor or some relevant continuing relation between the laboratory and the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">On May 10, 1974, plaintiff consulted defendant Torre, a dermatologist, and requested that he examine a dark mole on her left ankle. Torre excised the mole and submitted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>specimen to defendant Central Health Laboratories, Inc. (Laboratories),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a pathology report. About one week later, Torre informed plaintiff that the laboratory report was negative and \u201ctherefore nothing further had to be done\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Plaintiff saw Torre at least eight more times between May 10,1974 and September 13,1976.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During that period, plaintiff sought medical attention for various other ailments, but also complained about continued pain and a grayish color in her ankle. Torre re-examined the ankle several times and referred to the earlier biopsy report at least once. On each occasion, and even at plaintiff\u2019s last visit, Torre reassured her that there was no cause for concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In May, 1977, plaintiff consulted defendant Ju, a plastic surgeon. He assured her that her ankle was healed and free of disease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Later developments proved the earlier diagnosis to be wrong. In May, 1978, plaintiff discovered a lump in her groin. She immediately consulted a surgeon, who discovered a malignant melanoma after an operation on May 18. Further surgery in June, 1978 included removing another malignant melanoma from the site where Torre had excised the mole some four years earlier. Plaintiff was required to undergo further, radical surgery and extensive physical therapy. She has a severe limp and other permanent, debilitating injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Plaintiff commenced this suit for medical malpractice in 1979. Torre was served on July 5; Laboratories on August 17. Laboratories successfully moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was time-barred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the three-year Statute of Limitations (CPLR 214, subd 6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, Torre moved for summary judgment on the same basis, and, alternatively, that if continuous treatment were found, then the action was barred by the two- and one-half year limitation of CPLR 214-a. Plaintiff opposed the motion by arguing that continuous treatment had occurred, but that the three-year period was nonetheless applicable. Torre\u2019s motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The Appellate Division unanimously reversed (82 AD2d 152). That court held that the continuous treatment doctrine could not be determined on the record as a matter of law and that the three-year Statute of Limitations was applicable. It also ruled that Torre\u2019s continuous treatment could be imputed to Laboratories. Defendants were granted leave to appeal by the Appellate Division on a certified question. The order of the Appellate Division should be modified by dismissing the action as to Laboratories.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Initially, attention must be directed to whether the continuous treatment doctrine is applicable in the present case. Under that rule, the time in which to bring a malpractice action is stayed \u201cwhen the course of treatment which includes the wrongful acts or omissions has run continuously and is related to the same original condition or complaint\u201d <em>(Borgia v City of New York, </em>12 NY2d 151, 155). The concern, of course, is whether there has been continuous treatment, and not merely a continuing relation between physician and patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">As a starting point, continuous treatment does not contemplate circumstances where a patient initiates return visits merely to have his or her condition checked (see <em>id.). </em>The Statute of Limitations may begin to run \u201conce a hospital or physician considers the patient\u2019s treatment to be completed and does not request the patient to return for further examination\u201d (1 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 214-a.03, p 2-321; cf. <em>Davis v City of New York, </em>38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>NY2d 257). This is not to say, however, that a complete discharge by a physician forever bars a finding of continuing treatment. Included within the scope of \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d is a timely return visit instigated by the patient to complain about and seek treatment for a matter related to the initial treatment. Thus, there will be continuing treatment when a patient, instructed that he or she does not need further attention, soon returns to the doctor because of continued pain in that area for which medical attention was first sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s position, the continuing nature of a diagnosis does not itself amount to continuous treatment. <em>Fonda v Paulsen </em>(46 AD2d 540), upon which plaintiff relies, does not stand for that proposition. There, a pathologist\u2019s misdiagnosis of a biopsy resulted in the patient\u2019s not receiving treatment, notwithstanding the patient\u2019s repeated complaints of pain. Critical in <em>Fonda </em>was that the patient had returned to the doctor, albeit because of another injury, seeking treatment for tenderness at the spot where the biopsy excision had been made, and did so in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Properly read, <em>Fonda </em>does support plaintiff\u2019s claim of continuous treatment. As in <em>Fonda, </em>plaintiff returned to her doctor for other reasons, but she allegedly requested him also to examine her ankle because of continuing pain. Issues of fact exist on this record as to whether plaintiff\u2019s concern about her ankle was one of the purposes for her subsequent visits. Thus, it cannot be determined at this stage that plaintiff\u2019s relation with Torre did or did not amount to continuous treatment. The existence of these factual questions preclude granting summary judgment at this juncture (see <em>Ugarriza v Schmieder, </em>46 NY2d 471).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Assuming that continuous treatment did occur in the present case, the appropriate Statute of Limitations must be determined. The initial misdiagnosis occurred in May, 1974, at which time the period for bringing a medical malpractice action was three years (see CPLR 214, subd 6). Effective July 1, 1975, while plaintiff\u2019s treatment was continuing, the period was reduced to two and one-half years (see CPLR 214-a, added L 1975, ch 109, \u00a7 6). If section 214-a governs, then plaintiff\u2019s action is time-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>barred, more than 32 months having elapsed between plaintiff\u2019s last visit and service of summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Resolution of this question depends on whether the continuous treatment doctrine delays the action\u2019s accrual or only tolls the running of the Statute of Limitations. If the former, then plaintiff\u2019s action is barred. Although the cases speak of the doctrine in terms of when the action \u201caccrues\u201d (see, e.g., <em>Greene v Greene, </em>56 NY2d 86, 93-95; <em>Davis v City of New York, </em>38 NY2d 257, 259, <em>supra; Borgia v City of New York, </em>12 NY2d 151,155, <em>supra), </em>that term in this context is not strictly accurate. Section 214-a speaks to computing the limitation period in terms of \u201cthe act, omission or failure complained of\u201d, not of the entire course of treatment. And, there is a certain illogic in stating that no action is ripe \u2014 i.e., it does not \u201caccrue\u201d \u2014 until after treatment ends. Continuous treatment has nothing to do with the initial act of negligence. While such treatment itself may be negligent, that would give rise to a different cause of action and would not actually affect the original \u201cact, omission, or failure complained of\u201d. Rather than define the action\u2019s accrual in terms of the doctrine, it is defined in terms of when the original negligent act occurred. Continuous treatment serves simply as a toll \u2014 the action may be brought at any time, but the patient will not be compelled to initiate judicial proceedings so long as the physician continues to treat the injury <em>(see Borgia v City of New York, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The action having accrued in 1974, the three-year Statute of Limitations then in effect attached. Torre\u2019s continuing treatment of plaintiff, if any, served to toll the running of the statute, but not to truncate it by imposing the lesser time limit of section 214-a. Thus, whenever treatment of plaintiff is found to have ended, a three-year time period for bringing suit should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Finally, it must be determined whether the continuous treatment doctrine can be applied to Laboratories. In essence, this would require imputing Torre\u2019s continuing treatment, if any, to Laboratories, which performed a single, discrete act in May, 1974. Under the circumstances of this case, there is no justification for imputing the continuous treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The policy underlying the continuous treatment doctrine seeks to maintain the physician-patient relationship in the belief that the most efficacious medical care will be obtained when the attending physician remains on a case from onset to cure (see <em>Borgia v City of New York, supra). </em>Implicit in the policy is the recognition that the doctor not only is in a position to identify and correct his or her malpractice, but is best placed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">These considerations do not apply to an independent laboratory. In this context, the inquiry necessarily must be directed to the nature of a laboratory\u2019s relationship to the patient (see <em>McQuinn v St. Lawrence County Lab., </em>28 AD2d 1035,1036, mot for lv to app den 21 NY2d 644). Generally, a laboratory neither has a continuing or other relevant relationship with the patient nor, as an independent contractor, does it act as an agent for the doctor or otherwise act in relevant association with the physician. A laboratory does not have the opportunity to discover an error in a report. Instead, it must rely on the treating physician to discover any diagnostic mistake. Therefore, the policy underlying the continuous treatment doctrine generally will not apply to the independent laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Here, the record is devoid of any evidence introduced by plaintiff to justify departing from this general rule. Nothing in the record shows that Laboratories was other than an independent contractor with no continuing relation to plaintiff or that there was any agency relation with Torre. Its misdiagnosis occurred in May, 1974. Under the Statute of Limitations then in effect, suit must have been commenced by May, 1977. Plaintiff did not serve Laboratories until August, 1979. Having been brought too late, her action against Laboratories should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs to the corporate defendants against plaintiff and to plaintiff against defendant Torre, in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed. The question certified should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\">. The other defendant laboratories \u2014 National Health Laboratories, Inc., and National Health Laboratories, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) \u2014 are the successors to Central Health Laboratories, Inc. Defendant Revlon Corporation is the parent company of the Delaware corporation. All four entities will be referred to by the single term \u201cLaboratories\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\">. Although nothing properly in the record reflects the exact dates of plaintiff\u2019s consultations, this court accepts for the purpose of this appeal that September 13, 1976 was the date of plaintiff\u2019s last visit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-11\">. Ju is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\">. Plaintiff later commenced a contract action against Laboratories. Special Term dismissed this as being essentially a malpractice action and, hence, time-barred. The Appellate Division affirmed and plaintiff apparently has abandoned the cause before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b454-8\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkC\">(dissenting in part). While I agree that the action against the defendant Laboratories should be dismissed and that the plaintiff\u2019s action is governed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>three-year Statute of Limitations contained in CPLR 214 (subd 6), I would hold that, upon the circumstances disclosed in this record, the plaintiff is precluded, as a matter of law, from invoking in this malpractice action the doctrine of \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d <em>(Borgia v City of New York, </em>12 NY2d 151). Therefore, as to defendant Torre, I vote to reverse and to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s action as barred by the three-year Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">According to plaintiff\u2019s affidavit in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint, plaintiff had been under the care of defendant Torre, a dermatologist, for a variety of skin disorders. On May 10, 1974, Torre removed a d.ark mole from plaintiff\u2019s ankle. One week later, plaintiff was advised by Torre that a pathology report based on a specimen from the mole \u201cwas negative, and, therefore <em>nothing further had to be done.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.,)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Over the next two years, plaintiff consulted with Torre on at least eight occasions, the last visit apparently being on September 13, 1976. Although these visits were in connection with other ailments, plaintiff complained to Torre about a grayish color and inflammation in the area where the mole had been removed. On each occasion, Torre, after re-examining the ankle, assured plaintiff that there was no reason to worry.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In May of 1978, plaintiff discovered a lump in her groin that was later determined to be a malignant melanoma. In June of 1978; plaintiff underwent further surgery to remove another malignancy from the area where Torre had removed the mole four years earlier. As a result of yet another operation, plaintiff has been left with a variety of permanent injuries, including a severe limp.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The gist of plaintiff\u2019s action is that defendant Torre misdiagnosed her condition and was negligent in removing the mole from her ankle. Defendant Torre was served with the summons and complaint on July 5, 1979. Because the action was commenced more than five years after the initial misdiagnosis and negligent removal of the mole, plaintiff has invoked the \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d doctrine so as to toll the running of the applicable three-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>limitations period until September 13,1976, the date of her last visit with defendant Torre.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">A majority of this court has concluded that questions of fact exist concerning the applicability of the \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d doctrine to this case. In support of this conclusion, the majority states,.without citation of authority, that a \u201ccomplete discharge\u201d of a patient by a physician does not preclude a finding of \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d in situations where the discharged patient, without being requested by the physician to do so, makes \u201ca timely return visit * * * to complain about and seek treatment for a matter related to the initial treatment.\u201d (At p 406.) I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The general rule is that an action for malpractice accrues and the Statute of Limitations begins to run on the date of the alleged act of malpractice. In <em>Borgia v City of New York </em>(12 NY2d 151, <em>supra), </em>this court recognized an exception to this rule in instances where \u201cthe course of treatment which includes the wrongful acts or omissions has run <em>continuously </em>and is related to the same original condition or complaint.\u201d (12 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at p 155 [emphasis supplied].) In <em>Borgia, </em>however, the court readily acknowledged that the \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d doctrine had its limitations. Indeed, \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d was carefully defined to mean \u201ctreatment for the same or related illness or injuries, <em>continuing </em>after the alleged acts of malpractice, not mere continuity of a general physician-patient relationship.\u201d (12 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at p 157 [emphasis supplied].) Thus, to invoke the doctrine successfully so as to avoid the otherwise applicable Statute of Limitations, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that \u201ctreatment\u201d subsequent to the malpractice was, in fact, rendered; and (2) that there was no disruption in the course of treatment from when the malpractice originally occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The continuity aspect of the doctrine was clarified and, in a sense, amplified in <em>Davis v City of New York </em>(38 NY2d 257). In <em>Davis, </em>the decedent was examined by a city cancer detection center in connection with a lump on her breast on February 26, 1968. Decedent was advised at that time \u201cthat there was nothing to be concerned about and to return in two years.\u201d (38 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at p 259.) A year later, in February of 1969, decedent returned to the center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>for further examination in response to a mail communication from the center. In December of 1969, after being advised by her family physician to consult a surgeon regarding the condition of her breast, decedent telephoned the center and was told by a receptionist that she would be called back for further examination in February or March of 197Q. Subsequently, a letter was sent by the center scheduling an appointment on February 17, 1970. Decedent underwent a radical mastectomy on January 22, 1970, which disclosed the widespread presence of cancer. A notice of claim was served on the city on April 13,1970. In dismissing the action for failing to file a timely notice of claim, this court determined, <em>as a matter of law, </em>that the decedent was not under the \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d of the diagnostic center because the medical services rendered by the center were \u201cintermittent rather than continuous\u201d. (38 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at p 260.) Specifically, it was held that \u201cthe medical services rendered by the center in February, 1968 in legal contemplation were discrete and complete. The same was true of any medical service rendered the following February.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In the present case, it can be assumed that the periodic re-examinations of plaintiff\u2019s ankle undertaken by defendant Torre at plaintiff\u2019s behest in the two years following the alleged malpractice constituted \u201ctreatment\u201d.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Nevertheless, plaintiff, as a matter of law, has failed to demonstrate that this treatment was \u201ccontinuous\u201d. According to her own affidavit, plaintiff was advised by defendant Torre after the removal and testing of the mole that \u201cnothing further had to be done.\u201d Thus, Torre considered plaintiff\u2019s treatment to be complete and he did not request plaintiff to return for further examinations in connection with the ankle. Rather, it was plaintiff\u2019s complaints which caused Torre to re-examine her ankle during subsequent visits to his office in connection with other ailments. However, the initial \u201ctreatment\u201d, out of which arose the alleged acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>malpractice, having been completed, these later examinations were no different than was the treatment rendered to the decedent in <em>Davis, </em>to wit: \u201cdiscrete and complete\u201d services in legal contemplation and, therefore, \u201cintermittent rather than continuous\u201d in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In view of our decision in <em>Davis, </em>the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Fonda v Paulsen </em>(46 AD2d 540) for purposes of determining whether there has been continuity in treatment is misplaced. <em>Fonda </em>was decided prior to <em>Davis, </em>and the <em>Fonda </em>court itself acknowledged that \u201c[t]here is no New York case which supplies an adequate definition of the term \u2018continuous\u2019 as it applies to treatment in a malpractice case\u201d. (46 AD2d, <em>supra, </em>at p 543.) That jurisprudential gap having since been filled by our decision in <em>Davis, Fonda, </em>to the extent that it is to the contrary, is not an accurate statement of the law in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In my view, whether treatment has been \u201ccontinuous\u201d for purposes of a medical malpractice action should not be determined from the perspective of a discharged patient\u2019s desire to have his physician conduct a re-examination concerning a matter for which treatment already has been completed. (See, e.g., <em>Florio v Cook, </em>65 AD2d 548, affd 48 NY2d 792.) Rather, whether there has been continuity in treatment should depend upon the medical services actually rendered. (See <em>Davis v City of New York, supra.) </em>Indeed, the policy underlying the \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d doctrine is that it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to require a malpractice victim to interrupt ongoing, corrective treatment by commencing a lawsuit against the negligent physician. <em>(Borgia v City of New York, </em>12 NY2d 151,156, <em>supra.) </em>That policy, however, is not advanced where, as here, the treatment is completed and the patient is specifically informed that \u201cnothing further had to be done.\u201d Once treatment has ended and the patient has been discharged, later complaints about the same ailment should not serve to revive the expired course of treatment and thereby delay further the commencement of the statutorily prescribed limitations period. Statutes of repose such as CPLR 214 seek to finally put to rest stale claims. The view adopted by the majority today will only frustrate that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Since the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate, by a sufficient evidentiary showing, that the \u201ccontinuous treatment\u201d exception should be applied, I would dismiss the action against defendant Torre.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur with Chief Judge Cooke; Judge Jasen dissents in part and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\"> As to claims for malpractice with respect to acts, omissions and failures occurring after June 30, 1975, CPLR 214-a provides that \u201cthe term \u2018continuous treatment\u2019 shall not include examinations undertaken at the request of the patient for the sole purpose of ascertaining the state of the patient\u2019s condition.\u201d Although not applicable to plaintiff\u2019s action, it is doubtful whether a series of examinations, without more, even constitutes \u201ctreatment\u201d under CPLR 214-a.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
