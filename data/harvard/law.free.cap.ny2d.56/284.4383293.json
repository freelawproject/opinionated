Formal recognition of the right of publicity and its proper application to the facts of this case require a finding that Andretti does not have standing to maintain this action. <em>(Roberson v Rochester Folding Box Co., </em>171 NY 538; <em>Haelan Labs. v Topps Chewing Gum, </em>202 F2d 866, 346 US 816; <em>Koussevitzky v Allen, Towne &amp; Heath, </em>188 Misc 479, 272 App Div 759; <em>Gautier v Pro-Football, Inc., </em>278 App Div 431, 304 NY 354; <em>Wood v Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, </em>222 NY 88; <em>Madison Sq.

II. It was error to grant Andretti\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to defendants\u2019 alleged liability. <em>(McAdam v Ridge Press, </em>57 AD2d 763; <em>Manger v Kree Inst. of Electrolysis, </em>233 F2d 5; <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. of City of N.

Julien </em>and <em>William D. Fireman </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afp\">I. The court below correctly held that infringement of Andretti\u2019s \u201cright of publicity\u201d is actionable under section 51 of the Civil Rights Law. <em>(Brinkley v Casablancas, </em>80 AD2d 428; <em>Gautier v Pro-Football, Inc., </em>304 NY 354; <em>Haelan Labs. v Topps Chewing Gum, </em>202 F2d 866, 346 US 816; <em>Ali v Playgirl, Inc., </em>447 F Supp 723; <em>Grant v Esquire, Inc., 367 </em>F Supp 876; <em>Rosenberg v Lee\u2019s Carpet &amp; Furniture Warehouse Outlet, </em>80 Misc 2d 479; <em>Rosemont Enterprises v Urban Systems, </em>72 Misc 2d 788, 42 AD2d 544; <em>Time, Inc. v Hill, </em>385 US 374; <em>Booth v Curtis Pub.

II. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Andretti has standing to maintain this action. <em>(Rosemont Enterprises v Urban Systems, </em>72 Misc 2d 788,42 AD2d 544; <em>Yameta Co. v Capitol Records, </em>279 F Supp 582.) III. The court below properly held that consent under section 51 of the Civil Rights Law must be in writing and that the photograph autographed by Andretti did not constitute such written consent. <em>(Durgom v Columbia Broadcasting System, </em>29 Misc 2d 394; <em>Miles v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>61 AD2d 929; <em>Lomax v New Broadcasting Co., </em>18 AD2d 229.) IV. Statute of Frauds principles are applicable; because the inscribed photograph is insufficient on its face as a written consent, it cannot be supplemented by parol evidence. <em>(Felicie, Inc. v Leibovitz, </em>67 AD2d 656; <em>Crabtree v Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp., </em>305 NY 48; <em>Cohon &amp; Co. v Russell, </em>29 AD2d 221, 23 NY2d 569; <em>Matter of Levin, </em>302 NY 535; <em>Drake v Seaman, </em>97 NY 230; <em>Poel v Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co. of N.

The advertisements contained the name and picture of plaintiff, a well-known race car driver. Plaintiff sought recovery under section 51 of the Civil Rights Law, alleging that his name and picture were used in these advertisements without his written consent. Supreme Court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to liability. The Appellate Division reversed and granted the motion (82 AD2d 765).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The Appellate Division erred in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion. Section 51 of the Civil Rights Law, directly applicable to the instant case, permits an individual to recover damages if his or her name or likeness is used for advertising or trade purposes without the individual\u2019s prior written consent (see <em>Arrington v New York Times Co., </em>55 NY2d 433, 439). The parties do not dispute that before the Rolex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>advertisements were published, plaintiff accepted a Rolex watch worth approximately $6,000 and acknowledged his membership in the \u201cRolex Club\u201d in writing. Plaintiff sent the president of Rolex a photograph of himself with the handwritten inscription: \u201cTo Rene ... it\u2019s good to be a member of your Rolex Club! All the best, Mario Andretti.\u201d Whether this membership encompassed the use of plaintiff\u2019s picture and name in Rolex advertisements, however, is the subject of sharply divergent recitations of the relevant events. Factual issues exist as to what membership in the Rolex Club entailed, i.e., whether plaintiff thereby consented to the use of his name and likeness in Rolex advertisements. Summary judgment for plaintiff on the issue of liability was therefore improper. Parol evidence may be introduced to establish that an equivocal writing signed by the subject of the photograph was intended as the expression of consent contemplated by the statute to the use of the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, with costs, and the order of Supreme Court, New York County, entered December 8,1980 reinstated. The question certified should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
