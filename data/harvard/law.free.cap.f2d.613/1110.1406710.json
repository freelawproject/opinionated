Drawing on its newly granted authority under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty \u2014 Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (Magnuson-Moss Act),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Commission initiated proceedings for the promulgation of a trade regulation rule governing sales and warranty services of the mobile home industry on 29 May 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Toward the close of the public hearings held in connection with the proceeding, appellee-intervenor Center for Auto Safety (Center) filed a motion with the presiding officer to compel the production of service records from mobile home manufacturers who testified at the hearings. Section 1.13(d)(6) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice empowers officials presiding over Magnuson-Moss rulemaking to issue subpoenas duces tecum on behalf of \u201cinterested persons\u201d provided certain requirements are met.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After determining that the Center\u2019s request satisfied the criteria set forth in section 1.13(d)(6), the presiding officer granted the motion on 2 March 1978.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-17\">Ten of the fourteen manufacturers who were served with subpoenas refused to comply, and the Commission subsequently instituted enforcement proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Appellants argued there that the Commission lacked statutory authority to promulgate section 1.13(d)(6), which delegated to presiding officers in the agency\u2019s rulemaking the power to issue subpoenas on behalf of third parties. In addition, appellants complained that even assuming this authority, the presiding officer administered the subpoenas in bad faith, in part because the official denied allegedly similar requests that appellants filed for production of dealer and consumer correspondence records. In an opinion rendered from the bench, Judge Hart held that the Commission had the legal authority to issue the subpoenas in question, those subpoenas were not unduly burdensome, and the denial of appellants\u2019 motion to compel production was not an issue properly before the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-19\">In January 1975 Congress enacted the Magnuson-Moss Warranty \u2014 Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 202 of that Act amends the Federal Trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>Commission Act to add a new section 18.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under this section, the Commission is authorized to promulgate rules that specifically define unfair or deceptive acts or practices (trade regulation rules) within the meaning of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To exercise this power, the Commission must follow certain procedures detailed in section 18, which are designed to afford persons potentially affected by the rules greater opportunity to participate in the agency\u2019s rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">In deciding whether to promulgate a trade regulation rule, the Commission first must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking stating the reasons for the proposed rule and permitting interested persons to submit their views.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statute then directs the Commission to conduct informal hearings on the proposed rule during which interested persons may present their positions orally and through documentary submissions. If the Commission determines that disputed issues of material fact exist, interested persons may offer rebuttal submissions and conduct such cross-examination of witnesses as the Commission deems appropriate and necessary for a full and true disclosure of the material facts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-16\">On 4 April 1975 the Commission solicited comments on proposed rules intended to implement its rulemaking authority under the Magnuson-Moss Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These rules, including section 1.13, went into effect on 13 August 1975.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 1.13(d)(6) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice allows \u201cinterested persons\u201d to petition presiding officers in rulemaking proceedings for the issuance of subpoenas. To obtain a subpoena duces tecum, the party must make a general showing of the reasonableness and relevancy of the scope of the request together with a showing that the information sought is unavailable by voluntary methods and is \u201cappropriate and required for a full and true disclosure\u201d of the issues set for consideration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellants do not quarrel with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>the Commission\u2019s findings that the Center\u2019s request was in accord with these requirements. Instead, appellants contend that because the Magnuson-Moss Act itself makes no provision for the availability of compulsory process, the Commission was without authority to adopt section 1.13(d)(6) as part of its Rules of Practice governing Magnuson-Moss proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">A. <em>Statutory Authority to Adopt Section 1.13</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">The Commission\u2019s claimed authority to adopt section 1.13(d)(6) hinges in part on a construction of section 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 9 provides in pertinent part: \u201cFor the purposes of [the Act] . . . the Commission shall have power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Appellees advocate construction of the Act as an integrated whole, permitting the Commission to draw on the subpoena powers contained in section 9 to discharge it functions under section 18 of the Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Appellants contend on the other hand that the subpoena powers authorized in section 9 extend only to investigative subpoenas issued by the Commission\u2019s staff prior to the commencement of a rulemaking proceeding and not to subpoenas issued by a presiding officer during the agency\u2019s actual rulemaking proceeding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Their assertion is based on the contention that both the language and the legislative history of the Magnuson-Moss Act preclude the availability of compulsory process in section 18 proceedings. We find appellants\u2019 arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-16\">Appellants\u2019 first contention rests on a strained interpretation of section 202(a)(2) of the Magnuson-Moss Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 202(a)(2) provides that the \u201cCommission shall have no authority under this Act, other than its authority under this section, to prescribe any rule with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Appellants apparently read this section as prohibiting the Commission from adopting additional procedural rules governing the conduct of the agency\u2019s rule-making \u2014 a position we find to be totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-17\">A plain reading of the section reveals that it restricts only the Commission\u2019s power to promulgate <em>substantive </em>rules and does not affect or even address the Commission\u2019s power to adopt procedural requirements for rulemaking proceedings.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In fact it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>clear from another section of the statute that the Commission does indeed have the authority to prescribe procedural rules for its rulemaking proceedings. Section 202(c)(2) provides that the \u201cCommission may prescribe such rules and make such rulings concerning proceedings in [the informal] hearings as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">A more substantial challenge to the Commission\u2019s authority to delegate the subpoena powers in question is appellants\u2019 argument that Congress, by delineating the procedural requirements to be followed in Magnuson-Moss rulemaking and by not providing for compulsory process, intended to prevent third-party access to subpoenas in these proceedings. Although use of subpoenas is nowhere mentioned in the MagnusonMoss Act or in the legislative history to the Act, Congress, as mentioned above, expressly granted the Commission the authority to adopt procedural rules in its informal hearings, if appropriate. Thus it is certain that Congress intended the Commission to have <em>some </em>flexibility in conducting rulemaking. The issue before the court, then, is whether the Commission\u2019s adoption of section 1.13(d)(6) was within the latitude intended the Commission by Congress. We hold that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">In attempting to assess congressional intent, we are bound to render an interpretation consistent with the policies and purposes of the Act. \u201c[T]he width of administrative authority must be measured in part by the purposes for which it was conferred.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> One of Congress\u2019s chief concerns in devising section 202 of the MagnusonMoss Act was to afford increased opportunity for public participation in rulemaking while still enabling the Commission to pursue its statutory directive efficiently and effectively.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As the House Report explains: \u201cOur mission was to develop a provision which would allow interested persons an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful and constructive way on proposed rules while granting to the Commission the latitude to avoid unnecessary costs or delay in its proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-9\">As a result the Magnuson-Moss Act bestows unusually broad participatory rights in trade regulation rulemaking to interested persons, tailored to the Commission\u2019s need to conduct its proceedings efficiently. For example, if the Commission determines that there are disputed issues of material fact, interested persons are entitled to cross-examine witnesses and offer rebuttal submissions at the informal hearings.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Coordinat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>ing the two concerns of procedural efficiency and procedural fairness is the overarching statutory goal of attaining a \u201cfull and true disclosure\u201d of disputed facts.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Section 1.13(d)(6) is entirely consistent with that statutory scheme. While the provision somewhat enlarges the initiative powers of interested persons in rulemaking, it also is carefully circumscribed to assure that the Commission\u2019s ability to carry out its statutory mandate is not unduly impeded.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Under section 1.13(d)(6), in addition to showing the reasonableness and relevancy of a request, an individual must show that the requested information is \u201cappropriate and required for a full and true disclosure\u201d of the issues, and that it \u201cis not available by voluntary methods and cannot be obtained through examination, including cross-examination, of oral presentations or the presentation of rebuttal submissions.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The latter requirement reflects the fact that compulsory process is essential in those cases in which witnesses refuse to divulge voluntarily information that is necessary for a \u201cfull and true disclosure\u201d of the disputed facts. <em>Without this tool, crucial information would be excluded from the proceedings, and an individual\u2019s right guaranteed under section 18 to cross-examine witnesses and offer rebuttal statements thus would have no substance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">In upholding the Commission\u2019s authority to promulgate section 1.13(d)(6), we are also guided by the principle that permits an agency discretion to adopt procedures beyond the minima explicitly prescribed by statute. An agency has considerable \u201cbreathing room\u201d to choose the procedures it will use to discharge its statutory responsibilities.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>served: \u201c[T]he formulation of procedures [is] basically to be left within the discretion of the agencies to which Congress [has] confided the responsibility for substantive judgments.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> And in a later passage from the same case: \u201cAbsent constitutional constraints or extremely compelling circumstances \u2018the administrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties. \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">B. <em>Adjudication versus Rulemaking</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">Even conceding the Commission\u2019s authority to \u201cfashion [its] own rules of procedure,\u201d appellants maintain that an administrative law judge rather than the presiding officer specified in section 1.13(d)(6) was required to issue the third-party subpoenas. Appellants\u2019 assertion is grounded on the notion that the use of the subpoena power transforms the agency\u2019s rulemaking into an adjudication, thus triggering the separation of functions provision under section 5(d)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Section 5(d)(2) provides that an agency employee who makes the recommended or initial decision may not be \u201cresponsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of an employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for an agency.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The presiding officer who administered the subpoenas in question was an employee for the Bureau of Consumer Protection, a bureau \u201cengaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions\u201d for the Commission.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We find, however, that the proceeding before the Commission is rulemaking, and thus section 5(d)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-11\">Section 202 of the Magnuson-Moss Act incorporates a wholly new type of proceeding \u2014 a hybrid between conventional, informal rulemaking and adjudication.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Section 202 goes beyond the traditional notice and comment provisions of informal rulemaking to encompass quasi-adjudicatory procedures such as the limited opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and offer rebuttal statements. The drafters of the Magnuson-Moss Act, however, were quite explicit that the inclusion of these new procedural safeguards had \u201cnot turned rulemaking proceedings into adjudicatory proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Section 202(b) expressly directs the Commission to proceed without reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>those provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act that are applicable to adjudicatory proceedings, including the separation of functions provisions set forth in section 5(d)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Viewed in light of that background, the issue as framed by the appellants in essence is whether the \u201c[ajvailability of third-party subpoenas . . . remove[s] the last significant difference between the FTC\u2019s rulemaking and full-blown adjudicatory rulemaking.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">In <em>United States v. Florida East Coast Railway</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court set forth the basic distinction between adjudication and rulemaking. Referring to several earlier cases, the Court observed: \u201cWhile the line, dividing them [adjudication and rulemaking] may not always be a bright one, these decisions represent a recognized distinction in administrative law between proceedings for the purpose of promulgating policy-type rules or standards, on the one hand, and proceedings designed to adjudicate disputed facts in particular cases on the other.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>Thus the focus is not on whether the particular proceeding involves trial-type devices but instead turns on the nature of the decision to be reached in the </em>proceeding<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Rulemaking is prospective in scope and non-accusatory in form, directed to the implementation of general policy concerns into legal standards.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Adjudication, on the other hand, is \u201cindividual in impact and condemnatory in purpose,\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> directed to the determination of the legal status of particular persons or practices through the application of preexisting legal standards.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-16\">Under those guidelines, the proceeding before the Commission is rulemaking. Its purpose is to translate general policy considerations into prospective regulations governing mobile home sales and warranty services of the mobile home industry. Facts pertaining to the practices of individual mobile home manufacturers necessarily must be elicited in the proceeding to enable the Commission to obtain sufficient data to make a reasonable policy determination. The proposed regulation, however, rather than focusing on the acts or practices of any particular mobile home manufacturer specifies only the class of persons or practices that will fall within its scope (e. <em>g., </em>\u201c[t]hose mobile home warrantors who fail to establish and maintain regular and effective warranty performance systems designed to assure that each consumer of a mobile home that is warranted will receive full performance of warranty service and repairs within a reasonable period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>time\u201d <footnotemark>45</footnotemark>). The proceeding thus is designed to do no more than fulfill the Commission\u2019s statutory responsibility of defining with specificity \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d in order adequately to guide future conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">C. <em>Whether the Subpoenas Were Issued in Bad Faith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Having concluded that the Commission has the authority to issue third-party subpoenas in section 18 proceedings and that the mobile home proceeding before the Commission is indeed rulemaking, the only remaining question to be considered is appellants\u2019 claim that the presiding official issued the subpoenas at the request of the Center in bad faith.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Their claim is supported by two allegations: (1) that the presiding officer misled appellants into believing that no requests for subpoenas would be granted, and (2) that the presiding officer, after granting the Center\u2019s motion, arbitrarily denied appellants\u2019 requests for the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum to other witnesses seeking information of allegedly the same nature and relevancy as that subpoenaed from appellants. We reject the first allegation as baseless and decline to reach the merits of the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">Appellants\u2019 first assertion depends on a colloquy that occurred between the presiding officer and counsel for one of the consumer groups interested in the rulemaking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdqR\">[PRESIDING OFFICIAL]: Just to clarify, we have not insisted. Where we have gotten documents from witnesses, we have not insisted that the witness is at the hearing to get the documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-10\">[COUNSEL]: All I would like to say, I don\u2019t want to prolong this, but we have an obligation to rebut whenever evidence we can [sic], and it seems to me that we have an obligation to rebut whatever evidence is submitted by the manufacturers and we would like to have any written documentation that reflect that kind of termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-11\">[PRESIDING OFFICIAL]: We would also, and this is rule making again, I know you haven\u2019t been here, but I remind other counsel, it is not a trial and we try to get as much as we can voluntarily. Some of it we really don\u2019t want. We have too much paper, some we would like to have and haven\u2019t gotten. So, to that extent, we try to encourage the supplying of it. If they refuse at the hearing, we do not push them further. It has been the policy to do that. Indeed, I don\u2019t think at this juncture at the hearing, we have authority to do anything further.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">As a result of the statements quoted above, appellants maintain that the presiding officer was foreclosed from granting the Center\u2019s request for compulsory process.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We are unwilling to attach such a consequence to the presiding officer\u2019s remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">The exchange must be viewed in its proper context. The presiding officer\u2019s statement was not in response to a formal request for the production of documents accompanied by a statement of need required under section 1.13(d)(6), but was in response to an unembellished oral request for writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>ten documentation.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> His remarks can in no sense be construed as a ruling that precluded interested persons from submitting properly documented requests for compulsory process at a later time in the hearing. We note moreover that appellants cannot claim prejudice arising from the official\u2019s remarks because they were on notice that compulsory process potentially was available in Magnuson-Moss rulemaking. As discussed earlier, section 1.13(d)(6) was published for public comment on 4 April 1975<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and went into effect on 13 August 1975.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The presiding officer thus remained free to consider and grant those requests that satisfied the criteria set forth in section 1.13(d)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Appellants\u2019 second argument is based on the denial of their requests filed 10 March 1978 to compel the production of various documents from government agencies, consumer groups, and mobile home dealers who testified at the hearings.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The presiding officer denied these requests on the grounds that the motions were untimely and failed to satisfy the requirements of section 1.13(d)(6).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Appellants allege that the presiding officer\u2019s refusal to issue the subpoenas was arbitrary and discriminatory because the information requested was equally as relevant and necessary for a full airing of the facts as the information sought by appellee Center. We agree with the district court\u2019s finding that appellants\u2019 attack on the presiding officer\u2019s ruling was premature. Under the review provisions of section 18, appellants must await promulgation of a final trade regulation rule before the substance of their claim may be assessed.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">Appellants\u2019 challenge does not go to the merits of the presiding officer\u2019s action in issuing the subpoenas on behalf of appellee Center: appellants do not contest the official\u2019s findings that the Center\u2019s request as modified was reasonable in scope and relevant to the issues set for consideration and that it satisfied the additional requirements of section 1.13(d)(6). Instead the gist of appellants\u2019 concern is that they will be unable to rebut evidence adduced at the hearings without the information that they requested and that only a one-sided view of the facts will emerge as a result. This is exactly the type of challenge that falls within the coverage of section 18\u2019s judicial review provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">Under section 18, this court is authorized to set aside any trade regulation rule if that rule \u201cis not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record\u201d or if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>Commission\u2019s ruling limiting an interested person\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine or offer rebuttal submissions \u201chas precluded disclosure of disputed material facts . necessary for fair determination by the Commission of the rulemaking.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus section 18 evinces a congressional intent to stay judicial intervention in those circumstances until the agency proceeding has terminated. Because appellants are afforded an adequate remedy at that time, we find their claim presently to be unsuitable for judicial review.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">III.

Section 202(a)(h)(2), (d) of the MagnusonMoss Act directs the Commission and the Administrative Conference of the United States to conduct a study and evaluation of the rule-making procedures under section 18 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and submit a report to Congress of their findings. <em>See </em>MagnusonMoss Warranty \u2014 Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, Pub.L. No. 93-637, \u00a7 202(a)(h)(2), (d), 88 Stat. 2183, 2198 (1975). On 7-8 June 1979 the Administrative Conference accordingly adopted its recommendations. See Administrative Conference of the United States, Report to the Congress of the United States Pursuant to Section 202(d) of Public Law 93-637 (As Amended by P.L. 95-558), Recommendation 79-1: Hybrid Rulemaking Procedures of the Federal Trade Commission. Recommendation 79-1 states that the Commission in general should confine its use of subpoenas to the investigative stages conducted by the agency\u2019s staff prior to the initiation of the agency\u2019s rulemaking proceedings, and that subpoenas should be used only sparingly once the agency\u2019s rulemaking has begun. <em>See id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">The majority opinion should not be construed as sanctioning a more liberal use of subpoenas in rulemaking. Under the circumstances of this case, the presiding officer was justified in administering the subpoenas on behalf of the Center because the requirements of section 1.13(d)(6) were satisfied. Those requirements, we believe, are sufficiently stringent to prevent an excessive utilization of third-party subpoenas in section 18 proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1175-13\">. 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.13(d)(6) (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1175-14\">. <em>E. g., Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v.
