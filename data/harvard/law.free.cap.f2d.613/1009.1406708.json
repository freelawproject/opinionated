At issue are regulations the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) issued in 1972 requiring a more accurate method of cost computation for hospitals or hospital-nursing home complexes having 100 beds or more, and another less accurate one for all independent nursing homes, including those with 100 or more beds. The appellant here lost substantial sums of money in Medicare reimbursement by being forced to use the less accurate method.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-17\">An HEW administrative review board for Medicare providers to which the appellant applied for relief concluded that, whatever equities weighed in the appellant\u2019s favor, the regulations were binding, and the board denied relief. The district court found the regulations valid and granted the Secretary summary judgment. <em>Diplomat Lakewood Inc. v. Califano, </em>453 F.Supp. 442 (D.D.C. 1978). We find the requirement in the 1972 regulations that large independent nursing homes use a different and less accurate cost-computation method than that demanded of large hospitals and large hospital-nursing home complexes to be arbitrary, capricious and not in accordance with law. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-18\">I. BACKGROUND OF THE PROCEEDING</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-19\">The Diplomat Lakewood Incorporated (Diplomat) owns and operates a 129-bed nursing home in northeastern Ohio which provides care to elderly, infirm patients under the Medicare program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq. </em>(1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Diplomat\u2019s nursing home contains a distinct part certified as a \u201cskilled nursing facility\u201d under \u00a7 1861(j) of the statute, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1395x(j); that facility provides \u201cextended care services\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>tients. Therefore, Diplomat qualifies as a \u201cprovider of services\u201d under the statute for the services rendered in its skilled nursing facility. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395x(u). Diplomat also provides \u201cintermediate\u201d and \u201ccustodial\u201d types of care which are less intensive than skilled nursing care and for which Diplomat does not receive Medicare reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The relevant statute requires that providers be reimbursed for the services they furnish Medicare patients on the basis of their customary charge for, or the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of, those services, whichever is less. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395f(b). Reasonable costs must be determined pursuant to methods set forth by regulation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395x(v)(1)(A). Those computation methods must be fashioned to insure that Medicare costs are not borne by non-Medieare patients. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Reimbursement to providers for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries is made either by the Secretary or, more commonly, by private insurance companies which serve as fiscal intermediaries pursuant to contracts with the Secretary. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395h.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The intermediaries make interim estimated payments to providers. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395g; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.454 (1978). At the close of the providers\u2019 fiscal year, the intermediantes make final determinations regarding properly reimbursable costs based upon \u201ccost reports\u201d which the providers are required to file. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.406(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Providers must distinguish between \u201croutine\u201d and \u201cancillary\u201d services in their accounting. \u201cRoutine\u201d services include bed, board, nursing care, minor medical and surgical supplies, and the use of equipment for which a separate charge is not made. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.452(d)(2). All other services \u2014 /. e., those \u201cfor which charges are customarily made in addition to routine charges\u201d \u2014 are \u201cancillary\u201d services. Id. \u00a7 405.452(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">A skilled nursing facility administers the next most intensive level of care below a hospital. Medicare beneficiaries in skiiied nursing homes must be certified by a physician as requiring daily supervised professional health care. Id. \u00a7 405.1632. Approximately one-fourth of Diplomat\u2019s patients require this high degree of care and otherwise qualify for Medicare benefits. It is acknowledged generally that patients in skilled nursing facilities require more of some routine services \u2014 e. <em>g., </em>more nursing care, more minor medical and surgical supplies and greater use of equipment \u2014 than patients receiving lower levels of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">A. <em>The 1966 Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-12\">In 1966 the Secretary promulgated regulations giving all skilled nursing homes two options in computing their costs: the Departmental Method or the Combination Method. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(a); 31 <em>Fed. Reg. </em>14808, 14817 (1966). For Diplomat, the computation of reimbursable costs for ancillary services is essentially the same under either method. The two methods differed, however, in how reimbursable costs for routine services were to be computed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-13\">Under the Departmental Method, providers computed \u201c[t]he ratio of [Medicare] beneficiary charges to total patient charges for the services of each <em>department </em>[as] . . . applied to the cost of the department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>405.452(a)(1) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The figure resulting from that process included the providers\u2019 reimbursable Medicare costs for both routine and ancillary services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-14\">The Combination Method provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>The cost of \u201croutine services\u201d for program beneficiaries is determined on the basis of <em>average </em>cost per diem of these services . . . [plus] the cost of ancillary services used by beneficiaries, determined by apportioning the total cost of ancillary services on the ratio of beneficiary charges for ancillary services to total patient charges for such services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.452(a)(2) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">In simplified terms, therefore, the Combination Method requires providers operating nursing homes to average the costs of their routine services for all patients, regardless of the level of care \u2014 /. <em>e., </em>skilled, intermediate or custodial. In contrast, under the Departmental Method a nursing home provider is paid on the basis of the costs attributable to the routine services its Medicare patients receive at the skilled nursing .level of care. As explained below, that distinction becomes crucial in determining whether the Secretary abused his<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> discretion in 1972 by requiring that large independent nursing homes use the Combination Method, because that method of cost computation has no adequate mechanism for reflecting the fact that patients in skilled nursing facilities generally require and receive more routine services than patients receiving lower levels of care,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and it therefore is less accurate than the Departmental Method;</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">Until 1972 Diplomat utilized the Departmental Method in order to reflect the fact that all of its Medicare patients received the more intensive routine services provided in its skilled nursing unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">B. <em>The 1972 Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">In December 1970 the Committee on Finance of the United States (Senate Finance Committee) reported on several amendments to the Medicare reimbursement standards not relevant here. In its report, however, the Senate Finance Committee described two \u201cadditional matters of concern,\u201d one of which involved the option in the 1966 regulations for Medicare providers allowing them to use either the Departmental or Combination Method. S.Rep.No. 1431, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 178-80 (1970) [hereinafter <em>1970 Senate Report </em>].</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>According to the 1970 Senate Report, both the Comptroller General and HEW\u2019s Audit Agency had recommended a total scrapping of the less accurate Combination Method because it resulted in the inclusion of some nonreimbursable ancillary costs (e. <em>g., </em>for pediatric and obstetrical care) under the Medicare statute. The Committee was concerned, however, about imposing the more precise but admittedly more burdensome Departmental Method on smaller institutions. A compromise was struck. The Committee and the Secretary \u201ccohcur[red]\u201d that facilities with fewer than 100 beds should be required to use the Combination Method; \u201clarger institutions (e. <em>g., </em>those with 100 beds or more) should be required to carry out cost finding under more sophisticated methods and to apportion costs under the more accurate Departmental Method.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">On November 17,1971, the Secretary proposed several changes in the Medicare regulations, one of which was to eliminate the option between the Departmental and Combination Method for all providers. Despite the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s 1970 Report, however, emphasizing facility size as the distinguishing factor between nursing homes for accounting purposes, <em>all </em>independent nursing homes of whatever size were required to use the less accurate Combination Method for cost reporting periods beginning after December 31, 1971. 36 <em>Fed. Reg. </em>22987, 22989 (1971). On the other hand, large (over-100-bed) hospitals or hospital-nursing home complexes had to use the Departmental Method. In spite of the drastic effect of that proposal on large independent nursing homes, the preamble to the proposed regulations gave no explanation for the differentiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">On April 21, 1972, the Secretary adopted the November 1971 proposed regulations with no change. 37 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>10353, 10355 (1972). Again no justification was offered for the requirement that large independent nursing homes use the Combination Method. The Secretary said only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-8\">Many of the correspondents opposed elimination of the option, heretofore permitted under regulations, allowing hospitals to use either the Combination Method or Departmental Method of apportionment. Elimination of the option has been retained. The option was originally granted to accommodate institutions that found the more sophisticated Departmental Method difficult to employ. In practice, however, this provider option gives each provider the opportunity to select the method that will result in greatest reimbursement from the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 10353. Thus, the single factor mentioned to justify continued use of the Combination Method was lack of accounting sophistication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">Following adoption of the 1972 Regulations and in response to protests from the American Hospital Association and other provider representatives, the Secretary in August and September 1972 conducted a random survey of 20 out of the approximately 4,000 independent nursing homes in the Medicare Program to determine the impact on them of the Combination Method. Because of the small number of independent nursing homes surveyed, the results were inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">C. <em>The 1979 Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">Nearly three years later, in December 1974, the Secretary ordered another survey to determine whether skilled nursing facilities regardless of size or hospital affiliation then required to use the Combination Method were, in fact, sufficiently skilled in their accounting practices to utilize the more accurate Departmental Method. This time 842 providers were questioned. The survey, completed in July 1975, established that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of such facilities (i. <em>e., </em>95 to 98 percent) had the requisite accounting capability to use the Departmental Method. Joint Appendix (J.A.) 62. Acting upon those results, the Secretary signified he would consider a further amendment of the regulations to completely eliminate the Combination Method as to all providers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>HEW officials also contacted the Dallas regional Medicare director on November 11, 1976, and directed the Dallas office to advise two of its fiscal intermediaries to begin accepting current and resubmitted cost reports from small hospitals and independent nursing homes<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which followed \u201cdiscrete costing\u201d principles \u201cin general agreement with\u201d the Departmental Method, as long as those facilities maintained \u201cauditable records\u201d reflecting specific cost allocations. J.A. 103 &amp; 105.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The effect of the letter (which was not, apparently, ever incorporated in any formal announcement to providers) was to establish an exception procedure allowing the fortunate providers who knew of its existence to avoid the inequities of the 1972 regulations if the required cost-allocation showing was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-13\">Diplomat obtained a copy of the letter in the fall of 1977, pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request a year after this lawsuit was begun. Shortly thereafter, Diplomat requested and obtained from the Secretary a tentative agreement that Diplomat might avail itself of the exception process as well. <em>Id. </em>at 99-103. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>Diplomat submitted a \u201cdiscrete costing\u201d proposal to its fiscal intermediary in 1977. At the time of oral argument, that proposal apparently had not been finally accepted or denied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In 1976, the Secretary finally proposed new regulations requiring the use of the Departmental Method for all Medicare providers. 41 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>52067 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">The preamble to the proposal stated that the 1970 Senate Finance Committee report had been the cause for his prior action in 1972 requiring the Combination Method for smaller nursing homes and independent nursing homes. <em>Id. </em>at 52068. In support of the new proposal to do away with the Combination Method altogether, the justifications given were: (1) the 1975 survey showed that virtually all providers had the accounting capability to use the Departmental Method, (2) the Departmental Method would not unduly burden small providers, because statutory changes in 1972 already required more precise accounting in other contexts, and (3) the Departmental Method is a more precise method of computing Medicare-related patient costs. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It was not, however, until over two years later, in January 1979, that the Secretary finally adopted the new regulations requiring the Departmental Method for all providers for reporting periods beginning on or after July 1,1979. 44 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>3984 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">Despite the long delay between the proposal in 1976 and the final issuance of the new regulations in 1979, the Secretary refused to apply them retroactively because the benefits \u201cwould [not] be sufficient to justify the administrative effort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3985. Furthermore, the Secretary concluded that the procedures allowing for an exception \u201cprovide some degree of the flexibility sought by . providers [seeking retroactive application of the 1979 change].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">D. <em>The Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_t\">Pursuant to the 1972 regulations, Diplomat and other large nursing homes filed cost reports with their fiscal intermediaries using the Combination Method for accounting periods starting after December 31, 1971. The providers\u2019 fiscal intermediaries computed their Medicare reimbursements for those periods on that basis. The first reporting period to which Diplomat applied the Combination Method was fiscal year August 1, 1971 to July 31, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">On April 2, 1975 (before the HEW exception letter was written) those providers began a declaratory judgment action in the district court challenging the 1972 regulations. That court dismissed the complaint, on the ground that the providers had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo. <em>Aristocrat South, Inc. v. Mathews, </em>420 F.Supp. 23 (D.D.C.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">Section 1395oo allows any provider dissatisfied with a decision of its fiscal intermediary to obtain a hearing before HEW\u2019s Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB). The PRRB may affirm, modify or reverse the determinations of a fiscal intermediary and make \u201cany other modifications\u201d on matters covered by the provider\u2019s cost reports. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1869 (1978).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>Diplomat then took its case to the PRRB, where it was decided on a stipulated record. The stipulation concluded that Diplomat suffered a loss of $56,302 in reimbursements for the fiscal years 1973 and 1974 due to the enforced use of the Combination Method rather than the Departmental Method.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It was also stipulated, however, that Diplomat had no choice in those years but to use the Combination Method even though the Departmental Method was the more accurate one. Thus, the PRRB ruled that it was \u201cbound\u201d by the 1972 regulations and could not assist Diplomat in any way:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aom\">Although the Board is sympathetic with the Provider\u2019s position, it must find for the Intermediary as the Board is bound by the Regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-5\">However, the Board believes it appropriate to state that the method of apportionment which the Provider is forced to employ may only be appropriate for certain unsophisticated providers. The Provider has demonstrated that it has the capability to use the more sophisticated Departmental Method of apportionment and the Board believes that this latter method is substantially more accurate in most situations. Further, the Board believes that the instant situation is an appropriate example of this. The Board further notes that evidence was presented indicating that even the Bureau of Health Insurance does not dispute the fact [that] . the Departmental Method is a more accurate method for cost apportionment assuming the providers have the accounting capabilities to employ same. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-7\">The Provider must use the Combination Method of cost apportionment with simplified cost finding for the cost reporting periods ended July 31, 1973 and 1974.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJCq\">J.A. 9-10. Diplomat then returned to the district court for judicial review under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(l) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court found the 1972 regulations valid. The Secretary admitted (J.A. 71) and the district court recognized (453 F.Supp. at 444) that the Departmental Method is a more accurate indicator of Medicare patient-related costs, although it requires greater accounting sophistication on the part of the provider than the Combination Method. But the court thought that the criticism in the 1970 Senate Report of the excessive costs to the Medicare program which resulted from allowing providers to choose between the Combination and Departmental Methods was an adequate justification for the 1972 regulations taking away that option and requiring specific cost computation methods for various categories of providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">This was so even though the court recognized that the 1970 Senate Report focused on facility size and accounting sophistication rather than hospital affiliation in differentiating between facilities for which the Combination Method was appropriate and those for which the Departmental Method should be required. It concluded that deference must be paid to the Secretary\u2019s distinction in the 1972 regulations between large independent nursing homes and large hospital-affiliated nursing homes on the ground that large hospitals and affiliated nursing homes are \u201cmost likely\u201d to have sophisticated accounting abilities; the group required to use the Combination Method on the other hand included providers \u201ctending\u201d to have less accounting sophistication. <em>Id. </em>at 446. The court further found that a regulatory scheme need not be equitable in every case to be reasonable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>II. THE LEGALITY OF THE 1972 REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">We can find no rational basis in the record nor in any justification proffered by the Secretary for the distinction drawn in the 1972 regulations (for purposes of cost computation methodology) between large independent nursing homes on one hand, and large hospitals or hospital-nursing home complexes on the other. Therefore, we are compelled to reverse the decision of the district court upholding the validity of the regulations as they applied to Diplomat. We remand the case to the district court to enter summary judgment on behalf of Diplomat as to the invalidity of the 1972 regulations as applied to it and to grant further relief consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">A. <em>The Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">The burden of showing that the distinction in permissible accounting methods of which it complains in the 1972 regulations was \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> lay, of course, with Diplomat.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We would be obliged to affirm the decision below if we could find a rational basis in the record for the Secretary\u2019s action.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We must \u201cuphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-11\">But as the Supreme Court held in <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 94, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), the Secretary\u2019s action cannot be upheld \u201cmerely because findings might have been made and considerations disclosed which would justify [the 1972 regulations] . . . .\u201d The Secretary must give \u201cclear indication that [he] . has exercised the discretion with which Congress has empowered [him] . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94-95, 63 S.Ct. at 462, <em>quoting Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 197, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941). In short, we must be satisfied that the distinction in the 1972 accounting regulations between large independent nursing homes and large hospitals or hospital-extended care facilities \u201cwas based on a consideration of the relevant factors\u201d and that there has not been \u201ca clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 824, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). <em>See Home Box Office, Inc. v.

The Secretary is obligated to pay providers for the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of care provided to Medicare patients. The statute provided in 1972:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-7\">The reasonable cost of any services shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used, and the items to be included, in determining such costs for various types or classes of institutions, agencies, and services . . . . In prescribing the regulations referred to in the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the principles generally applied by national organizations or established prepayment organizations (which have developed such principles) in computing the amount of payment, to be made by persons other than the recipients of services, to providers of services on account of services furnished to such recipients by such providers. . . . Such regulations <em>shall </em>(A) <em>take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services in order that, under the methods of determining costs, the costs with respect to individuals covered by the insurance programs established by this title will not be borne by individuals not so covered, and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by such insurance programs, </em>and (B) provide for the making of suitable \u2022retroactive corrective adj\u00fastments where, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-13\">When he first proposed the controversial 1972 regulations, the Secretary made no explanation at all of why the more accurate Departmental Method option was being taken away from large independent providers who had heretofore used it efficiently. In fact, the 1972 proposed regulations stated that their \u201cobjective\u201d was, in accordance with the statutory mandate, to accord providers the \u201creasonable costs\u201d attributable to Medicare patients:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-14\">The law provides that the costs with respect to individuals covered by the health insurance program will not be borne by individuals not so covered, and conversely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>that costs with respect to individuals who are not under the program will not be borne by the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Proposed 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405, 452(e); 36 <em>Fed. Reg. </em>at 22990. And although the proposed regulation prescribed the type of accounting method nursing homes could use after January 1,1972, it allowed the use of either method for periods up to that time, provided that the objective of \u201cwhatever method of apportionment is used will be to approximate as closely as practicable the <em>actual </em>cost of services rendered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied). The proposal emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXC\">The two methods of apportionment available for use in determining the cost of services rendered to beneficiaries of the program have as their goal the allocation of the total allowable costs between the beneficiaries and other patients in as <em>equitable </em>a manner as possible. Under these methods, if it is found that beneficiaries receive more than the average amount of services, the providers would receive reimbursement greater than average cost for all patients. Conversely, if the beneficiaries receive less than the average amount of services, the providers would be reimbursed accordingly for the services rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">It is clear, then, from these excerpts that the articulated objective of the 1972 regulations \u2014 like the 1966 regulations <em>(see </em>31 <em>Fed. Reg. </em>at 14817) \u2014 was to provide reimbursement on the basis of the most reasonable approximation practicable to the actual costs of providers in servicing Medicare patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">The record does reflect that one of the practicalities with which the Secretary had to cope, however, was the uneven \u201ccost finding\u201d capabilities among providers, a factor he noted in proposing both the 1966 and 1972 regulations.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Indeed, we would have no problem at all in upholding these regulations if he had gone ahead and drawn a distinction between different kinds of providers on the basis of their actual accounting sophistication, or even provided some basis in the record for broad groupings incorporating such a distinction. The Secretary did do this to some degree in applying the Combination Method to small providers and the Departmental Method to large ones. Unfortunately, however, he did not cite any evidence in the agency record or even in the agency\u2019s experience that would warrant drawing such a distinction between large hospital-affiliated nursing homes and large independent nursing homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">It is noteworthy that even now the Secretary makes no such claim. He admitted in this case that the 1972 regulations were \u201cnot based upon any study that included a review of the impact of the \u2018Combination Method\u2019 of cost apportionment on \u2018extended care facilities\u2019 previously using the \u2018Departmental Method\u2019 of cost apportionment, [or] . the accounting capability of such \u2018extended care facilities\u2019 to use the \u2018Departmental Method\u2019 of cost apportionment.\u201d J.A. 76. Nor did he conduct any \u201csurvey of the use by \u2018extended care facilities\u2019 of the more sophisticated \u2018Departmental Method\u2019 of cost apportionment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, his original proposal, as stated in the 1970 Senate Report, had been to do away altogether with the Combination Method.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">Although the 1972 regulations in proposed or final form made no reference to the 1970 Senate Report, the Secretary argued before the district court that the changes were motivated by it. He also made that statement in the preambles to the proposed and final amendments in 1976 and 1979. 41 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>at 52068; 44 <em>Fed. Reg. </em>at 3985. Thus, it behooves us to take a careful look at the Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>The 1970 Senate Report criticized the excessive Medicare costs attributable to the inclusion of certain pediatric and obstetrical <em>services </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>ancillary services \u2014 in reimbursable costs under the Combination Method. <em>1970 Senate Report </em>at 179. The Report also recognized that the Combination Method had been allowed as an option for both large and small \u201cinstitutions\u201d in the past because \u201ceven some relatively large hospitals would have difficulty completing the required cost finding and would also be unable to apportion costs under the Departmental Method because of poor recordkeeping practices, and this initial [1966] provision for simplifying reimbursement even for the largest institutions seems reasonable <em>for the past.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">But a close reading of the Report leaves us with no doubt that the Senate Finance Committee clearly envisioned a new system for the future that would not allow, let alone mandate, the Combination Method for large institutions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-6\">It is recognized that medicare cost finding and cost reporting requirements have contributed to an upgrading in record-keeping and accounting systems and it does not seem unreasonable now to expect <em>all larger institutions </em>which generally receive larger medicare payments <em>to use the more accurate Departmental Method </em>of apportionment of costs between medicare and other payers. On the other hand, the committee is concerned that for smaller providers program cost finding requirements should be simplified wherever possible and wherever equitable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-10\">Therefore, the committee and the Department concur that the Department should simplify its cost finding and cost reporting requirements for smaller institutions (e. g. those having less than 100 beds) and require the use of the Combination Method by those institutions without an option to use the Departmental Method. At the same time <em>larger institutions (e. g. those with 100 beds or more) should be required to carry out cost finding under more sophisticated methods and to apportion costs under the more accurate Departmental Method.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-11\"><em>1970 Senate Report </em>at 179-80 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is impossible to find in the Report any license to impose the disfavored Combination Method upon large independent institutions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Report stressed that there was a correlation between cost finding sophistication and size;' it nowhere mentioned any such correlation with hospital affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>The final regulations promulgated in April 1972 again failed to discuss any justification for the distinction in question. The Secretary did allude generally to objections he had received during the comment period on the elimination of the option, but he did not touch on the distinction among larger institutions at issue here. 37 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>at 10353. We are forced to conclude that he either was not aware of the problem at all<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> or he chose to ignore it. In either event, he has provided us with no findings or evidence in the record to support the distinction.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">In contrast, when the Secretary proposed a radical turnabout in 1976 to eliminate the Combination Method altogether, he cited as his basis: 1) two interim studies, one of which involved 842 nursing homes then using the Combination Method, 2) extensive provider and Congressional correspondence, and 3) General Accounting Office data and \u201cresults of our own reviews.\u201d 41 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>at 52068.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Secretary in this same preamble explained the 1972 regulations only as having been \u201cestablished in accordance with the report of the Senate Finance Committee,\u201d and their \u201cobjective\u201d as \u201cto eliminate the choice of reimbursement methods\u201d in order to \u201crelieve the smaller and less complex providers of the necessity for developing the more sophisticated accounting procedures as now required by step-down cost finding and the Departmental Method of apportionment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">The motivation for the 1972 distinction between large independent nursing homes and large hospitals or hospital-nurs<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>ing home complexes remains unfathomable. We must therefore disagree with the lynchpin of the district court\u2019s opinion that \u201cthis categorization was sound and reasonable, demonstrating the Secretary\u2019s \u2018consideration of relevant factors\u2019: bed size, accounting sophistication, and excessive reimbursement problems . . . .\u201d 453 F.Supp. at 446 (citations omitted). Similarly, we cannot agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-6\">The Departmental Method group includes those large providers most likely to have sophisticated accounting ability, namely hospitals and nursing homes affiliated with hospitals. The Combination Method group encompasses the providers tending to have less accounting prowess and least likely to abuse the ancillary cost aggregation procedures of the Combination Method. The Secretary chose this breakdown of facilities in order to improve Medicare reimbursement procedures for, the majority of providers and thereby benefit Medicare recipients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Our independent review of the Secretary\u2019s single justification, the 1970 Senate Report, as well as his admission that no other investigation was made of independent nursing home accounting capabilities prior to the 1972 changes convinces us differently: there is no rational basis for the distinction.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">Thus, although, as the district court cautioned, due deference should be paid an agency\u2019s determination of how best to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>achieve the statutory policies Congress directs it to implement<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and regulations must be validated if they are \u201creasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation,\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the deference due an agency \u201ccannot be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia.\u201d <em>Greater Boston Tele.

Its fiscal intermediary, Blue Cross of Northeastern Ohio, stipulated before the PRRB that the loss in reimbursable costs for the two-year period involved in this case, Diplomat\u2019s fiscal years 1972-73 and 1973-74, stemming from its ineligibility to use the Departmental Method was $56,302.

The allocation bases shown on the face of the SSA-2570 produce an equitable result for small hospitals where no nonallowable cost centers are involved (nursing homes, clinics, etc.). However, it has been found that small hospitals with nonallowable cost centers may sometimes produce a more accurate allocation of costs between the hospital and the nonallowable cost center(s) through other than a strict application of the prescribed bases.

The <em>Food Chains </em>case presented a situation not unlike this one. After an extensive investigation of several motor common carriers, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) initially concluded that the carriers had not established the necessity for tariff changes that would place the duty of loading and unloading freight upon shippers; it found that the carriers\u2019 duty to perform loading services shall be decided on a case-by-case basis. It subsequently reversed that holding on the basis of the same record and found that no carrier had a duty to load or unload cargo. 175 U.S.App. D.C. at 351, 535 F.2d at 1313. The only basis cited for its changed decision was a separate ICC proceeding in which no opposition was raised to the petition of three carriers to eliminate the loading services. This court rejected the ICC\u2019s inference drawn from the separate proceeding that shippers in general did not need loading services from carriers. We could not find any support for such a conclusion in the record and hence remanded the case. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 535 F.2d at 1318.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1079-16\">.

Of course, the Report does support that portion of the 1972 regulations which mandates the Combination Method for all nursing homes below 100 bed size and that portion which requires the Departmental Method for hospital-extended care facilities having over 100 beds. It might also have been justifiable to have thrown large independent facilities in the below-100-bed size grouping, if there were so few of them as to make it administratively inefficient to consider them separately. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>shows, however, that in 1972 there were more than 4,000 independent facilities participating in the Medicare, program.

One additional point deserves attention. The 1970 Senate Report notes that the Comptroller General and the HEW Audit Agency recommended the elimination of the Combination Method in 1970 because it allowed certain pediatric and obstetrical costs to be included in providers\u2019 total ancillary costs, a criticism which was apparently directed at hospitals rather than nursing homes. <em>1970 Senate Report </em>at 179; <em>see Administration of Federal Health Benefit Programs (Part 1 </em>\u2014 Medicare <em>Program): Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations, </em>91st Cong., 2d Sess. 30-54 (1970) (questioning of Thomas M. Tierney, Director, Social Security Administration, Bureau of Health Insurance). The Secretary asserts that nursing homes provide fewer ancillary services than hospitals, argues that they therefore had less of an opportunity than hospitals to abuse the Combination Method, and concludes that this lack of opportunity for abuse justifies his application of that method to large as well as small independent nursing homes. On consideration, however, this argument does not hold up. Although it might be an additional reason for not requiring the Departmental Method where other reasons such as lack of accounting sophistication militate against such a requirement, as in the case of small facilities, it makes no sense as a <em>primary </em>reason for not allowing a large facility with sophisticated accounting capability to use the more accurate method.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">. Regarding the survey, the Secretary stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-14\">. . The questions asked in the survey were formulated to determine whether (1) total costs and charges and health insurance program charges could be accumulated for each ancillary department; (2) total costs and inpatient days and health insurance inpatient days could be accumulated for each special care inpatient hospital unit; and (3) providers were willing to convert to the Departmental Method of apportionment and step-down or a more sophisticated method of cost finding. This survey revealed that all but a few of the providers surveyed are able to develop the necessary statistics which would enable them to use the Departmental Method of apportionment and step-down or a more sophisticated method of cost finding. Moreover, a majority of the providers surveyed stated their preference to use the Departmental Method of apportionment and step-down or a more sophisticated method of cost finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-16\">41 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>at 52068.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">. The district court also opined that \u201c[i]f Diplomat Lakewood could provide HEW with acceptable figures for actual costs HEW would reimburse it at that level, pursuant to an exception to the regulations. Diplomat Lakewood has not been able to produce such exact figures for HEW.\u201d 453 F.Supp. at 446 n.15. The Secretary also cited existing procedures for reopening cases in his refusal to make the 1979 elimination of the Combination Method retroactive. 44 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>at 3985. Furthermore, the Secretary presses (although weakly) the possibility of that alternative remedy as a ground for concluding that Diplomat still has not fully exhausted its administrative remedies. Gov\u2019t Br. 12-13 n.8 &amp; 16-17 n.10. From the record it appears to us that: (1) Diplomat has been trying for some time to find out from its fiscal intermediary (to whom it must submit cost reports) what it needs to do to qualify for an exception; the intermediary and the Secretary have been sparring over whose responsibility such instructions are, with the controversy still unresolved (J.A. 99-102); (2) Diplomat has already submitted its case to the PRRB, pursuant to the district court\u2019s earlier instructions (420 F.Supp. at 27) and over Diplomat\u2019s protests \u2014 ultimately proven correct \u2014 that such a petition would be futile in view of the PRRB\u2019s limited jurisdiction; the PRRB did not suggest that Diplomat should pursue the exception route; and (3) the Secretary admitted for purposes of the previous suit that: \u201cThe Plaintiffs for cost reporting periods after December 31, 1971, are required to file \u2018cost reports\u2019 using only the \u2018Combination Method\u2019 .\u201d (J.A. 74). We find that, in these circumstances, the possibility of exception relief does not bar Diplomat from challenging the substantive validity of the distinction at issue embodied in the 1972 regulations. <em>Cf. Phillips Petro. Co. v. FEA, </em>435 F.Supp. 1239, 1248 (D.Del.1977), <em>aff\u2019d subnom. Standard Oil Co. v.

The Secretary did not argue, but the court itself raised the question of why Diplomat did not challenge the 1972 regulations until it filed its action in 1975. For three reasons, we find that immaterial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-13\">(1) There is no statutory provision allowing for direct review of the Secretary\u2019s Medicare regulations. <em>Cf. </em>Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2060 (1976); Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1455 (1976); Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(f) (1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-14\">(2) Diplomat could perhaps have brought an action in 1972 in the district court in this circuit, basing jurisdiction on \u00a7 10 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-06. <em>See Independent Broker-Dealers\u2019 Trade Ass\u2019n v.

Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). Diplomat could perhaps have asserted jurisdiction then under the federal question statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. <em>See AMA v. Weinberger, </em>395 F.Supp. 515 (N.D. Ill.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>522 F.2d 921 (7th Cir. 1975) (preliminary injunction granted in an action based on \u00a7 1331 challenging Medicare and Medicaid regulations; jurisdictional issue not discussed); <em>cf.

Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 761, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2464, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), held that the prohibition in \u00a7 205(h) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>\u00a7 405(h), on actions under \u00a7 1331 against the United States \u201cto recover on any claim arising under [Title II of the Act]\u201d applied to an action challenging a denial of benefits under Title XVIII.

[it is] applicable with respect to [Title II] ,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1395\u00dc, thus <em>Salf\u00ed </em>alone arguably bars a suit under \u00a7 1331. Of course, the argument might have been made that \u00a7 205(h) applies only to claims arising under the statute and not to a direct challenge to regulations. In 1977 this court rejected that argument, however, finding that \u00a7 205(h) as interpreted by Sal\u00edr precludes a direct challenge to Medicare regulations because that would be an \u201caction envisioning recovery on any claim emanating from Title [XVIII].\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of Am.

Diplomat\u2019s fiscal year ends on July 31, Thus, not until Diplomat submitted its annual cost reports for 1972-73 sometime after July 31, 1973, and not until HEW evaluated them could Diplomat establish it had been harmed in the 1972 change in the regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-11\">Because there is no statutory authority for direct review, because other possible jurisdictional grounds were subsequently eliminated by court decisions, and because of possible ripeness questions, Diplomat\u2019s failure to challenge the regulations earlier should not act as a bar to its present action.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">. <em>Udall v.
