Although the administrative proceedings focused on beverage containers with a residual acrylonitrile monomer (RAN) level equal to or greater than 3.3 parts per million (ppm), the Commissioner made findings and conclusions applicable to all beverage containers manufactured with acrylonitrile, and the Final Order prohibited manufacture of such containers irrespective of their RAN levels.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">FDA began to focus on acrylonitrile copolymer beverage containers in 1974, when the duPont Company submitted test results on a container fabricated from a somewhat different substance which alerted FDA to the possibility of significant migration from acrylonitrile containers. Subsequently, the Commissioner determined that, because of this putative migration, acrylonitrile copolymer was a \u201cfood additive\u201d within the statute, and, on February 12, 1975, he published a regulation prescribing the conditions under which the chemical might be used safely in beverage containers: RAN levels in the wall of the container were limited to 80 parts per million (ppm), and acceptable migration of acrylonitrile monomer into the food was set at 300 ppb (parts per billion).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-16\">Two years later, FDA issued test results indicating that acrylonitrile caused adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>affects in laboratory animals. The Commissioner announced that he would lower the acceptable migration threshold for non-beverage containers to 50 ppb, and would withdraw approval entirely for acrylonitrile beverage containers, on the assumption that no such container could satisfy the 50 ppb migration limitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Upon judicial review, this court held FDA\u2019s suspension of its food additive regulation without a hearing to be invalid. The court stayed the administrative action on March 18, 1977<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and ordered that the required hearing be completed within 60 days. <em>Monsanto Co. v. Gardner </em>(No. 77-1245, 3/18/77). Subsequently, on a joint motion of the parties, the time limitation was extended by 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">At the administrative hearing, petitioners introduced results from tests on a newly developed acrylonitrile beverage container having a RAN level of approximately 3.3 ppm. Tests on the container, employing a detection method sensitive to 10 ppb, detected no migration of acrylonitrile monomer. Nevertheless, the administrative law judge found that acrylonitrile copolymer was a \u201cfood additive,\u201d since migration had been detected from beverage containers composed of the same chemical compounds, though with higher RAN levels than those present in the \u201cnew\u201d container.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Final Order prohibited manufacture of beverage containers containing acrylonitrile copolymer irrespective of their RAN levels.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">This case brings into court the second law of thermodynamics, which C. P. Snow used as a paradigm of technical information well understood by all scientists and practically no persons of the culture of humanism and letters.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That law leads to a scientifically indisputable prediction that there will be <em>some </em>migration of <em>any </em>two substances which come in contact. The Commissioner\u2019s Final Decision, which upheld the ALJ\u2019s determination, is unclear on whether and to what extent reliance was placed on this \u201cdiffusion principle\u201d rather than on a meaningful projection from reliable data. At one point in the Final Decision the Commissioner stated: \u201cthe migration of any amount of a substance is sufficient to make it a food additive\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 a passage evocative of the diffusion principle. Elsewhere, the Commissioner stated that he was able to make a finding of migration based on a projection from actual data \u2014 on the assumption that a roughly linear relationship (as a function of time and temperature) existed between the RAN levels in a container and the concentration of acrylonitrile that would migrate into a test fluid. On this premise, though migration from the 3.3 ppm RAN container was itself below the threshold of detectability (10 ppb), it could be projected from the testing data obtained from containers with higher RAN levels.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">This was a troublesome aspect of the case. As it was presented to us, the Commissioner had made a projection of migration from 3.3 ppm RAN containers without the support of any actual data showing that migration had occurred from such containers. One of petitioners\u2019 experts put it that the relationship might not be linear at very low RAN levels; but this was dismissed by the Commissioner as \u201cspeculative.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>could not say that the expert\u2019s contention of no migration from very low RAN containers was improbable as a concept of physical chemistry, but it was put to us that the validity of this contention could neither be demonstrated nor refuted for 3.3 ppm RAN containers because, under the conditions of intended use, migration was projected to occur in amounts below the threshold of detectability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Our own study showed the possibility of using experimental data to check the FDA\u2019s projection analysis. The FDA revealed that a projection of migration from low RAN containers had in fact been made for test conditions of prolonged duration and above-normal temperature. Under such conditions migration was projected in concentrations greater than 10 ppb, the threshold of detectability at the time of the Final Decision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, this court requested post-argument memoranda from the parties on whether tests had been performed, or would be feasible, to confirm by actual data the hypothesis that migration occurs from containers with a RAN level of 3.3 ppm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The responses to our inquiry have revealed the probable existence of data unavailable to counsel during the administrative proceedings that bear importantly upon the assumptions made by the Commissioner in reaching his findings and conclusions. This discovery buttressed our earlier conclusion that the Commissioner did not have sufficient support for his decision to apply the \u201cfood additive\u201d definition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">In light of the inadequacy of the agency\u2019s inquiry and in light of our view that the Commissioner has a greater measure of discretion in applying the statutory definitions of \u201cfood additive\u201d than he appears to have thought, we remand this proceeding for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">The proceedings at hand are dramatic testimony to the rapid advance of scientific knowledge in our society. At the time of the administrative proceedings, the lowest concentration of acrylonitrile in a test fluid that could be detected with an acceptable degree of confidence was 10 ppb. There are now analytical techniques available that can detect acrylonitrile concentration of 0.1 ppb, an improvement of two orders of magnitude.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, on the issue of migration of acrylonitrile monomer it is now possible to generate \u201chard\u201d data previously unobtainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-17\">In his post-argument testimony, Monsanto\u2019s expert claims, on the basis of such \u201chard\u201d data, that the hypothesis which the Commissioner labeled as \u201cspeculative\u201d may accurately describe the migration characteristics of containers with very low RAN levels, to wit, that in such containers the acrylonitrile monomer is so firmly affixed within the structure of the copolymer that no migration will occur under the conditions of intended use.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If these assertions can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, a modification of the current regulation is a likely corollary. The actual issuance of a regulation approving the production of a beverage container with an acceptable RAN level would presumably require both a container that had been developed <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the appropriate petition. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>ever, the Commissioner would have latitude to issue a statement of policy based upon the results of the proceeding or remand that would specify what in his review was an acceptable RAN level. This would serve a technology-forcing objective.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\"> FDA opposes petitioners\u2019 post-argument motion for remand, asserting that the proffered new evidence will not affect the Commissioner\u2019s order insofar as that order precludes manufacture of beverage containers with RAN levels equal to or greater than 3.3 ppm \u2014 the type of container already tested. FDA points out that the material submitted in response to this court\u2019s inquiry affirmatively supports the validity of the Commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> FDA contends that a petition for modification of the regulation, or a similar procedure, would be the appropriate vehicle for presentation of any new evidence indicating that migration ceases when RAN levels fall below a certain threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">As a general rule, courts defer to administrative agency orders closing the record and terminating proceedings. The rule has applicability in cases involving scientific matters notwithstanding the possibility that advances and experiments will yield new material data. Indeed, the importance of finality as a matter of administrative necessity may be magnified by the possibility\u2014 indeed probability \u2014 of advance in at least some areas. Procedures for rehearing or modifying orders are generally available to provide appropriate relief from any hardships or other harm.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The general rule of finality applies in the usual case because the courts trust the administrator\u2019s ability to make a reasoned judgment that sufficient evidence has been submitted, that adequate time has been provided for rebuttal, and that the record should be closed. However, in this instance, the closing of the record did not reflect unfettered administrative judgment: FDA conducted these administrative proceedings under a time constraint dictated by an order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">The Court is also concerned that the Commissioner may have reached his determination in the belief that he was constrained to apply the strictly literal terms of the statute irrespective of the public health and safety considerations. As we discuss below, there is latitude inherent in the statutory scheme to avoid literal application of the statutory definition of \u201cfood additive\u201d in those <em>de minimis </em>situations that, in the informed judgment of the Commissioner, clearly present no public health or safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">In the usual case, the general doctrine of necessity and finality serves the public interest in immediate protection of the consuming public. But in this case production of acrylonitrile beverage containers was deferred voluntarily even when this court issued a stay of the FDA order, and in any event it is now prohibited pending further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">Finally, we are concerned that the record reflects a momentum toward a precipitate determination. Several factors bear on our judgment. One is the text of the decision, with its lack of precision as to basis. Another is the fact that the beverage container evaluated by the Commissioner was characterized by a migration level well below the agency\u2019s initial limit. It was offered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>petitioners in the hearing as available as a result of ongoing technology, but the time constraint imposed by judicial mandate prevented the agency from scheduling the kind of administrative consideration that would ordinarily have been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Pretermitting various issues that should await conclusion of the remand proceedings, we turn to certain other important questions that are presented by the record, that have been fully briefed and argued, and that are ripe for resolution.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The statute requires a demonstration of safety precedent to FDA approval of any \u201cfood additive.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The statutory definition of \u201cfood additive\u201d which triggers that requirement contains a two part test. First, the <em>component </em>element of the definition states that the intended use of the substance must be reasonably expected to result in its becoming a component of any food.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Second, the <em>safety </em>element of the definition states that the substance must be not <em>\u201cgenerally recognized [as] safe </em>under the conditions of its intended use.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Petitioners are concerned that the Commissioner has determined, or will determine, that the component element of the definition may be satisfied solely by that application of the second law of thermodynamics called the diffusion principle: <em>any </em>two substances that are in contact will tend to diffuse into each other at a rate that will be determined as a function of time, temperature, and the nature of the substances. Congress did not intend that the component requirement of a \u201cfood additive\u201d would be satisfied by a mere recitation of the diffusion principle, a mere finding of any contact whatever with food. Petitioner\u2019s contention on this point is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-15\">For the component element of the definition to be satisfied, Congress must have intended the Commissioner to determine with a fair degree of confidence that a substance migrates into food in more than insignificant amounts. We do not suggest that the substance must be toxicologically significant; that aspect is subsumed by the safety element of the definition. Nor is it necessary that the level of migration be significant with reference to the threshold of direct detectability, so long as its presence in food can be predicted on the basis of a meaningful projection from reliable data. Congress has granted to the Commissioner a limited but important area of discretion. Although as a matter of theory the statutory net might sweep within the term \u201cfood additive\u201d a single molecule of any substance that finds its way into food, the Commissioner is not required to determine that the component element of the definition has been satisfied by such an exiguous showing. The Commissioner has latitude under particular circumstances to find migration \u201cinsignificant\u201d even giving full weight to the public health and welfare concerns that must inform his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">Thus, the Commissioner may determine based on the evidence before him that the level of migration into food of a particular chemical is so negligible as to present no public health or safety concerns, even to assure a wide margin of safety. This authority derives from the administrative discretion, inherent in the statutory scheme, to deal appropriately with <em>de minimis </em>situations.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, if the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>sioner declines to define a substance as a \u201cfood additive,\u201d though it comes within the strictly literal terms of the statutory definition, he must state the reasons for exercising this limited exemption authority. In context, a decision to apply the literal terms of the statute, requires nothing more than a finding that the elements of the \u201cfood additive\u201d definition have been satisfied.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">In the case at hand, the Commissioner made specific rulings that the component element of the definition was satisfied with respect to acrylonitrile beverage containers having an RAN level of 3.3 ppm or more. These rulings were premised on a projection, based on an extrapolation from reliable data, of migration of acrylonitrile monomer in then-undetectable amounts. In light of the supplementary submission made in response to the post-argument inquiry of this court, we find that the determination can be made for the 3.3 ppm RAN containers with an appropriate degree of confidence, and with the support of the required quantum of evidence.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Turning to the safety element of the definition, the Commissioner determined that the scientific community had insufficient experience with acrylonitrile to form a judgment as to safety. Based on this lack of opinion, the Commissioner made a finding that acrylonitrile was not generally recognized as safe within the meaning of the statute. The Commissioner acted within his discretion in making such a finding, but we note that the underlying premise may. be affected, perhaps weakened, perhaps strengthened, with time and greater experience with acrylonitrile.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This finding on the safety element will be open to reexamination on remand at the discretion of the Commissioner. He would have latitude to consider whether acrylonitrile is generally recognized as safe at concentrations below a certain threshold, even though he has determined for higher concentrations that in the view of the scientific community acrylonitrile is not generally recognized as safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">Petitioners also made a claim of discriminatory treatment \u2014 that the Commissioner is applying policies in the petitioners\u2019 case that have not been applied in other similar circumstances. However, there is no claim that the Commissioner was motivated by discriminatory intention to bring the petitioners before the agency and to focus on their product. Petitioners came before the agency in the ordinary course. Once the Commissioner undertook scrutiny, he shifted the lens of his microscope to a higher power \u2014 but that is no ground for objection, so long as the final action remains within the legitimate scope of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed in part, and in part is remanded to provide the opportunity for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">.
