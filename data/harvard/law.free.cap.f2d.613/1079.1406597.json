Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>198 U.S. App.D.C.-, 613 F.2d 1067 <em>(International Detective (Wells Fargo)), </em>involves a challenge to an Interstate Commerce Commission order granting contract carrier authority to a company in the armored car market. As in <em>International Detective (Wells Fargo), </em>the Commission\u2019s order provides for new entry and competition in certain Federal Reserve Bank routes, routes previously dominated by one authorized carrier. However this order was a grant of temporary authority, under the terms of a different statutory provision,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides the sole basis of this petitioner\u2019s challenge. Because of the particular issues turning on a grant of temporary authority we consider this case separately. We conclude that the Commission did have discretion to approve a temporary grant in these circumstances, and we affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">As pointed out in <em>International Detective (Wells Fargo), supra, </em>the armored car industry is a specialized field dominated by four large firms with the Federal Reserve Banks providing the largest single source of demand. In the fall of 1977 Wells Fargo Armored Service Corporation applied for temporary authority to carry coin, currency and other high-value commodities on routes for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia. The proposed routes covered shipments between Richmond and points in Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina. In its application Wells Fargo included the usual evidence of ability and fitness, particularly its experience as an intrastate carrier of such commodities. Although Wells Fargo was the low bidder on these routes it could not actually receive the Reserve Bank\u2019s new three-year contract (starting in January 1978) unless it had Commission authorization. Wells Fargo had filed for permanent authority as a contract carrier, but it anticipated some years delay in administrative processing of this permanent application due to the opposition of the existing carrier, petitioner Brink\u2019s Incorporated. Wells Fargo wanted temporary authority to qualify for the Reserve Bank contracts in the interim period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-21\">The Richmond Federal Reserve Bank filed a statement supporting the Wells Fargo application for temporary authority. The Bank, like those in <em>International Detective (Wells Fargo), supra, </em>had the responsibility of providing transportation of coin and currency to various member and nonmember banks in the Southeast. Brink\u2019s was the only authorized carrier for the West Virginia and North Carolina routes, enjoying a monopoly of the Bank\u2019s business. In 1976 the Bank had requested competitive bids for armored car service on various routes. Wells Fargo was the lowest bidder on the West Virginia and North Carolina runs and another carrier, Federal Armored Express, captured other routes. Brink\u2019s did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>not submit the lowest bid for any territory. The Bank would save some $900,000 over three years if Wells Fargo had the contracts on the West Virginia routes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the basis of this very substantial cost savings and secondary advantages in Wells Fargo\u2019s service,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Bank supported the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">At first the Commission denied the application, and Wells Fargo sought review in this court, No. 78-1135. Prior to judicial consideration the Commission reopened the administrative proceeding,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in an order of August 8,1978, the full Commission, by a closely divided vote, approved the temporary authority grant. Tersely, the Commission found an \u201cimmediate and urgant [s/c] need,\u201d based on the need to \u201cgive the supporting shipper an alternative choice in the competitive bidding for contracts . Applicant needs this grant of authority in order to tender a bid. If it is granted the authority, the applicant can compete for the shipper\u2019s business by offering better service.\u201d The new winner, Wells Fargo, moved to dismiss its pending lawsuit in this court without prejudice and the motion was granted. The new loser, Brink\u2019s, filed the instant petition for review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before oral argument the Commission, acting through Division 2, approved a permanent authority permit for Wells Fargo as a motor contract carrier, and on August 24, 1979 (after oral argument) Division 2 denied Brink\u2019s petition for administrative review and affirmed the earlier grant to Wells Fargo of permanent. authority. These actions raise a shadow of mootness over the grant of temporary authority. Determining first that the subsequent administrative action does not render this case moot, we next examine the validity of considering a shipper\u2019s economic and competitive needs under the temporary authority statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-13\">Before oral argument counsel for the Commission suggested that the subsequent grant of permanent authority mooted this case. However, at argument counsel informed us that the permanent authority decision of Division 2 had been appealed administratively. It appeared that, until final agency action<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> had occurred, the grant of temporary authority was still outstanding; Commission counsel conceded that until the further administrative appeal was resolved this case would not be moot. But, as noted above, on August 24,1979, the final step was taken and permanent authority was definitively granted by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-14\">We conclude, nevertheless, that the grant of temporary authority is not moot and may still be reviewed by this court on its merits. We take this position because the award of temporary authority falls within the category of \u201cshort term orders, capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. I. C. C., </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>310 (1911). <em>See also Moore v. Ogilvie, </em>394 U.S. 814, 816, 89 S.Ct. 1493, 23 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969); <em>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>197 U.S.App.D.C. 1 at 7, 606 F.2d 1373 at 1379 (1979); <em>Nader v. Volpe, </em>154 U.S.App.D.C. 332, 333, 475 F.2d 916, 917 (D.C.Cir. 1973); <em>Alton &amp; So. Ry. Co. v. Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mach. &amp; A. W., </em>150 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 41-44, 463 F.2d 872, 877-880 (D.C.Cir. 1972); <em>Jeannette Rankin Brigade v. Chief of Capitol Police, </em>137 U.S. App.D.C. 155, 157, 421 F.2d 1090, 1092 (D.C. Cir. 1969). The Commission has by no means withdrawn from the general view of. its temporary authority which is embodied in the order now challenged, and there is therefore a high probability that it will continue in that view in the future, but that, as here, judicial scrutiny will not be completed due to the time the appellate process necessarily takes. In the circumstances, consideration of the merits of this case is appropriate at this time, rather than a dismissal for mootness which would leave both the Commission and the motor carriers subject to the distinct possibility that they would never learn from the courts the parameters of the agency\u2019s temporary authority in the not unusual situation presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">TEMPORARY AUTHORITY BASED ON COMPETITIVE NEED</p>\n<p id=\"AR7\">The only issue presented by petitioner Brink\u2019s is whether the Commission could properly consider, in awarding the temporary authority, the Richmond Bank\u2019s need for increased competition on the bidding for the West Virginia routes involved here. Petitioner\u2019s position is that such a competitive need has no place whatever in a grant of temporary authority, no matter what role it may play when a permanent award is being made. There are substantial arguments on both sides, and the margin is close, but we have concluded that in this instance the Commission did act within its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">We consider the problem in the light of the situation facing the Richmond Reserve Bank when it supported Wells Fargo\u2019s application for temporary authority. In view of the considerable difference between the bids of Wells Fargo and of petitioner Brink\u2019s for the West Virginia routes, the Bank would save some $900,000 over the normal 3-year period of those contracts if awarded for the full term to Wells Fargo. <em>See </em>Part I, <em>supra. </em>In the hope that authority could be awarded Wells Fargo sooner than the end of the three-year span, the contract actually given to Brink\u2019s was for six months (with a 90-day cancellation clause). Full processing of applications for permanent authority can take upwards of two years. It is plain that, the sooner the Richmond Bank could use Wells Fargo, the sooner it would begin to save money. And the savings would not be minor or marginal, but a very substantial differential. Even a grant of temporary authority for the normal limit of 180 days (with the possibility of a special extension) would result in important savings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">Section 210a of the Motor Carrier Act (set out in note 1, supra) allows temporary authority grants for areas having \u201cno motor carrier . . capable of meeting the immediate needs of the place or area.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A long-standing judicial gloss on the statute has it that the mere existence of other carriers physically capable of driving trucks in an area does not preclude a grant of temporary authority. Rather, the shipper\u2019s need for, e. <em>g. </em>direct-line service, national connections, or special equipment and timetables, has provided the basis for an \u201cimmediate need,\u201d even where other carriers were in the area. <em>See, e. g., Union Cartage Co. v. United States, </em>244 F.Supp. 1005 (D.Mass. 1965) (3-judge court) (affirming temporary authority based on shipper\u2019s letter that ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>isting motor carriers proved inadequate); <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. United States, </em>263 F.Supp. 154 (N.D.Ohio 1966) (3-judge court) (shipper\u2019s need not satisfied by existing interlining carriers; temporary authority for single line carrier affirmed); <em>Estes Express Lines v. United States, </em>292 F.Supp. 842 (E.D.Va.1968) (3-judge court) (shipper\u2019s need for nationwide, connected service supports temporary authority; existence of local interlining carriers not sufficient), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>394 U.S. 718, 89 S.Ct. 1469, 22 L.Ed.2d 673 (1969); <em>Superior Trucking Co. v. United States, </em>302 F.Supp. 257 (N.D. Ga.1969) (3-judge court) (shipper\u2019s statements that existing carriers lacked necessary equipment, were remotely located, and failed to answer service calls supported finding of \u201cimmediate need\u201d) <em>Beil Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>306 F.Supp. 209 (S.D. W.Va.1969) (3-judge court) (shipper\u2019s letters that existing carriers were inadequate supported finding of need), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>397 U.S. 818, 90 S.Ct. 1517, 25 L.Ed.2d 804 (1970). <em>Cf. American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, </em>397 U.S. 532, 90 S.Ct. 1288, 25 L.Ed.2d 547 (1970) (affirming on procedural issues Commission finding of need for additional single-line service when number of adequate existing carriers was too small to meet shipper\u2019s requirements). This long-standing judicial construction is congruent with the construction of the \u201cpublic necessity and convenience\u201d requirement for permanent common carriers. Although the \u201cpublic necessity\u201d standard is different from the \u201cimmediate need\u201d standard applicable here, courts applying that language have also concluded that the mere existence of a physically able carrier does not negate a finding of necessity. <em>See Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 286-89, 95 S.Ct. 438, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974); <em>Nashua Motor Express, Inc. v. United States, </em>230 F.Supp. 646, 653 (D.N.H.1964) (3-judge court) (and cases cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">These holdings do not, _ of course, control the present issue of whether a shipper\u2019s competitive need can be found an \u201cimmediate need\u201d in the sense of the temporary authority statute, but the rulings do show that a temporary grant is not excluded simply because the shipper can somehow have its goods moved physically from one point to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">On its face the temporary authority statute specifies only that the need be \u201cimmediate\u201d and that there be no other motor carrier capable of meeting that particular need. What types of \u201cimmediate need\u201d there can be is left undescribed by the legislation. We know from previous decisions, summarized above, that the requisite need does not have to be a physical need for transportation \u2014 that a need for a particular type of service can be sufficient. Is that the full extent of the authority? The text of the statute does not give a definitive answer, leaving open the content of \u201cimmediate need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">Although the legislative history of the provision indicates that Congress was thinking in terms of physical and perhaps service-type needs, the ultimate emphasis seems to have been on the emergency or exigent nature of the need (/. e. the need for quick availability to the shipper of a carrier, without waiting for a grant of permanent authority) and there is nothing in the history forbidding consideration of competitive needs if they should prove in a particular instance to be of that compelling character. In 1938 Congress approved a series of clarifying and procedural amendments to facilitate administration of the 1935 Motor Carrier Act. Among the changes was the temporary authority provision, designed to give the ICC power to bypass normal procedural requirements and quickly grant temporary service in case of immediate and urgent need. The committee reports simply declare that such authority would be limited to \u201csituations in which there was an emergency and where the points or territory affected were without carrier service capable of meeting the need.\u201d H.Rep. No. 2714, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 3 (1938); S.Rep. No. 1650, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1938) (containing identical language). This emphasis on emergencies is reflected in the hearings where then Chairman Eastman of the ICC stressed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>emergency authority would be narrowly restricted and applied to protect the \u201clegitimate interests of other carriers.\u201d <em>Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, To Amend the Motor Carrier Act, 1935, </em>75th Cong., 3d Sess. 5, 20 (1938) (Senate Hearings); <em>Subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Amending the Motor Carrier Act </em>11-12 (1938) (House Hearings). The only type of emergencies mentioned to the Committees were actual physical needs, <em>see </em>Chairman Eastman, <em>Senate Hearings, supra, </em>at 5, <em>House Hearings, supra, </em>at 11 (\u201cThe bringing in of oil wells in a new field' and conditions created by a flood or other calamitous visitation are good examples, and there are others.\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But the full metes and bounds of the general terms of the provision were not spelled out, and the Commission was left with flexible authority within a limited range. The real thrust of the committee reports and the hearings was that temporary authority was to be limited to cases of an unmet need of sufficient exigency that the normal hearing procedures for a permanent authority grant should be pretermitted. <em>See Senate Hearings, supra, </em>at 5, 20 (statement of Chairman Eastman).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">On this basis, we do not read the text of the statute or its legislative history as necessarily excluding a competitive need if the Commission can legitimately find that that unmet need is of sufficient exigency and gravity to call for immediate action, rather than awaiting permanent authority. A competitive need is undoubtedly a \u201cneed\u201d within statutory coverage. In <em>International Detective (Wells Fargo), supra, </em>decided today, we hold that a competitive need can be a \u201cdistinct need\u201d for permanent contract carrier authority. There is no reason why a competitive need cannot similarly be a \u201cneed\u201d for temporary authority \u2014 provided that it meets the additional requirements of immediacy and exigency. The National Transportation Policy (now section 10101), which blankets all motor carrier regulations including the temporary authority provisions, reflects congressional concern for economic considerations in transportation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Subsection (a)(2) establishes a general policy of \u201csafe, adequate, <em>economical, </em>and efficient transportation\u201d (emphasis added), and subsection (a)(4) speaks of a policy of \u201creasonable rates.\u201d If competitive considerations reach the exigent and compelling plane, they furnish an \u201cimmediate and urgent need\u201d within the scope of the provisions for temporary authority. In our view, the Congresses which initiated and continued that provision for a temporary grant would not have balked at such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>We are reinforced in our belief \u2014 that account can be taken in a temporary grant of an impelling competitive need \u2014 by the Commission\u2019s regulations on temporary authority which have been in effect since 1965. These regulations distinguish between two types of temporary authority: \u201cemergency temporary authority\u201d for 30-day periods to meet those very insistent emergencies where time does not permit even normal temporary authority procedures; and \u201cregular\u201d temporary authority for the statutory 180-day period which incorporates certain filing requirements with provision for <em>Federal Register </em>notice and opportunity to file a protest. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1131.1(b)(1) (1978) (defining \u201ctemporary authority\u201d and \u201cemergency temporary authority\u201d); <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 1131.2, \u00a7 1131.3 (procedural requirements for filing \u201ctemporary authority\u201d applications).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the initial congressional concern for authorizations without any formal procedural requirements when there occurred \u201ccalamitous visitations\u201d has been confined to the more limited \u201cemergency temporary authority\u201d cases. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1131.4(b)(3) (1978) (describing \u201cemergency\u201d authority as necessary to meet, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cneeds resulting from fires, floods, storms, or other disasters which affect the public health\u201d). Broader types of needs are now covered under the \u201cregular\u201d temporary authority provisions, which correspondingly provide more elaborate procedural protections. Section 1131.-4(b)(2) describes the \u201cregular\u201d temporary authority provision in examples of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APO\">a new or relocated plant, different method of distribution, new or unusual commodities, an origin or destination not presently served by carriers, a discontinuance of existing service, failure of existing carriers to provide service, <em>or comparable situations which require new motor carrier service before an application for permanent authority can be filed and processed, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">This broader administrative category includes a wide range of shipper needs; we see no reason why exigent economic needs should not be among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">It is also significant that, in another context of weighing shippers\u2019 needs, the ICC has a long-standing record of recognizing economic needs as relevant to the need for new carriers or new routes. In evaluating common carrier applications (for permanent operation) the Commission is required to consider \u201cpublic convenience and necessity.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(a)(2) (1979). In determining \u201cpublic necessity\u201d the Commission has long recognized the shipper\u2019s need for reasonable rates under the \u201ceconomic embargo\u201d doctrine. Although mere desire by a shipper for more desirable rates will not demonstrate public necessity, a showing that existing carrier rates are \u201ctoo high or structurally ill-suited to move traffic\u201d will justify certification of a new carrier. See, e. <em>g., Armellini Express Lines, Inc., Ext-Freight Forwarder Traffic, </em>113 M.C.C. 603, 614 (1971), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom., Alterman Transport Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>361 F.Supp. 664 (M.D.Fla.1973) (3-judge court); <em>Kroblin Refrigerated Xpress, Inc., Ext.-Freight Forwarder Traffic, </em>123 M.C.C. 831, 841 (1975), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom., Regular Common Carriers Conference v. I. C. C., </em>182 U.S.App. D.C. 177, 559 F.2d 798, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 903, 98 S.Ct. 299, 54 L.Ed.2d 190 (1977); <em>National Freight, Inc., Ext.-Pittsburgh, Pa., </em>110 M.C.C. 433 (1969); <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. </em>\u2014 Common <em>Carrier Application, </em>68 M.C.C. 199 (1956); <em>Herman R. Ewell Ext.Philadelphia, </em>72 M.C.C. 645 (1957). While petitioner Brink\u2019s rates here are not a complete embargo in the classic sense, the $900,000 in rate savings to the shipper Bank (over a three-year period) is certainly a powerful economic consideration. The Commission has previously recognized the economic ills produced by a monopolist carrier, <em>see, e. g., Frank R. Chullino, Extension-Alcoholic Beverages and related items to Omaha, </em>120 M.C.C. 181, 189 (1973); <em>George D. Best &amp; Harold Wilcox-Common Carrier Application, </em>120 M.C.C. 551 (1974); <em>Samuel J. Lansberry, Inc., Ext.-Centre County, Pa., </em>126 M.C.C. 456, 458-59 (1977), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>and has well-recognized discretion to consider competition in determining \u201cpublic necessity.\u201d <em>See, e. g., Bowman Transportation, supra, </em>419 U.S. at 288, 297\u201499, 95 S.Ct. 438; <em>International Detective (Wells Fargo), supra. </em>We do not incorporate the common carrier content of \u201cpublic necessity\u201d into the \u201cimmediate need\u201d standard of temporary authority for contract carriers. We think, rather, that one element of necessity in common carrier application \u2014 severe economic need \u2014 provides a useful analogy in considering the types of need in temporary authority cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">Though the issue does not appear to have been presented often or definitively, there is also some case authority supporting the use of competitive or economic considerations in temporary authority cases. <em>See East Coast Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>556 F.2d 741 (5th Cir. 1977) (per curiam); <em>Central Delivery Service of Washington, Inc., </em>Doc. No. MC 140443 (Sub. No. 2-TA) (Feb. 11, 1977);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>cf. Alterman Transport Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>361 F.Supp. 664, 669 (M.D.Fla.1973) (3-judge court) (noting emergency temporary authority and temporary authority granted to carrier on basis of economic embargo theory). We know of no case authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">Our general conclusion \u2014 from the statutory text, taken together with the legislative and administrative history \u2014 is that the Commission can legally take account of a competitive need where that factor creates for the shipper an exigent, immediate need for the applicant\u2019s service in order to gain or save a substantial sum.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the specific case before us, we hold that the Commission did not act arbitrarily or abuse its discretion in finding those conditions to exist. The agency could permissibly determine that the Richmond Bank fell into that category because of the sharp difference between petitioner\u2019s and Wells Fargo\u2019s bids, and the magnitude of the sum at stake.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1141-15\">.

Temporary authority for motor and water carriers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-19\">Without regard to subchapter II of chapter 103 of this title and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, the Interstate Commerce Commission may grant a motor carrier or water carrier temporary authority <em>to provide transportation to a place or in an area having, respectively, no motor carrier or water carrier capable of meeting the immediate needs of the place or area. </em>Unless suspended or revoked, the Commission may grant the temporary authority for not more than 180 days. A grant of temporary authority does not establish a presumption that permanent authority to provide transportation will be granted under this subchapter, [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-23\"><em>Cf. </em>49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10923 (1979) (standards for permanent authority as a contract carrier).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">. The Bank stated that it would save a total of $1.2 million by using Wells Fargo on both the North Carolina and West Virginia routes. After preliminary Commission denial of the application, the Bank gave Brink\u2019s a new three-year contract for North Carolina. However, the West Virginia runs, which remain at issue here, were covered only by short term (six month) contracts (with a 90-day cancellation clause) on which the Bank could still save some $900,000 if Wells Fargo was given temporary authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">. The Bank said that Wells Fargo submitted the \u201cbest service proposal\u201d and claimed that\u2019 Wells Fargo\u2019s service would provide additional flexibility. However the primary reason for Bank support was the saving that could be realized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1142-15\">. Initially the Commission declined to reconsider its decision, apparently believing that, since the January 1978 contract deadline had passed, the Bank was stuck with Brink\u2019s for another three years. The Bank then informed the Commission that the West Virginia contract had a six-month term with a 90 day termination provision. As noted <em>supra, </em>the Bank argued that granting Wells Fargo temporary authority would still result in up to $900,000 in savings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1142-16\">. Brink\u2019s also hied for a stay of the temporary authority order before the Commission and this court. The motions to stay were both denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1142-17\">. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 (1976) (defining finality for purpose of judicial review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">.

This interpretation of temporary authority has been in effect since 1965, when regulations on temporary authority applications were first published. <em>See </em>30 Fed.Reg. 5836 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">. Like most of the Commission\u2019s temporary authority decisions, this is an unpublished order. The facts in <em>Central Delivery </em>provide an exact parallel with this case: temporary authority was granted to an armored carrier to serve the needs of the Baltimore branch of the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank stated in supporting shipper that temporary authority would save it a very substantial sum, some $255,000 per annum, while the permanent authority application was still pending. In a summary order the Commission (on reconsideration) granted the temporary authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">. In reaching this conclusion, we do not forget the possibility that an existing carrier with a monopoly (by virtue of having the sole ICC authority) over Federal Reserve or other business may prolong and delay permanent authority proceedings for quite a while, and thereby continue to reap its monopoly profits until the new entrant is finally approved. We do not suggest that petitioner was guilty of such delaying tactics. But in <em>Central Delivery Service of Washington, Inc., </em>Doc. No. 140443 (Sub. No. 2-TA) (Feb. 11, 1977), <em>supra, </em>note 11, the Baltimore Bank branch expressed considerable concern over the delaying tactics of the protesting (and sole authorized) carrier on a pending permanent authority grant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1147-12\">. Though petitioner\u2019s sole attack is that consideration of economic issues was outside the statutory boundaries, it does make a subsidiary argument that the Bank\u2019s need was not \u201cimmediate\u201d but rather \u201cprospective,\u201d based on the fact that even after temporary authority was granted it would take the Bank 90 days to terminate the existing contract with Brink\u2019s. This argument is without merit because the \u201cimmediate need\u201d does not require an instantaneous need. The temporary authority regulation allows for needs arising anytime \u201cbefore an application for permanent authority can be filed and processed\u201d \u2014 a period often involving several years. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1131.4(b)(2) (1978). The regulation also defines immediate need as a showing that \u201cthere is <em>or soon will be </em>an immediate transportation need\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>Brink\u2019s construction would compel a shipper to await until the first day of actual need arose before filing for temporary authority, causing the shipper to go without needed services during the processing period. Further, in this case the Bank\u2019s need was \u201cimmediate\u201d in the sense that as soon as a new carrier was authorized the Bank could give Brink\u2019s the requisite notice and thereby minimize the Bank\u2019s transportation costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
