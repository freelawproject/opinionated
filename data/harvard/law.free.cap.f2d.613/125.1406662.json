This development moots two of Granville\u2019s contentions relating to failure of the Parole Commission to grant him parole. Gran-ville\u2019s remaining contentions concern his conviction and sentence in one of four felonies which he has committed. That conviction was for bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2 &amp; 2113(a), and an eight-year sentence was assessed. Granville contends that the conviction was invalid and the sentence excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Because of various collateral consequences we must review an attack on a conviction even though the prisoner is discharged from physical custody during the pendency of appeal. <em>Carafas v. Lavallee, </em>391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968); <em>Hudson v. Alabama, </em>493 F.2d 171, 172 n. 1 (5th Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Granville attacks this conviction by arguing that the crime of bank robbery requires physical presence at the scene of the crime. But Granville was charged with aiding and abetting, and his conviction was supported by evidence of participation and overt acts in furtherance of the robbery. Consequently, Granville\u2019s first contention is wholly without merit. <em>United States v. McGhee, </em>448 F.2d 781 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 949, 971, 94 S.Ct. 3077, 3176-77, 41 L.Ed.2d 670, 1142-43 (1974); <em>United States v. Henson, </em>456 F.2d 1045 (8th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">Granville secondly contends that his sentence was excessive, both as a matter of law and because the Judge relied upon erroneous information in his presentence report. We have consistently allowed the District Court wide discretion in sentencing. Granville\u2019s sentence was within the statutory limits and the sentence was not an \u201carbitrary or capricious action amounting to a gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>589 F.2d 811, 826-27 (5th Cir. 1979). The fact that other participants in the bank robbery received somewhat lesser sentences does not make Granville\u2019s sentence excessive. <em>Lucio v. United States, </em>394 F.2d 511 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">The second alleged reason that the sentence was excessive was similarly rejected by the District Court. Granville claims that the presentence report incorrectly stated that he had been dismissed from a sales position because of an $18,000 commission fraud. But Granville has failed to make any sort of showing that this information was material and relied upon by the sentencing Judge. This is normally the petitioner\u2019s burden. <em>United States v. Rollerson, </em>491 F.2d 1209, 1213 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Trevino, </em>490 F.2d 95, 96 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>466 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>513 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1046, 93 S.Ct. 546, 34 L.Ed.2d 498 (1972). Under the limited scope of review applicable in this case, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>Granville\u2019s failure to sustain his burden defeats the presentence report argument. The District Court therefore properly upheld both the sentence and the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\">. Granville filed the instant motion on June 13, 1977. At that time he was incarcerated under sentences relating to other felonies, not under the bank robbery sentence at issue here. It appears that the bank robbery sentence was fully-served on March 29, 1977. But applying the liberal standard of <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595, 30 L.Ed.2d 652, 653 (1972), Granville\u2019s pro <em>se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion adequately presents a motion \u201cin the nature of a writ of error <em>coram nobis . </em>. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 505, 74 S.Ct. 247, 249, 98 L.Ed. 248, 253 (1954). <em>See Grene v. United States, </em>448 F.2d 720-21 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>344 F.2d 401, 409-10 (5th Cir. 1965). Our jurisdiction in the present case is therefore \u201cof a limited scope, existing \u2018in those cases where the errors [are] of the most fundamental character, that is, such as render[ing] the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 186, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 2240, 60 L.Ed.2d 805, 812 (1979) (quoting <em>United States v. Mayer, </em>235 U.S. 55, 69, 35 S.Ct. 16, 19, 59 L.Ed. 129, 136 (1914)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
