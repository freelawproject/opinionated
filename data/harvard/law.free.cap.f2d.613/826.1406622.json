Both turn on the issue of whether appellant was an employee within the meaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (the Act). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16 (Supp. II 1972). Because we find that the nature of appellant\u2019s' employment status requires further evidentiary exploration, we vacate the grant of the motion to dismiss, leave undisturbed in the present state of the record the denial of the cross-motion for summary judgment, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">From September, 1968 to November 29, 1974, appellant Spirides worked intermittently in the District of Columbia as a foreign language broadcaster for the Greek Service, a division of the Voice of America (VOA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Excepting the periods from (i) 1968 to 1969, (ii) October, 1970 through October, 1971, and (iii) October, 1974 through November 29, 1974,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> she worked pursuant to Purchase Order Vendor (POV) contracts which indicated, <em>inter alia, \u201c. . </em>. that the Contractor [Spirides] shall perform such services as an independent contractor, and not as an employee of the [United States International Communication] Agency.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these renewable yearly contracts, she was paid per assignment, which included four consecutive hours of rehearsals and performances as a mistress of ceremonies of the Greek Service\u2019s radio program.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">In June, 1974, with the addition of two female foreign nationals to the employee staff of the Greek Service, the Chief of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Service informed Spirides he could no longer justify the expenditure of POV funds for a female voice. Therefore, her contract was not to be renewed after its September, 1974 expiration.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Claiming that this action resulted from sex discrimination, appellant filed a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Office (EEOO) of USICA in October, 1974. The following month, without an investigation, EEOO issued a final decision finding no discrimination. Spirides then appealed to the Appeals Review Board of the Civil Service Commission (CSC), which found that USICA had violated civil service regulations by failing to investigate appellant\u2019s allegations, <em>see </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.216 (1978), and remanded the case to USICA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">When EEOO again found no evidence of sex discrimination, appellant requested and received a hearing by an EEOO Complaints Examiner. His finding of sex discrimination and consequent recommendation of back pay and reinstatement were rejected by USICA in January, 1976, principally because Spirides was found to be a contractor instead of an employee. As such, she was determined to be ineligible for retroactive back pay and reinstatement under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">A second appeal to the Appeals Review Board confirmed USICA\u2019s decision. The Board found that, because (1) Spirides was not a \u201cfederal employee\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(a) (1970),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) agency officials did not consider her an employee, and (3) her employment contract described her as an independent contractor instead of an employee, she was precluded from seeking redress under the Act or its regulations. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.212 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Her administrative remedies exhausted, Spirides timely filed a complaint in the District Court alleging unlawful termination of her employment by reason of her sex.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She claimed jurisdiction under the Act, and sought declaratory relief, retroactive and prospective injunctions, and damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> USICA filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, on the ground that Spirides was not an employee under the Act and hence not protected by its provisions. Spirides opposed this motion, and moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of her status as an employee under the Act. Relying only on these motions and responses, together with affidavits in support of the summary judgment motion, the District Court found that Spirides was at all times under contract as a Purchase Order Vendor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and thus was an independent contractor and not an employee. It therefore denied the partial summary judgment motion and granted the motion to dismiss the complaint. This appeal challenges both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">A. <em>Scope of Coverage of Title VII</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-17\">For several years after its enactment, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 proscribed only nonfederal employment discrimination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Congress became increasingly concerned, however, about the apparent inability of federal employees to obtain judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>cial review of employment discrimination cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, in 1972, Title VII was amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act to forbid discrimination by federal government employers,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and to permit federal employees to sue those employers in discrimination cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Congress emphasized repeatedly that those covered by the 1972 amendments must be \u201cemployees,\u201d or individuals \u201cemployed by an employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2000e(f). For example, the Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">All personnel actions affecting <em>employees </em>or <em>applicants for employment . </em>in executive agencies shall be made free from any discrimination based on . . . sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-16(a) (emphasis added). In addition, within a certain period of time after filing an initial charge with an agency, department, or unit, or after action by an agency or by the Civil Service Commission,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABU\">.an <em>employee </em>or <em>applicant for employment </em>if aggrieved by the final disposition of his complaint, or by the failure to take final action on his complaint, may file a civil action ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-16(c) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">This statutory language supports the conclusion that the 1972 amendments to Title VII cover only those individuals in a direct employment relationship with a government employer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Individuals who are independent contractors or those not directly employed by such an employer are unprotected.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Status as an employee is therefore of crucial significance for those seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>to redress alleged discriminatory actions in federal employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">That the Greek Service in the present case is an employer is clear, because it is an \u201cexecutive agency\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> engaged in the \u201cgovernmental activity\u201d of broadcasting radio programs overseas. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(h). Whether appellant is an employee, or \u201cindividual employed by an employer,\u201d however, is more difficult to determine, because the Act does not clearly compel consideration of any particular set of factors, nor does it describe precisely the elements of the employment relationship that must exist to trigger equal employment coverage in the public sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">B. <em>Determination of Employee Status Under Title VII</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Appellee argues, and the Civil Service Commission agrees,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that the test for employee status should be controlled by the statutory definition of the term in the Civil Service Commission\u2019s authorizing legislation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This definition of \u201cemployee\u201d is found in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(a) (1970), which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-7\">(a) For the purpose of <em>this title, </em>\u201cemployee\u201d, except as otherwise provided by this section or when specifically modified, means an officer and an individual who is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-8\">(1) appointed in the civil service by one of the following acting in an official capacity\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-9\">(A) the President;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-14\">(B) a Member or Members of Congress, or the Congress;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-15\">(C) a member of a uniformed service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-16\">(D) an individual who is an employee under this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-17\">(E) the head of a Government controlled corporation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-18\">(F) the adjutants general designated by the Secretary concerned under section 709(c) of title 32, United States Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-19\">(2) engaged in the performance of a Federal function under authority of law or an Executive act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-20\">(3) subject to the supervision of an individual named by paragraph (1) of this subsection while engaged in the performance of the duties of his position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A49\">(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-21\">Appellee points out, correctly to be sure, that appellant has not been \u201cappointed to the civil service.\u201d Therefore, appellee argues that appellant cannot be considered an employee for purposes of the instant case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-22\">Examining the plain language of the Civil Service statute, we find that the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d applies only to \u201cthis title,\u201d /. e., Title V, which creates the Civil Service Commission. As this court has duly noted in the case of <em>Lodge 1858 v. Webb,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an individual must satisfy all subsections of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1205(a) \u201cto be deemed an employee <em>within the meaning of the Civil Service </em>laws.\"<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>In this case, however, the issue to be decided is not whether Spirides is an employee under the civil service laws, but whether she may in any respect be deemed an employee under Title VII as amended. Therefore, resort to the civil service definition is unwarranted, and whether or not Spirides may be deemed an employee cannot be determined merely by noting the absence of her \u201cappointment to the civil service.\u201d Furthermore, because the Act is remedial in character, it should be liberally construed,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and ambiguities should be resolved in favor of the complaining party.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Use of the restrictive civil service definition here would not effectuate the broad remedial purposes of the Act,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and would therefore be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Rather, determination of whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor for purposes of the Act involves, as appellant suggests, analysis of the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d of the work relationship.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This test calls for application of general principles of the law of agency to undisputed or established facts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Consideration of all of the circumstances surrounding the work relationship is essential, and no one factor is determinative.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the extent of the employer\u2019s right to control the \u201cmeans and manner\u201d of the worker\u2019s performance is the most important factor to review here,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> as it is at common law<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and in the context of several other federal statutes.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> If an employer has the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>control and direct the work of an individual, not only as to the result to be achieved, but also as to the details by which that result is achieved, an employer/employee relationship is likely to exist.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Additional matters of fact that an agency or reviewing court must consider include, among others, (1) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether the work usually is done under the direction of a supervisor or is done by a specialist without supervision; (2) the skill required in the particular occupation; (3) whether the \u201cemployer\u201d or the individual in question furnishes the equipment used and the place of work; (4) the length of time during which the individual has worked; (5) the method of payment, whether by time or by the job; (6) the manner in which the work relationship is terminated; <em>i. e., </em>by one or both parties, with or without notice and explanation; (7) whether annual leave is afforded; (8) whether the work is an integral part of the business of the \u201cemployer\u201d; (9) whether the worker accumulates retirement benefits; (10) whether the \u201cemployer\u201d pays social security taxes; and (11) the intention of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The District Court found in its challenged order that \u201cplaintiff was at all times a \u2018Purchase Order Vendor,\u2019 hence an independent contractor and not an employee of the United States Information Agency . . . .\u201d For this reason alone, the Court apparently concluded that it had no subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed the action. Even if the District Court had made this finding of non-employee status after applying the proper principles of law, that would not be the end of the matter. Under Fed.R.Civ. Proc. 52(a), an appellate court must set aside a trial court\u2019s findings if it concludes that they are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 394-95, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). In this case, we need not reach the question of whether the District Court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous, however, because the District Court applied an erroneous legal standard in holding that Spirides was outside the reach of Title VII. <em>See United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., </em>374 U.S. 174, 194 n. 9, 83 S.Ct. 1773, 10 L.Ed.2d 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">The District Court made its decision relying principally, if indeed not entirely, on the contract language. Courts generally look to the substance of a contract rather than its form,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and, although contract language may be indicative to some degree of the intention of the parties, it is not necessarily controlling.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, employment contracts, no matter what the circumstances that justify their execution or what the terms, may not be used to waive protections granted to an individual under this or any other act of Congress.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>In this case, the POV contract indicates beyond question not only that the Greek Service had authority to hire appellant, but that it had authority to hire her as an independent contractor. Yet, despite the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d language, the contract does not define the employment relationship between the parties other than to indicate in the barest of terms the service to be provided, the payment schedule, and the length of the agreement. Because consideration of these facts alone was insufficient to support a finding that appellant was an independent contractor and thus beyond the scope of the Act, we hold that the District Court\u2019s virtually exclusive reliance on the contract language as indicative of appellant\u2019s employment status was error. The Court should have reviewed all of the circumstances surrounding Spirides\u2019 work relationship in addition to its consideration of the elements of her POV contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The District Court also denied appellant\u2019s cross-motion for partial summary judgment, apparently on the basis of the language in the POV contract. Appellant claims that the specific facts alleged in her motion, together with those in her accompanying affidavit, are sufficient to support the grant of summary judgment in her favor, particularly in view of appellee\u2019s failure to respond to the motion with affidavits or any countering evidence. We are unpersuaded that this is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">While it is always perilous for an opposing party to remain silent in the face of a summary judgment motion, <em>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 160-61, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970), the moving party still has the burden of showing that there exist no genuine issues of material fact. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 90 S.Ct. 1598; 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 56.22[2], at 1338 (2d ed. 1976). If the movant makes an insufficient showing, no defense is required.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Appellant showed in her papers that she worked as a foreign language radio announcer at the Greek Service for about five years, from 1968 to 1969 and from 1970 through 1974. She worked pursuant to a Purchase Order Vendor contract for most of this period,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and apparently pursuant to an oral agreement for the rest of the time. She normally worked approximately four hours per day from three to five days per week, and was paid per assignment. The Greek Service provided her an office and all the materials for her work. She continually worked for the same supervisor who instructed her when rehearsing or broadcasting as to voice inflection, reading tempo, and projection. The program scripts were written for her, and although her comments and criticism of the scripts were accepted, she could not change any part of a script without approval.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Even though for present purposes we must accept these statements as true,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> there remain issues of material fact that may bear on the determination of appellant\u2019s employment status, such as whether she was given annual leave, whether the Greek Service paid social security taxes for her, and whether she received retirement benefits. Appellant thus has not met her burden of proving entitlement to partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">As stated hereinabove, the appeal is availing as to the dismissal of the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>but not as to the cross-motion for summary judgment; and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">. VOA is itself a division of the United States Information Agency (USIA), which has been renamed the United States International Communication Agency (USICA or Agency).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">. From September, 1969 to September, 1970, Spirides was on a leave of absence. During the other periods excepted in the text, Spirides was not under contract, and apparently worked pursuant to an informal oral agreement. See Affidavit of Appellant (Sept. 1977), J.A. at 19-20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\">. Appellee stated in the District Court that the Agency has authority to procure services of individuals like appellant under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471(5) (1970), which allows the Secretary of State</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-10\">(5) to employ, without regard to the civil service and classification laws, when such employment is provided for by the appropriation Act, (i) persons on a temporary basis, and (ii) aliens within the United States, but such employment of aliens shall be limited to services related to the translation or narration of colloquial speech in foreign languages when suitably qualified United States citizens are not available. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">See <em>also </em>Letter from C. Normand Poirier, Assistant General Counsel of USICA, to Gregory V. Morrow, Jr. (June 30, 1975), J.A. at 15-16 (Agency authorized to use purchase orders to obtain broadcast services under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471(5) (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"A86\">In appellee\u2019s brief to this court and during' oral argument, however, appellee suddenly claimed that 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471(5) only allows USICA to enter into personal service contracts with aliens, and thus is inapplicable here because appellant was an American citizen while she worked for appellee. Appellee now argues that USICA\u2019s hiring authority outside of the civil service laws stems from 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(c)(3) (1970), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-17\">(c) All purchases and contracts for property and services shall be made by advertising, as provided in section 253 of this title, except that such purchases and contracts may be negotiated by the agency head without advertising if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-18\">* * * * *. *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-19\">(3) the aggregate amount involved does not exceed $10,000. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-20\">Appellant points out that her POV contract itself states that \u201cthe Agency is authorized to enter into this contract by the United States Information and Education Exchange Act of 1948 (Public Law 402, 80th Congress), as amended, and Reorganization Plan No. 8 of Aug. 1, 1953.\u201d This Act is codified only in various sections of Title 22, including section 1471. See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1431-1440, 1442, 1447, 1448, 1451-1453, 1456-1458, 1461, 1462, 1466-1468, 1471-1473, 1476-1479 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-21\">We find it unnecessary to decide this question, because it is clear not only that USICA has authority to procure broadcast services without regard to the civil service laws, but also to contract with independent contractors. Our task is to define the work relationship between the Agency and such hirees, however, and neither of the statutes, nor the POV contract in question, whatever its source, provides such a definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b888-7\">. <em>See </em>text at-of 198 U..S.App.D.C\u201e at 830 of 613 F.2d, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b888-9\">.

In addition to Title VII coverage for government employees, an employee of a government contractor is protected against the contractor\u2019s discriminatory actions during performance of the contract. <em>See </em>Exec.

In <em>Webb, </em>a reduction-in-force (RIF) was announced at the Marshall Space Flight Center, requiring that employees be laid off only if they could not be placed in alternative available positions. Appellants, former employees displaced by the RIF, claimed that certain alternative positions were being filled illegally and should be set aside for them because NASA was treating its independent contractors like employees in violation of the civil service laws. The court, in determining whether or not the workers in question were employees who required appointment under the civil service laws, looked in part to the Civil Service statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1205(a), and found that the workers in fact were not employees. <em>Id. </em>188 U.S.App. D.C. at 241-43, 580 F.2d at 504-06.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b890-24\">. <em>Id. </em>188 U.S.App.D.C. at 241, 580 F.2d at 504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b891-5\">. <em>See, e. g., Coles v.
