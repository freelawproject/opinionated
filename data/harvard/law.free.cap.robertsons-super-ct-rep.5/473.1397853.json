The action was upon a policy of insurance of $3300, on a cargo of wheat. The facts established were as follows : On the 18th December, 1860, the appellants received from the- respondents a policy of insurance upon a cargo of wheat contained in a canal boat, <em>[The W. H. Platt,) </em>for one month only;- in which permission was given that the boat be towed from place to\u2019place in New York harbor. It excepted theft, robbery, <em>ice </em>or barratry, from the perils, insured against. On the 14th of January, 1861, such canal boat, with the wheat on board, after having been towed from her berth in Jersey city, in the state of New Jersey, to a pier 36, East fiver, in New York harbor, while in the act of being fastened to the pier, was struck by ice and sunk. The boat received no injury, except from <em>ice, </em>and the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>to it caused thereby damaged the wheat to the amount insured in such policy. Other facts appear in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-4\">The plaintiffs claimed that the boat on board of which the cargo was, when the loss occurred, was neither <em>lying up </em>nor <em>on a trip or voyage </em>within the meaning of the policy, <em>but </em>was being towed from place <em>to </em>place in Eew York harbor, as provided in the written portion of the policy, and that the exceptions did not therefore apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-5\">The referee-held that the damage sustained by the plaintiffs from the loss and injury to the wheat was incurred from the peril of ice, which was excepted from, those insured against.- He therefore directed judgment to be entered for the defendants, and that the complaint be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">Judgment being entered accordingly, the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-7\"><em>J. B. </em>Burrill, for the appellants, plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-8\">I. As such policies of insurance as that in question are prepared by underwriters, it is their duty so to frame them as to leave no doubt in regard to their construction, and they should be construed against the party by whom they have been prepared.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-9\">1. The defendants in the present instance, prepared a policy in many respects inapplicable to the condition of the tow boat in which the property insured was laden, or to the circumstances of this particular case'; since the insurance was effected for a limited period of time, was confined to the harbor of Eew York; and yet speaks of navigating, making <em>trips and voyages.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-10\"><em>2. </em>It would be inequitable to allow this insurance company to screen itself from the payment of this loss on the ground that it has drawn its policy so badly, vaguely,\u201cconfusedly, and ambiguously, as to permit a construction which will destroy the very purpose and object which the insured desired to attain by effecting insurance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>II. The insured desired to effect insurance on his cargo laden on this boat; it was not his intention that the boat should remain at her then present location, or that she should lie up there, or any where else; but that the boat should be <em>towed </em>from place to place in the harbor, and be insured, both while lying up, and while being towed from place to place. The company, therefore, in so many words, insured the plaintiffs for \u201c one month, $3300, on wheat on boat <em>W. 3. Platt, </em>lying at Jersey city,\u201d which might \u201cbe towed from place to place in New York harbor.\u201d This means an insurance on the cargo on the boat <em>W. 3. Platt, </em>not only while lying at Jersey city; but also while being towed from place to place in the harbor, and at whatever place in the harbor she may be, whether lying up at a dock, or at anchor in the stream. The words, \u201c said boat may be towed from place to place in New York harbor,\u201d are in writing, (while the other portions of the policy are printed,) and according to well settled principles, must control. <em>(Benedict </em>v. <em>Ocean Ins. Co., </em>31 <em>3. Y. Rep. </em>389.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-5\">1. The counsel, for the defendants claims that the words, \u201csaid boat may be towed,\u201d &amp;c. are inserted merely to overcome the printed clause of the policy, which provides that the boats are not\u2019 to be moved or towed from the place, where the boat is in the policy stated to be lying, without the written consent of the company. This is not so. The printed clause merely provides that the vessel\u2019s berth shall not be changed without written consent, and is intended to apply to those cases only where vessels are insured only while lying up, <em>i. e. </em>at her berth. In such case, if consent were given to change the berth of the vessel, doubtless, if the vessel succeeded in changing her berth without accident, the policy would protect and cover her after she had reached the new berth, and so long as she remained there; but the company would not be liable for a loss sustained by such boat in transitu from one berth to another. The policy in question goes further; it is not restricted to insurance while lying up at the berth, (either that designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>in the policy or such other as she may subsequently acquire,) but it insures the boat while being towed from place to place, not merely while going ftom one <em>berth </em>to <em>another </em>berth, but to any place in the harbor. If the plaintiffs had effected a sale of different parts of their wheat; to be delivered on board of different vessels in the stream, and of a third part, until the whole cargo was exhausted, this clause in the \u25a0policy would cover it in each of these cases, and permit the boat to go from one vessel to another, and, after the whole cargo had been delivered, to return to the original berth at Jersey city,, or to any other berth in the harbor of New York. The written portions of the policy being therefore inconsistent with, and relating to other circumstances, and covering other conditions of things than those provided for in the printed parts of the policy, must control.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">2. The defendant\u2019s counsel also claims that ice is one of the excepted dangers and perils insured against in this policy. The perils caused by <em>ice </em>being excepted from those \u25a0 assumed by the company, \u201c <em>while the said boat is on said trip or voyage, or while lying up, as aforesaid,\u201d </em>of course, the exception only takes effect in cases where the perils and dangers out of which ice is excepted, may be encountered. Such language as so used is, therefore, equivalent to saying,. that loss by ice will not be insured against, while the boat is <em>on said trip or voyage, or while lying up, as aforesaid; </em>which words are inapplicable to the case presented. There was no trip or voyage mentioned in the policy, and the words <em>on said trip or voyage </em>\u201d had no application, because no trip or voyage had been mentioned. This also shows that the printed part of the policy bears no application and is inappropriate, and that the written parts of the policy alone must govern.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">3. The boat in question was not <em>on any trip or voyage, </em>nor was it intended or designed that she should make any; none was specified in, nor could she make any under the conditions of, the policy. The boat was neither <em>lying up </em>at the time of the accident, nor <em>on a trip or voyage </em>at that time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>in which cases alone, the exception of <em>ice </em>was to prevail. The clause of the policy which commences with the words \u201ctouching the perils,\u201d and all other clauses controlled and governed by it, have no application, and may be excluded in applying the policy to this particular case. We contend that, not having application to this particular case, it may be entirely rejected, and, in that event, we must fall back upon the <em>written </em>portion of the policy. The written portion, whether taken by itself or in connection with other parts of the policy which are applicable to the case, will entitle us to indemnity for the loss for which we claim to recover.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-5\"><em>S. J. Scudder, </em>for the respond\u00e9nts, defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">l. The policy is an ordinary port policy, as understood by merchants and underwriters, and carefully adapted to the exigencies of owners of vessels or cargoes lying in port at the time of insurance. It covers the risk while lying at a pier, and is so framed that permission may be given to move from place to place in port, without such moving, when assented to, being repugnant to any of the general provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-7\">II. The policy specially excepts from the perils insured against, theft, robbery, <em>ice </em>or barratry. The loss to the appellants was occasioned by ice, (an excepted peril,) and by no other cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">m. The loss thus occasioned by an excepted peril, it would seem, in the ordinary contemplation of things, should fall on the insured. The difficulty attending a recovery for such a loss, where no policy of insurance has been made, is no greater than that encountered in maintaining a claim to recover, where, although an insurance exists, it does not cover the cause of loss. It is, however, seriously contended, that, because permission was given to move the boats insured, the excepted peril of ice ceased to be excepted, and was insured against!</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-9\">IV. The permission to move the boats from place to place, in New York harbor, is, in no respect, repugnant to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>or inconsistent with, any of the provisions of the policy, and especially is it not so with the provision excepting theft, ice, barratry, &amp;c. The appellants accepted the policy as it is; paid the usual premium for insurance, where ice is excepted; received the usual permission to move their boats from certain places to certain places; did move them, and one was damaged by ice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-4\">1. The contract must be interpreted to give effect to all its provisions, and harmonize all its intents. It is obvious that the insured intended to move their boats ; that, at the time of insuring, they were lying at different points, laden with wheat. It provides for a <em>trip or voyage, </em>calls for anchors, cables and rigging, and compels <em>lights </em>while at anchor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-5\">2. The boats could not be moved without written permission. The insurers so prepared the form of policy to entitle themselves to regulate the mode and time of moving, and points from and to which the moving should be. If this permission had not been given, no question as to the peril of ice could have been raised. There is less danger from ice in a slip, when protected by the piers, than when in the stream. The underwriters refused to insure against ice, while the boat was in a slip, but gave permission for her to move in the stream, where greater danger existed; and, it is claimed, that thereby they assumed the risk, so carefully provided against in their policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">3. If this permission to move struck out ice from the exceptions, it equally struck out barratry; upon the theory of the appellants, had the master scuttled the boat while on the trip to pier 36, the insurers would have been liable. Indeed, upon this theory, no danger could have been excepted, no peril avoided by the insurers, if the permission to move were in writing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-7\">V. This is not a case which comes under the rule, that,where insurance is made upon property in a special business, everything necessary to that business is excepted from the conditions of prohibition. It is not necessary for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>canal boat to be cut down by ice, or scuttled by her master, or her wheat stolen by river thieves.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b487-5\">By the Court, Robertson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A88\">The plaintiffs claim that the exceptions in the policy in this case, of injury by <em>ice </em>to the vessel, containing the subject of insurance from the enumerated perils insured against, did not apply to it, while it was being <em>towed </em>from <em>place to place </em>in the harbor of New York, as permitted by the policy. And they base such claim on the argument that both the enumeration of such perils and such exceptions therefrom, are only applicable while the vessel was either on some voyage or trip, or lying at the wharf, <em>(towing </em>from place to place in a har.bor being neither,) and that, being so inapplicable, the policy operated as a general contract of insurance against all perils usually insured against, upon vessels 'or their cargoes on the water, by .mere force of the words, \u201c <em>do insure.\u201d </em>The defendants, on the other hand, contend that the words, \u201con said trip or voyage,\u201d refer to the <em>toiving </em>previously spoken of, and, therefore, the injury to the vessel by <em>ice, </em>while being so towed, came directly within the exception of perils from those enumerated as being those against which the insurance was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">I am compelled to differ with the learned counsel for the parties somewhat, as to both positions taken by them, notwithstanding the ingenious reasoning by which they were sustained, as well as from the reasoning of the learned referee, in the opinion accompanying his report. I would find it difficult .to arrive at the conclusions that the general expression of <em>towing </em>a vessel about a harbor is either <em>navigating </em>it, within the meaning of the policy, or a <em>trip </em>or <em>voyage, </em>according to the received meaning of those words. But in this case the <em>towing </em>was not made the main predicament in which the vessel was to be, while insured, but,, if any thing, it was rather to be while lying at the wharf. It was, in terms. and in fact, an exceptional permission to change the location of the subject insured, without vitia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ting.the insurance, and required the written consent of the company before such change could be made, unless the-two clauses are irreconcilable, and the written is to control the printed. An insurance of the cargo of a vessel on <em>a voyage, </em>which was not to be undertaken without the written consent of the underwriters, would be either a nullity, or, at most, a mere proposal for a contract. But it would not be so in regard to merely occasionally <em>towing </em>a vessel insured for some fixed period, as in this case. The terms, \u201cnavigation,\u201d \u201c navigating,\u201d \u201c voyage or trip,\u201d in this form- of policy, are evidently intended for vessels which are in the course of being propelled from one port to another, and while the printed part of it seems to be adapted to a vessel, either while on such a voyage, or lying at a wharf to be discharged, the greater portion of its stipulations referring rather to the former. I do not see, therefore, any peculiar fitness in terming it a <em>port </em>policy only. The introduction of the written clause in the one in question, undoubtedly confined the perils insured against to those while the vessel was in port, and thus modified the more extensive ones embraced in the printed part of the policy, and rendered many of its stipulations superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The mere failure, however, to describe any <em>voyage or trip </em>in the policy, within the meaning of those words, as used in it, could not alone render the enumeration of perils insured against, and the exception therefrom of injury by <em>ice, </em>inapplicable <em>to </em>the vessel in question while being <em>towed. </em>The words \u201con said voyage or trip \u201d maybe rejected as surplusage, except so far as they tend to explain the meaning of the alternative phrase, \u201c <em>or while lying up as aforesaid,\u201d </em>and still the defendants be protected by the exception. The object of the policy was evidently to insure the cargo in question while in the port of Hew York. The entire phrase, \u201c on said trip or voyage, or while lying up, as aforesaid,\u201d by making such conditions as the only alternatives, evidently meant to comprehend every possible condition in which the vessel containing the-subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>insurance could be placed while in that port. She was either to be.engaged in navigation or <em>laid up. </em>The meaning of the word <em>lying, </em>as used in the enumeration of the perils, is not necessarily confined to mere inertness of position, joined, as it is, with the proposition \u201c <em>up,\u201d </em>but embraces the idea of a change from a prior state of activity to one of repose. In this case it meant a cessation of <em>active \u00bfnavigation, malting trips or voyages from port to port. </em>The vessel in question did not cease to <em>lie up </em>whenever she was <em>towed </em>from place to place in the harbor, any more than if she. <em>lay </em>at .the wharf; lthough, for greater caution, the privilege of <em>towing </em>was expressly reserved. At all events the two conditions were not irreconcilable. She ceased to be in active^ service as a vessel capable of being navigated, and was kept as a mere floating warehouse, or receptacle for merchandise, to be towed or transported while <em>afloat </em>by external power, but even then only with the defendants permission. The words \u201cas aforesaid\u2019\u2019 also included not only <em>lying up </em>while <em>at a wharf, </em>but also while being <em>towed </em>about the harbor. I conclude, therefore, that the vessel was injured by the excepted peril, <em>ice, </em>while she vyas <em>11 lying up, as aforesaid,\u201d </em>within the meaning of the policy, and that, therefore, the defendants were properly held not to be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The difficulty with the position taken on behalf of the plaintiffs, is that they can only succeed by establishing that, as matter of fact, a vessel, while being towed, was neither making a trip or voyage nor lying up, within the meaning. of the policy, but in a predicament to which neither description would <em>apply\u2014that of being </em>towed\u2014and that, as matter of law, the previous general words of insurance insured against all perils usually insured against on the water. I have already dealt with the first, and the last is not sustained by any authority or writer, English or American, on the subject of insurance. On the continent of Europe, where the civil law or its modifications prevail, usage or positive enactment has defined all the perils insured against, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>and there is no need of inserting them in a policy. But I have not been able to find any authority that, in Great Britain and this country, claims that any perils are insured against other than those enumerated in the policy, and any necessarily or usually consequential ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
