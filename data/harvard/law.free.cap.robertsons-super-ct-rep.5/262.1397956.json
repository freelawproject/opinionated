He was then asked by his counsel: \u201c In consequence of the delay and failure of Mr. Crow to complete the work at the time agreed on, what amount of damage did you sustain ?\u201d Which question was objected to and excluded.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHL\">Four defenses were made by the answer in this case, and of course there were as many issues to be tried by the jury. 1. Whether a sum was paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs, exceeding the work actually done by them. 2. Whether the defendants sustained damage by the unworkmanlike and unskillful performance of such work. 3. Whether,, such, work was not completed within the time agreed <em>on; </em>\"and 4. Whether the defendants sustained damage by the abandonment of such work by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">All of such issues are presumed to have been passed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\"by the jury, unless expressly withdrawn from their consideration, and all such evidence which might influence them in deciding any of such issues improperly, being illegal, should be excluded, if objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">In this case, a question was put to a witness (the defendant Becker,) whether the price to be paid was \u201c that on a contract for a rough job ?\u201d To which the defendants\u2019 counsel objected, and excepted to its admission. This question evidently might have had its effect on the jury, for even the learned justice, before whom the action was tried, remarked to them, \u201c that the price named in the contract did not call for a very superior class of work;\u201d and the jury might have been induced to think from the admission of the evidence, that they were authorized to determine the class of work from the price paid, and were to be governed by that. It is true, the judge in charging the jury, in other respects confined his remarks to the question of abandonment. But he did not exclude from their consideration the other defenses in the action, in determining on which, .the jury might have been governed by the improper evidence already admitted, as the judge evidently was.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">I do not deem it necessary in this case, to discuss the question whether, on a motion for a new trial on a case, for misdirection of the judge, it is essential that an exception should have been taken to his charge on the trial, on the point objected to on the hearing. Although <em>Archer </em>v. Hubbell, (4 <em>Wend. </em>514,) seems to be decisive of it in the Supreme Court, sustained as it is by <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>(5 <em>Wend. </em>193,) and <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>McKinley, </em>(3 <em>Code Rep. </em>10,) this court seems in <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>(3 <em>Sandf. </em>341,) and <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>Long Island Railroad Company, </em>(5 <em>id. </em>180,) to have held differently but it seems also to have been governed by the consideration that upon the whole case, the party succeeding was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">But, for the error in admitting the testimony in answer to the question, whose admission was objected to, the defendants are entitled to a new trial, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Jones, J.

The defendants\u2019 counsel then offered to show the loss of rents on the building from October 15 to December 6, which was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-16\">Jonathan See, a witness on behalf of the defendants, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>having testified that Becker gave him a piece of paper, which he gave to Crow, was asked: \u201c State the contents of that paper?\u201d Which was objected to on the ground that no notice had been given for its production. The objection was sustained, and exception taken. The parties having rested, the judged charged the jury: \u201cThis is an action on a contract for building a house. It would seem as if the price named in the contract ($1500) would not call for a very superior class of work. But the whole case resolves itself to a question of credibility between the witnesses, of which you (the jury) are the exclusive judges. Mr. Becker, the defendant, states that Mr. Crow abandoned the work at a certain stage, and that he bad to complete it. The plaintiff testified that he completed the work agreed on in the contract, with the assistance of men whom he employed and paid. The jury \u2018would\u2019 remember the testimony of these parties, and other witnesses examined, and as they credited either side, * * find for the plaintiffs or defendants.\u201d Counsel for the defendants excepted to that part of the charge, which spoke of the price named in the contract, not calling for a very superior class of work. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs for $438.75. The defendants moved for a new trial, which was denied. Judgment having been entered according to the verdict, the defendants appeal to the general term from the judgment, and the order denying a new trial. On the argument of the appeal, the defendants\u2019 counsel urged that the judge erred in his rulings above mentioned; also in the expression of his opinion above referred to, and in not charging the jury on the law applicable to the facts proved, and also urged that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. The questions: (1.) \u201c In consequence of Mr. Crow not having the work completed by the 15th of October, how much did you lose on your contract with Mr. Jones ? \u201d (2.) \u201c In consequence of the delay of Mr. Crow to complete the work at the time agreed upon, what amount of damages did you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sustain?\u201d and (3.) \u201cWere you acquainted with the value of rentals in that vicinity during May, 1860?\u201d were properly overruled, and the offer accompanying the last question, to show the loss of rent on the building from 15th October to 6th Dec\u00e9mber, was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The first two questions call for a decision by the witness, on mixed questions of law and fact. It is not every loss which a party may deem himself to have sustained by a breach of contract, that will be regarded as damages by the law; yet by the second question he is necessarily asked to determine how much, and what damages he is to recover, and by the first question that there was a loss by reason of non-performance by the plaintiffs. These are matters' to be determined by the jury, under direction of the judge. I think it highly improper to have a whole issue decided, both as to the law and the fact, by answers to general questions. It is true, the other side may, by a skillful' cross-examination, show precisely in what manner the witness arrives at his estimates, and thus save himself from being charged with improper items; but, as it devolves on the party claiming damages to prove them, I see no reason why it should be made easy for him by swearing to generalities, to give <em>prima facie </em>evidence as to the amount, and impose on the other side the difficult task of getting rid of the effect of this general oath, by eliminating through the medium of a long cross-examination, the sources of knowledge from, and the basis on which, the estimate is made, and the items composing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The third question, and the accompanying offer, did not go far enough. As Mr. Jones suffered the loss of rent (if there was any) the defendant could not in any event be' allowed that loss, unless he showed that he was compelled to deduct it from his contract price with Mr.' Jones. This' he did not propose to show. But there is another objection. The defendant had closed the direct-examination of\u2022 the witness; he had been cross-examined, and the defend-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ant prepared to re-open the direct, on a matter not touched on in the cross, examination. It was in the discretion of the judge either to allow or disallow such re-opening. He refused it. I see no reason for interfering with such exercise of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The defendants\u2019 counsel asked the following question: State the contents of that paper ? An objection to the question was sustained, and an exception taken. No notice to produce the paper had been given. To avoid the effect of this, the defendants say that the pleadings notified the plaintiffs that this paper was relied on. All that is in the pleadings on this subject, is the allegation \u201c that due notice was given to the plaintiff;\u201d whether written or verbal, is not stated. It might be either, and yet be <em>due. </em>This allegation, surely, cannot be said to put the plaintiff on guard that a written notice is relied on. Again, the defendants say, the plaintiff in his testimony on the trial denied ever having received such notice, or having possession of it; consequently, a notice to produce would be superfluous. I do not so understand the testimony. The plaintiff\" says he cannot swear that such notice was not served on him ; he only says, it was not, to his knowledge. If notice to produce had been given, he could have examined Ms papers, and have been prepared either to produce or deny that he ever had it, or admit that he had it, but lost it; or denying all knowledge of it, also deny that it is in his possession. A want of present knowledge as to the service or possession of a paper, arising perhaps wholly from not having made search for it, cannot excuse the necessity of giving a notice to produce, the object of which is to give the party so noticed an opportunity to look for the paper, and to produce it if he has it, and sees fit so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">A reversal cannot be had by reason of an error, (if any such there be,) in putting the question: \u201c $1500 would be a contract for a rough job ?\u201d or in the court\u2019s making the remark, \u201c $1500 for a building of this dimension, is little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>enoughor in the observation by the judge in his charge-: \u201c It would seem as though the price named in the contract, would not call for a very superior class of work;\u201d because the evidence eUpited by the question, and the remarks made, had not the slightest bearing on the issue presented to the jury, and could not possibly have affected their verdict thereon. The evidence and the remarks, bore solely on the question of the value of the work done, and the degree of workmanship and skill required by the contract; while the only question left to the jury to pass on, was whether the plaintiff had abandoned the work before its completion or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">It is urged that the verdict is against the weight of evidence. The verdict rendered was that the plaintiff had not abandoned the work, but had completed it. As this was the only matter left by the charge to their consideration, it is absurd to say they rendered a verdict upon any other; it would be more absurd to say, that because the evidence on an issue not left to them, required a verdict for the defendants, therefore, their \u2022 verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, on an issue which was left to them, is against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The only question then on this point is, whether the evidence on the subject of the abandonment of the work, is such as to call for setting aside the verdict, as being against the weight of evidence. The evidence on that point was . quite conflicting. I understand the rule to be, that when a jury have by their verdict settled such conflict of evidence, their verdict will be regarded as conclusive, and will not be disturbed, because from the written or printed testimony the court think the preponderance of evidence to be contrary to the verdict, or would have been better satisfied with a verdict the other way\". This case exemplifies the soundness of the rule. Upon the printed case before me, it would be exceedingly difficult to pass on the question, while if I had presided at the time, I should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>probably have had no difficulty in arriving at a conclusion; which might have been in unison with the verdict, or not, as the case might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The jury had better opportunities for arriving at a.correct conclusion than the general term has, and it is impossible for this court to say, under the evidence in the case, that the conclusion they did arrive at was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The remaining point raised on this appeal is, that the judge erred in-not charging the jury upon the law applicable to the facts proved. He did charge on the issue of abandonment, and correctly. He did not charge on the other issues, nor was he requested to. The defendants\u2019, counsel not having requested a charge on the other issues, cannot now claim that there were other issues which should have been submitted to the jury. If this were a pure bill of exceptions, it is evident that the defendants could not now take such objection, simply because there is no exception which covers it. But it is a case and bill of exceptions combined, and it is claimed that the- fact of the motion being for a new trial on a case, entitles the defendants now to take this objection, although it was not taken at the trial. I think it does not, and in support of my views might rely on the cases of <em>New York and Erie R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>(2 <em>Sandf. </em>732;) <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>(3 <em>id. </em>341;) <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>Long Island R. R. Co., </em>(5 <em>id. </em>180;) <em>Jackson ex dem. Beekman </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>(13 <em>John. </em>495.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In <em>Jackson ex dem. Beekman </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>the defendant moved for a new trial on a case. The evidence was pretty strong in favor of the defendant on the question of adverse possession. But that question was not submitted to the jury. There did not appear to have been objection made on the trial to such non-submission, nor any request preferred to have it submitted. The court' held, that it must be presumed that such defense was abandoned on the trial. This case is on <em>quatuor pedibus </em>with the one at. bar, and I have been unable to find any case that directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>overrules it. But is based on the general proposition, that' on a motion for a new trial, made on a case, any objection may be raised, although not made at the trial. I can find no authority for this proposition. On the cpntrary, the law seems to me well settled, that no objection can be urged on a motion for a new trial on a case, which was not taken at the trial; The English practice in this respect, is laid down thus: \u201cIf the judge incorrectly reject a competent witness, or admit the evidence-of one that is incompetent; or mistakes the law, or misdirects - the jury in any respect, so that the client might be prejudiced, it is the duty of the leading counsel immediately to state the ohjection, and if he do not, the court will not, .ora <em>motion, </em>grant a new trial. It is imperative on counsel to object, if at all, at the time, or lose the effect of the objection, and be precluded from supporting a motion for a new trial. It is sufficient, however, to merely suggest the objection to the judge, and present the point concisely.\u201d <em>(Chitty\u2019s General Practice, vol. </em>3, <em>p. </em>915.) At the time this doctrine was laid down, there were under the English practice, two modes of correcting errors at trial. One by a motion for a new trial, which was similar to our motion for a new trial on a case, and in respect to which the above principles were laid down, and the other by bill of exceptions and writ of error, which was similar to our appeal upon exceptions. And it is stated to have been the practice of one of the learned English judges, when he thought the point raised of1 sufficient importance, not to put the party to the delay of a motion for a new trial, but to suggest the tendering of a bill of exceptions, so that a writ of error might go at once. <em>(Chitty's General Practice, vol. </em>3, <em>p. </em>915.) A practice which is similar to ours of ordering exceptions to be heard in the first instance at general term.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">To pass to our own country, <em>Graham, </em>in his book on <em>Practice, </em>at page 293, lays down the rule, that on a motion for a new trial on a case, the court will not take notice of an objection not raised at the trial. This rule does not depart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>from, but follows the English practice. <em>Graham </em>lays down the above mentioned case in 13 <em>John. </em>495, as the authority for this proposition. At first blush it might appear that this case was not authority for the position, but on a close inspection it will be found that it is. It was held that by reason of 'the non-submission of a question to the jury, the court must presume it was abandoned at the trial. It is-evident that such presumption could only be deemed to have arisen, from the fact of no objection having been raised below to the non-submission of the question, and no request having been made for its submission. The non-objection, is the cause from which the court deduced the effect of a presumption of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The same remarks will apply, and are to be understood as applying, without repetition, to other cases, where from the. same cause, the courts deduce the effect of an aequiesence in a ruling or decision, or in a certain disposition of a case, or of a presumption of an assumption by both parties at the trial, of the existence of a fact, or a presumption of a consent at the trial to substitute the judge for the juiy, in the determination of all, or some of the disputed questions involved. Thus, in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>(20 <em>Wend. </em>210,) the defendant was not allowed to argue, as a cause for a new trial, that the proof was insufficient to establish that the servant was acting in the business of the master, because it was assumed at the trial that the proof was sufficient. So in <em>Beekman </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>(19 <em>Wend. </em>444,) it was held that the point, that the value had not been paid for a boat, could not be urged, because on the trial it was assumed that it had been paid. Both these cases were motions for a new trial on a case, and in both the court refused to hear an objection that certain matters were not proved, on the ground that it was assumed at the trial that they were proved. But how did the court arrive at the conclusion that there was such assumption ? Only from the fact that on the trial attention was not drawn to such want of proof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>by objection or otherwise. These cases, therefore, carry out the English practice before referred to, and our practice, as laid down in <em>Graham </em>and the case in 13 <em>John. </em>There are many other cases of the same character as those above cited from <em>Wendell, </em>but it is needless to refer to them. I have been unable to find a single- authority in this state antagonistic to the existence of the general rule thus laid down in the English practice, in the standard book on practic.e:of-\u00a1this state, (Graham\u2019s,) and the decisions above-referred to,</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u2018There are three cases which, on a cursory view, might appear to be antagonistic, but are not in fact. They are <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Hubbell, </em>(4 <em>Wend. </em>514;) <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>(5 <em>id. 191 Scott </em>v. <em>Lilienthal, </em>(9 <em>Bosw. </em>224.) I will examine thein' in- inverse, order. In the case in 9 <em>Bosworth, </em>the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court, after deciding that no exception had been taken sufficiently covering-the objection raised, so as to permit a new trial to be granted on a bill of exceptions, held that what transpired on'the trial amounted to taking such objection to the reception of , evidence, as would authorize the court to grant a new trial upon a case. This decision accordingly comes within the general rule, which does not require an <em>exception </em>for the purpose of founding a motion for a new -trial on a case, but simply that the point shall have been raised on the trial by objection or otherwise. In 5 <em>Wendell, </em>191, the court held \"that the point had been raised at the trial by objection to' the defense, and having once been raised, need not 'be- reiterated by an objection to the charge submitting such defense to the jury, and the court says: \u201cIf they had stood by in perfect silence, and heard the judge submit to the jury a matter of defense which was excluded by the pleadings, the court might not listen to them on a motion for a new trial for that cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">As the case was disposed of on the ground that a sufficient objection had been taken, it was unnecessary to decide what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>rule would have been applicable if no objection had been raised, and the court did not decide what rule would be applied, but intimated that in such case the objection would not be listened to. This case is then, to some extent, authority in favor of the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The case of <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Hubbell, </em>(4 <em>Wend. </em>514,) does not seem to have been reported with a view to the point under discussion, as the only statement concerning it is contained in the reporter\u2019s note as to what an oral decision on the argument was. It consequently does not appear whether any, and if any, what objections were raised at the trial. The point made was, that objections to the charge could not be raised, because the charge was not <em>excepted to, </em>and the court held that such rule only applied to bills of exceptions. This ruling is undoubtedly correct. The distinct point made was, that on a case a charge could not be reviewed unless there were <em>exceptions. </em>This point the court met, holding that the doctrine of <em>exceptions </em>was only applicable to bills of <em>exceptions. </em>To this extent, and to this extent only, is the case authority, and in this view of it is perfectly consistent with the general rule above laid down, relative to motions for new trials on a case. By that rule, it was never necessary that <em>exceptions </em>should be taken, but simply that the points relied on for a new trial, should have been raised at the trial by objection or otherwise. The point taken in 4 <em>Wendell, </em>was, not that the question had not been raised at the trial, but that no exception had been taken to its decision. Whatever misapprehension there may be as to the existence of a rule, that on motion for a new trial on a case, no objections can be heard unless raised at the trial, seems to me due to a hurried reading of the case in 4 <em>Wendell, </em>and a failure to recognize the broad distinction between exceptions and objections; a distinction not new, but well recognized by the English and our practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">There is, however, an exception to the general rule, which is, that where there are objections, by reason whereof the party who has obtained a verdict can, in no possible event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>and under no possible circumstances, be entitled to it, in that' action, a new trial will be granted, on the ground of such objections, although they were not taken at the trial. <em>(Rich </em>v. <em>Penfield, </em>1 <em>Wend. </em>380.) Here I will refer to a remark made by the court, in the above cited case of <em>Beekman </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>(19 <em>Wend. </em>444,) viz: \u201cThe party cannot now make an objection, which, if taken at the proper time, might have been answered.\u201d Language of the same import, is used in the above cited case of <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>(20 <em>Wend. </em>210,) and in numerous other kindred cases. It might be urged that by this language the courts meant to lay down, as a general rule, that on a motion for a new trial any objection may be urged, although not taken at the trial, and as the exception to the rule that such objection as might have-been obviated, could not be urged. I think the argument unfair and unsound; as the objections which can be obviated are immensely more numerous than those which cannot be, the argument would make the <em>exceptions </em>have a more extended application than the general rule. Again, as the general rule that all objections must be raised at the trial, was well settled in the English practice and our own, before the decisions in which the language under consideration is used, it cannot be overturned by inference drawn from mere peculiarity of phraseology. The fair and just interpretation of the language is, that it is simply designed to point out the exception; to decide that the case in hand does not fall within it, but that the general rule requiring all objections to be raised at the trial applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">From this review, I am satisfied that upon authority, the decisions of Chief Justice Oakley, in the <em>New York and Erie R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>(2 <em>Sandf. </em>732,) that a party cannot z move for a new trial on a point not taken at the trial, if it be such as might have been obviated by proof, if it h'ad been raised; and the decisions of the same chief justice in <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>(3 <em>Sandf. </em>341,) and of Judge Duer, in <em>Stoddard </em>V. <em>Long Island R. R. Co., </em>(5 <em>Sandf. </em>180,) that objection to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the charge cannot he taken for the first time on the motion for a new trial, are correct. I am aware that the court, in the last two cases, suggest that a different rule obtains in .the Supreme Court. I have not been referred to, and am unable to find any case, in that court establishing a different rule. It is true, that court has established the exception above referred to, but I do not understand this court to repudiate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">There may possibly be another exception to the rule, (although I do not regard it as well settled,) which is, where the judge charges correctly, but the language used is such as tends to mislead, and has, in fact, misled the jury. This may be admitted as an exception, on the ground that it cannot be ascertained that the jury has been misled until after the rendition of the verdict, at which time an objection comes too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Thus, upon authority, the general rule is well settled, that on a motion for a new trial on a case, the court will entertain no objection not raised at the trial; and the exception to it, that they will entertain an objection, which, if taken, could not have been obviated; or, in other words, an objection by reason whereof the party obtaining the verdict can, in no possible event, and under no possible circumstances, be entitled to it in that action, is also well settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The rule, it appears to me, is based on sound principles. To allow a verdict to be set aside for errors in the admission or rejection of testimony, or in charging or not charging the jury, where such errors were in no manner pointed out, suggested or objected to on the trial, would not only be unfair to the judge who tried the cause, but would tend to lead some counsel to suffer error to be committed for the purpose'of setting aside a verdict, if it should happen to be unfavorable, and others to prepare themselves, negligently depending upon their general ability to put in, or offer to put 'in, such evidence as should, in any aspect of the case, be sufficient, and, if the verdict be against them, then em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ploy other counsel to pick out flaws on which to obtain a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Although a party may have no right to urge an objection not taken at the trial, still the court may possibly, in a case . o\u00ed gross injustice, of its own motion, set aside a verdict, for objections not taken at the trial. Indeed, in one case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>(12 <em>Wend. </em>492,) the Supreme Court went further, and set aside a nonsuit, and ordered a new trial, although they held that the nonsuit was properly granted; and this was done for the reason, as stated in the opinion, that the plaintiffs had fallen into an error in their construction of the statute, and might have a good cause of action in point of fact. There is stated in the head note, but not in the opinion, the additional reason, that the court has reason to believe that without such relief the cause of action would be lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">I do not propose to discuss the subject as to what power a court possesses in granting new trials, of their own motion ; whether it is a wholly unrestricted power, or whether there are any, and, if so, what restrictions. It is sufficient to say, that this case does not present such features as to call on the court to exercise, on its own motion, any prerogative it may have. The main issue in the case, viz. abandonment, was properly submitted to the jury, and I see no reason for disturbing their verdict on that issue. With reference to the issue of non-completion by the day, there was no proof of any damages arising therefrom, and, therefore, there was nothing to submit to the jury. On the issue as to unworkmanlike and unskillful performance, (on the decision of which issue, that of payment to the extent of the value of the work necessarily depends,) there was general evidence on the. part of the plaintiffs that the work was done in a workmanlike manner, and was better than ordinary work; while, on the part of the defendants, there was general evidence that the work was rough, and not workmanlike. The only matters particularized, however, were that, by the settling of one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>piers, a stone was broken, causing a damage, according to the defendants, of $30 or $40; according to the plaintiffs, about $5.50; and by reason of bad workmanship a chimney had to be taken down and rebuilt, at a cost of $15.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The plaintiffs admit the settling of pier, but say it was the fault of the ground, for which they are not accountable; and they deny that any of their work had to be taken down and rebuilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">There is a conflict of testimony; the plaintiffs are just as likely to be correct as the defendants. Indeed, the jury having, on another issue, the conflicting testimony on which was left to them, found for the plaintiffs, it is but fair to assume, in considering whether the court should, of its own motion, take action, that the plaintiffs are more likely to be correct on this issue than the defendants, and that the jury, if it had have been left to them, would have so found. Conceding that the court can, of its own motion, interpose and grant a new trial for objections not taken at the trial, the circumstances of this case do not call for the exercise of such power; if they do, there is no case in which the court might not be called on to exercise such power, for a weaker case than this can scarcely be imagined.-</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">I am of opinion, for the reasons assigned, that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
