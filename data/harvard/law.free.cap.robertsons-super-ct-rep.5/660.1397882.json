This action was bronght by Max Maretzek, the manager of an opera in the city of New York, against the defendants, William Cauldwell and Horace P. Whitney, publishers, editors and proprietors of <em>The Sunday </em>Mercury, a weekly paper published in the city of New York, to recover damages for two articles published therein, in October, 1863. The first article ivas headed \u201c The disgrace of the opera,\u201d and it described the opera of the plaintiff as being frequented by vicious and immoral persons, and being such an exhibition as respectable women could not patronize. The second article, which was set forth as a second cause of, action, was entitled \u201c The Academy of Music under a cloud\u2014Sin in high places.\u201d This article made the same charges with more particularity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-10\">The cause was tried,'at a trial term of the court, at which, upon the impanelling, of the jury, the plaintiff\" challenged a juror named Meyer for principal cause, upon the ground that he was \u201copposed'to theatrical representations.\u201d The juror was upon that challenge excluded by the court, and upon 'the trial the jury rendered a verdict for $1000 in favor of the plaintiff Upon this ground, among others, the defendants moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b668-11\"><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeF\">If the case on which this motion was made be correct, there was a fatal error committed on the former trial. A juror, (Meyer,) after a challenge of him by the counsel for the defendants had been withdrawn, was 'challenged by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel for principal cause, which challenge was passed upon by the court. The juror having stated that \u201che was opposed to theatrical representations,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s counsel claimed that he was.incompetent, and requested the court to exclude him; to which the counsel for the defendants objected. The court excluded the juror, and another was impaniielled in his stead; to which decision and course the counsel for the defendants- excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Such an opinion, entertained by the juror, did not show either such relations to either party, or such bias and in-comp\u00b0etency, on account of a. fixed opinion, as amounted in law, to an absolute conclusive prejudging of the matters in issue in this action, so as to constitute a principal cause of challenge, and was therefore at most only a ground of challenge <em>to the favor </em>to be tried in the usual mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">There must, therefore, be a new trial on the case, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
