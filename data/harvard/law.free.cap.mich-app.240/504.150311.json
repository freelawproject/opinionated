In its written judgment, the trial court found that plaintiff\u2019s injury did not meet the no-fault \u201cthreshold\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, plaintiff contended that the trial court erred in dismissing his claim. We concluded that the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition without making the findings required under MCL 500.3135(2)(a); MSA 24.13135(2)(a), which provides in pertinent part that the issue whether an injured person has suffered serious impairment of body function is a question of law for the court if the court finds that \u201c[t]here is no factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the person\u2019s injuries.\u201d We remanded this case to the trial court, instructing the court to make appropriate findings concerning whether there is a factual dispute with respect to whether plaintiff\u2019s impairment affects his \u201cgeneral ability to lead his . . . normal life.\u201d <em>May v </em>Sommerfield, 239 Mich App 197, 202-203; 607 NW2d 422 (1999); MCL 500.3135(1); MSA 24.13135(1), MCL 500.3135(2)(a); MSA 24.13135(2)(a), MCL 500.3135(7); MSA 24.13135(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In its written findings after remand, the trial court admittedly changed its original finding that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>suffered an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function, stating that \u201c[t]here is no objective manifestation of the ir\\juiy the plaintiff now complains of aside from his subjective complaint of pain.\u201d Nonetheless, the court concluded that even if it had found that plaintiff had such an objectively manifested injury, \u201cit would have found that there is no genuine issue of material factual dispute that the impairment does not affect plaintiffs \u2018general ability to lead his . . . normal life.\u2019 \u201d The plain language of MCL 500.3135(7); MSA 24.13135(7) defines a serious impairment of body function in subjective terms, i.e., as an impairment that \u201caffects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d The trial court properly compared plaintiff\u2019s lifestyle before and after the accident in determining whether a factual dispute existed with respect to the extent of plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> See MCL 500.3135(1); MSA 24.13135(1) (\u201c[a] person remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic loss caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the injured person has suffered . . . serious impairment of body function . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
