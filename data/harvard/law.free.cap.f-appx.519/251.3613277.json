He challenges the application of the eight-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) for having been previously removed after an aggravated-felony conviction. The enhancement was based on his Texas retaliation and federal illegal reentry convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">We review a preserved challenge to the application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and have assumed, without deciding, that <em>de novo </em>review applies to Mendoza Zamora\u2019s claim of error. <em>See United States v. Medina-Torres, </em>703 F.3d 770, 773 (5th Cir.2012). Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) provides an eight-level enhancement of the offense level if the defendant was previously deported after an aggravated-felony conviction. We employ the categorical approach to determine whether a conviction meets the definition of an aggravated felony by examining the statute of conviction rather than the underlying facts. <em>Id. </em>at 774. \u201cWhere the statute of conviction contains a series of disjunctive elements, at least one of which may not qualify as an aggravated felony, we employ a modified categorical approach to determine whether the particular crime for which the defendant was convicted constitutes an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Under that approach, we are \u201c \u2018limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Aggravated felony is defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 3(A). An aggravated felony includes \u201can offense described in section 1325(a) or 1326 of ... title [8] committed by an alien who was previously deported on the basis of a conviction for an offense described in another subparagraph of ... paragraph [43].\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(O). Section 1326(a) prohibits an alien from reentering the United States after he has been removed. A twenty-year statutory maximum applies to an alien \u201cwhose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\u201d \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Thus, a conviction for illegal reentry under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is an aggravated felony within the meaning of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(O). <em>See United States v. Gamboa-Garcia, </em>620 F.3d 546, 548 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">Mendoza Zamora was previously convicted of illegal reentry; the judgment cited \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) as the statute of conviction. The retaliation conviction was the underlying aggravated felony used to characterize the illegal-reentry conviction as one under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). We need not determine whether Mendoza Zamora can relitigate that characterization, because he does not explicitly argue that his illegal-reentry conviction is not an aggravated felony because its underlying retaliation conviction is' not an aggravated felony. Mendoza Zamora is represented by coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>sel, so he is not entitled to a liberal construction of his arguments. <em>See Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">As to Mendoza Zamora\u2019s contention that there was no Shepard-approved evidence establishing that the illegal-reentry conviction was under \u00a7 1826(b)(2), such evidence was not required. By relying on the citation to \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in the prior illegal-reentry judgment to conclude that that conviction was under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), the district court properly used the judgment to establish the existence of the prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 449-50 n. 1 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Neri-Hernandes, </em>504 F.3d 587, 591-92 (5th Cir.2007). Because this conviction constituted an aggravated felony within the meaning of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(O), the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in enhancing the sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
