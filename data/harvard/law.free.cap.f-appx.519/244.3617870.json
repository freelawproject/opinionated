He asserts that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on its determination that his prior Texas burglary-of-a-habitation conviction was a crime of violence. Specifically, he argues that his conviction was not for generic burglary because the Texas Penal Code uniquely includes burglary convictions under a \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Because he objected to the enhancement in the district court on this ground, we review the issue <em>de novo. See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). We agree with the panel that recently rejected this contention, finding persuasive its reasoning that \u201c[mjerely maintaining an inferior possesso-ry interest in a habitation does not extinguish the potential violence that may result when a person enters a habitation with the intent to commit theft.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Joslin, 487 Fed.Appx. 139, 141-43 (5th Cir.2012). <em>See also United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.2013) (affirming on plain-error review a 16-level sentencing enhancement under Section 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based on a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation under Texas Penal Code Section 30.02(a)(1)). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
