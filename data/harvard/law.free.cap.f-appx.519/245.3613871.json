Its order explained that Saldivar had fourteen days to file an itemized request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Saldivar filed that request fifteen days later, on July 7, 2012. Defendant Erick Rodela responded on July 16, 2012, contending in part that Saldivar\u2019s request was untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 20, 2012, Rodela filed a notice of appeal \u201cfrom a final order entered in this action on June 22, 2012.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The district court awarded fees and costs in an order dated October 10, 2012. Rodela did not file a notice of appeal from that order. Rodela now contends that because Saldivar\u2019s motion was untimely, the district court abused its discretion by partially granting her request for fees and costs. Because Rodela did not appeal from the October 10 order, we lack jurisdiction to resolve this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1)(B) provides that a \u201cnotice of appeal must ... designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That requirement is jurisdictional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cWhere the appellant notices the appeal of a specified judgment only or a part thereof, ... this [Cjourt has no jurisdiction to review other judgments or issues which are not expressly referred to and which are not impliedly intended for appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the district court\u2019s June 22, 2010 order <em>mentioned </em>costs and fees, the court did not <em>award </em>costs and fees until several months after Rodela filed his notice of appeal. And while Rodela did not appeal until briefing on cost- and fee-shifting was complete, he \u201ccould not have intended to appeal the [cost- and fee-shifting] <em>ruling </em>in [his] notice[ ] of appeal because the [cost- and fee-shifting] order had not yet been made at the time the notice[] of appeal [was] filed.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore DISMISS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
