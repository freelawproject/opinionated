He claims that his prior offense, under Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Penal Code \u00a7 22.01, assault of a family-member, is not a crime involving moral turpitude, rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal. He suggests that his assault conviction was for reckless rather than intentional conduct. He argues that his assault offense did not involve moral turpitude because \u00a7 22.01(a) requires only bodily injury rather than serious bodily injury as an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We apply a two-part standard of review to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Chancoy-To-noc committed a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Amouzadeh v. Winfrey, </em>467 F.3d 451, 455 (5th Cir.2006). First, we accord substantial deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its definition of the phrase \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, we review de novo whether the elements of a state or federal crime fit the BIA\u2019s definition of a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>The BIA\u2019s determination of what constitutes moral turpitude must be upheld if it is reasonable. <em>Hamdan v. INS, </em>98 F.3d 183, 185 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Since \u00a7 22.01 has multiple subsections and is phrased in the disjunctive, such that some violations of the statute would involve moral turpitude and others not, this court has found that \u00a7 22.01 is not categorically a crime involving moral turpitude. Esp<em>arza-Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>699 F.3d 821, 825 (5th Cir.2012). Using the modified categorical approach, we must review the record of conviction to determine whether Chancoy-Tonoc\u2019s offense falls into a subsection that is a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Amouzadeh, </em>467 F.3d at 455. Under Texas law, a person commits the offense of assault if he \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to another, including the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) (West 2011). The record of conviction reveals that Chancoy-Tonoc was convicted under \u00a7 22.01(a)(1). The charging instrument tracks the language of that subsection, stating that Chancoy-Tonoc \u201cintentionally and knowingly cause[d] bodily injury to\u201d the victim, \u201ca member of the Defendant\u2019s family ... by GRABBING [HER] WITH HIS HAND ... by BITING [HER] ... [and] by PULLING [HER] WITH HIS HAND.\u201d As the record shows that Chancoy-Tonoc was convicted of intentionally inflicting bodily injury on a member of his family, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that his assault offense was a crime involving moral turpitude was reasonable. <em>See Esparza-Rodr\u00edguez, </em>699 F.3d at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
