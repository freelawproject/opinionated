He contends that the district court erred by imposing a sixteen-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2 based on his conviction of statutory rape under Georgia Code Annotated \u00a7 16-6-3(a) (2005). He particularly argues that his offense does not satisfy the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of the enumerated offenses of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d or \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because the statute of conviction prescribes a three-year age differential between the victim and the defendant, rather than four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-22\">The sole argument raised by Ramirez-Loarca is foreclosed by <em>United, States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc). There, we applied a \u201cplain-meaning\u201d approach to determine the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d and \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and concluded that the generic definitions of those offense categories do not include any specific age differential. <em>Id. </em>at 561-62 &amp; n. 28. We expressly rejected the claim that the statute at issue\u2014 \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Texas Penal Code \u2014 did not satisfy the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because the statute prescribed a three-year instead of a four-year age differential between the victim and the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 562 n. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In light of <em>Rodriguez, </em>Ramirez-Loarea has not shown that it was error for the district court to impose a sixteen-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 based on his conviction of statutory rape under \u00a7 16 \u2014 6\u2014 3(a). Thus, the judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
