He also requests an evidentiary hearing, appointment of counsel, and in-junctive relief. The district court dismissed his action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Conklin is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We review the dismissal of the complaint de novo, accepting the facts alleged in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>See Green v. Atkinson, </em>623 F.3d 278, 279 (5th Cir.2010). Conklin has not demonstrated that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim based on a finding that he failed to allege an actual injury. <em>See Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002); <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Accordingly, we do not reach Conklin\u2019s arguments concerning the district court\u2019s alternative grounds for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Because Conklin has not demonstrated that his appeal would involve a nonfrivo-lous issue, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. His requests for an evidentiary hearing, appointment of counsel, and injunctive relief are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Conk-lin\u2019s suit and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous each count as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Conklin has two other strikes. <em>See Conklin v. Gutierrez, </em>No. 2:12-CV-20 (S.D.Tex. Apr. 19, 2012); <em>Conklin v. Walters, </em>70 Fed.Appx. 491 (10th Cir.2003). As Conklin now has at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is advised that he is no longer allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; \u00a7 1915(g) SANCTION BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
