He raises an argument that he concedes is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410 (5th Cir.2013), which held that Texas\u2019s definition of \u201cowner\u201d did not take the Texas crime of burglary of a habitation outside the generic definition of the enumerated crime of violence of burglary of a dwelling under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The appellant\u2019s motion for summary disposition is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
