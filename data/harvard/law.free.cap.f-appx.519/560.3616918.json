After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">On appeal, Price does not challenge the district court\u2019s revocation of her supervised release or argue that her 10-month sentence, to be served consecutive to her state sentence, is substantively unreasonable. Rather, on appeal, Price\u2019s sole argument is that the district court committed procedural error because it erroneously believed that the pertinent Sentencing Guidelines policy statement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.3(f), addressing the propriety of imposing a consecutive sentence, was mandatory. Price contends that, had the district court realized that \u00a7 7B 1.3(f) is only advisory, the court likely would have imposed a concurrent or partially concurrent sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-17\">Section 7B 1.3(f) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-18\">Any term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of probation or supervised release shall be ordered to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>served consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving, whether or not the sentence of imprisonment being served resulted from the conduct that is the basis of the revocation of probation or supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.3(f). Although \u00a7 7B1.3(f) uses the word \u201cshall,\u201d all of the policy statements in Chapter 7 that govern sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release are non-binding. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 7 Pt. A; <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">As her sole argument, Price points to a comment by the district court early in the revocation hearing. Specifically, the government advocated for a ten-month sentence to run consecutive to the undischarged sentences for Price\u2019s state court convictions. The district court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvS\">Well, I think it has to run consecutive. But Mr. Korchin [addressing Price\u2019s counsel], it makes sense to me. I don\u2019t think \u2014 you know, I thought your client was doing well on supervised release and did for almost four years and then at the end messed up. But it probably might be best for her to just get the ten months, get it over with and not have any supervised release after the fact. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">What are you feeling on it?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Price\u2019s counsel then stated that Price\u2019s violations were grade C violations, so revocation was not required, and the district court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Taken as a whole, the record of the revocation proceedings clearly reflects that the district court did not view the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.3(f) as mandatory. In fact, the district court agreed with Price\u2019s counsel that it was not required to revoke supervised release at all. The district court then listened without objecting as Price\u2019s counsel noted that the state court had expressed hope that Price\u2019s federal sentence would run concurrent to her state sentence. The district court also heard Price\u2019s alternatives to the government\u2019s request for a consecutive ten-month sentence, which included imposing a sentence of time served, or running her federal sentence concurrent to what remained of her state sentence. The district court listened to these options without disagreement, except for noting that a sentence of time served would not be possible because Price had not served time following her revocation of her supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The district court also listened as the government argued that Price\u2019s alternatives were not appropriate because Price committed her second violation (of shoplifting) shortly after she had committed her first violation (of shoplifting) and had been placed back on supervised release. Finally, the district court listened as Price herself addressed the court and asked for her sentence to run concurrent to her state sentence. The district court responded by thanking Price for her comments. In other words, despite the fact that the parties\u2019 arguments as to the appropriate sentence assumed the district court had the discretion to impose something other than a consecutive sentence, the district court never stated that it was bound by the Sentencing Guidelines to impose a consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Only when the one statement Price identifies is viewed in isolation does it suggest that the district court believed itself constrained to impose a sentence consecutive to Price\u2019s state sentence. When read in context and as part of the record as a whole, however, the statement reflects nothing more than the district court\u2019s acknowledgment of, and in this instance agreement with, the Sentencing Commission\u2019s recommendation in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.3(f) that a sentence imposed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>revocation of supervised release should be served consecutive to any prison term the defendant is already serving. See <em>United States v. Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1319 n. 6 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that a district court\u2019s ambiguous oral statements must be read in context with the district courts acts and, \u201cif possible, are interpreted to be consistent with (and not inconsistent with) the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-10\">. We ordinarily review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness using the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). The government contends that we should review Price's claim for plain error because she failed to raise her procedural error during the revocation hearing. We need not resolve this issue because under either preserved or plain error review, Price\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
