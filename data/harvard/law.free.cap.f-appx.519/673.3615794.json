We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Smith\u2019s suit alleged prison officials deprived him of a constitutionally-protected liberty interest in failing to comply with Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) policy when he challenged information in his administrative prison file. Specifically, Smith\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim is premised on the following theory. First, Smith claims BOP Program Statement 5800.11(15)(e) (Sept. 8, 1997) confers a liberty interest in providing that when an inmate challenges information in his file, prison officials \u201cshall\u201d \u2014 which is to say <em>must </em>\u2014 \u201ctake reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of challenged information.\u201d In Smith\u2019s view, the mandatory nature of this procedural scheme confers a liberty interest for purposes of procedural due process. Second, Smith alleges prison officials deprived him of 5800.11(15)(c)\u2019s liberty interest by failing to \u201ctake any reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy\u201d of information in his file \u201cbefore using such information against [him].\u201d According to Smith, prison officials used inaccurate information against him when they deemed him unsuitable \u201cfor placement at a Minimum facility.\u201d <em>(Id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The district court did not err in dismissing Smith\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Smith\u2019s due process <em>Bivens </em>theory requires alleging not only the deprivation of a liberty interest, but also that such deprivation \u201cimpose[d] atypical and significant hardship\u201d relative \u201cto the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 2300, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). As pleaded, however, Smith\u2019s complaint alleges only that he was denied placement in a less-secure prison as a result of the purported deprivation. Absent extraordinary circumstances, such a denial does not amount to an \u201catypical\u201d or \u201csignificant hardship.\u201d <em>See id.; cf. Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 494, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 1264, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980) (concluding that \u201cthe stigmatizing consequences of a transfer to a mental hospital for involuntary psychiatric treatment\u201d and \u201cmandatory behavior modification as a treatment for mental illness, constitute the kind of deprivations of liberty that requires procedural protections\u201d). Accordingly, Smith\u2019s complaint fails to state a cognizable <em>Bivens </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing Smith\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">. <em>Bivens v.

Although <em>pro se </em>pleadings are construed liberally, <em>Tannenbaum v.
