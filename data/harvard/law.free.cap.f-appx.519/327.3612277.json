He argues that the district court erred when it treated his claims as falling under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or habe-as corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">District courts are directed to screen complaints filed by prisoners in civil actions and dismiss a complaint if it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). We review such dismissals de novo, accepting the facts alleged in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Green v. Atkinson, </em>623 F.3d 278, 279 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">To the extent that Stanko relies on the Declaratory Judgment Act to challenge the prohibition against his possession of a firearm and ammunition imposed after he was convicted of violating the Federal Meat Inspection Act, he fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted. <em>See Johnson v. Onion, </em>761 F.2d 224, 226 (5th Cir.1985). Further, to the extent that he asserts a claim for declaratory relief that in effect attacks the constitutionality of the conviction and sentence imposed for violating the Federal Meat Inspection Act and he has not shown that his conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, he fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 643-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 190-91 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Stanko\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
