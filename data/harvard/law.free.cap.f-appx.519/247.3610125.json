He sought modification of his sentence based on Amendment 750 (amending crack cocaine Drug Quantity Table; made retroactive by Guideline \u00a7 lB1.10(c)) to the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. (Johnson\u2019s sentence had been reduced earlier pursuant to a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-18\">For this second motion, Johnson contends: the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or his post-sentencing conduct; and, its determination that he poses a danger to society is \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-24\">A decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). In determining whether to reduce a sentence, the district court first ascertains whether defendant is eligible for a reduction and the extent of the reduction authorized. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). If so, the court considers any applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determines whether the authorized reduction is warranted in whole, or in part, under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 2692. In addition to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court \u201cshall consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment\u201d and \u201cmay consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, n. l(B)(i-iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-27\">The district court \u201cwas under no obligation to reduce [Johnson\u2019s] sentence\u201d. <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. The court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as Johnson\u2019s record of post-sentencing rehabilitation and the danger he posed to the community; therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, 55 </em>F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-28\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
