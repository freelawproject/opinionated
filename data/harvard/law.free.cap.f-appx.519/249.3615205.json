In his application seeking asylum or withholding of removal, he asserted that his family was verbally threatened by ethnic Albanians multiple times because his father had worked with the Serbians for 25 years and that, after he left Kosovo, ethnic Albanians shot at his father and uncle on one occasion and kidnapped his father and uncle for several days on three other occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Shoshi argues that, based upon the persecution of his family members, he has established a well-founded fear of future persecution. He may not rely solely upon the treatment of his family members to support his asylum claim. <em>See Arif v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 677, 681 n. 15 (5th Cir.2007). Moreover, the reasonableness of Shoshi\u2019s fears of future persecution is diminished because Shoshi\u2019s family members continue to live unharmed in Kosovo. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 193 (5th Cir.2004). He has therefore failed to show that \u201cthe evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). As Shoshi failed to satisfy the asylum standard, he cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Eduard, </em>379 F.3d at 186 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">His petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
