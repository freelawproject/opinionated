No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that Perez was not entitled to equitable tolling of the statutory period because he had not demonstrated diligence in pursuing his rights. The district court then granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to whether Perez\u2019s claim was time-barred and whether equitable tolling should have applied. On appeal, Perez does not dispute that the one-year limitation period had expired, but argues that the limitation period should be equitably tolled because he exercised due diligence and extraordinary circumstances prevented him from timely filing his federal petition. The extraordinary circumstances that Perez asserts include his illiteracy, ignorance of the law, <em>pro se </em>status, lack of English-language proficiency, and dependence on the assistance of inmate law clerks. Additionally, he asserts that the prison employees\u2019 harassment of other inmates who were assisting him with his habeas petition presented him from timely filing. He also asserts, for the first time on appeal, that the prison\u2019s lack of Spanish-language legal materials prevented him from timely filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely. <em>See Hepburn v. Moore, </em>215 F.3d 1208, 1209 (11th Cir.2000). We also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of equitable tolling of the statutory period. <em>Chavez v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>647 F.3d 1057, 1060 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1018, 181 L.Ed.2d 752 (2012). However, we do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1265 (11th Cir.2000) (involving a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petitioner). We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and will affirm the findings of fact unless \u201cthe record lacks substantial evidence\u201d to support the determinations. <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). A determination regarding whether a party exercised diligence is a-factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), as amended by the AEDPA, a \u00a7 2254 petition is governed by a one-year statute of limitations that begins to run on the latest of four triggering events, one of which being the date on which a judgment of conviction becomes final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The one-year limitation period for filing a \u00a7 2254 petition is tolled while a properly filed application for state post-conviction review is pending. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Here, the parties do not dispute that the one-year limitations period had expired, and Perez concedes that his federal habeas petition was untimely. ' Thus, the only issue on appeal is the applicability of equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">The statute of limitations may be equitably tolled only when a petitioner shows (1) that he pursued his rights diligently, and (2) \u201cthat some extraordinary circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>stance\u201d prevented a timely filing. <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562,177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (quoting <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 1814, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005)). Equitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy that is limited to rare and exceptional circumstances. <em>Hunter v. Ferrell, </em>587 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, its application requires flexibility and review on a case-by-case basis. <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 2563. The petitioner seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of showing that it is warranted. <em>Hunter, </em>587 F.3d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Although we have characterized the equitable tolling standard as a two-part test, requiring a defendant to establish both extraordinary circumstances and due diligence, courts need not consider whether extraordinary circumstances exist if a petitioner\u2019s delay in filing the federal habeas petition exhibits a lack of due diligence. <em>Diaz v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>362 F.3d 698, 702 &amp; n. 7 (11th Cir.2004) (expressly refusing to consider Diaz\u2019s extraordinary circumstances argument in light of his unexplained 532-day delay in filing his \u00a7 2254 petition). We have held that a prisoner was not entitled to equitable tolling where he claimed to have contacted the state court by mail to determine the status of his case, but did not provide any evidence or information about his alleged contact attempts. <em>Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1288-89. We have also held that a prisoner\u2019s failure to set forth grounds to excuse his delay in seeking state habeas relief \u201cprecludes a finding that he exercised due diligence.\u201d <em>See Rivers v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (discussing the due diligence requirement of then 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 6(4), now located at \u00a7 2255(f)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">An inability to understand English does not constitute extraordinary circumstances justifying equitable tolling. <em>United States v. Montano, </em>398 F.3d 1276, 1280 n. 5 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore, we have not accepted a lack of a legal education and related confusion or ignorance about the law as excuses for a failure to file in a timely fashion. <em>See Rivers, </em>416 F.3d at 1323 (stating in the context of a \u00a7 2255 proceeding that lack of an education was no excuse for delayed efforts to vacate a state conviction). As with any litigant, <em>pro se </em>litigants \u201care deemed to know of the one-year statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Outler v. United States, </em>485 F.3d 1273, 1282 n. 4 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">We conclude from the record here that the district court did not clearly err in adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that Perez had not demonstrated diligence in pursuing his rights, as Perez did not set forth grounds to explain or excuse his delay. Even assuming that Perez satisfied the due-diligence requirement, none of the circumstances he alleged before the district court constituted extraordinary circumstances to justify equitable tolling, and we will not consider his newly-raised argument that the prison lacked sufficient Spanish-language legal resources. Accordingly, Perez has not met his burden of showing that equitable tolling is warranted. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying Perez\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
