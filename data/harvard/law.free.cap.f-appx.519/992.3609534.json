He argues on appeal that the district court erred by adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) before the expiration of the 14-day time limit for filing objections. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">We \u201creview for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s treatment of a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation.\u201d <em>Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). A district court abuses its discretion when it \u201chas made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Josendis v. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs, Inc., </em>662 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation omitted). However, we review all appeals \u201cwithout regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111. We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636, a district court may direct a magistrate to prepare an R &amp; R containing proposed findings of fact and a recommended disposition for a disposi-tive motion. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1). The parties have 14 days from the day on which they receive the R &amp; R to file objections. <em>Id. </em>The district court must conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of those portions of the R &amp; R to which an objection is made. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">Under the PLRA, indigent prisoners may proceed with a civil action if they partially pre-pay the filing fee. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1), (b)(l)-(2). However, \u00a7 1915(g), commonly known as the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-18\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1915(g). After the third meritless complaint, a prisoner with three strikes must pay the full filing fee for each additional suit at the time that he initiates the suit. <em>Dupree v. Palmer, </em>284 F.3d 1234, 1236 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">A prisoner who qualifies under imminent danger of serious physical injury at the time that he filed his complaint, however, can proceed IFP. <em>See Medberry v. Butler, </em>185 F.3d 1189, 1192-93 (11th Cir.1999). An allegation of past imminent danger will not invoke this exception. <em>Id. </em>at 1193. In determining whether a prisoner is in imminent danger, we look to the prisoner\u2019s complaint as whole, which must be construed liberally and the allegations of which must be accepted as true. <em>Brown v. Johnson, 387 </em>F.3d 1344, 1350 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">In this case, we agree that the district court procedurally erred by adopting the R &amp; R nine days after the magistrate issued the R &amp; R, and five days before the expiration of the time period for Owens to file objections. The district court also procedurally erred by failing to consider Owens\u2019s timely filed objections, which it received within 14 days of the issuance of the R &amp; R. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1). Nevertheless, the errors did not affect Owens\u2019s substantial rights, because, as we discuss below, Owens\u2019s objections were meritless. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Owens, who had three strikes under the PLRA, needed to show that he was in \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d in order to proceed IFP. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Taking the allegations in his complaint as true, he was assaulted by his cell mate, and various corrections officers refused to intervene. Owens suffered various injuries, including a tear in his stomach lining, as a result. Other officers ignored his specific requests, both before and after the assault, for protective custody based on threats he had received from his cell mate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">However, Owens was transferred out of Okaloosa Cl after filing his complaint. Accordingly, even if he had been in imminent danger of serious physical injury from his cell mate and the failure of prison officials to protect him, that danger had passed. <em>See Medberry, </em>185 F.3d at 1193 (holding that the plaintiff failed to show that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury from being placed in the general population at the prison where he was housed when he filed his complaint, because he had been transferred to another facility since filing the complaint). His allegations of attacks at the facility to which he was transferred were insufficient to invoke the \u201cimminent danger\u201d exception, because he also asserted that prison officials there took action to protect him. An allegation of past imminent danger will not invoke the \u201cimminent danger\u201d exception. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Owens\u2019s objections to the R &amp; R did not demonstrate that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">. Finally, Owens\u2019s request for appointment of counsel on appeal is denied as unwarranted. <em>Kilgo v. Ricks, </em>983 F.2d 189, 193 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
