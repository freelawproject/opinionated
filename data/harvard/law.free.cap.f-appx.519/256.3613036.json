Pando pleaded guilty to violating numerous conditions of his probation and appeals the 36-month prison sentence he received after his probation was revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>A sentence imposed after the revocation of probation must not be \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 496 (5th Cir.2012). To determine whether a sentence is plainly unreasonable, this court \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497 (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is free of procedural error, this court considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">On appeal, Pando argues that the district court proeedurally erred because it did not consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and gave inadequate reasons for its sentence. Because Pando objected only generally to the reasonableness of his sentence, review of the procedural reasonableness of his sentence is for plain error. <em>See Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 497. Given that the district court articulated reasons for its sentence outside the guidelines policy statement range and these reasons addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Pando fails to show that under plain error review his sentence was not proeedurally reasonable. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 497-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Next, Pando disputes the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, asserting that his sentence is excessive and unduly harsh. Because Pando pleaded true to violating numerous conditions of his probation, the district court was authorized to sentence him to a term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2). This court considers the extent of the district court\u2019s deviation from a guidelines policy range, but defers to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. <em>Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 500. In light of the district court\u2019s previous leniency and Pan-do\u2019s conduct in getting arrested while on probation and failing on multiple occasions to abide by the terms of his probation, the district court\u2019s decision to revoke Pando\u2019s probation and sentence him to 36 months in prison was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 499-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
