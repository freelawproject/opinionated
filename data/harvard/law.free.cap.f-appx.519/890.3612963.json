Relator James Dent Nunnally brought this action against his former employer, West Calcasieu Cameron Hospital (\u201cWCCH\u201d). The district court found that the complaint lacked sufficient detail regarding the false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>claims actually presented to the Government and dismissed for failure to plead fraud with particularity as required by FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). For the reasons stated herein, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Nunnally filed suit in March 2008 under the <em>qui tam </em>provisions of the FCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government investigated Nunnally\u2019s allegations over a three-year period and eventually declined to intervene. Pursuant to <em>qui tam </em>procedure, the complaint was then unsealed and available for WCCH\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Nunnally alleges that WCCH violated the FCA and the AKS by implementing a scheme to defraud the Government whereby the hospital charged reduced test fees to physicians in return for the physician referring to WCCH all patients in need of laboratory tests, particularly those covered by Medicare. He alleges WCCH then would charge Medicare significantly higher fees than charged to non-Medicare patients for the same tests, thereby resulting in the Government paying thousands of \u201cfalse claims\u201d generated by the illegal inducements. WCCH moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted under Rule 12(b)(6), and for failure to plead fraud with the requisite particularity under Rule 9(b). The district court granted WCCH\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">We review a motion to dismiss under Rule 9(b) and Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>See Frank v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>314 F.3d 195, 197 (5th Cir.2002) (Rule 12(b)(6)); <em>Shushany v. Allwaste, Inc., </em>992 F.2d 517, 520 (5th Cir.1993) (Rule 9(b)). Rule 12(b)(6) allows dismissal if a plaintiff fails \u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). To withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Cory. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Claims brought under the FCA are fraud claims that must also comply with the supplemental pleading requirements of Rule 9(b), demanding that \u201ca party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b); <em>see United States ex rel. Longhi v. Lithium Power Techs., Inc., </em>575 F.3d 458, 468 (5th Cir.2009). Traditionally, we have held that pleading fraud with particularity requires that \u201c[a]t a minimum ... a plaintiff [must] set forth the \u2018who, what, when, where, and how\u2019 of the alleged fraud.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., </em>125 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.1997) (internal citation omitted). In the context of the FCA, we have explained that Rule 9(b) is \u201ccontext specific and flexible,\u201d and noted that a plaintiff may sufficiently state a claim with particularity \u201cwithout including all the details of any single court-articulated stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>dard \u2014 it depends on the elements of the claim in hand.\u201d <em>Grubbs, </em>565 F.3d at 189-90.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Nunnally argues that our decision in <em>Grubbs </em>absolves <em>qui tam </em>relators of the heightened pleading requirements under Rule 9(b) and in the FCA itself. To the contrary, <em>Grubbs </em>reaffirms the importance of Rule 9(b) in FCA claims, while explaining that a relator may demonstrate a strong inference of fraud without necessitating that the relator detail the particular bill. <em>See </em>565 F.3d at 190. We established that a relator could, in some circumstances, satisfy Rule 9(b) by providing factual or statistical evidence to strengthen the inference of fraud beyond mere possibility, without necessarily providing details as to <em>each </em>false claim. <em>Id. </em>This standard nonetheless requires the relator to provide other reliable indications of fraud and to plead a level of detail that demonstrates that an alleged scheme likely resulted in bills submitted for government payment. <em>Id. </em>Significantly, the complaint in <em>Grubbs </em>rested on the relator\u2019s actual description of a solicitation by two of the defendants to the relator to participate in an elaborate scheme to defraud the government, the particulars of which were there alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Nunnally\u2019s complaint, by contrast, is broad and sweeping, providing no indicia of any actual knowledge of any FCA-violating fraud.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A generous reading of his complaint discloses an allegation that WCCH engaged in a practice of making false certifications of compliance with the AKS. The AKS is a criminal statute prohibiting the knowing or willful offering to pay, or soliciting, any remuneration to induce the referral of an individual for items or services that may be paid for by a federal health care program. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(l-2); <em>Thompson, </em>125 F.3d at 901. A violation of the AKS can serve as the basis for a FCA claim when the Government has conditioned payment of a claim upon the claimant\u2019s certification of compliance with the statute, and the claimant falsely certifies compliance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Thompson, </em>125 F.3d at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Nunnally alleges WCCH violated the AKS by inducing physicians to provide improper referrals for lab services. The elements of the AKS violation must also be pleaded with particularity under Rule 9(b), because they are brought as a FCA claim. <em>See Bennett, </em>747 F.Supp.2d at 760, 783-785. Nunnally\u2019s complaint merely offers sweeping and conclusory allegations of \u201cverbal agreements\u201d between WCCH and \u201cvarious physicians,\u201d without a shred of detail or particularity. We are given no information on the contents of those agreements, the identity of any physicians, actual inducements, or improper referrals. The sole \u201cspecificity\u201d in the complaint is an \u201cexample\u201d of an agreement to charge physicians $3.60 for a blood test, while later charging Medicare $10.60 for the same test. This \u201cexample\u201d is insufficient because it does not allege, nor reliably indicate, that the two differing pay scales constitute \u201cremuneration\u201d to the physicians. It does not even indicate that these amounts are real rather than hypothetical. The complaint does not specify who in particular was involved in this \u201cagreement,\u201d or how it constituted an illegal kickback.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Moreover, actual inducement is an element of the AKS violation, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(l-2), and Nunnally must provide reliable indicia that there was a kickback provided in turn for the referral of patients. This requires pleading that WCCH knowingly paid remuneration to specific physicians in exchange for referrals. Nunnally\u2019s complaint fails to allege any particular details of any actual referral by a physician who entered an agreement with WCCH, or even to offer a time period more distinguishing than \u201c[s]ince approximately 1992 and continuing to date.\u201d The complaint merely states that \u201c[r]elator estimates that during [sic] past six years [WCCH] has submitted thousands of such overstated claims ... causing Medicare to pay in excess of $4,000,000,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Finally, Nunnally fails to allege with particularity an actual certification to the Government that was a prerequisite to obtaining the government benefit. <em>See Thowipson, </em>125 F.3d at 902. According to Nunnally\u2019s complaint, WCCH violated the AKS by \u201cperiodically either certifying] in writing or impliedly certifying] to the Medicare program that it complied with all of Medicare\u2019s program rules, regulations and laws applicable thereto.\u201d Nunnally\u2019s complaint does not identify a single claim submitted by WCCH for services rendered pursuant to an illegal referral, let alone one for which WCCH expressly certified its compliance with federal law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, even if we assume that Nunnally\u2019s allegations of remuneration are sufficient, Nun-nally has pleaded no facts regarding actual Medicare referrals or the billing and payment services provided to any Medicare patient. There is no basis to infer from the complaint that WCCH expressly certi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>fied compliance with the AKS as a part of submitting claims to the Government. Nunnally\u2019s pleadings of an AKS violation are deficient and cannot serve as a basis for FCA liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Additionally, to the extent Nunnally brings separate claims under the FCA premised on presenting false claims, \u00a7 3729(a)(1), or making false records, \u00a7 3729(a)(2), separate from the alleged AKS violation, he again has failed to plead with the requisite particularity as required by <em>Grubbs.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Nunnally\u2019s wholly generalized allegations of false claims presented to the Government do not \u201calleg[e] <em>particular </em>details of a scheme\u201d (emphasis added) and are not \u201cpaired with reliable indicia that lead to a strong inference that [false] claims were actually submitted.\u201d <em>See Grubbs, </em>565 F.3d at 190. We held in <em>Grubbs </em>that the contents of a false claim need not always be presented under this subsection because, given that the Government need not rely on or be damaged by the false claim, \u201cthe contents of the bill are less significant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189. This does not absolve Nunnally of the burden of otherwise sufficiently pleading the time, place, or identity details of the traditional standard, in order to effectuate Rule 9(b)\u2019s function of fair notice and protection from frivolous suits. <em>See id. </em>at 190. Nunnally\u2019s allegations of a scheme to submit fraudulent claims are entirely conelusory, do not offer factual information with sufficient indicia of reliability, and do not demonstrate a strong inference that the claims were presented to the Government in violation of \u00a7 3729(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Further, \u00a7 3729(a)(2) \u201crequires [] that a defendant made a false record or statement for the purpose of getting a false or fraudulent claim paid by the Government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192. \u201c[T]he recording of a false record, when it is made with the requisite intent, is enough to satisfy the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Grubbs, </em>the relator alleged several specific incidents where doctors admitted to \u201cwriting] notes\u201d concerning physician visits that did not actually take place. <em>Id. </em>Nunnally\u2019s complaint does not contain any detail of comparable particularity. He merely alleges there was \u201cwritten and/or implied certification to the Medicare program that it was in compliance with all of the Medicare\u2019s program rules.\u201d He points to no specific instance of such a record or statement. As Nunnally has not met his burden under Rule 9(b), his claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-7\">. The FCA's <em>qui tam </em>provisions permit a private individual, as a relator, to sue on the United States\u2019 behalf to recover for false claims for payment submitted to the Government. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730; <em>United States ex rel. Williams v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., </em>417 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\">. Rule 9(b)'s requirement for pleading with particularity provides a \"screening function\u201d to ensure that the case has not been brought for frivolous reasons. <em>United States ex rel. Grubbs v. Kanneganti, </em>565 F.3d 180, 186 (5th Cir.2009). The heightened pleading standard for fraud claims supplies defendants with the information they need to prepare responses, prevents discovery intended as a mere fishing expedition, and protects the defendants' reputations from baseless allegations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b919-6\">. In <em>Grubbs, </em>we noted that the oft-quoted \"time, place, contents, and identity\u201d standard originated in common-law fraud and securities fraud cases, where that application of Rule 9(b) directly tracks the elements of those claims. 565 F.3d at 188. Given that the FCA does not include elements of reliance and damages, \"the statute is remedial and exposes even unsuccessful false claims to liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189. Therefore, \"a claim under the [FCA] and a claim under common law or securities fraud are not on the same plane in meeting the requirement of 'stat[ing] with particularity\u2019 the <em>contents of the fraudulent misrepresentation.\u2019\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Nonetheless, the pleading standard for FCA claims remains higher than what is required under Rule 8 alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b919-7\">.

The district court properly applied the preF-ERA version because Nunnally filed this suit in March 2008, before the date of FERA\u2019s enactment. <em>See United States ex rel. Bennett v.
