The district court denied McDonald\u2019s first motion to reduce on the ground that he was a career offender and ineligible for a reduction of his sentence, <em>see United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012), and McDonald did not appeal that decision. The decision that the district court lacked authority to reduce McDonald\u2019s sentence is the law of the case, <em>see United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997), and McDonald does not challenge that binding decision. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying McDonald\u2019s renewed motion to reduce, which duplicated the argument made in McDonald\u2019s first motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">We AFFIRM the denial of McDonald\u2019s second motion to reduce.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
