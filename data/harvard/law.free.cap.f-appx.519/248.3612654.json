By moving for IFP status, McPherson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">McPherson\u2019s brief contends only in general terms that his claims are not frivolous. He does not address, however, the certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith or any of the district court\u2019s reasons, <em>see Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202, so his challenge to the certification is deemed abandoned, <em>see Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Thus, McPherson has not shown that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-21\">The motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal by the district court and the dismissal of the appeal both count as strikes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir. 1996). Thus, McPherson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
