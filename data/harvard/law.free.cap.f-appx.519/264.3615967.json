He maintains that because his prior conspiracy conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 does not require an overt act, the prior conviction does not comport with the generic, contemporary meaning of conspiracy, and the prior conviction should not have been used as a basis for the 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We review Cortinas-Aldape\u2019s arguments for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 753 (5th Cir.2012). The prior conviction used to support the enhancement in this case was based on 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841. In considering whether a prior federal conviction for conspiracy to commit a drug trafficking offense will justify an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(I), we need look no further than the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 753-54. We have held in this situation that the \u201cGuidelines themselves, reasonably interpreted,\u201d support the enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 754. Accordingly, the district court in this case did not err, plain or otherwise, in applying the enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 754-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
