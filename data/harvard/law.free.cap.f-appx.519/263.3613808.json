Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Kennedy has failed to provide argument that addresses the district court\u2019s reasons for denying his Rule 59(e) motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Where an appellant does not identify error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if he had not appealed at all. <em>Brinkmann v. Dall. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Kennedy has not addressed the basis for the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, he has abandoned any challenge thereto. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999). The appeal is frivolous and is therefore DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Kennedy\u2019s motion to appeal IFP is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
