United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), and <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>560 U.S. 563, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). Stall-ings\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition challenges his 240-month sentence imposed upon conviction for conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1) and (b)(1). In his petition, Stallings acknowledges he previously filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 that was denied. On appeal, Stallings argues the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>court erred in dismissing his petition as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion because he was actually innocent of his U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement, such that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255, however, permits a federal prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition if the petitioner can establish that \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). In <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc), </em>we expressly held that the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause \u201cdoes not authorize a federal prisoner to bring in a \u00a7 2241 petition a claim, which would otherwise be barred by \u00a7 2255(h), that the sentencing guidelines were misapplied in a way that resulted in a longer sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The district court did not err in dismissing Stallings\u2019 petition. The claim raised by Stallings addressed the legality of his sentence and was therefore outside the scope of \u00a7 2241. <em>See Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Stallings may not circumvent the statutory restriction on successive \u00a7 2255 motions simply by filing his current petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1308. Stallings\u2019 240-month sentence does not exceed either the unenhanced 40-year statutory maximum sentence, or the enhanced statutory maximum sentence of life for a defendant with a prior felony drug offense, given his concession on appeal that his Florida cocaine-trafficking conviction was a predicate offense for \u00a7 851 enhancement purposes. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Because Stallings\u2019 240-month sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, he may not rely on the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) to bring his claim under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
