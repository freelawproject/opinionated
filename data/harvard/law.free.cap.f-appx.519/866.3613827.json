Tangherlini, the Acting Administrator of the GSA. Murry proceeds pro se. For the reasons provided below, we AFFIRM the final judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-24\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"Ay-a\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b892-25\">Murry is a former employee of the GSA. She suffers from agoraphobia and depression, as well as anxiety, panic, and post-traumatic stress disorders. During the events at issue, Murry largely worked as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>supply technician at the GSA\u2019s National Forms and Publications Center (\u201cNFPC\u201d) in Forth Worth, Texas. Murry\u2019s position was classified as GS-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">At the NFPC, Murry worked from a cubicle within a warehouse, which at times was infested with insects and rodents. Murry\u2019s supervisor was Kay Caise. The two apparently had an adversarial relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">During her time at the NFPC, Murry took a considerable amount of leave. For instance, in 1999, Murry took 994.7 hours (or 124.3 days), including annual, sick, donated, and unpaid leave. In 2000, Murry took 667.7 hours (or 83.5 days), including annual, administrative, and unpaid leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">In April 2000, Murry requested reassignment on account of the insect and rodent infestation. In May 2000, Murry again requested reassignment, this time on account \u201cof hostile and unhealthy work conditions\u201d pertaining to both the infestation and her adversarial relationship with Caise. Also in May 2000, Murry was granted 31 days of leave (the full month) after submitting a letter from her psychiatrist that repeated contact with Caise and the infested work environment had \u201cincapacitated\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Murry again requested reassignment in June 2000 and, in July 2000, requested to work from home. Also in July 2000, Mur-ry requested five additional days of leave. In support of this request, Murry submitted a doctor\u2019s note stating that work in the NFPC warehouse was \u201cnot suitable for her continued mental and physical well being.\u201d The GSA did not reassign her.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">B.Murry\u2019s First EEOC Complaint in July 2000</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">On July 25, 2000, Murry filed a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), claiming that the GSA had denied her a reasonable accommodation of reassignment. In addition, Murry asserted a retaliation claim that is not pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">After conducting a hearing, the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that the GSA had searched for an open position suitable for Murry, but had found none. Thus, the ALJ concluded that the GSA had put forth \u201ca legitimate non-discriminatory reason for not reassigning Murry.\u201d The GSA issued a final, agency-level decision that the agency had not discriminated against Murry on account of her disability. On administrative appeal, the EEOC\u2019s Office of Federal Operations (\u201cOFO\u201d) affirmed the GSA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">C. Aftermath of Murry\u2019s July 2000 Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">On August 1, 2000, the GSA presented a memorandum to Murry stating that there were no available GS-5 positions in the Forth Worth area other than her position at the NFPC. The agency denied Murry\u2019s request to work from home because her job required her to operate a computer system that was not accessible remotely, and to perform physical inventory checks at the warehouse. However, to accommodate a new sleeping medication that Murry was taking, which left her groggy in the mornings, the GSA agreed to allow her one hour of unpaid leave every morning. Later, in 2001, the agency agreed to allow Murry two hours of unpaid leave every morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">In May 2001, the GSA promoted two individuals from GS-4 personnel clerk positions to GS-5 human resources assistant positions to account for those individuals\u2019 increased responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">D. Murry\u2019s Second EEOC Complaint in May 2002</p>\n<p id=\"b893-17\">On May 10, 2002, Murry filed a second complaint to the EEOC, claiming that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>GSA had failed to reassign her to -positions that had become vacant after the period covered by her first EEOC complaint\u2014 namely, the two human resources assistant positions. The ALJ again concluded that there had been no discrimination. The GSA adopted the ALJ\u2019s conclusion, and the OFO affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">II.PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Murry filed the instant suit on June 7, 2010, stating a claim under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Murry asserted that the GSA had denied her a reasonable accommodation by denying her requests for reassignment. Additionally, Murry asserted retaliation and hostile work environment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The GSA moved for summary judgment. First, the district court determined that Murry\u2019s hostile work environment claim failed for failure to exhaust her administrative remedies. In other words, Murry had never asserted a hostile work environment claim in her two EEOC complaints. Next, the district court determined that any claims arising out of Murry\u2019s first EEOC complaint, in July 2000, were now stale. In other words, Murry had failed to bring a timely suit in district court after the OFO had affirmed the GSA\u2019s denial of her July 2000 complaint. Thus, the district court only reached the merits of Mur-ry\u2019s reassignment claim, and only with respect to the period after her first EEOC complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">In assessing the merits of Murry\u2019s reassignment claim, the district court applied our conjunctive four-pronged test to establish <em>prima facie </em>discrimination on the basis of a covered disability. <em>See Washburn v. Harvey, </em>504 F.3d 505, 508-09 (5th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). The district court determined that Murry could not satisfy the second prong of <em>Washburn, </em>that she was \u201cotherwise qualified for the position sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508 (alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Accordingly, on February 24, 2012, the district court granted the GSA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Murry\u2019s complaint with prejudice. Murry timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">III.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">\u201cThis court reviews a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Performance Autoplex II Ltd. v. Mich-Continent Cas. Co., </em>322 F.3d 847, 853 (5th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">IV.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">As noted above, we apply a conjunctive four-pronged test to establish <em>prima facie </em>discrimination on the basis of a covered disability. <em>See Washburn, </em>504 F.3d at 508-09 (citations omitted). The second prong of the <em>Washburn </em>test is that the plaintiff was \u201cotherwise qualified for the position sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508 (alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">Here, to satisfy the second prong of <em>Washburn, </em>Murry would have had to (i) identify the positions sought; (ii) show that she was qualified for the positions; and (iii) show that she could have performed their \u201cessential functions ... with no more than a reasonable accommodation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Murry also would have had to (iv) show that the positions were vacant. <em>Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, </em>174 F.3d 615, 620 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(9)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">We apply this second <em>Washburn </em>prong to all three positions that Murry might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>have sought on reassignment: (i) one of the human resources assistant positions; (ii) her own supply technician position, but working from home; and (iii) a suitable alternative GS-5 position in the Fort Worth area. Murry cannot satisfy <em>Wash-bum </em>\u2019s second prong with respect to any of these positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">First, Murry, a supply technician, cannot show that she was qualified to be a human resources assistant, an altogether different field. Moreover, Murry cannot show that one of the human resources assistant positions was even available since those positions came into existence only upon the promotion of the personnel clerks who already occupied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Next, Murry cannot show that she could have performed the essential functions of a supply technician from home. As noted above, those functions included the operation of the computer system and the performance of physical inventories, neither of which could have been performed remotely-</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Finally, the record does not show that there were any vacant GS-5 positions, similar to that of a supply technician, within the Forth Worth area but in an office other than the NFPC warehouse. Murry points to a \u201ccustomer assistant\u201d position that the GSA filled on June 18, 2000, after a search that presumably took place while Murry was out on leave in May 2000. However, it would not have been reasonable for the GSA to search for a replacement position until it knew for sure when Murry would be returning from her incapacitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Moreover, the customer assistant position was in the very NFPC warehouse from which Murry sought reassignment. While Caise might no longer have been her supervisor, Murry still risked renewed incapacitation from the rodent infestation. Given these facts, Murry cannot show that there was any available position for which she was qualified, and could perform its essential functions without risking renewed incapacitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Y. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the final judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b892-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
