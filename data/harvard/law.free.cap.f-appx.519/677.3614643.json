After careful review, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-22\">Cassady, a former inmate at the Augusta State Medical Prison, sued the Defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the Defendants violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Cassady alleged that the Defendants acted with deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>indifference by allowing him to be exposed to unsafe levels of environmental tobacco smoke that had an adverse effect on his \u201cpresent and future health needs.\u201d (Dkt. 13 at \u00b640.) Specifically, Cassady alleged that while he was incarcerated, over \u201c92% of the inmates\u201d in his cell block smoked, and he was subjected to high levels of environmental tobacco smoke. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 24.) As a result of the exposure, Cassa-dy has had \u201cmultiple asthma attacks\u201d and his \u201crespiratory condition continues to deteriorate.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.) Cassady also alleged in his complaint that \u201cthere is no level of [environmental tobacco smoke] that is risk-free,\u201d exposure to tobacco smoke is known to cause severe cardiac and respiratory ailments, and the Defendants knew of this risk and still allowed Cassady to be exposed to tobacco smoke. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The Defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court denied the motion and ordered that \u201c[t]he case shall proceed to trial only on Plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claims against [the Defendants] for acting with deliberate indifference in exposing him to levels of environmental tobacco smoke that posed an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his <em>future health.\u201d </em>(Dkt. 49 (emphasis added).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Before trial, the Defendants objected to portions of Cassady\u2019s proposed exhibits, which included references that Cassady\u2019s doctors had told him to stay away from tobacco smoke, on the grounds that such evidence is inadmissible hearsay. The district court agreed and excluded the doctors\u2019 orders from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The case proceeded to trial, and after Cassady rested his case, the Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a). The court granted judgment in their favor, concluding that Cassady had failed to present evidence that Defendants\u2019 actions caused a risk to his future health. Cassady appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Cassady raises three issues on appeal: (A) whether the district court erred in limiting the trial to Cassady\u2019s future-health claim, (B) whether the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Defendants, and (C) whether the district court erroneously excluded the doctors\u2019 orders from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">With regards to a prisoner\u2019s medical condition, a prison official can violate the Eighth Amendment in two ways: (1) by being deliberately indifferent to a prisoner\u2019s existing serious medical needs, <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); or (2) by being deliberately indifferent to conditions posing a substantial risk of future harm, <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993). See <em>Weaver v. Clarke, </em>45 F.3d 1253, 1255 (8th Cir.1995) (\u201c[A] prison official violates the Eighth Amendment by being deliberately indifferent <em>either </em>to a prisoner\u2019s <em>existing </em>serious medical needs <em>or </em>to conditions posing a substantial risk <em>o\u00ed future </em>harm.\u201d). Cassa-dy alleges both types of Eighth Amendment violations in his complaint. <em>(See </em>Dkt. 13 at \u00b6 40 (alleging that the Defendants \u201cwere recklessly indifferent to Plaintiffs present and future health needs\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">The district court, in its order addressing the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, limited the trial to Cassady\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>future-health claim \u2014 that the Defendants were deliberately indifferent \u201cin exposing him to levels of environmental tobacco smoke that posed an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his <em>future health.\u201d </em>(Dkt. 49 (emphasis added).) In the order, the court says it is adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. <em>(Id.) </em>But <em>the </em>magistrate judge never recommended that the district court should grant summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on Cassady\u2019s present-health claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">A district court may \u201caccept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part\u201d the magistrate judge\u2019s findings or recommendations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C). Presumably that is what happened here \u2014 the court rejected the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to deny the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment in its entirety and instead granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on the present-health claim that the Defendants were deliberately indifferent to his health during the time he was incarcerated at the Augusta State Medical Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">However, when a district court fails to sufficiently explain its rulings, we will remand the case. <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>480 F.3d 1090, 1091-92 (11th Cir.2007). Except for the court\u2019s order, the only other mention of. the present-health claim in the record occurs during the pretrial conference. At the conference, Cassady said that he was asserting both a present-health claim and a future-health claim. (Dkt. 102 at 34.) The district court responded by saying that it limited the trial to the future-health claim and that it \u201cbelieve[d] that that is, in fact, the correct statement of the issue of this trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 35-36.) The order and the court\u2019s comments at the pretrial conference \u201cfail to provide this Court with an opportunity to conduct meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Danley, </em>480 F.3d at 1092. We therefore vacate the order that effectively grants summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on Cassady\u2019s present-health claim, and we remand the matter to the district court to enter a reasoned order addressing whether the Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the present-health claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">After Cassady rested his case, the Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law. After hearing argument, the district court granted judgment in favor of the Defendants, concluding that Cassady \u201chas not provided any medical evidence to establish the causal connection between his [environmental tobacco smoke] exposure and his alleged injuries.\u201d (Dkt. 101 85.) Cassady challenges on this appeal the court\u2019s grant of judgment in favor of the Defendants. The parties agree that we review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to grant a judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Cassady argues that the district court improperly granted judgment as a matter of law because he presented evidence which would support the inference that the Defendants caused a risk of harm to his future health. Cassady does not dispute that he was required to prove causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">With a future-health claim, a plaintiff must prove that the \u201cprison officials have, with deliberate indifference, exposed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>to levels of [environmental tobacco smoke] that pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health.\u201d <em>Kelley v. Hicks, </em>400 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Helling, </em>509 U.S. at 35, 113 S.Ct. at 2481). The plaintiff \u201cmust show that he himself is being exposed to unreasonably high levels of [environmental tobacco smoke].\u201d <em>Id. </em>This requires \u201ca scientific and statistical inquiry into the seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood that such injury to health will actually be caused by exposure to [environmental tobacco smoke].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Helling, </em>509 U.S. at 36, 113 S.Ct. at 2482).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">After review, we agree with the district court \u2014 Cassady failed to present sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that the Defendants, in allowing him to be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, caused a substantial risk of harm to his future health. Cassady did not present any medical evidence that established his particular level of exposure to tobacco smoke or his risk of harm to his future health based on that level of exposure. He presented no scientific or statistical evidence that his exposure to tobacco smoke will likely cause a risk of harm to his future health. <em>Cf. Larson v. Kempker, </em>414 F.3d 936, 940 (8th Cir.2005) (concluding that a prisoner did not put forth sufficient evidence because he \u201cdid not present any ... reliable basis to estimate the levels of [environmental tobacco smoke] to which he is exposed or scientific evidence concerning how those levels of [smoke] would affect his future health\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Cassady contends that the district court erroneously excluded evidence of his doctors\u2019 orders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cWe review evidentiary rulings made by the district court for abuse of discretion and will reverse the district court\u2019s decision only in cases where substantial prejudice exists.\u201d <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">If we were to assume that the district court erred in excluding the doctors\u2019 orders, the error would not warrant reversal because no substantial prejudice exists. As we said, the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Defendants because Cassady failed to prove that the Defendants caused a risk of likely harm to his future health. Evidence that Cassady\u2019s doctors told him to stay away from smoke does not satisfy the causation element of his future-health claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the Defendants on Cassadys future-health claim. We vacate the district court\u2019s order that effectively grants summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on Cassady\u2019s present-health claim. We remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of two other defendants. (Dkt. 49.) Cassady does not challenge that ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\">. We reject the Defendants\u2019 argument that Cassady\u2019s failure to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation waived his right to raise this issue on appeal. There was nothing for Cassady to object to in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which recommended that the Defendants' motion for summary judgment be denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">. Cassady argues that the district erroneously required him to present evidence of a physical injury. However, because Cassady failed to present this argument to the district court, we deem it forfeited. See <em>Higginbottom v. Carter, </em>223 F.3d 1259, 1260 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that we do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal). Even if the argument was properly before us, the district court granted judgment in favor of the Defendants because Cassady failed to prove causation, not because Cassady failed to prove that he has a physical injury. Cassady also argues that the district court erred by dismissing his entire case and that the case should have continued on his requests for declaratory and injunctive relief. But Cassady did not ask for declaratory relief in his complaint, <em>(see </em>dkt. 13) and the district court dismissed his claim for injunctive relief as moot, (dkt. 24.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b707-14\">. Cassady does not point us to what doctors\u2019 orders he sought to introduce into evidence. After our review of the record, we assume that Cassady is referring to several letters that he wrote to the Defendants, which were admitted at trial in redacted form. The redacted parts include references that Cassady\u2019s doctors told him to stay away from smoke and that he needed a smoke-free environment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
