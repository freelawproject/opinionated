The district court imposed a 24-month imprisonment term for her conspiracy conviction and consecutive 24-month imprisonment terms for each of her convictions' for aggravated identity theft, resulting in a total of 10 years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Cuellar argues that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the imprisonment terms for her aggravated identity theft convictions to run consecutively to each other. The district court had the discretion to determine whether those imprisonment terms would be served concurrently or consecutively. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1028A(b)(4). In light of the evidence regarding the extensiveness of Cuellar\u2019s criminal conduct, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1028A(b)(4); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, comment. (n.2(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">According to Cuellar, the district court also failed to adequately provide reasons for its decision to impose the consecutive sentences. Because she did not object on this ground in the district court, plain error review applies. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Cuellar has not shown any clear or obvious error regarding the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
