Giles appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d). Giles\u2019s complaint alleged that Wells Fargo violated the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq. (\u201cTILA\u201d), by failing to provide notice of a transfer of ownership in Giles\u2019s mortgage loan, as required by section 1641(g). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In 2007, Giles executed a Promissory Note (\u201cNote\u201d) in favor of America South Mortgage Corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Note was secured by a mortgage on real property (\u201cMortgage\u201d) which named Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\u201cMERS\u201d) as the mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The Mortgage identified America South as the \u201cLender\u201d and described MERS as \u201ca separate corporation that is acting solely as a nominee for Lender and Lender\u2019s successors and assigns.\u201d The Mortgage conveyed to MERS (as nominee) legal title to the property and granted to MERS (as nominee) the power of sale. The Mortgage also said that \u201cMERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by [Giles] ..., but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender\u2019s successors and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender including, but not limited to, releasing and canceling this Security Instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">In late 2007, the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) purchased the Note. In 2008, servicing of the loan was transferred to Wells Fargo. Pursuant to guidelines governing the relationship between Fannie Mae and Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo held the original executed Note as a custodian on behalf of Fannie Mae.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">In June 2010, Wells Fargo sent Giles a \u201cNotice of Acceleration of Promissory Note and Mortgage\u201d notifying Giles that, because she had defaulted on her payments, Wells Fargo would commence foreclosure proceedings. In July 2010, MERS executed an \u201cAssignment of Mortgage\u201d (\u201cAssignment\u201d), transferring to Wells Fargo \u201call right, title and interest of [MERS] in and to that certain Mortgage executed by [Giles], ... together with the note and indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, and all interest of [MERS] in and to the property described in said Mortgage.\u201d On appeal, Giles acknowledges that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that the purpose of the assignment was ... to allow Wells Fargo to conduct a foreclosure in its own name and that this was required by Fannie Mae\u2019s Guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wells Fargo did not provide a Notice of New Creditor to Giles following the Assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">In October 2010, Wells Fargo conducted a foreclosure sale of Giles\u2019s property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>conveyed legal title to the property to the highest bidder: Fannie Mae.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Giles filed this civil action, alleging that Wells Fargo failed to abide by section 1641(g)\u2019s notice requirement, which Giles asserted was triggered by the Assignment. The district court granted Wells Fargo\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Wells Fargo was not required to provide notice under section 1641(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Galvez v. Bruce, </em>552 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate where the record presents no genuine issues of material fact and where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Swisher Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Schafer, </em>550 F.3d 1046, 1050 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cOnce the movant adequately supports its motion, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to show that specific facts exist that raise a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Dietz v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., </em>598 F.3d 812, 815 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Section 1641(g) requires that, within \u201c30 days after the date on which a mortgage loan is sold or otherwise transferred or assigned to a third party, the creditor that is the new owner or assignee of the debt shall notify the borrower in writing of such transfer....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641(g)(1). Based on its plain language, section 1641(g)\u2019s disclosure obligation is triggered only when ownership of the \u201cmortgage loan\u201d or \u201cdebt\u201d itself is transferred, not when the instrument securing the debt (that is, the mortgage) is transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">But Giles argues that, under Alabama law, \u201cthe transfer of a mortgage also transfers the obligation the mortgage secures unless the parties to the transfer agree otherwise.\u201d <em>See Crum v. LaSalle Bank, N.A., </em>55 So.3d 266, 269 (Ala.Civ. App.2009). Alabama law also requires that a foreclosure be undertaken only by an entity entitled to receive the money secured by the mortgage. <em>See </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 35-10-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Even if we assume \u2014 without deciding\u2014 that Wells Fargo became the owner of both the Mortgage and the Note as a result of the Assignment, Wells Fargo was not subject to section 1641(g)\u2019s notice requirement because the Assignment was made \u201csolely for [Wells Fargo\u2019s] administrative convenience.\u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641(f). Under section 1641(f), a servi-cer \u201cshall not be treated as the owner of the obligation\u201d \u2014 and, thus, is not subject to section 1641(g)\u2019s notice requirement \u2014 if the servicer was assigned the obligation \u201csolely for the administrative convenience of the servicer in servicing the obligation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The phrase \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d is not defined by TILA. In construing the statute\u2019s language, \u201cwe \u2018start with the assumption that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re James, </em>406 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.2005). The term \u201cconvenience\u201d means \u201cfitness or suitability for performing an action or fulfilling a requirement.\u201d Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster. com/dictionary (last visited Mar. 25, 2013). And the term \u201cadministration\u201d means of or relating to the act or process of managing. <em>See id. </em>(defining \u201cadministrative\u201d as \u201cof or relating to administration,\u201d \u201cadministration\u201d as \u201cthe act or process of administering,\u201d and \u201cadministering\u201d as \u201cmanaging\u201d). Thus, the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d is that which permits a person to perform an action or fulfill a requirement in the process of managing whatever is being managed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">To the extent that Wells Fargo was assigned the Note, the assignment enabled Wells Fargo both to conduct a valid foreclosure proceeding under Alabama law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>and, therefore, to carry out its duties as servicer to Fannie Mae. Thus, the Assignment was \u201cadministratively convenient\u201d to Wells Fargo. And Fannie Mae\u2019s Guidelines make clear that such assignment was temporary and made solely for the purpose of completing the foreclosure proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Giles argues that, because Fannie Mae saved itself some trouble and benef\u00edtted from avoiding conducting the foreclosure in its own name, the Assignment was not made \u201csolely\u201d for Wells Fargo\u2019s administrative convenience. But, as the district court explained, \u201cif a servicer could not avail itself of the [\u201cadministrative convenience\u201d] exception because its principal received some benefit, then the exception itself would be a nullity; the reason Fannie Mae contracts out the servicing of the loan (including foreclosure) is because it benefits Fannie Mae to do so.\u201d That Fannie Mae benef\u00edtted from having Wells Fargo conduct the foreclosure proceeding did not change the fact that the Assignment itself enabled Wells Fargo to fulfill its obligations as servicer.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Because Wells Fargo falls within the scope of section 1641(f)\u2019s \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d exception, it was not required to notify Giles of the Assignment. No genuine issue of material facts exists; Wells Fargo was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-10\">.
