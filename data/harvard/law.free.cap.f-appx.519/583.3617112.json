Though this term fell within the maximum sentence prescribed by statute, 20-years\u2019 imprisonment, and the applicable sentence range under the Sentencing Guidelines, 46 to 57 months, Ochoa-Torres appeals the sentence, arguing that it is substantively unreasonable, in that it is greater than necessary to serve the sentencing objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). We disagree and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We evaluate the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse-of-diseretion standard, <em>Gall v. United </em>States, 552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), taking into account the totality of the facts and circumstances relating to the offense and the offender. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). The relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether the sentence ... fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, 431 F.3d </em>784, <em>788 </em>(11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-10\"><em>IcL </em>at 786 (summarizing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The weight given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor is \u201ca matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Ochoa-Torres fails to show that the District Court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. The record reflects that the court considered and weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, including Ochoa-Torres\u2019s lengthy criminal history, as well as his request for a sentence below the Guidelines sentence range.</p>\n<p id=\"AzR\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
