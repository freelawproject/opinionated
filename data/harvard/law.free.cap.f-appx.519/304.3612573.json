Ajah seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the denials of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and of his motion to alter or amend that judgment pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52(b) and 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">A COA is required to appeal \u201cthe final order in a proceeding under section 2255.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). Because Ajah\u2019s motion sought to alter or amend the judgment denying his \u00a7 2255 motion, a COA is required. <em>See Ochoa Canales v. Quarterman, </em>507 F.3d 884, 888 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>No. 12-40243, 2013 WL 698396 at *1 (5th Cir. Feb.26, 2013) (\u00a7 2255 case citing <em>Ochoa Canales). </em>However, the district court did not address whether a COA was warranted when it denied Ajah\u2019s motion to alter or amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We assume without deciding that we lack jurisdiction over the appeal from that judgment pursuant to Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2255 Proceedings, which has language similar to former Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>See United States v. Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d 1113, 1114 (5th Cir.1997). We decline to remand this case to the district court for a COA ruling because Ajah has not briefed, and thus has abandoned on appeal, any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of that motion. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir. 2000); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). The appeal from the denial of the motion to alter or amend is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction, and Ajah\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">In the alternative, even if we assume that we have jurisdiction over the appeal without the district court\u2019s ruling on a COA, we would deny a COA as to the motion to alter or amend. To obtain a COA, Ajah must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Because Ajah has failed to brief any arguments regarding the denial of his motion to alter or amend, he has not made the required showing, and Ajah\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">Although Ajah filed a notice of appeal within 60 days of the entry of the entry of the judgment denying his \u00a7 2255 motion, he withdrew that appeal. In light of the district court\u2019s unchallenged determination that Ajah\u2019s motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rules 52(b) and 59(e) motion was untimely, Ajah\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely as to the judgment denying his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(ii), (iv). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over an appeal of that judgment. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). The appeal from the denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction, and Ajah\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED as MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
