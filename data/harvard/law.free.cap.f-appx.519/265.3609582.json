Callen argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the indictment, which was based on his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The record indicates that Callen pleaded guilty without a written plea agreement. Callen does not contend that his plea was unknowing or involuntary and he has not provided a transcript of his rearraignment. Because \u201cthe record contains no manifestation of a reservation of appellate rights,\u201d we treat the plea as unconditional. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 917 (5th Cir.1992). An unconditional guilty plea \u201chas the effect of waving all non-jurisdictional defects in the prior proceedings,\u201d <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 238 (5th Cir.2007), including any claim of a speedy trial violation, <em>Bell, </em>966 F.2d at 915. Accordingly, Callen has waived his speedy trial act claim. <em>Id. </em>at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
