The United States moves for a summary affirmance and to stay the briefing schedule. Because the \u201cposition [of the United States] ... is clearly right as a matter of law so that there [is] no substantial question as to the outcome of the case,\u201d <em>Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969), we grant the motion for summary affirmance and dismiss as moot the motion to stay the briefing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-23\">Bassett\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. We have held that defendants, like Bassett, whose sentences are based on the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on the drug quantity tables, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, are ineligible for a reduction of their sentence under Amendment 750. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-30 (11th Cir.2008). Bassett argues that the district court should have considered the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but a district court considers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>those sentencing factors only when it has the authority to reduce a sentence and decides whether to grant a reduction. The district court lacked the authority to reduce Barrett\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Bassett\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence, and we DISMISS as moot the motion to stay the briefing schedule.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
