By his IFP motion in this court, Perez questions the district court\u2019s denial of IFP status and certification that his appeal was not in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. </em>Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Perez contends that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that he could not use Rule 60(b) to sidestep the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) in connection with his notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. There is no arguable merit to the contention that it was an abuse of discretion to deny Perez relief under Rule 60(b). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 213-15, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007); <em>Dunn v. Cockrell, </em>302 F.3d 491, 492 (5th Cir.2002). Consequently, we may dismiss this frivolous appeal sua sponte. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Perez\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
