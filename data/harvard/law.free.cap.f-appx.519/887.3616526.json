On appeal, Moore contends that the district court erred by applying the sentence enhancement in U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) [hereinafter \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d] for possession of a dangerous weapon and that the use of relevant conduct to increase his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-18\">Section 2D1.1 provides for a two-level enhancement of a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Government can prove personal possession of a dangerous weapon \u201cby showing a temporal and spatial relationship of the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2010). It may prove vicarious possession \u201cwhen another individual involved in the commission of an offense possessed the weapon ... [and] the defendant could have reasonably foreseen that possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (A defendant involved in a \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d is responsible under the Guidelines for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d); <em>United States v. DeLaGarza, </em>460 Fed.Appx. 406, 409 (5th Cir.2012) (unpublished opinion) (\u201cThis latter proof is known as vicarious possession.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Ordinarily, we review de novo the district court\u2019s legal application of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). <em>Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d at 390. However, since Moore failed to preserve the specific arguments he raises on appeal, his arguments will be reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Moore must show that the error was clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion-to correct the error but only if it \u201c \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>United Stales v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The district court applied the dangerous weapon enhancement based on the shotgun found in Moore\u2019s codefendant\u2019s home. Moore contends that the district court incorrectly applied an inapposite, personal possession rationale to support the enhancement and supplanted the pre-sentence report (PSR) finding that he vicariously possessed the weapon. The district court referred to the temporal and spatial relationship between the shotgun and the drug-trafficking activity in which Moore and his codefendants were jointly involved. In so doing, the district court incorporated the requisite findings that the codefendant possessed the shotgun in connection with the offense and' that Moore could have reasonably foreseen that his codefendant would possess a weapon in furtherance of their jointly undertaken criminal activity. The district court also adopted the PSR, which expressly concluded that Moore could have reasonably foreseen that his codefendant would possess a weapon in connection with the offense. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 765-66 (5th Cir.2008). We perceive no error in the district court\u2019s application of the vicarious possession test.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Moore\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence that the codefendant possessed the shotgun in connection with the offense is unavailing. He ignores the unrebutted evidence in the PSR that the codefendant sold the methamphetamine he obtained from Moore at the codefendant\u2019s residence; the shotgun was found in the codefendant\u2019s bedroom along with a holster, ammunition, and drug-trafficking paraphernalia; and the codefendant was reputed to carry a firearm. Further, one of the drug sales that occurred shortly before the search of the codefendant\u2019s residence was actually conducted in the codefen-dant\u2019s bedroom. Based on this evidence, the district court was entitled to infer that the codefendant possessed the shotgun in connection with the offense. <em>See Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d at 390. To the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Moore argues that he could not have foreseen that the codefendant would possess the shotgun, \u201c[i]t was readily foreseeable that firearms would be employed as tools of the drug trafficking trade.\u201d <em>United States v. Garza, </em>118 F.3d 278, 286 (5th Cir.1997). There was no error, plain or otherwise, in the application of the enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon in \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Moore\u2019s contention that the use of relevant conduct to enhance his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, <em>244-45, 125 </em>S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b914-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
