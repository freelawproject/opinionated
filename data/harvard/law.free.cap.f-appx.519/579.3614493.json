On appeal, Tucker argues that the district court erred in granting Sejong\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Tucker\u2019s discriminatory and retaliatory termination claims under \u00a7 1981 and Title VII, as well as on his state law claims. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The only federal claims that Tucker has preserved for appeal are his claims of discriminatory and retaliatory termination. Tucker argues that the district court erred in finding that he had offered no direct evidence of discrimination. This argument is without merit. Tucker has failed to identify any statements by Sejong\u2019s managers that show a discriminatory intent without inference. <em>See Hinson v. Clinch Cnty., Ga. Bd. of Educ., </em>231 F.3d 821, 827 (11th Cir.2000). Tucker has likewise not established sufficient circumstantial evidence of a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation with regard to his termination. Nonetheless, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Tucker established a prima facie case for his discrimination and retaliation claims, the district court did not err in granting Sejong\u2019s motion for summary judgment because Tucker did not show that Sejong\u2019s reason for firing him was pretextual. <em>See Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024-25 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
