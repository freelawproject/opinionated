The district court applied a four-level enhancement pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). Crockett challenges the application of that enhancement. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Crockett sold two firearms and around three grams of cocaine to an undercover officer. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. At sentencing, the district court applied the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) four-level enhancement over Crockett\u2019s objection, finding that Crockett possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense\u2014 his sale of cocaine. On appeal, Crockett argues that his possession of firearms was not in connection with his sale of cocaine because he sold both in the same transaction; the firearms were simply part of the consideration the buyer would receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 698 (11th Cir.2002). Whether a firearm was used \u201cin connection with\u201d a felony offense is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) calls for a four-level enhancement when the defendant \u201cpossessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). The question here is whether Crockett\u2019s sale of firearms and drugs together constitutes the possession of a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d a felony offense \u2014 the sale of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">The phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d is not defined in the Guidelines. However, the commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1 explains what \u201cin connection with\u201d means. Application Note 14(A) says that the application of the enhancement is warranted if the firearm \u201cfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(A). The commentary to the Guidelines is \u201cauthoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993). Crockett does not contend that the commentary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\u00a7 2K2.1 violates the Constitution, violates a federal statute, or is inconsistent with the guideline. We therefore give the commentary authoritative weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Here, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in concluding that Crockett\u2019s possession of the firearms was \u201cin connection with\u201d his sale of cocaine. The district court found that the possession of \u201cthe firearms had the potential of facilitating ... the possession with intent to distribute\u201d cocaine. (R. 4 at 19.) Moreover, the firearms were in close proximity to the drugs. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K1.2 cmt. n. 14(B) (noting that the application of the enhancement is wax\u2019ranted in a drag trafficking offense case when the firearm is found in \u201cclose proximity\u201d to the drugs). Finally, we note that the fact that the firearms were not used to embolden or protect Crockett while selling the cocaine does not change our conclusion. We have never held that the application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) enhancement is appropriate only when a defendant uses a firearm to embolden or protect himself. As long as the firearms facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense, application of the enhancement is not improper. In this case, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Crockett possessed the firearms in connection with the sale of cocaine. Thus, the court did not err in applying the four-level enhancement of \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
