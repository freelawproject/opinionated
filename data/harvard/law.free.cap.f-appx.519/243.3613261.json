Iqbal, a native and citizen of Bangladesh, petitions this court for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) denying an untimely motion to reopen his immigration proceedings. Iqbal entered this country without inspection in September 1989. He did not seek any form of immigration relief but instead agreed to depart voluntarily on or before December 12,1989, or face deportation to Bangladesh. Iqbal did not depart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>as stipulated and, in October 2011, he moved to reopen the 1989 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Iqbal argues that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to find that he has demonstrated a <em>prima facie </em>fear of persecution based on changed country conditions in Bangladesh. He contends that he fled Bangladesh in 1989 due to fear of persecution by the Jatiya Party but that the current situation in Bangladesh is such that he fears persecution by members of the Awami League, who now control the country. He contends that he has established a <em>prima facie </em>case for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and that he has demonstrated exceptional circumstances warranting a favorable discretionary grant of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">An alien must file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the date on which the final administrative decision is entered. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). This timing requirement does not apply if the request for relief \u201cis based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). A motion to reopen must be based on new evidence and must make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988); <em>see </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). We review the denial of a motion to reopen under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, regardless of the basis of the alien\u2019s request for relief.\u201d <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009). In this case, the BIA affirmed the decision of the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) without opinion; therefore, we review the IJ\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions. <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 186 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">We note that portions of the brief submitted by Iqbal\u2019s attorney are not relevant to this case. We agree with the IJ\u2019s determination that the evidence submitted in support of the motion to reopen establishes a continuing history of persecution in Bangladesh, rather than a change in the country\u2019s conditions. Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the untimely motion to reopen the deportation proceedings. <em>See Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632-33 (5th Cir.2005). Because Iqbal has not demonstrated changed country conditions, we do not address his arguments that he has established <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding of removal under the CAT. <em>See INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
