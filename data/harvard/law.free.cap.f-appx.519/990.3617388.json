The district court denied the petition as time-barred. In 2012, Morris filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the same state criminal judgment. The district court construed the \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2254 petition and denied it as impermis-sibly successive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">Sections 2241 and 2254 both govern a single post-conviction remedy, but \u00a7 2254 contains additional limitations on a federal court\u2019s ability to grant the writ of habeas corpus and applies to all prisoners who are in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court. <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1059-60 (11th Cir.2003). Prisoners, like Morris, who are in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court may not avoid the procedural restrictions imposed on \u00a7 2254 petitions by nominally bringing suit under \u00a7 2241. <em>See id. </em>at 1060-61; <em>see also Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1351-52 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), before a petitioner can file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, he must obtain an order from the court of appeals authorizing the district court to consider the second or successive petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without such authorization, the district court lacks subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>matter jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition. <em>Hill v. Hopper, </em>112 F.3d 1088, 1089 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">We, thus, find that the district court correctly construed Morris\u2019s self-styled \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2254 petition and concluded that it was improperly successive. However, the district court erred by denying the petition rather than dismissing it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Franqui v. Florida, </em>638 F.3d 1368, 1375 (11th Cir.2011). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand with instructions to dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We decline to address the merits of Morris\u2019s substantive claim because of our determination that his petition was imper-missibly successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1016-17\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1016-18\">. The district court granted a certificate of appealability (''COA\u201d) on \"all claims stated\u201d in the petition. The government argues that the COA was improvidently granted. We need not address this argument because we find that Morris\u2019s habeas corpus petition must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1016-22\">.For a second \u00a7 2254 petition to be considered successive, the first \u00a7 2254 petition must have been denied or dismissed with prejudice. <em>Guenther v. Holt, </em>173 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir.1999). A denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely is considered to be with prejudice. <em>Jordan v. Sec'y, Dep't of Corr., </em>485 F.3d 1351, 1353 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
