Moon (\u201cMoon\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of Defendant-Appellee The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company\u2019s (\u201cGoodyear\u201d) motion to dismiss his complaint. The district court determined that Moon\u2019s state law claims were preempted by \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). Thereafter, treating Moon\u2019s claims as \u00a7 301 claims, the court found that dismissal was warranted because Moon failed to exhaust the grievance procedures set forth in the collective bargaining agreement entered between Goodyear and Moon\u2019s labor union. After thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">Moon worked as a forklift operator at Goodyear\u2019s manufacturing plant in Gadsden, Alabama for 37 years. Certain employees at this plant, including Moon, were unionized and represented by the United Steelworkers of America (\u201cthe Union\u201d). In 2009, Goodyear and the Union entered into master negotiations which included provisions regarding the out-sourcing of union jobs to non-union members. Sp\u00e9cif\u00ed-cally, Goodyear- and the Union agreed that employees whose jobs were outsourced would be paid a discretionary separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>payment in exchange for their agreeing to leave Goodyear. The separation payment was $2,000 for each year of the employee\u2019s service with Goodyear, with a maximum payment of $50,000. The terms of this agreement were memorialized in the Fork Truck Staff Reduction Agreement (hereinafter the \u201ccollective bargaining agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">In December 2010, Goodyear notified Moon he was eligible for a $50,000 separation payment because his job was set to be outsourced. Moon was presented with a Buyout Application Form to apply for the separation payment. The Buyout Application Form drafted \u201cFOR BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES OF THE GOODYEAR-GADSDEN PLANT\u201d is specifically based upon the \u201cBuyout provisions of the [collective bargaining agreement.]\u201d [R. 6 at 11.] It further stated that \u201c[the employee] understand^] that [Goodyear] will make the final determination as to whether to accept application in accordance with the [collective bargaining agreement.]\u201d <em>[Id.] </em>Moon signed the form as did a Goodyear representative. The form stated that Moon\u2019s last day of employment would be December 31, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In anticipation of his impending retirement, Moon cancelled his disability insurance, signed up for social security, and sought an alternate healthcare plan. Prior to December 31, 2010, however, Goodyear determined it would not outsource Moon\u2019s job and refused to pay him the $50,000. As a result, Moon filed suit against Goodyear in Alabama state court for breach of contract. Goodyear removed the matter to the Northern District of Alabama contending that Moon\u2019s breach of contract claim was preempted by federal labor law. The district court denied Moon\u2019s subsequent motion to remand the case to state court. Thereafter, Goodyear filed a motion to dismiss Moon\u2019s complaint, which the district court granted. Moon then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010). We also review <em>de novo </em>\u201cwhether \u00a7 301 preempts a state-law claim.\u201d <em>Atwater v. Nat\u2019l Football League Players Ass\u2019n, </em>626 F.3d 1170, 1179 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">\n<em>A. Section 301 preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">We turn first to whether Moon\u2019s state law claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and fraud are preempted by \u00a7 301(a) of the LMRA. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-12\">Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). Thus, \u00a7 301 \u201cgrants jurisdiction to federal courts to adjudicate employment disputes involving collective bargaining agreements[.]\u201d <em>Bartholomew v. AGL Res., Inc., </em>361 F.3d 1333, 1338 (11th Cir.2004). Section 301 likewise provides the foundation for the preemption doctrine, summarized by the Supreme Court in <em>Lingle v. Norge Division of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 399, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410 (1988) in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>[I]f the resolution of a state-law claim depends upon the meaning of a collective bargaining agreement, the application of state law (which might lead to inconsistent results since there could be as many state-law principles as there are States) is pre-empted and federal labor-law principles-necessarily uniform throughout the Nation \u2014 must be employed to resolve the dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 405-06, 108 S.Ct. at 1881. In determining whether Moon\u2019s state law claims require interpretation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, we look to the elements of each challenged state law claim. <em>Lightning v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 1551, 1557 (11th Cir.1995) (analyzing \u00a7 301 preemption of tort claims); <em>see also Bartholomew, </em>361 F.3d at 1338-39 (extending this analysis to a breach of contract claim). With regard to Moon\u2019s state tort claims, \u00a7 301 preemption requires the court to determine whether the state law claim \u201cconfers nonnegotiable state-law rights on employers or employees independent of any right established by contract, or, instead, whether evaluation of the tort claim is inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract.\u201d <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 213, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 1912, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985). We hold that Moon\u2019s three state law claims are all preempted by \u00a7 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">\n<em>1. Breach of contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In Alabama, \u201c[a] plaintiff can establish a breach-of-contract claim by showing (1) the existence of a valid contract binding the parties in the action, (2) his own performance under the contract, (3) the defendant\u2019s non-performance, and (4) damages.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Slade, </em>747 So.2d 293, 303 (Ala.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe basic elements of a contract are an offer and an acceptance, consideration, and mutual assent to the essential terms of the agreement.\u201d <em>Armstrong Bus. Servs., Inc. v. AmSouth Bank, </em>817 So.2d 665, 673 (Ala. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">To establish the existence of a contract the court must analyze the terms of the buyout provisions contained in the collective bargaining agreement. The Buyout Application Form drafted \u201cFOR BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES OF THE GOODYEAR-GADSDEN PLANT\u201d is specifically based upon the \u201cBuyout provisions of the Fork Truck Staff Reduction Agreement [i.e., the collective bargaining agreement.]\u201d [R. 6 at 11.] And to determine whether Goodyear breached the Buyout Application Form, we must determine whether it breached the terms supplied in the collective bargaining agreement, as those are the terms specifically referred to in the Buyout Application Form. Consequently, Moon\u2019s breach of contract claim is preempted by \u00a7 301. <em>See Bartholomew, </em>361 F.3d at 1339 (\u201cBecause the plaintiffs state-law breach of contract claims are substantially dependent upon an analysis of the collective bargaining agreement, they are preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">\n<em>2. Unjust enrichment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Moon can recover for unjust enrichment if he can prove that Goodyear \u201cholds money which, in equity and good conscience, belongs to [Moon] or holds money which was improperly paid to [Goodyear] because of mistake or fraud.\u201d <em>Mantiply v. Mantiply, </em>951 So.2d 638, 654 (Ala.2006) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). In his operative complaint, Moon alleges that Goodyear \u201chas been unjustly enriched as a result of its inducement of [Moon\u2019s] actions followed by its refusal to pay [Moon] the separation amount.\u201d [R. 22 \u00b6 16.] Hence, Moon claims that Goodyear should have paid him due to his reliance on the Buyout Applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tion Form. The Buyout Application Form, however, contains no terms of its own, and instead adopts the buyout provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. Thus, to determine whether equity and good conscience dictates that Moon recover the money he requests, we must interpret the only terms provided \u2014 the buyout provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. Because determining whether Moon is entitled to the separation amount clearly \u201cdepends upon the meaning of a collective bargaining agreement,\u201d <em>Lingle, </em>486 U.S. at 406, 108 S.Ct. at 1881, Moon\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment is preempted by \u00a7 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">\n<em>3. Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The elements of fraud are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">(1) a false representation (2) of a material existing fact (3) reasonably relied upon by the plaintiff (4) who suffered damage as a proximate consequence of the misrepresentation. To prevail on a promissory fraud claim ... that is, one based upon a promise to act or not to act in the future, two additional elements must be satisfied: (5) proof that at the time of the misrepresentation, the defendant had the intention not to perform the act promised, and (6) proof that the defendant had an intent to deceive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALL\"><em>Waddell &amp; Reed, Inc. v. United Investors Life Ins., </em>875 So.2d 1143, 1160 (Ala.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). The false representation Moon directs the court to is the Buyout Application Form. Whether Goodyear\u2019s failure to pay the buyout was fraudulent, however, depends entirely on the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, which serve as the terms of the Buyout Application Form. Thus, resolution of Moon\u2019s fraud claim \u201cis substantially dependent upon analysis of the terms of an agreement made between the parties in a labor eontract[.]\u201d <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>471 U.S. at 220, 105 S.Ct. at 1916. Consequently, Moon\u2019s fraud claim is preempted by \u00a7 301,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">\n<em>B. Section 301 Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">After determining that Moon\u2019s state-law claims were preempted by the LRMA, the district court analyzed Moon\u2019s claims under \u00a7 301. Although an employee may sue an employer under \u00a7 301 for breach of a collective bargaining agreement, the employee first must exhaust the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. Maddox, </em>379 U.S. 650, 652-53, 85 S.Ct. 614, 616, 13 L.Ed.2d 580 (1965); <em>see also Mason v. Cont\u2019l Grp., Inc., </em>763 F.2d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cEmployees claiming breach of a collective bargaining agreement or wrongful termination of employment by them employer are bound by that agreement\u2019s terms providing a method of resolving disputes between them and their employer.\u201d). Thus, when an employee has not attempted to utilize the dispute resolution mechanisms available to him under the collective bargaining agreement, his independent suit is to be dismissed. <em>Mason, </em>763 F.2d at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">With regard to any potential \u00a7 301 claim, we conclude that such claims were also appropriately dismissed. Such claims are not cognizable because Moon \u201cfail[ed] to make use of the grievance procedure established in the collective-bargaining agreement[.]\u201d <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>471 U.S. at 220-21, 105 S.Ct. at 1916. The grievance procedure explicitly requires that an employee who has spoken to his area manager about a grievance and is unsatisfied, reduce his grievance to writing and sign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> [R. 4-1 at 10.] Moon does not contend that he followed this mandate. Moon instead argues that he in effect complied with the grievance procedures because the Union failed to assist him when he sought their help. This contention is not persuasive as the grievance procedures above dictate that Moon was responsible for initiating the procedures, not the Union.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court properly dismissed his \u00a7 301 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. Because Moon\u2019s state law claims against Goodyear are all preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA, the district court properly denied Moon's motion to remand the case to Alabama state court. <em>See Sams v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, AFL/CIO, CLC, </em>835 F.2d 848, 849-50 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-17\">. Moon explicitly refers to the 2009 master negotiations in his operative complaint, [R. 22 \u00b6 4], and this document is central to his \u00a7 301 claim. Therefore, we may consider it at the motion to dismiss stage. <em>See Brooks v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1997) (\"[Wjhere the plaintiff refers to certain documents in the complaint and those documents are central to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, then the Court may consider the documents part of the pleadings for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, and the defendant\u2019s attaching such documents to the motion to dismiss will not require conversion of the motion into a motion for summary judgment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-24\">. Moon acknowledges that his claim is against Goodyear, and is not a hybrid claim against Goodyear and the Union. <em>[See </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 5.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
