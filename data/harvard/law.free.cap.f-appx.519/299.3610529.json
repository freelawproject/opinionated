The district court imposed a 64-month prison term and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Herrera-Garcia challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his supervised release term on the grounds that the district court did not explain why it imposed a term of supervised release and the court did not account for the fact that he is a deportable alien, a factor that, he contends, should have received significant weight. Because Herrera-Garcia did not raise these issues or object to his sentence in the district court, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United, States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 328-29 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Where the defendant is an alien who is likely to be deported after serving a prison sentence, supervised release is not ordinarily imposed and \u201cshould not be imposed absent a determination that supervised release would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u201d <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(e), \u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n.5). Here, the district court did not explain why it chose to impose a supervised release term. Nonetheless, the record does not suggest that if the court had explained the sentence in greater detail it would have concluded that supervised release was unwarranted. Moreover, given Herrera-Garcia\u2019s history of violence and extensive criminal history and that the presentence report informed the district court of the relevant sentencing considerations, Herrera-Garcia cannot show that any error, if left uncorrected, would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Accordingly, Herrera-Garcia has not shown that the district court committed reversible plain error by not adequately explaining its decision to order a supervised release term.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">As for substantive reasonableness, Herrera-Garcia\u2019s three-year supervised release term was within the advisory guidelines range, and Herrera-Garcia has not overcome the inference that the district court considered the relevant factors in imposing this sentence. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, he has not established that the court plainly erred in imposing supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cik. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
