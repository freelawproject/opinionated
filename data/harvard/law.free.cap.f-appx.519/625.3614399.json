After pleading guilty in 2007 to possession with intent to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C), the district court found Brown responsible for 12.5 grams of cocaine and 2.85 grams of crack cocaine. Because of his criminal history, the district court deemed Brown a career offender and gave him a guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, the district court emphasized that Brown\u2019s criminal history showed him to be a habitual, repeat offender, a \u201ccareer offender\u201d in lay terms as well as the technical, legal sense. Nevertheless, the district court granted a downward variance and sentenced Brown to 110 months\u2019 imprisonment. Brown later filed the present motion to reduce his sentence, which the district court denied because it had sentenced Brown as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">On appeal, Brown argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because his sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d the career offender Guidelines given that the district court granted a downward variance. He acknowledges that in <em>United States v. </em>Moore, we concluded that career offenders were not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which similarly reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008). However, he argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (plurality opinion), undermined <em>Moore. </em>In <em>Freeman, </em>the Court explained that \u201c\u00a7 3582(c)(2) modification proceedings should be available to permit the district court to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the sentencing range in question was a relevant part of the analytic framework the judge used to determine the sentence or to approve the agreement.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2692-93. Finally, although recently added commentary to \u00a7 IB 1.10 of the Guidelines defines the term \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d in the context of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to be the guideline range calculated by the district court before it applies any variance, Brown contends this commentary improperly contradicts the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the [Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>[Guidelines and the scope of its authority-under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1201 (internal quotation marks omitted). The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provide that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary to the 2011 version of the Guidelines defines \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category ... which is determined before consideration of any departure ... or any variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to reduce offense levels in crack cocaine cases. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750. It was made retroactive by Amendment 759, effective November 1, 2011. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We have addressed whether Amendment 706, which was effective on November 1, 2007, authorized reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for defendants who had been convicted of crack cocaine offenses, but had been sentenced under the career offender guidelines. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. We explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only authorizes reductions to sentences that were \u201cbased on sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1327. As Amendment 706 did not lower the career offender offense levels, we concluded that it did not lower the sentencing range upon which a career offender\u2019s sentence had been based. <em>Id. </em>We also explained that the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201c[made] clear\u201d that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized where an amendment lowers a defendant\u2019s base offense level for the offense of conviction but not the career offender sentencing range under which the court sentenced the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court, in a plurality opinion, held that a defendant sentenced under a plea agreement recommending a specific sentence or sentencing range pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) could, in certain circumstances, still qualify for a reduced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the sentence or sentencing range in the plea agreement was \u201cbased on\u201d the amended guideline range. <em>See Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. Moreover, the Court noted that its approach comported with the applicable guidelines policy statement at the time. <em>See id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2692-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">We have made clear that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule or abrogate <em>Moore, </em>and that <em>Freeman </em>is inapplicable to a defendant sentenced as a career offender. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (stating that reduction is not authorized if \u201cthe amendment .. does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d). In <em>Lawson, </em>we explained that <em>Freeman </em>did not address the situation in which de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>fendants were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Therefore, a defendant who was convicted of a crack cocaine offense but sentenced as a career offender was still not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under Amendment 750. See id</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">We conclude from the record here that the district court correctly concluded that Brown was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it sentenced him as a career offender, and, thus, his sentence was not based on the later-amended crack cocaine guideline. Brown\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, Brown\u2019s argument that he was not sentenced as a career offender because the district court granted a downward variance is unconvincing. The commentary to \u00a7 IB 1.10 defines \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as the calculated range before any variance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)). Second, we reject Brown\u2019s argument that this commentary improperly contradicts <em>Freeman </em>because the plurality in <em>Freeman </em>acknowledged that its decision comported with applicable guideline policy statements at the time, and, moreover, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) explicitly incorporates the guideline policy statements. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
