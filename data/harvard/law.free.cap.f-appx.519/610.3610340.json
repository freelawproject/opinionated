Johnson\u2019s complaint asserts the defendants, two prison officials, violated his rights to worship and participate in Ramadan. The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Johnson raises multiple issues on appeal, which we address in turn. Issue One</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Johnson first argues that two provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) \u2014 \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c) \u2014 violate his rights to due process and access to the courts by-requiring him to litigate against a magistrate rather than the defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review questions of constitutional law <em>de novo. United States v. Ward, </em>486 F.3d 1212, 1221 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Section 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, which only addresses procedures to be followed by the district court once a claim is presented before the court, did not impede or restrict Johnson\u2019s ability to prepare, file, and bring to the court\u2019s attention his complaint. <em>See Vanderberg v. Donaldson, </em>259 F.3d 1321, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (addressing a dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)). Similarly, there is no due process violation where Johnson filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, and the district court conducted a <em>de novo </em>review before dismissing his complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>Id. </em>at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">Section 1997e(c) likewise only addresses procedures to be followed by a court after an inmate\u2019s claim is presented, and did not restrict Johnson\u2019s ability to prepare and file complaints or bring them to the court\u2019s attention. <em>See id. </em>at 1323. Nor did the initial screening by a magistrate under \u00a7 1997e(e) violate due process, where, as here, Johnson had the opportunity to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s R &amp; R, and the district court conducted a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">Issue Two</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">Johnson next argues the court improperly dismissed his complaint, as his claims against the defendants had an arguable basis in law and fact, and the dismissal improperly deprived him of one of his \u201cthree strikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Napier v. Preslicka, </em>314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir.2002). A claim is frivolous if it is without arguable merit in either law or fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">Under \u00a7 1997e(e), a prisoner may not bring a federal civil action for damages for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody absent a showing of physical injury. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e); <em>Napier, </em>314 F.3d at 531. Because Johnson did not allege a physical injury, \u00a7 1997e(e) barred his claims for damages for mental anguish, anxiety, and depression that resulted from the defendants\u2019 actions, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>missing the claims as frivolous. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e); <em>Napier, </em>314 F.3d at 531. Moreover, Johnson has cited no authority for the proposition that the district court\u2019s dismissal improperly deprived him of one of his \u201cthree strikes\u201d under \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Issue Three</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Johnson contends \u00a7 1997e(e) violates the separation of powers doctrine by denying prisoners the right to seek compensatory damages absent a showing of a physical injury. Johnson\u2019s claim that \u00a7 1997e(e) impermissibly prescribes a rule of decision is contrary to the reasoning underlying our decision in <em>Harris v. Garner, </em>namely, that \u00a7 1997e(e) does not bar all relief for certain constitutional violations, but rather is only a limitation on recovery, within Congress\u2019s power to legislate. 190 F.3d 1279, 1287-89 (11th Cir.), <em>vacated, </em>197 F.3d 1059 (11th Cir.1999), <em>reinstated in relevant part, </em>216 F.3d 970, 972, 985 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Issue Four</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Finally, Johnson argues the restriction on his right to recover damages absent a showing of physical injury violates the Eleventh Amendment and \u00a7 1983 by granting immunity from monetary damages to prison officials who knew, or should have known, they were violating Johnson\u2019s constitutional rights. Johnson fails to explain how the PLRA violates any rights he may have under the Eleventh Amendment, which protects states from suits brought by individuals in federal court. <em>Ross v. Jefferson Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>701 F.3d 655, 658-59 (11th Cir.2012). With respect to his argument that the PLRA \u201cviolates\u201d \u00a7 1983, even if the PLRA conflicted with \u00a7 1983, the PLRA would control, as it was enacted after, and is more specific than, \u00a7 1983. <em>See Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. U.S. Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>619 F.3d 1289, 1299 (11th Cir.2010). Moreover, Johnson has provided no authority for his implicit proposition that any such conflict, assuming that it existed, would entitle him to relief in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\">. To the extent Johnson\u2019s brief may be read as seeking redress for the deprivations of other prisoners\u2019 rights, he has alleged no facts establishing his standing to do so. <em>See Harris v. Evans, </em>20 F.3d 1118, 1121 (11th Cir.1994) (era banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
