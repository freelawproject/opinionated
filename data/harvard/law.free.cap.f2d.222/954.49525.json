So pointing it urges upon us that the assigned error presents nothing for our consideration under the plain provisions of Rule 50(b) and Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., and the authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>construing and applying them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree that this is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">This court has never departed from but has consistently reaffirmed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the rule governing in cases of this kind, as laid down in Baten v. Kirby Lumber Corp., 5 Cir., 103 F.2d 272, 274:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-6\">\u201cWhether the verdict is authorized by the evidence is a question not reserved in the trial. The defendants went to the jury without challenging its sufficiency, and no error can be attributed to the judge thereabout. Federal appellate courts do not directly review jury verdicts but only rulings of the judge which may have affected the verdict. Rule of Civil Procedure 50, 28 U.S.C.A., following section 723c, does not do away with but emphasizes the necessity of a motion for a directed verdict to raise the legal question whether the evidence is sufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">.
