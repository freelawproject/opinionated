TARKINGTON, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

Judge Edelstein correctly interpreted the rule of Mollica v. Compania Sud-Americana DeVapores, 2 Cir., 202 F.2d 25, and other cases, and properly directed a verdict for the defendant under the law as then interpreted in this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-19\">2. An appeal of the original judgment is barred by the fact that plaintiff did not file his notice of appeal until May 28, 1954, sixty-four days after entry of the original judgment. But the appeal is timely as to the question raised by the motion to reopen the judgment. See, e. g., United States v. Wis-sahickon Tool Works, 2 Cir., 200 F.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-21\"> 3. On April 5, 1954, the Supreme Court decided Alaska S. S. Co. v. Petterson, 347 U.S. 396, 74 S.Ct. 601, 98 L.Ed. 798, affirming, on the opinion below, the decision of the Ninth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>in Petterson v. Alaska S. S. Co., 205 F.2d 478, 479. The opinion of the Ninth Circuit had expressly rejected the \u201c \u2018relinquishment of control\u2019 \u201d doctrine of the Second Circuit expressed in Mollica v. Compania Sud-Americana DeVapores, 2 Cir., 202 F.2d 25, and other cases. Since the doctrine of the Petterson case conflicts with the cases on which the trial judge relied in directing a verdict, the trial judge should have treated plaintiff\u2019s motion as a motion under Fed.Rules Civ. Proc. rule 60(b), 28 U.S.C.A., to correct a mistake of the court. Thus viewed, plaintiff\u2019s appeal is timely, for the motion was filed ten days after the decision of the Supreme Court in Petterson, and the notice of appeal filed within thirty days after the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The judgment is reversed, and the action remanded for a new trial on the issue of unseaworthiness.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
