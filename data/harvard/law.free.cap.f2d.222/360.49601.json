United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127; Friedberg v. United States, 348 U.S. 142, 75 S.Ct. 138; Smith v. United States, 348 U.S. 147, 75 S.Ct. 194, and United States v. Calderon, 348 U.S. 160, 75 S.Ct. 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-21\">The Supreme Court\u2019s order recited, 348 U.S. 906, 75 S.Ct. 311, 312: \u201cWe have not considered the merits of these cases, nor have we determined their relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>our recent opinions, supra, believing that reexamination by the Courts of Appeals is desirable even in those cases remotely involving the principles laid down in the net worth decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">A reexamination by this court discloses that this is indeed a case only remotely involving the net worth problem. As appears from our former decision 9 Cir., 204 F.2d 74, the district court\u2019s judgment was affirmed upon the ground that the proof of guilt under count 13 was sufficient. Proof under that count did not involve use of the net worth method of proof. We therefore conclude that our former decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
