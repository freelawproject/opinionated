Te Grotenhuis sued in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under \u00a7 4915 of the Revised Statutes, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145, asking that the Commissioner of Patents be authorized to issue Letters Patent covering certain claims of his patent application, Serial No. 585,824, which had been rejected by the Board of Appeals of the Patent Office. The District Court dismissed, and Te Grotenhuis appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The specification of appellant\u2019s application describes pigmented coating compositions such as paints and lacquers and methods of making them. The claims in issue related to an emulsion or water-base paint which is said to have the less porous and more glossy film. The District Court held that some of the claims sought were unpatentable because they were too broad; that one was un-patentable over appellant\u2019s prior patent, No. 2,394,025, in view of Safford; and that the others were unpatentable over Safford. (The Safford patents are Nos. 2,424,853 and 2,510,661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">We have carefully studied the record and have found no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
