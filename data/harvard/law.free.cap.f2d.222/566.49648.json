Hanley was found guilty of both offenses by a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He was sentenced to imprisonment for from four to twelve years on the housebreaking count, and to a term of one year on the larceny charge, the sentences to run concurrently. He did not appeal. Some nine months after the sentences were pronounced, Hanley filed a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, asserting the trial judge should have <em>sua sponte </em>directed an acquittal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offenses. Cf. Rule 29(a), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. This appeal is from the order which denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-20\">A question as to the sufficiency of the proofs at the trial in which the prisoner was convicted cannot be raised by a motion to vacate under \u00a7 2255. Finan v. United States, 4 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
