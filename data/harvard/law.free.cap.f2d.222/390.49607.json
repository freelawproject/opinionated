MILLER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Richard Thomas Keefe, a private in the United States Army stationed in France, and another American soldier, pleaded guilty October 30, 1953, in a French civil court to a charge that in off-duty hours they had beaten a cab driver and stolen his taxicab. Each is now serving in a French civil prison the five-year sentence imposed upon him by the French court.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">December 16, 1953, Keefe\u2019s wife filed in his behalf in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. For obvious reasons, Mrs. Keefe did not ask that the writ be directed to the foreign jailer. Instead she named as respondents the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army, alleging those officials had conspired to deprive her husband of his liberty. She charged that, acting through their agents, servants or employees, the three Secretaries \u201cactually have deprived the said Richard Thomas Keefe of his liberty, in a \u2018Maison de Correction\u2019 at Orleans, France.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AdKr\">Apparently she meant only to charge the Secretaries with indirectly causing her husband\u2019s present incarceration by not preventing the French from taking, trying, convicting and confining him, for she also alleged that her husband\u2019s imprisonment \u201cwas and is brought about by an alleged trial of him by a French court on October 31,1953, for the offense of \u2018Robbery\u2019, i.e., taking a civilian taxicab by force, and for which he was sentenced to confinement for a term of five (5) years.\u201d This was in effect an allegation of what is undoubtedly the fact: that Keefe is imprisoned by a French civilian jailer pursuant to the French court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">Upon the filing of this petition, the District Court entered an order to show cause. The respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the petition and discharge the show cause order was granted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-16\">\u201cThis cause having come on for consideration on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, an order to show cause, respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the petition and discharge the order to show cause, and argument of counsel, and it appearing to the Court that the petitioner is not in the custody of the respondents, and that this Court is without jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>corpus, it is this 13 day of January, 1954,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">\u201cOrdered, that the respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the petition and discharge the order to show cause, be, and the same hereby is, granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_P\">This appeal is prosecuted from the foregoing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The question is, therefore, whether the District Court erred in refusing to issue a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to the petition we have described. That depends on whether Keefe is held in actual or constructive custody by the respondents named in the petition, or by any other person or persons subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court. If not, it was properly denied, for reasons presently to be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The petition shows on its face that Keefe is not in the custody of the respondents. It also shows, because it alleges he is detained by French civil authorities, that there is no one within the jurisdiction of the court who is responsible for his detention and who would be an appropriate respondent. It was therefore necessary to dismiss the petition insofar as it sought a writ of habeas corpus, as a court will not issue that writ unless the person who has custody of the petitioner is within reach of its process. Cf. Ex parte Mitsuye Endo, 1944, 323 U.S. 283, 306, 65 S.Ct. 208, 89 L.Ed. 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Although the petition was insufficient to require or justify habeas corpus, we think it should be examined as one seeking a mandatory order requiring the Secretary of State to obtain Keefe\u2019s release through diplomatic negotiations with France. Mrs. Keefe\u2019s allegations in that respect, though sketchy, are probably sufficient to show she was seeking that relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2Moreover, her brief seems to be directed to the proposition that the Secretary of State can effectuate the prisoner\u2019s release, that it is his legal duty to do so, and that the court can and should require him to perform that duty. We understand her argument to be substantially this:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">(a) In its reservation to its ratification of the Status of Armed Forces Treaty,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Senate of the United States \u201cspecifically provided that, when the constitutional rights of an American serviceman was [sic] violated overseas, the chief diplomatic officer should intercede\u201d ;</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">(b) Keefe\u2019s constitutional rights have been and are being violated by the French in that he was compelled to be a witness against himself, might have been cruelly and unusually punished by deportation to a penal colony, and is now in involuntary servitude;</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">(c) It is therefore the legal duty of the Secretary of State to intercede and obtain Keefe\u2019s release, which he can now do \u201cby representations to the Government of France.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-17\">We discuss appellant\u2019s premises (a) and (b) and her conclusion (c) in that order:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-18\">(1) The Senate\u2019s reservation in its ratification of the Treaty does not provide that, when an American soldier\u2019s constitutional rights are violated in a foreign criminal trial, the Secretary of State should or shall intercede in his behalf through diplomatic negotiations. Its provision is that an American observer shall attend the trial and report to the commanding officer any violation of Article VII, \u00a7 9, of the Treaty,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> **whereup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>on that officer \u201cshall then request the Department of State to take appropriate action to protect the rights of the accused.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">(2) Mrs. Keefe\u2019s allegations made on information and belief that her husband\u2019s constitutional rights were violated were not supported by the record, which sufficiently shows that the contrary is true. A representative of our Staff Judge Advocate was present at the trial and reported no unconstitutional irregularities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commanding officer did not think it necessary to request the State Department to take action to protect Keefe\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">(3) Since appellant\u2019s premises (a) and (b) fail, her conclusion (e) must fall. The Secretary of State was not requested by the commanding officer of the area to make the representations to France which Mrs. Keefe would have him make. Even had the request been made, whether to grant it would have been within the Secretary\u2019s discretion. He was not under a legal duty to attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>through diplomatic processes to obtain Keefe\u2019s release. Quite to the contrary, the commencement of diplomatic negotiations with a foreign power is completely in the discretion of the President and the head of the Department of State, who is his political agent. The Executive is not subject to judicial control or direction in such matters. Marbury v. Madison, 1803, 1 Cranch 137, 164, 5 U.S. 137, 164, 2 L.Ed. 60; cf. United States v. Curtis-Wright Export Corp., 1936, 299 U.S. 304, 57 S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255. Accordingly we hold the petition was properly dismissed, even though it be regarded as seeking affirmative injunctive relief against the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">This action might also be regarded as one seeking an order in the nature of mandamus requiring the Secretary of Defense to reinstate the monthly allotment to the wife and children which was cancelled after Keefe\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mrs. Keefe alleged the Secretary had \u201cwithout any justification or excuse\u201d terminated the monthly payment which she \u201cis informed and therefore believes, is an allotment to which she is entitled under congressional enactment.\u201d The petition cited no statute requiring a soldier\u2019s pay and allowances to be continued in circumstances such as those shown here. We know of no such enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The petition was insufficient as a claim for reinstatement of the allotment: it falls short of being the \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\u201d required by Rule 8(a) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This rule requires the pleader to disclose adequate information as the basis of his claim for relief as distinguished from a bare averment that he wants relief and is entitled to it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AoRM\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\">. The petition alleged that the Secretary of State can, \u201cby representations to the Government of France,\u201d obtain Keefe\u2019s release. And the prayer was not only for a writ of habeas corpus, but also \u201cFor such other and further relief as to the Court may seem just and proper.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\">. \u201cAgreement Between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of Their Forces,\u201d 99 Cong.Rec. 8724 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-19\">.

Although the petition recites that these allotments have been terminated, there is no specific prayer for their reinstatement; nor was the matter dealt with in the briefs and arguments. In these circumstances, I think there is no basis even to consider such a claim, let alone to make a final disposition denying it on the ground that \u201cthe petition was insufficient as a claim for reinstatement of the allotment.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
