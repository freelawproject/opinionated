Appellant had been invited to the premises by the caretaker\u2019s wife, not a party herein, who sought to make arrangements for the latter\u2019s daughter to reside temporarily with the appellant. Appellant was following her hostess down the basement stairway with the intention of making egress from the house to re-enter her car which had been parked nearby a basement doorway. Appellant charged negligent maintenance of the stairway in that appellee had not provided a banhister at the point where appellant slipped and in appellee\u2019s failure to provide additional or more powerful lighting than existed at the time of the accident. At the close of the appellant\u2019s case the trial judge granted appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">We have carefully considered the evidence and appellant\u2019s claims with respect thereto. Granting appellant the most favorable inferences to which she may be entitled, we still find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
