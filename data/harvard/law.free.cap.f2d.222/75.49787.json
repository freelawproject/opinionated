The occasion was a collision in a fog on December 10,1942, between two tankers, the Petroleum Company\u2019s, \u201cGoldshell,\u201d and the \u201cWhite Plains,\u201d owned by the United States. The \u201cWhite Plains\u201d had been lying at Pier 62 in the North River, had backed from her berth, and with the help of tugs had swung about and was headed south; bound out. The \u201cGoldshell,\u201d bound in, left Stapleton early that morning and was on her way upstream. Both vessels were in ballast and each had a \u201cSandy Hook pilot\u201d on the bridge in charge. The collision was oif Pier 22 in the North River at 7:33 A.M. in a fog so thick at the time that the visibility was in the neighborhood of only about 500 feet. Judge Conger found that it took place \u201cwell on the wrong side of the river,\u201d by which he meant well to the east of mid-channel, probably about 500 feet from the pier ends; but, as we think the place of the collision was irrelevant, we shall disregard the challenge of the \u201cWhite Plains\u201d to this finding and, ar-guendo, assume that it was correct. The vessels came together at an angle, the \u201cWhite Plains\u201d showing her green light to the \u201cGoldshell\u201d and the \u201cGoldshell\u201d her red light to the \u201cWhite Plains.\u201d The \u201cGoldshell\u201d was blowing regulation fog whistle; the \u201cWhite Plains\u201d was not, though she did sound a signal to a passing car float, which the \u201cGoldshell\u201d heard \u201con a bearing oif the \u2018Goldshell\u2019s\u2019 port bow\u201d when the \u201cGoldshell\u201d was \u201cat about the place where the collision occurred.\u201d The \u201cWhite Plains\u2019s\u201d masthead light had been out for sixteen minutes before the collision, and .the outlook from her bridge \u201cwas seriously restricted by certain cargo which was loaded on the forward deck and by the gun tub on the forecastle head.\u201d As soon as the \u201cGoldshell\u201d heard the \u201cWhite Plains\u2019s\u201d blast she stopped her engines, when she saw the \u201cWhite Plains\u2019s\u201d green light she put them half speed astern, and she followed this with full speed astern \u201cshortly\u201d before the vessels came together. The \u201cWhite Plains\u201d did nothing until she saw the \u201cGoldshell\u2019s\u201d red light when she backed full speed astern. Her pilot did not hear the \u201cGoldshell\u2019s\u201d fog signals.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Judge Conger did not charge the \u201cWhite Plains\u201d because of her fault in failing to show her masthead light, or because the outlook from the bridge was restricted, for he thought that neither of these had any part in bringing about the collision. Nor did he charge her for her failure \u201cto sound regulation fog signals\u201d because this he held to have \u201cin no way contributed to the collision, because her single blast to the carfloat served the same purpose by telling him\u201d \u2014the \u201cGoldshell\u201d \u2014 \u201cthat there was a vessel in the vicinity.\u201d He also found that neither vessel \u201cwas operating at a speed that was excessive under the circumstances.\u201d Thus he found the \u201cGold-shell\u201d without fault, and he charged the \u201cWhite Plains\u201d with fault only because, as we have said, she \u201cwas proceeding south, well on the wrong side of the river in a dense fog,\u201d for, although at Pier 22 the North River is not a narrow channel, he held that notwithstanding this, prudent navigation required ships to keep to the right in a fog. The testimony as to that was the following. The pilot of the \u201cWhite Plains\u201d said that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>normal tendency of every pilot is to get on his side of the river. * * * I was on the wrong side of the center. * * * And the further over, the worse it would be.\u201d The second officer also said that the \u201cWhite Plains\u201d should have been \u201cnear the west, slightly to the west of the center line, possibly\u201d; and the third officer said that it \u201cwould be the proper thing for her to do, to proceed down the Jersey side.\u201d Finally, the pilot of the \u201cGoldshell\u201d thought it \u201cthe general rule any place to favor the right side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALq\">We do not regard this testimony as adequate to establish an imperative duty upon ships to keep to the right in this part of the North River. There may be customs that release a vessel from the statutory duty to keep to the right in a narrow channel \u2014 there is one for Hell Gate. Moreover, there is no reason a priori why a custom should not impose a duty, if a custom may release from one; Article 29, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 221, in substance so declares. However, in order to give any custom the force of law there must be evidence that it is a definite, uniform and known practice,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the most that can be inferred from the testimony at bar is that these witnesses thought it safer in a fog to keep to the right; they say nothing about how much it prevails as a practice. It is at once apparent that it could not contribute in the slightest to safe navigation unless it was generally followed; and, indeed, it might tend to slacken precaution generally, so far as it was not. Moreover, even if it was generally followed, it is doubtful how far it would be of much value. One of the reasons why we held the North River not to be a narrow channel<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was because there were so many piers and so much cross river traffic, \u201cproceeding in every conceivable direction.\u201d Perhaps a rule that a vessel moving north or south should in a fog keep to her right when there is no cross traffic would be beneficial; but we see no reason so to suppose as things were. Be that as it may, when the law declares that vessels need not keep to the right, as it does when the water is not a narrow channel, the opinions of navigators are irrelevant as to their duties, except there be in addition proof not only that the calling shares the opinion, but that it puts it in operation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab0\">The \u201cWhite Plains\u201d was, however, guilty of at least two statutory faults: carrying no masthead light and blowing no regular fog signals; and although Judge Conger found that these played no part in the event (as we too should be disposed to think), that is hardly enough, for, once a vessel is found guilty of a breach of a statutory rule, she must, under the doctrine of The Pennsylvania, 19 Wall. 125, 136, 22 L.Ed. 148, show \u201cnot merely that her fault might not have been one of the causes or that it probably was not, but that it could not have been.\u201d We might find it hard to hold that the \u201cWhite Plains\u201d had proved beyond any reasonable doubt that her two statutory faults did not contribute to the collision; but we prefer to base her liability upon another fault which, moreover, .the \u201cGoldshell\u201d shared with her, for both vessels were moving too fast in the fog that existed at the time. Although Article 16, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 192, only requires a vessel in a fog to \u201cgo at a moderate speed,\u201d as everybody knows, the courts have imposed a gloss upon this that \u201cmoderate speed is that at which, if the other vessel also does her duty, the vessel will be able to stop her way before they collide.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> So far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>appears, neither vessel needed the speed at which she was moving in order to keep steerage-way; and, if she chose not to anchor, as it was not unlawful to do,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we cannot say that she could not have reduced still further. In any event since neither did reduce to the speed that would have enabled her to conform to the law, she was in duty bound to prove that it was impracticable to do so. The fact that the rule is more honored in the breach than in the observance, merely means that people are usually willing to take chances rather than submit to the galling necessity of poking about in a fog; and, although the usual measure of the care demanded is that commonly used in the calling, that is not the inevitable standard. Common prudence is not always adequate prudence; the courts may and at times do condemn practices that are current in the business.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The decree will be modified by holding both vessels at fault.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AH6\">.
