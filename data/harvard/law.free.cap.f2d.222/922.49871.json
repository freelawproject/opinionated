It further appears that the Tax Court acted in conformity with its own published Rule, Rule 7(a) (2) in dismissing the petition and did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or in abuse of its discretion in ordering the petition to be dismissed and in denying petitioners\u2019 motions to set aside said order.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">It is accordingly ordered that the orders of the Tax Court herein be and they hereby are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
