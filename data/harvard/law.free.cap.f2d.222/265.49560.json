Appellee filed objections thereto. Rehearing was ordered and the case was reargued.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-32\">We have re-examined the record and have reconsidered the case in the light of the original and supplemental papers and have concluded that we erred in affirming the decision of the Examiner-in-Chief, acting for the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-33\">Consequently, the conclusion stated in our original decision of May 27, 1954, is withdrawn and this decision is submitted for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-34\">The application of appellant, Kitchen-Quip, Inc., is for the registration on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>principal register of the - mark \u201cSalad-master\u201d for use on \u201chand operated food shredders and slicers having several interchangeable rotatable cutting cones.\u201d The mark was first used by appellant in November 1946, and at the time of taking testimony had been continuously used for five years. At that time approximately 170,000 of the devices had been manufactured and approximately 160,000 had been sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Hawaii by a direct, i. e., house-to-house, method.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Appellee, opposer, the Sunbeam Corporation, manufactures and sells household kitchen appliances, including a food chopper, food slicer and shredder which is an attachment for appellee\u2019s electrically driven kitchen appliance sold under the trade-mark \u201cMixmaster.\u201d Its mark \u201cMixmaster\u201d has been in continuous use since September 1930 under registration issued August 20, 1935, for \u201cfood mixers, fruit juice extractors, mayonnaise makers, drink mixers, meat grinders and food choppers, food slicers and shredders, ice crushers, potato peelers, can openers, mechanically operated colanders, coffee grinders, pea shelters, and attachments for operating ice cream freezers.\u201d Appellee contends that the marks here involved are so similar that their concurrent use would be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers; and that \u201chand operated food shredders and slicers having several inter-changeable rotatable cutting cones\u201d are goods of the same descriptive properties and identical with appellee\u2019s food chopper, food slicer and shredder attachment to its kitchen appliance upon which opposer\u2019s mark is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Appellant denies the similarity of the marks, and also denies that the articles, possess the same descriptive properties inasmuch as appellee\u2019s food chopper, food slicer and shredder apparatus is designed to be used solely in the form of an attachment to appellee\u2019s electrically driven device known as a \u201cMixmaster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The tribunals of the Patent Office sustained the opposition under Section 2(d) of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1052(d), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">\u201c[Sec. 2.] No trade-mark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on account of its nature unless it *. * *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">\u201c(d) Consists of or comprises a mark which resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">We have given careful consideration to the arguments of counsel and to the briefs of the parties and are of the opinion that the concurrent use of the involved marks on the goods of the parties would not be likely to cause mistake or confusion or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\"> Both parties have cited many authorities to sustain their arguments, but this court has repeatedly held that prior decisions are of little value in an opposition proceeding because each case must rest upon its own distinctive facts, and that likelihood of confusion from similar marks is largely a matter of opinion. This court has also repeatedly held that the likelihood of confusion of the purchasing public, as to origin of the goods it purchases because of the similarity of marks, is the test applied \u25a0in opposition proceedings, and that the marks must be considered in their entireties. North Star Manufacturing Co. v. Wells Lamont Corporation, 193 F.2d 204, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 764, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">Appellant\u2019s apparatus is operated by hand. Appellee\u2019s apparatus is operated by being attached to an electrically operated mixer. Appellant\u2019s product is sold by solicitors through house-to-house canvassing while appellee\u2019s product is sold through retail stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Both marks contain the word \u201cMaster.\u201d One has the prefix of the two syllable word \u201cSalad\u201d while the other has the one syllable word \u201cMix\u201d as its prefix. The presence of the suffix \u201cMaster\u201d in appellee\u2019s registered mark \u201cMixmas-ter\u201d and in the words \u201cSaladmaster,\u201d which appellant seeks to have registered, does not preclude registration of appellant\u2019s mark in view of the dissimilarity of the prefixes. Certainly \u201cSaladmas-ter\u201d and \u201cMixmaster\u201d do not look alike and they do not sound alike. When viewed as a whole, we do not think the concurrent use of the marks on the goods of the parties is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">For the reasons above stated, the decision appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">JACKSON, J., sat for GARRETT, C. J.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">O\u2019CONNELL and WORLEY, JJ., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
