Joined as defendants were appellants, who are the heirs of Aehille and Delphine Cal\u00edais Lee or their descendants. Appellants answered, denying appellee\u2019s claim of ownership and asserting that they were the owners of a described portion of the property by virtue of \u201cactual, physical, open and notorious possession * * * from about the year 1909 to the present time to the exclusion of all others.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-24\">Appellee then filed a motion for summary judgment which, in effect, took the position that the possession, if any, of appellants and their ancestors had been interrupted by injunction suits previously filed and therefore could not have been \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted\u201d within the meaning of Article 3500 of the LSA-Civil Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Attached to the motion were affidavits, certified cop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ies of documents upon which appellee relied for its title and exhibits from the injunction proceedings referred to therein. Appellants filed counter-affidavits contradictory to some of the particulars as alleged in appellee\u2019s motion and further asserting the claims of possession. The trial judge, without opinion, granted the motion and entered judgment for ap-pellee as prayed for, presumably upon the grounds that the prior injunction proceedings amounted in law to interruptions of any possession in appellants and their ancestors and thereby prevented the full accrual of the necessary prescriptive period. The appeal from that judgment raises two questions: (1) was the possession of Achille Lee interrupted by the filing and prosecution of the injunction suits? and (2) if so, did that interruption operate against the community interests of Delphine Cal-\u00edais Lee?</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">From the pleadings, affidavits and attached exhibits the following undisputed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> facts may be gleaned: appellee is the record owner of a tract of land in Sections 17, 18, 19 and 20, Township 20 South, Range 22 East, Southeastern Land District of Louisiana, West of the Mississippi River; but the real dispute is concerned with a small tract having a frontage along Bayou Lafourche of approximately 22% arpents, a portion of which is situated in Sections 19 and 20, being the land claimed by appellants. Achille Lee entered the small tract of land about 1909 and he and his wife, or their descendants, had been in possession thereof since that time (see footnote 3), though without color of title. Fur trapping was profitable in this area, and \u201ctrapping wars\u201d broke out between persons or firms deriving trapping rights from the record owners of the land and those who contended for \u201cnatural\u201d rights to trap there.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">In November, 1922, Delaware-Louisiana Fur Trapping Co., Inc., filed a proceeding in equity in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Equity No. 17,129, against Pizani and others, and among the defendants were Achille Lee and other ancestors of appellants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff in that action alleged itself to have been in possession of the property for more than one year,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> setting forth its claim as lessee of the record owner, and sought an injunction preventing the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>therein from trespassing and trapping upon a large tract of land, including <em>a </em>portion of the property in dispute here. A temporary restraining order was granted November 9, 1922, recognizing plaintiff\u2019s possession and restraining the defendants from entering upon the property or otherwise interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s possession. Answer was filed' in March, 1923, by many of the defendants, including Achille Lee and other ancestors of appellants, denying the plaintiff\u2019s possession and alleging that the lands had been open to the public for trapping for more than one hundred years. After due proceedings were had, a final decree was entered on November 23, 1923, enjoining Achille Lee and other ancestors of appellants from trapping upon the property there involved or otherwise interfering in any manner with the full and quiet possession of the plaintiff in that suit. '</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In October, 1924, the same plaintiff filed a similar suit (Equity No. 17,759) against Armstrong and others, including Achille Lee and other ancestors of appellants, seeking a similar injunction with respect to other lands, including a portion of the property involved here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The complaint contained allegations of possession very similar to those' in the Pizani suit. (See footnote 5.) A temporary restraining order was granted on October 29, 1924, recognizing the plaintiff\u2019s possession \u201cfor a number of years past\u201d, and restraining the defendants from entering upon the property or otherwise interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s possession. A supplemental bill of complaint was filed in this suit on June 7, 1926, in which Achille Lee and other ancestors of appellants were also named defendants, and ultimately a permanent injunction was issued on October 13, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">As a result of these two injunctions Achille Lee and many other persons, some of them being the' same persons or the ancestors of the persons who are appellants here, were cited for contempt, personally served and some of them were punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Interruption of Achille Lee\u2019s Possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">In approaching the solution of this problem it is necessary to relate certain settled principles of Louisiana law which point up the controversy involved here. Article 3500 of the LSA-Civil Code requires that the possession upon which appellants rely must be continuous and uninterrupted for the entire statutory period\u2014thirty years in this case since appellants have no color of title upon which to base a claim of good faith prescription. The prescriptive period is subject to \u201cnatural interruption\u201d and \u201clegal interruption.\u201d Article 3516. A natural interruption occurs \u201cwhen the possessor is deprived of the possession of the thing during more than a year, either by the ancient proprietor or even by a third person.\u201d Article 3517. Article 3518 provides: \u201cA legal interruption takes place, when the possessor has been cited to appear before a court of justice, on account either of the ownership or of the possession; and the prescription is interrupted by such demand, whether the suit has been brought before a court of competent jurisdiction or not.\u201d A special statute, LSA-R.S. 9:5801, provides: \u201cThe filing of a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction shall interrupt all prescriptions affecting the cause of action therein sued upon, against all defendants, including minors and interdicts.\u201d When a suit brings either the codal article or the special statute into effect, the interruption continues throughout the pendency of the action, and a completely new prescriptive period begins at the termination of the suit. Turner, Wilson &amp; Co. v. McMain, 29 La. Ann. 298; B. J. Wolf &amp; Sons v. New Orleans Tailor-Made Pants Co., 110 La. 427, 34 So. 590; South Arkansas Lumber Co. v. Tremont Lumber Co., 146 La. 61, 83 So. 378; Stroud v. Standard Oil Co., La.App., 41 So.2d 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Achille Lee died in 1931, twenty-two years after he entered upon the property in 1909, and appellants claim one-half interest in the property as his heirs. They do not dispute that under LSA-R.S. 9:-5801 the filing of the present suit interrupted any prescription not already accrued, and it was filed on April 16, 1953, twenty-two years after Lee\u2019s death. It is seen that neither Lee nor his heirs could have possessed uninterruptedly for thirty years in their own right, so it is necessary for the present appellants to tack their own possession onto that of their ancestors to show a continuous period of thirty years prior to the filing of this suit, or since April 16, 1923. Therefore, it is clear that if the Pizani and Armstrong injunction suits operated to interrupt Achille Lee\u2019s possession, the appellants have no claim to the property as his heirs since both suits were pending after 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Appellants do not dispute the propositions just stated. Rather, they contend that the injunction suits did not have the effect of interrupting prescription because they were personal actions by a trapping lessee against Lee himself and could not affect the real rights of ownership and possession of the property. They further contend that the only purpose of the injunctions was to prevent Lee from conspiring with others wrongfully to interfere with the plaintiff\u2019s trapping rights, not to assert a claim of ownership adverse to Lee\u2019s. They rely exclusively upon Gulf Refining Co. of Louisiana v. Glassell, 186 La. 190, 171 So. 846, wherein the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that a lessee of the landowner had only a personal right and had no standing in law to bring a pet-itory or other real action<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> involving ownership or possession of immovable property.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> We agree with appellee, which urges in its brief that we need not be concerned with the \u201cinteresting but involved\u201d question of whether or not the injunction suits were personal or real, nor are we concerned with the purpose of the suits. We are called upon to determine the <em>effect </em>of those suits on the possession of Achille Lee. Whether or not the plaintiff therein was legally entitled to do so, it brought the suits and alleged that it was the trapping lessee of the <em>legal owners </em>of the lands therein described and, as such, had been in <em>possession of the </em>property for more than a year. These allegations were denied in the answers filed, but no question was raised as to plaintiff\u2019s capacity <em>to sue. </em>The final decrees, issued in contested proceedings, recognized the plaintiff\u2019s possession and enjoined Achille Lee and others from entering the property and interfering with plaintiff\u2019s peaceable possession. Insofar as this record shows, the decrees were never appealed nor were they otherwise directly attacked. They became final and binding upon Lee and his heirs, and were in fact enforced against him. Hence, we may not speculate as to what the effect on the ultimate results would have been if the principles reviewed in the Glassell case had been asserted in defense of the injunction suits. The adjudication of possession adverse to Lee\u2019s is binding upon us, Miller v. Albert Hanson Lumber Co., 134 La. 225, 63 So. 883, since the validity of a judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction may not be collaterally attacked. King v. Hester, 5 Cir., 200 F.2d 807; Folse v. St. Bernard Police Jury, 201 La. 1048, 10 So.2d 892; In re Phoenix Building &amp; Homestead Ass\u2019n, 203 La. 565, 14 So.2d 447; Public Loan Corp. v. Adams, La.App., 66 So.2d 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>It is evident that the plaintiff in those suits was asserting rights of possession derived from the legal owner and that Lee\u2019s unlawful invasion of those rights was the point at issue. We think it clear that the decrees furnish proof of a natural interruption within the meaning of Article 3517 of the LSA-Civil Code. Further, we are of the opinion that the suits asserted rights which were contradictory and adverse to Lee\u2019s possession of the property and that he was therefore \u201ccited to appear before a court of justice, on account * * * of the possession\u201d within the meaning of Article 3518. We hold that the injunction suits interrupted Lee\u2019s possession and prevented the accrual of thirty years acquisitive prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Effect on the Community Interest of Mrs. Delphine Callais Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Basing their reasoning upon their contention thht the' injunction suits were merely personal actions 'against Lee for tortious conduct on his part, appellants argue that Mrs. Lee was not cited therein and that the suits could have no effect upon her community .interest in the property. Thus, they urge, even if the suits interrupted Lee\u2019s possession, they are the owners of one-half interest in the property through inheritance from Mrs. Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">We cannot agree. In asserting an inherited interest from Mrs. Lee, \u25a0appellants are required to rely upon the \u25a0rule that property acquired by prescription during, the marriage falls into the community. Crouch v. Richardson, 158 La. 822, 104 So. 728. Mrs. Lee could not have \u25a0 acquired a possessive interest .apart from the community, for a wife cannot prescribe against the community during the marriage. McGill v. Urban, 10 La.App. 82, 120 So. 408. In Louisiana, the husband is head and master of the community, LSA-Civil Code, Article 2404, and he is its only legal representative in suits by or against the community. Mitchell v. Dixie Ice Co., 157 La. 383, 102 So. 497; Smith v. Brock, La. App., 200 So. 342; Cutrer v. Spring, La. App., 4 So.2d 106; Anderson v. Edmondson, La.App., 8 So.2d 131; Walet v. Jefferson Lake Sulphur Co., 5 Cir., 202 F.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">We have held that the injunction suits involved Lee\u2019s possessive rights in the property. In view of the principles just discussed, it. follows that Lee\u2019s possession was that of the community existing between him and Delphine Cal\u00edais Lee and that the suits interrupted prescription as to both members of that community.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-13\">. <em>Art. 8W5, </em>LSA-Civil Code: \u201cImmovables are prescribed for by thirty years without any title on the part of the possessor, or whether he be in good faith or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\"><em>Art. 8499: </em>\u201cThe ownership of immov-ables is prescribed for by thirty years without any need of title or possession in good faith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-26\">. \u201cThe possession on which this prescription is founded must be continuous and uninterrupted during all the time; it must be public and unequivocal, and under the title of owner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\">. In the trial court, appellee objected to statements in appellants\u2019 pleadings and affidavits concerning the nature and extent of their possession on the ground that such statements constituted legal conclusions rather than allegations of fact. While we are inclined to think there was considerable merit in this position, the view we take makes a decision on this point unnecessary; and we assume for the purposes of this opinion that appellants and their ancestors possessed the property physically, openly and unequivocally as owners during the periods before and after the pendency of the injunction suits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">.
