The complaint alleged that the plaintiff bought a ticket from Cleveland to Seattle by airplane, and that she was injured while on the leg of the route between Chicago and Seattle in a plane, owned and operated by the Northwest Airlines Inc. She joined as defendant the Capital Airlines, Inc., which issued the ticket; but as it acted only as an agent for the other company, we disregard it. The ticket contained two limitations; one that the passenger must serve notice of any claim for injuries within thirty days, and the other that suit must be brought within one year. The plaintiff complied with neither limitation, but, since we hold that the second was valid, we ignore the first, regardless of the scope that should be given to the decision of the Civil Aeronautics Board in In re Battista, 1952 U. S. Aviation Reports 471. Northwest Airlines Inc., which we shall speak of as the defendant, was operating under a certificate of public convenience and necessity granted by the Board, and had filed with it a copy of its regulations, one of which, as we have said, provided that the action must be \u201cactually commenced within one year after such occurrence\u201d: i. e. after the injury. Judge Weinfeld held that, as the plaintiff had not procured any preliminary ruling of the Board as to the validity of the limitation, she might not challenge it, and that consequently the action was brought too late. Judgment was entered in June, 1951, and neither at the hearing before the judge, nor after the opinion or the judgment was filed, did she ask leave to present to the Board the invalidity of the regulation, so that the only question upon this appeal is whether it was to be deemed valid until the Board, declared that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">As to this the plaintiff says, first, that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction did not extend to a regulation limiting the time within which an action for personal injuries may be brought, because the statute, \u00a7 483(a) of Title 49 U.S.C.A., did not require carriers to file such a regulation with the Board; and its jurisdiction extended only to regulations that had to be filed. To this there are two answers: first, that the jurisdiction of the Board to hear complaints as to the validity of a carrier\u2019s regulations is not dependent upon the carrier\u2019s duty to file the regulation with the Board; and second, that the statute imposed upon the carrier a duty to file with the Board such a regulation as that at bar. Section 642 of Title 49 defines the Board\u2019s jurisdiction; it is entitled, \u201cComplaints to and investigations by Board\u201d, and subdivision (g) provides that \u201cwhenever any air carrier shall file with the Board a tariff stating a new * * * rate, fare, or charge * * * or any * * * regulation * * * affecting such rate, fare, or charge, or the value of the service thereunder, the Board is empowered * * * to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such * * * regulation.\u201d A passenger\u2019s action to recover damages for personal injuries, is based upon a claim for the carrier\u2019s failure to render the agreed service, and involves \u201cthe value of the service,\u201d a part of which is the passenger\u2019s safe delivery at the agreed destination. The measure of the recovery is the difference between the safe delivery of the passenger and the actual delivery; and a regulation that limits the time within which that claim may be asserted certainly \u201caffects\u201d the value of the recovery: the substitute for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the service. Hence \u00a7 642(g) gives the Board jurisdiction over such claims, regardless of whether the carrier is under any duty to file the limiting regulation. But, even were it otherwise, \u00a7 483(a) does in fact require carriers to file such a regulation; for it covers carriers\u2019 regulations \u201cshowing, to the extent required by regulations of the Board, all classifications, rules, regulations * * * in connection with * * * air transportation\u201d; and the Board\u2019s Regulation \u00a7 224.1(e) (7) is in part as follows: \u201cGeneral rules which govern the tariff: i. e. state conditions that in any way affect the rates named in the tariff or the service under such rates.\u201d The reasons we have just given in discussing \u00a7 642 (g), show that a regulation, limiting the time within which an action based on the negligent carriage of passengers may be brought, \u201caffect\u201d the \u201cservice\u201d under prescribed rates and hence they must be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">All that remains is whether the carrier\u2019s regulation must be deemed valid until the Board declares otherwise; and, as to that, our decision in Lichten v. Eastern Airlines, 2 Cir., 189 F.2d 939, 25 A.L.R.2d 1337 is authoritative. Incidentally, it escapes at least two of judge Frank\u2019s criticisms of the majority's ruling in that case; for the regulation there involved, exculpated the carrier from liability for its negligence on the agreed route and also upon a deviation. It is indeed true that a common carrier of passengers is not free to set as short a period as it pleases within which a passenger must sue for damages arising from its negligence \u2014 the period must be \u201creasonable\u201d \u2014 but that is a quite different question from whether it may altogether exculpate itself from the consequences of its negligence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; or, indeed, whether it may limit the recovery to less than the actual loss or injury. Both regulations do indeed \u201caffect\u201d the \u201cvalue of the service\u201d; but it is a far greater limitation of the carrier\u2019s responsibilities to allow it to limit its care than to fix a period before the end of which suit must be brought. Assuming for argument that no regulation ought to be allowed to relieve the carrier of its duty, there is every reason for allowing the Board to pass upon the adequacy of the time for suit. Finally, it is irrelevant that after the plaintiff\u2019s claim arose, the Board held that all such limitations should be invalid in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-16\">.
