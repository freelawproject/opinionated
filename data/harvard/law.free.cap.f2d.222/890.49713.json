On October 29th the restraining order was violated when St. Helen was given the certificate. On December 15, 1954 the district court ordered respondents to cancel the certificate of : undesirable discharge within five days and ordered that if respondents failed so to act the certificate ,of discharge would be deemed null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-26\">The issue is whether there is any .appealable order before us. We think not. Neither the restraining order nor the order cancelling the certificate is a final order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of the orders was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>preliminary order to preserve the status quo prior to the issuance of the certificate of discharge until the district court could hold a hearing. \u201cSo long as the matter remains open, unfinished or inconclusive, there may be no intrusion by appeal.\u201d Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, at page 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, at page 1225, 93 L.Ed. 1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Certain interlocutory orders are also made appealable by special provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The orders here involved do not come close to any there specified unless they are deemed to be injunctions. Although a temporary restraining order becomes an injunction if a hearing is called after a substantial time has elapsed (evidently 20 days),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the temporary restraining order was frustrated immediately after its issuance by the giving of an undesirable discharge certificate to St. Helen. The order of the district court cancelling the certificate was stayed by order of this court on December 27, 1954. The running of the period during which a temporary restraining order can remain in force without becoming a temporary injunction was tolled by the violation of the restraining order and by this court\u2019s order staying the second order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">By dismissing the appeal this court will be able, in short order, to consider the case after the district court has had an opportunity to determine the issue involved. The district court should immediately conduct its hearing. If it then enjoins the respondents, an appeal would be in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">The appeal is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-17\">. \u00a7 1291.
