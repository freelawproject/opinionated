On waiver of jury trial the case was heard by the judge below without a jury; and, as appellant admitted the refusal to be inducted, the only ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tion before the court was the validity of classification order of the draft board. Appellant, who was a carpenter by trade, claimed to be a minister of religion of the sect known as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and to have become a minister of that sect when he was nine years of age. There was evidence before the board, however, to the effect that he worked as a carpenter 45 hours a week and devoted only 15 hours a month to religious work. There was evidence also that appellant\u2019s brother was the \u201ccompany servant\u201d or \u201cpresiding minister\u201d of the company of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses of which appellant was a member and that appellant was merely a \u201cterritory servant\u201d and \u201cBible study servant\u201d. The facts are fully set forth in the \u201cMemorandum of Facts and Authorities\u201d filed by the trial judge and nothing need be added thereto. For reasons therein adequately stated, we agree with the trial judge that the order of the board denying appellant the classification of a minister of religion may not be condemned as arbitrary or unreasonable, or as lacking support in the record, or as denying appellant procedural or other rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Appellant complains because the local board did not make an adequate and full memorandum of oral evidence given at the time of his personal appearance and because it filed with the record before the Appeals Board a letter setting forth its reasons for denying him the classification which he asked. Section 1624.2 of the regulations provides, however, for the registrant himself to make the summary of the oral information which he presents to the board; and for the local board to file with the record before the Appeals Board a letter setting forth the reasons for its .action can be no more objectionable than for a trial court to file an opinion setting forth the reasons for its action in a case that is appealed. \u25a0 The letter introduces no facts into the record, but merely gives the reason for the board\u2019s action on the basis of facts otherwise appearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
