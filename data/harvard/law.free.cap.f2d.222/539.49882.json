Northern Lumber Company sought an order authorizing service on Ida Ohlson by publication, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1655. The district judge made an order, 17 F.R.D. 432, denying the motion. From that order Northern Lumber Company appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">The order in question was not final. Absent any final order whatever, by no possible interpretation of Fed.Rules Civ. Proc. rule 54(b), 28 U.S.C.A., could an appeal be proper even if the judge had made a certificate of finality pursuant to that Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
