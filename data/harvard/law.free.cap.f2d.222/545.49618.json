Judge Clary in the district court, holding that the agreement was incomplete and ambiguous, allowed extrinsic evidence to cure those defects and supply the deficiencies. From our own study of the record we are satisfied that such rulings were proper. The record is clear also that appellee by its actions did not waive its defense that the contract was conditioned upon written confirmation. Finally, appellants contend that the trial court erred in refusing to consider their \u201cadditional reasons\u201d for a new trial. As we see it that ruling was justified. In that connection we are satisfied that all the important questions in appellants\u2019 case were fully presented on their behalf in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-23\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
