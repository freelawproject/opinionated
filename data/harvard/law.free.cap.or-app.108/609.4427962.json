J.</author>\n<p id=\"b655-3\">Defendants appeal their convictions for promoting gambling, ORS 167.122, and possession of a gambling device. ORS 167.147. The cases were consolidated for trial and appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The trial was tried on stipulated facts. Defendants Day and Benoit contracted with the owner of the Safari Club, a restaurant and lounge, to manage the operation of poker tables. Defendant Hansen also helped manage the games. Players bought poker chips from defendants for $1 a chip and could exchange them after playing at the same rate. They played a kind of poker called \u201chold-em.\u201d Dealers at each table dealt the cards, but they did not deal themselves a hand or in any way bet on the outcome. They also performed other services, such as officiating and selling chips. After each round, it was customary for the winner to tip the dealer one chip. A dealer could deal between 30-40 rounds an hour, and the tips were the dealers\u2019 sole compensation. Defendants received 25 percent of the tips that the dealers collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The statute defining promoting gambling, ORS 167.122,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the statute defining possession of a gambling device, ORS 167.147,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> require the existence of \u201cunlawful gambling.\u201d Defendants argue<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that they should not have been convicted of either crime, because the poker games did not constitute \u201cunlawful gambling.\u201d \u201c \u2018Unlawful\u2019 means not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>specifically authorized by law.\u201d ORS 167.117(15). \u201cGambling\u201d is broadly defined to include the kind of poker played here, except to the extent that the game is a \u201csocial game.\u201d ORS 167.117(4)(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">\u201c \u2018Social game\u2019 means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201c(a) A game, other than a lottery, between players in a private home where no house player, house bank or house odds exist and there is no house income from the operation of the social game; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201c(b) If authorized pursuant to ORS 167.121, a game, other than a lottery, between players in a private business, private club or place of public accommodation where no house player, house bank or house odds exist <em>and there is no house income from the operation of the social game.\u201d </em>ORS 167.117(13). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Defendants argue that the money they received as 25 percent of the dealers\u2019 tips was not income from the operation of the games, because the tips were \u201cthe proceeds of detached and disinterested generosity\u201d of the players. The record does not support defendants\u2019 characterization of the tips as gifts, wholly distinct from the poker operation. The fact that tips were not mandatory does not make them a gift. Be that as it may, the dealers provided services for the poker game and for which the players compensated them. The money defendants received from the dealers was income to defendants directly resulting from the games. The games were not \u201csocial games,\u201d but \u201cunlawful gambling.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> ORS 167.122(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u201cA person commits the crime of promoting gambling in the second degree if the person knowingly promotes or profits from unlawful gambling.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> ORS 167.147(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">\u201cA person commits the crime of possession of a gambling device if, with knowledge of the character thereof, the person manufactures, sells, transports, places or possesses, or conducts or negotiates a transaction affecting or designed to affect ownership, custody or use of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">\u201c(a) A slot machine; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">\u201c(b) Any other gambling device, believing that the device is to be used in promoting unlawful gambling activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-12\"> Defendants assign error to the court\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d that they promoted and profited from unlawful gambling. The state does not contend that we cannot review that assignment of error. Defendants\u2019 contention, in effect, is that the court should have granted their motion for judgments of acquittal, and we review the case accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\"> ORS 167.117 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">\u201c(4) \u2018Gambling\u2019 means that a person stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under the control or influence of the person, upon an agreement or understanding that the person or someone else will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome. \u2018Gambling\u2019 does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">\u201c(c) Social games.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b656-13\"> Because we conclude that the percentage of the tips paid to the house constituted house income, we need not address the state\u2019s alternative argument that the games were not \u201csocial games\u201d because defendants operated a house bank. ORS 167.117(13)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
