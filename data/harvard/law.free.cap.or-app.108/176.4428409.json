ORS 137.010; OAR chapter 253. In <em>State v. Orsi, </em>defendant pled guilty to one count of criminal mischief, ORS 164.635, and was sentenced to 24 months probation. The trial court also imposed a departure sentence of 180 custody units, instead of the presumptive sentence of 90 units. OAR 253-08-006(1). In <em>State v. Gauthier, </em>defendant pled guilty to two counts of burglary, ORS 164.225, and was sentenced to a departure sentence of 48 months imprisonment, twice the presumptive sentence under the guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Under the sentencing guidelines, a trial court must impose the presumptive sentence provided by the guidelines unless \u201cthe judge finds substantial and compelling reasons to impose a departure,\u201d which must be stated \u201con the record at the time of sentencing * * *.\u201d OAR 253-08-001. The scope of review of a departure sentence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cshall be limited to whether the sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact and reasons justifying a departure from the sentence prescribed by the rules of the State Sentencing Guidelines Board:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201c(a) Are supported by the evidence in the record; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c(b) Constitute substantial and compelling reasons for departure.\u201d ORS 138.222(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The trial court in <em>Orsi </em>stated that the departure sentence was imposed in order that defendant, who suffers from a manic-depressive condition, could undergo a mental health treatment program. In <em>Gauthier, </em>the trial court imposed a departure because of defendant\u2019s \u201congoing involvement\u201d in similar crimes; because the victim of another of his crimes had lost over $1,300 in property that had not been recovered; and because the victim came home during the burglary, which created the \u201cpossibility of harm.\u201d Neither defendant objected at sentencing to imposition of a departure sentence. On appeal, neither claims that the evidence did not support the court\u2019s finding, but each claims that the departure sentence is not justified by \u201csubstantial and compelling\u201d reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The state argues that defendants failed to preserve any alleged error. We agree. Before the 1989 enactment of sentencing guidelines, the scope of review of an appeal from a sentence after a plea of guilty was limited to a challenge that the sentence exceeded the maximum allowable by law or was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual. ORS 138.050(3). Whatever change ORS 138.222 makes in the scope of review in guideline cases, it did not change the fundamental requirement that a defendant must preserve a claim of error. ORAP 5.45(2); <em>State v. King, </em>307 Or 332, 768 P2d 391 (1989); <em>Tarwater v. Cupp, </em>304 Or 639, 748 P2d 125 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">The argument that the court\u2019s reasons for departure are not \u201csubstantial and compelling\u201d is not an error of law that may be reviewed as \u201capparent on the face of the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(2); <em>see State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 800 P2d 259 (1990); <em>cf State v. Montgomery, </em>106 Or App 150, 806 P2d 183 (1991) (question of authority of sentencing court to order car to be sold is apparent on the face of the record and could be considered notwithstanding a failure to object).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Imposition of a departure sentence is a discretionary determination by the sentencing court. OAR 253-02-001 (3) (d). The sentencing court has the discretion to decide to depart on the basis of mitigating or aggravating factors other than those set out in OAR 253-08-002. That rule provides a \u201cnonexclusive\u201d list of mitigating and aggravating factors. If a defendant does not agree that the sentencing court\u2019s reasons are substantial and compelling, it is. incumbent on him to indicate the basis of his objection. Without an objection, the sentencing court is not put on notice that its explanation or analysis may be flawed, and no error is preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
