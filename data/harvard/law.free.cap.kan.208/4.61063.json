Pierce, et al., </em>208 Kan. 19, 490 P. 2d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The principal trial in district court commenced March 24, 1969. The defendants were represented by Mr. Chester I. Lewis and Mr. Charles Scott. On the morning of April 8, 1969, the following proceedings occurred in the absence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">\u201cThe Court: Gentlemen, I have given much thought to the problems of \u2014that have come up from time to time in regard to statements of counsel which were not warranted, objections which contained more than the legal points involved, and the fact that since this trial commenced we have been unable to start on time at any session. Henceforth, if there is to be a legal objection I will expect counsel, and counsel are ordered, to merely advise the Court that they object. If I need any legal reason for the objection I will ask counsel for the legal basis. In the event that there is a request to strike the testimony in addition to the objection, counsel may also request that the testimony be stricken. But there is to be nothing further said in regard to any objections leveled against testimony or evidence \u2014 physical evidence. In the event counsel feel it is necessary to argue concerning the admission of evidence or conduct of counsel, then request may be made to the Court for permission to argue, which may or may not be granted. But no argument is to take place without permission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">\u201cAny violation of these rules \u2014 and these rules will be rules in effect during the remainder of this trial \u2014 and in the event of any violation it will be considered a direct contempt of this Court, and it is my intention to assess a fine of $25 upon each direct contempt action. I might add, what I will do is just have the court reporter tab the spot which I feel is contemptuous if it does occur, which I hope it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Later on the same day, after the taking of certain testimony, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: I\u2019d like to respectfully ask your Honor to consider the legal import of a portion of the announcement you made at the beginning of the hearing. That has to do with making a general objection only without stating the legal ground of the objection. And I believe that it is both the duty and the obligation of lawyers when making a record to state the legal ground of their objection. And I request your Honor to \u2014 over the lunch hour to reconsider one portion of your ruling having to do with making a general objection only and ask you to modify it to the extent of \u2014 without getting into any argument, but to the extent of stating the legal basis, as I fear that it would so circumscribe the ability to make a record that it might \u2014 well, you can see the implications, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">\u201cThe Court: No, I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>\u201cMr. Sanborn: Well, the implication is that you have advised the lawyers that they may not state the legal grounds of their objection. And I believe that this exceeds the \u2014 well, it exceeds the \u2014 it prevents the record stating what is essential if there should be a review for the basis upon which offers were made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">\u201cThe Court: If I need help with legal reasons I have stated I will ask counsel for their legal reasons. If not, the Court can say that I shouldn\u2019t have done what I did. But as far as I am concerned there hasn\u2019t been any strictly legal objection throughout the course of this trial. I\u2019m tired of it, and I\u2019m tired of the arguing, and rightly or wrongly I\u2019m going to shorten this matter up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Well, just so the record clearly shows that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201cThe Court: I think it would be better if the reasons were stated, but they have not been stated in most instances with particularity; and so the ruling is going to remain the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The following day, April 9, this occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Your Honor, with respect to one of the \u2014 I can only discuss one of the reasons I asked to see your Honor in chambers with counsel and with no one else present because that involves relationship of counsel and the Court, and it\u2019s not a matter of propriety for me to take it up other than with the Court and the counsel. However, I can \u2014 I know you\u2019ve announced that you have to leave right away, so I can take up the second part of what I wish to take up. And I believe that the law is \u2014 we\u2019ve done some research on it\u2014 I think the record should reflect this and I wish your Honor would take time to look at some of these things we\u2019ve extracted from Wigmore, because the posture on appeal if only a general ground of objection is stated, I believe from reading these cases is that no appeal can be taken from any ruling which states only a general ground, and that that precludes appeal. I believe further that for \u2014 on the part of the State that it is not possible to conduct the examination with respect to certain types of evidence, and I refer to those upon which there are certain grounds and circumstances which they can be admissible under which are exceptions to certain general rules; and so far as our research has disclosed it is stated that the reason counsel must and should state his specific grounds is because no Court can have at his fingertips all the various rules of evidence and rules of law; and the appellate courts have frequently said that no trial court should be expected to do that. And when you\u2019re in the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, but I want to do it. I don\u2019t mean to cut you off, but I\u2019m not going to change my ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Well, I am tiying to tell your Honor that it is part of the duty of an advocate to make a record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: It is part of the duty of an advocate to examine his witnesses and to propound any question which he deems should be asked of the witness in order to bring out the facts and circumstances of which he knows which bear a relationship to his case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">\u201cThe Court: I agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Even though he may not for some basis of legal ruling succeed in eliciting the testimony, still it quite often happens that in certain circumstances witnesses being unfamiliar with the Court and things of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>nature, they do under certain rules of evidence \u2014 and well recognized rules, I think \u2014 you have to ask certain questions in a certain way and you have to tell the Court the basis upon which you are asking the questions, sometimes the connection that it bears with other evidence to make a chain of circumstances; and to do that of course you have to rise, that\u2019s the rule of Court prescribed by the Supreme Court of this State and you have to address that to the Court. And so number one and the only part I think that I can properly discuss in the presence of anybody but counsel and the Court, and I\u2019ve thought about this very deeply. I think that \u2014 I asked for this and I discussed it with Mr. Scott already, and I don\u2019t know what they believe the law to be, but I do believe that if a record continues to be made under circumstances when there are only general objections, from that time on all appeal on those matters will be \u2014 if I read these rules right \u2014 waived. And no way to bring it up at a later time. And I want the record to show what it has now shown with this being granted by the Court. And I have tried on several occasions and I still feel that it is\u2014 and the only way with propriety and I should and I think it\u2019s the only proper way is for the other thing that it not be discussed with any other person than the Court and the lawyers. Because that particular matter I know when you take anything like that up with the Court you are supposed not to take it up in the presence of other persons. And I know that you didn\u2019t have much time, that is, for this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201cBut I\u2019ve been trying to be able to do this on several different occasions, and I just think that this must be some time put in this record and done. Because it\u2019s affecting the ability to properly as an advocate conduct the examination of some of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, my ruling is going to remain the same. I\u2019ve already spoken to that point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Later the same day the first adjudication of contempt occurred during the direct examination by appellant of a woman testifying for the prosecution. The record reflects the witness had previously given a written statement to an investigating officer concerning her knowledge of the case, to which appellant referred in the course of his examination in an effort to refresh her recollection as to the testimony desired. Counsel for defendants interposed an objection unless they were permitted to examine the document, with which position the court generally agreed. The record then reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">\u201cQ. Mr. Sanborn: Have you had an opportunity now to read\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t know if it was going to be taken away from me so I thought it would be best not to read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">\u201cThe Court: You may read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">\u201cMr. Lewis: Can she read it from the beginning, your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-13\">\u201cQ. Is that what you told the officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">\u201cA. Well, it\u2019s down here on black and white, I still can\u2019t remember if I stated it in exact words or anything like that, but it\u2019s down here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201cQ. Well does it state substantially what you told him or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cA. It states here that he had received a phone call from his wife and that she was going to have a baby and that he would have to leave. If this is \u2014 are you talking about the whole gist of the thing? But on the majority of it I\u2014 I mean I \u2014 I can\u2019t recall exactly word for word if this is what I said and et cetera, but I mean it must be the gist of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cQ. From reading that does that refresh your recollection now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cA. Not really. It still doesn\u2019t cause I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cQ. Did you tell them the best you knew the truth at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">\u201cQ. Mr. Sanborn: Miss Spencer, you did not tell Officer Davis anything in regard to the \u2014 or any suggestion that Mr. Blake was intoxicated on that evening, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">\u201cMr. Lewis: I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled. You may answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-13\">\u201cA. Oh, no, because he didn\u2019t ask me. They asked me what went\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-14\">\u201cQ. Mr. Sanborn: Thank you. You\u2019ye answered the question. And you did not tell Officer Davis anything with regard to any statement about the circumstances of Frank Carpenter\u2019s leaving on that night, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-15\">\u201cMr. Lewis: I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-16\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-17\">\"A. I have here that he left out cause his wife was gonna have a baby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-18\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: And what else did you tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-19\">\u201cA. Can I read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-20\">\u201cMr. Lewis: I object to what else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-21\">\u201cQ. Mr. Sanborn: It\u2019s perfectly all right if you read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-22\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled. Go ahead, you may read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-23\">\u201cMr. Lewis: If the Court please, if it\u2019s introduced into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-24\">\u201cThe Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-25\">\u201cMr. Lewis: I move to introduce it into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-26\">\u201cThe Court: Objection sustained. Let\u2019s admit it. I\u2019m going to let her read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-27\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Excuse me, your Honor, did she mean aloud? I didn\u2019t mean to be instructing any witness that she be doing anything orally. I thought she meant read it without saying anything. I wasn\u2019t trying to make instructions about the thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-28\">\u201cThe Court: Tab the machine, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-29\">\u201cA. Now what am I supposed to do?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-30\">Later the same day, out of the presence of the jury, as to this incident the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-31\">\u201cThe Court: While you\u2019re looking I might announce that it is with deep regret that at 4:46 p. m. voluntary statements were made by Mr. Sanborn after an objection. I consider it a violation of the Order. Mr. Sanborn is fined $25 to be paid to the office of the Clerk of the District Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-32\">The second instance of contempt occurred April 10, 1969, during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the cross-examination by defendants\u2019 counsel of the custodian of records of Wichita State University, who had been offered as a prosecution witness and had testified concerning the attendance record of a certain person (not a defendant) at the university. This particular record had been identified and received in evidence as an exhibit. We are told the witness also had before him a folder containing other records pertaining to three of the defendants to which the witness had not testified or referred; that counsel for defendants opened the folder and removed these papers. Further events are depicted in the record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\n<em>\u201cCross-Examination by Mr. Lewis</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cQ. Well, they put something in the file where you can\u2019t get a copy of your transcript until the fines are paid or something like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201cMb. Sanborn: Excuse me, your Honor. Those aren\u2019t records pertaining to this individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\u201c(Whereupon Mr. Sanborn takes papers from Mr. Lewis\u2019s hands.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">\u201cThis witness brought these but they don\u2019t pertain to his examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">\u201cMr. Lewis: Well, your Honor, he just snatches records out of somebody\u2019s hands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-12\">\u201cThe Court: Tab your file. It\u2019s a violation of the Order of the Court. Now you may proceed, Mr. Lewis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">\u201cMr. Lewis: May I get these back, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Just a moment, I\u2019d like to be' heard on this, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-15\">\u201cThe Court: The audience is to remain quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-16\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Your Honor, may I please be heard on this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-17\">\u201cThe Court: No, sir, you may not. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-18\">The following transpired later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-19\">\u201cThe Court: He wants to be heard. I want him to be heard now. That was a very rude display to try to jerk that out of Mr. Lewis\u2019s hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-20\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: If the Corut please, the records which were taken in hand were not records pertaining to this examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-21\">\u201cThe Court: And you, sir, have no authority to jerk anything out of anyone\u2019s hands in this Courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-22\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Which were records not in the possession of Mr. Lewis. They pertained to further examination in this case. And the contents of them were not subject to his inspection at that time as a matter of law. And the only means of calling this to the Court\u2019s attention was employed by counsel, meaning me. And I respectfully represent to the Court that there was no other possible way to keep those matters intact other than the course of action which was pursued, which is \u2014 I respectfully suggest to your Honor, the only course of action which could have brought this matter to the attention of the Court\u2019 and at the same time have preserved the status quo ante with respect to those records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-23\">\u201cThe Court: I want the record to disclose what occurred and the reason for the fine, the violation of the Order of this Court. Until I made the Order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>which is in the record, counsel in this case continually abused the usual procedures of the Court. There was continual harassment. The reputation of counsel in regard to conduct during a trial is well known. And it was for these reasons that the Order was issued, reluctantly so. But it became an absolute necessity if order was to be maintained throughout the rest of this trial. When Mr. Lewis picked up documents on the desk in front of the witness, which I didn\u2019t know what the documents were, it didn\u2019t appear that Mr. Lewis did, Mr. Sanborn immediately rose from his chair and proceeded to take the records from Mr. Lewis\u2019 hands. And then made statements to the Court, the part of the Order of this Court that no statements or argument was to be had with the Court without my permission, conduct in attempting to take the papers from Mr. Lewis\u2019 hand, his statements to the Court without permission, were contemptuous; and a fine of $25 is levied, to be paid by noon tomorrow with, of course, all appeal procedures and rights open to counsel whenever there is a fine of contempt of Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The third instance of contempt occurred April 16, 1969, during appellant\u2019s cross-examination of one of the defendants, John H. Manning, thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cQ. Thank you. And then you said to him, I was just as surprised as you were when you were hit, didn\u2019t you? In front of Reverend Reynolds and Dan Sawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cA. No, you\u2019ll have to ask them. I didn\u2019t say that, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201cQ. Well, you saw him get hit, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u201cA. Mr. Sanborn, if you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">\u201cQ. Your Honor, I request that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">\u201cA. Now, wait a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">\u201cQ. It\u2019s a simple question, he either saw him get hit, he can answer it yes or no, and he can answer it without making a speech.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-13\">\u201cA. I\u2019d have \u2014 you\u2019d have to tell me what you consider a hit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-14\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Your Honor, would you please advise him to answer my question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-15\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t remember the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-16\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: The question was, whether this witness now on the stand when Blake and Reynolds and Sawyer were over at his house\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-17\">\u201cThe Court: No, your question was did he see Blake hit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-18\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-19\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Answer by whatever your definition of hit is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-20\">\u201cA. Okay. Well, I saw Richard Alexander and a \u2014 I don\u2019t-know what the \u2014what the conversation was at that time, Richard Alexander was \u2014 Blake was sitting here, Richard Alexander was sitting here. And Richard Alexander hit Blake on the back of the head like that, like I do some child. Now if you construe that as a hit, I certainly did see that. And Blake saw that and felt that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-21\">\u201cQ. Yes. And you said in this conversation I am asking you about, I was just as surprised as you were when you were hit, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201cA. I don\u2019t remember saying that I was surprised as he was, but I might have said I was as surprised \u2014 I\u2019m surprised that you construe that as being hit. I don\u2019t know if I said that or not, but this is what\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201cQ. And you further said, in fact I wish you would have given me a wink or a signal and the odds might have looked a little better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\u201cA'. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">\u201cQ. He said that to you? Is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t say that to him and he didn\u2019t say that to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">\u201cQ. Neither one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\">\u201cA. That wasn\u2019t said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-12\">\u201cQ. Thank you. That didn\u2019t occur in the conversation, that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. And then you said, well, if you had hit anybody I was going to help you. You said that to him, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-13\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-14\">\u201cQ. Tell the jury if you said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-15\">\u201cMb. Lewis: Just a minute, now, your Honor. He asked a question and I am going to object. I\u2019m going to tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-16\">\u201cThe Coubt: Just a minute, Mr. Manning. That\u2019s argumentative now, Mr. Sanborn. The witness is trying to answer it, and it may not come out as quickly as you might desire; but he has a right to answer these questions in the best way he knows how.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-17\">\u201cMb. Sanbobn: With all due respect, your Honor, I do not believe the witness is trying to answer my question. I think he is deliberately evading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-18\">\u201cMb. Lewis: Your Honor, I object\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-19\">\u201cMb. Scott: Your Honor, I am going to object as to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-20\">\u201cThe Coubt: I want you to tab the machine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-21\">After assessing the fine for this contempt the trial court made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-22\">\u201cThere isn\u2019t any question but that Mr. Manning from time to time in his answers to Mr. Sanborn\u2019s questions is flippant. That is a personality contrast. And I will allow counsel to continue to ask the questions until a proper answer is given. But the demeanor of a witness and the weight to be given to his testimony is not a matter of comment by counsel. It\u2019s a matter for the jury to determine and weigh. And I consider it highly improper for counsel to state in front of the jury his opinion as to the demeanor and the weight to be given to the testimony of the witness. It is not up to Mr. Lewis, Mr. Scott, Mr. Cooley, Mr. Sanborn, or me, to decide whether a witness\u2019 testimony is correct or incorrect. It\u2019s up to the jury. And we have no right to comment upon that in front of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-23\">\u201cMy comments are not that Mr. Manning\u2019s testimony is always to the point. They are merely at times I have refused to admonish him because I don\u2019t feel that the answer called for admonishment. At other times I have admonished him. So pay your fine or appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-24\">The fourth act held contemptuous took place April 18, 1969, during appellant\u2019s cross-examination of another defendant, Fred M. Johnson, as shown by the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201cQ. What businesses, if any, are you associated with these men in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cA. None presently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cQ. What businesses have you been associated with them in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cA. We endeavored to form a partnership to \u2014 as the founding partners of a hamburger snack bar called The Brothers. And this was an attempt to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">\u201cQ. Thank you. And where was the location of this Brothers Restaurant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Can I answer the last question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">\u201cThe Court: If you didn\u2019t finish your answer, finish it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Your Honor, I am not asking him other than what business ventures they were in, and I want to find the location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-12\">\u201cThe Court: Tab the file, please. You may finish your answer, Mr. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-13\">\"A. This business was an attempt to set up the foundation whereby we could bring other young ghetto youth into some kind of economic awareness by setting up small shops around the community engaging them in their own business, assisting them via experts, expertise, that was made available to us in Johnson County, a very affluent area outside Kansas City, Kansas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: I would like to request that the reporter read my question, your Honor. This is not what I asked him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-15\">\u201cThe Court: Have you finished your answer, Mr. Johnson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-16\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-17\">\"The Court: Ask your next question, Mr. Sanborn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-18\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: I would like to know what the location was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-19\">\u201cA. The location was at 7th at \u2014 I believe 1701 North 7th Street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-20\">Thereafter, as to this the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-21\">\u201cAt 4:03 p. m. Mr. Sanborn addressed the Court without permission which is a violation of the Order previously given in this case. The court reporter\u2019s transcript was tabbed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-22\">The fifth act of contempt occurred also April 18, 1969, during appellant\u2019s further cross-examination of defendant Johnson reflected in the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-23\">\u201cA. I was assistant director in charge of neighborhood services and community action. Also liaison to Model Cities assigned to the City of Kansas City, Kansas, to assist in implementation of the Model Cities Demonstration Cities application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-24\">\u201cQ. And you were also assigned by Mr. Hamms as a part of your duties to work with the J. A. C. S. people, were you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-25\">\u201cA. No, that\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-26\">\u201cQ. You mean rather than Mr. Hamms assigning you, you volunteered to do that as you stated in your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-27\">\u201cA. That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-28\">\u201cQ. And that was a part of the duties of your job to do that, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-29\">\u201cA. No, it was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-30\">\u201cQ. Now you stated to your counsel that you were familiar with the regulations pertaining to the operation of your agency, and your agency was the Community Action Agency, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_1\">\u201cQ. And you\u2019re familiar, of course, with Memorandum Number 76 from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Community Action Program, aren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201cA. When is it dated, Mr. Sanborn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201cQ. November 21,1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">\"A. I probably had a chance to peruse it, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">\u201cQ. It\u2019s part of your duty to be familiar with these regulations as the Associate Director, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">\u201cA. I would say yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">\u201cQ. And you are also familiar with Memorandum\u2014 you were working there in \u201966, were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-14\">\u201cQ. You were familiar with Memorandum Number 18 from the same Office of Economic Opportunity to all community action programs, dated February 4, T966, weren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-15\">\u201cA. Would you please read that memorandum to refresh my recollection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-16\">\u201cQ. I first want to know if as you stated after four years of working with this program and these memoranda, you are familiar with the memoranda and duties devolving upon you as a recipient of federal funds in administering a community action program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-17\">\u201cThe Court: The witness has requested that you refresh his recollection. If you wish to pursue the line of questioning, you will refresh his recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-18\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Are you familiar with a memorandum on the subject of CAP employment assistance directive to community action agencies regarding the Job Corps?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-19\">\u201cA. Would you read that memorandum \u2014 both memorandums, Mr. Prosecutor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-20\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Your Honor, I do not believe it\u2019s appropriate to have witnesses in Court questioning the lawyers. And I\u2019d appreciate it if I could have answers to my questions rather than be subjected to an examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-21\">\u201cThe Court: Tab the file, please. Frankly, I think the question borders on the absurd. To expect an individual to remember a memorandum in 1966 is fantastic. And all he\u2019s asking is to get some information on the memorandum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-22\">As to this act o\u00a3 contempt the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-23\">\u201cAt 4:14 p. m. Mr. Sanborn made a statement to the Corut without permission, which was a violation of the former Order of the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-24\">The sixth act occurred April 21, again during appellant\u2019s cross-examination of defendant Johnson, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-25\">\u201cQ. What time of the day did you call Dan Sawyer\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-26\">\"A. We have morning staff meetings at the Foundation from 8:00 o\u2019clock until 11:00 sometimes, and 1 have my staff meeting of my staff after 3:00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-27\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: Excuse me. Your Honor, I only asked him what time he called Dan Sawyer\u2019s office. May I simply request that I have a responsive answer for my question with respect to the time he called Dan Sawyer\u2019s office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Tab your file. I asked that if the witness needed to be admonished that you merely advise me in terms only requesting me to admonish the witness. Now, answer the question, Mr. Johnson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The last act of contempt likewise occurred April 21 during appellant\u2019s cross-examination of defendant Johnson, as shown by the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201cQ. The question was, did you call the Wichita Police Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201cA. No, I instructed LaVert to call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">\u201cMr. Sanborn: I ask that the unresponsive \u2014 I ask that you ask the witness to answer the question I ask rather .than some other question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">\u201cThe Court: Tab your file, please. Ask your next question, Mr. Sanborn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">In making its rulings on the last two contempts the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">\u201cAt 3:09 and 3:16 p. m., Mr. Sanborn violated the order of this Court. Just prior to that, he was admonished that if the witness was to be told to answer the question in a manner other than which it was answered, he was merely to say, ask me to admonish the witness. Almost within a very short time thereafter, as the record will show, he requested admonishment in terms other than those directed by tire Court. He violated that, as well as the original order given in this case to which reference has been made throughout the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">Appellant raises no procedural challenge to his convictions but makes multiple substantive attacks upon them. He says the order he is charged with violating was not clear and unambiguous, as it must be before he can be held in contempt. He contends it was unlawful, being in derogation of his duty as an advocate prosecuting his case in compliance with K. S. A. 60-404 and 60-405. Finally, he asserts his conduct was not disrespectful or contemptuous to the court, nor such as to interrupt or interfere with its proceedings or with the administration of justice. It is upon these latter grounds we broadly rely for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">By statute a direct appeal from a contempt conviction is provided wherein this court may affirm, reverse or modify the judgment as justice may require (K. S. A. 20-1205). Upon such review this court has authority to examine the language or acts found to be contemptuous and determine whether they are sufficient to constitute contempt <em>(In re Gambrell, </em>160 Kan. 620, 164 P. 2d 122). Appellant was adjudged guilty of that which is classified as direct criminal contempt. Generally criminal contempt is conduct directed against the dignity and authority of a court or a judge acting judicially, with punitive judgment to be imposed in vindi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>cation; its essence is that the conduct obstructs or tends to obstruct the administration of justice (17 C. J. S., Contempt, \u00a7\u00a7 5[1], 8b.). This court defined it long ago in <em>In re Dill, Petitioner, </em>32 Kan. 668, 5 Pac. 39, thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">\u201cTo constitute a direct contempt of court there must be some disobedience to its order, judgment or process, or some open and intended disrespect to the court or its officers in the presence of the court, or such conduct in or near the court as to interrupt or interfere with its proceedings, or with the administration of justice.\u201d (p. 689.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">See, also, <em>Smith v. Clothier, </em>113 Kan. 47, 213 Pac. 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In making its seven findings of contempt the trial court uniformly ruled appellant had violated the April 8 order of the court. We cannot concur in this conclusion. Analyzing briefly, without detailed repetition, the events in question, we find in the first incident appellant was found guilty because he made \u201cvoluntary statements\u201d after an objection. Here there had been considerable colloquy between the court and counsel for defendants, and the matter of the witness reading her pretrial statement had become somewhat ambiguous \u2014 did the witness intend to read the paper aloud in the presence of the jury or silently to herself? Appellant\u2019s statement appears to be no more than a request for clarification, couched in respectful terms, made at a time when there was no objection pending before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">In the second instance, taking records from Mr. Lewis\u2019 hands, it appears the latter had without notice to or permission from anyone removed papers from a folder brought into the courtroom by a prosecution witness. The papers referred to some of the defendants on trial and had not then been used or referred to in any way but were available for the prosecution\u2019s use in impeaching those defendants in the event they testified falsely. Once the papers had been examined by the other side, their value as impeachment tools would have been dissipated. At the same time appellant retrieved them, acting in what he considered an emergency, he explained his problem to the court, again in a respectful and factually accurate manner, and, when so directed by the court, did not persist in retention of the papers but promptly returned them to Mr. Lewis. The court conceded its lack of knowledge concerning their content despite appellant\u2019s plea to be heard prior to returning them. Patently the act of taking the papers was not in violation of the silencing order. Although discourtesy by any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>one should never he necessary and is not to be condoned, appellant\u2019s act seems to have been prompted by the unwarranted invasion of then private material rather than disrespect or contempt toward the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The third instance, occurring during appellant\u2019s cross-examination of a witness in which appellant commented that the witness was evading the question, came after a <em>defense </em>objection had been made upon which the court did not rule but instead addressed itself directly to appellant in a manner inviting colloquy. Appellant had made no objection but had simply repeated his question after the witness had declined to answer concerning his own purported previous statement, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. There is no indication of bad faith on appellant\u2019s part. We do not pass on the propriety, from a purely legal standpoint, of the remarks made in the presence of the jury by either appellant or the court \u2014 we simply are unable to see contemptuous violation of the order here.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The fourth occurrence was appellant\u2019s restatement of his question to a defendant as to the location of a particular business enterprise. The defendant had already answered appellant\u2019s question but, as witnesses are sometimes wont to do, desired to do more. That this was the case is evidenced by the witness\u2019 further answer. Again appellant\u2019s remarks were respectful and not disruptive and we fail to see contemptuous violation of any order.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The fifth occurrence also came during cross-examination of the same defendant, who was employed as a supervisor by the Office of Economic Opportunity in its war on poverty in Wyandotte county, and had been one of the founders of the program. This defendant, along with the others, was charged with robbery and extortion of money from a representative of a private agency (JACS) whose mission was to recruit disadvantaged youth into the Job Corps program under OEO (see <em>State v. Pierce, et al., </em>supra). The defendant had previously testified on direct examination he had received the money as a consultant\u2019s fee and that he had no duty by reason of his job to assist in Job Corps recruitment. It was the prosecution\u2019s theory that under his employment it was his duty to do that for which he claimed the consultation fee, that is, assist in Job Corps recruitment. This point became crucial in the case as to this witness. Appellant had in his possession two OEO numbered, dated memoranda on the subject upon which he wished to test the witness\u2019 credibility on this critical issue. Upon being di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>rected to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection as to the memoranda appellant read the title of one to the witness. The witness had first indicated his familiarity with OEO policy directives but he declined to answer the question with respect to the one identified to him by title and he addressed a request directly to appellant. Appellant responded to the request by the statement, addressed to the court rather than to the witness, for which he stands convicted of contempt. It is noteworthy in passing that later cross-examination, after considerable fencing and hedging by the witness, did result in his begrudging admission that by reason of OEO policy directives with which he was familiar he did have an official duty to further Job Corps recruitment. Beyond this, however, we see no improper conduct interfering with or impeding the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The last two incidents involve appellant\u2019s requests to the court for help in securing responsive answers to questions, answers which were in fact forthcoming without embellishment once the court acted as requested. Instinctively in a heated trial experienced counsel will address their problem to the court, not only to advance their cause, but also to aid the court in making proper disposition of the matter at issue. This is particularly true in cross-examination of a hostile witness where, as here, the record reveals the examiner is justified in his appeal for help. The examiner is sometimes required to make clear to the court the reason for his request for help where the situation may not be otherwise apparent. Again we see no violation of the court\u2019s order. A judge must have power to protect himself from actual obstruction in the courtroom but at the same time it is essential to a fair administration of justice that a lawyer be able to make honest good-faith efforts to present his client\u2019s case (see <em>In re McConnell, </em>370 U. S. 230, 8 L. ed. 2d 434, 82 S. Ct. 1288).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In none of the incidents do we see hostility or defiance toward the court on appellant\u2019s part, anything abusive or insulting, undue persistence in opposing any ruling, nor do we find open or wilful misconduct which can fairly be characterized as obstructing or tending to obstruct the procedure of the trial. The brief filed on behalf of appellee virtually acknowledges this conclusion in a statement contained therein as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">\u201cAlthough the isolated comments which Appellant has chosen to abstract do not reflect conduct which interrupts or interferes with the proceedings or the administration of justice, taken as a whole and examining Appellant\u2019s prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>conduct, his comment was argumentative and was exactly that which he had been making for the eleven days since trial had started and which necessitated the order entered the day before on April 8, 1969.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">There has been filed on behalf of appellee a lengthy counter abstract in which are included numerous excerpts from the trial transcript of events occurring prior to entry of the April 8 order. It has not been shown wherein appellant\u2019s abstract is incorrect or inadequate as to the events in question and the propriety of appellee\u2019s counter abstract may well be questioned. Nonetheless we have examined it. It does reveal appellant constantly addressed himself to the court in his comments rather than to opposing counsel \u2014 a practice not always reciprocated by the latter \u2014 and despite vigorous presentation appellant remained respectful to the court throughout. It also indicates the arduous and difficult nature of the task confronting the trial judge in the conscientious discharge of his duty \u2014 aggressive advocacy on each side appropriate to the heat of the particular skirmish; each side construing everything to its own advantage and seeldng to leave nothing unanswered; frequent interruption with somewhat intemperate remarks all around; and, not the least, the presence of a volatile, partisan audience.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The judgments of conviction of contempt are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">APPROVED BY THE COURT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
