KAPLAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">This action concerns mortgage pass-through certificates (the \u201cCertificates\u201d) issued by IndyMac MBS, Inc. in several offerings pursuant to multiple registration statements and related prospectuses and prospectus supplements (the \u201cOffering Documents\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lead plaintiffs, the Wyoming State Treasurer and the Wyoming Retirement System, allege that the Certificates were issued pursuant to materially misleading Offering Documents in violation of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs sue both individual and underwriter defendants involved in preparing the Offering Documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The parties filed a stipulation of settlement on September 11, 2014,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Court approved the settlement and certified a settlement class on February 23, 2015.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The settlement terminates this case as against the underwriter defendants in exchange for a payment of $340 million.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lead plaintiffs previously reached a $6 million settlement with certain individual defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, there is a total settlement fund of $346 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The matter is now before the Court on plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees arid reimbursement of expenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-20\">\n<em>The Request for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-22\">Eight law firms that served as counsel for plaintiffs<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> request an aggregate fee award of $44.89 million,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or about 13 percent of the $346 million settlement fund. The aggregate lodestar of $24.57 million reflects 55,372 hours worked multiplied by hourly rates of between of $210 and $420 for associates and $410 to $835 for partners.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The total requested fee reflects a blended multiplier of 1.83, with proposed multipliers varying by firm (from a low of I.32 to a high of 1.92).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-24\">In addition, counsel,seek reimbursement of $2.99 million in litigation expenses. The two lead plaintiffs separately request reimbursement of costs and expenses of $27,725 relating to their participation in a mediation and Rule 30(b)(6) depositions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>There have been no objections to counsel\u2019s proposed fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ams\">\n<em>I. Legal Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Rule 23(h) permits the Court to \u201caward reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and nontaxable costs\u201d in a certified class action. The decision as to what constitutes a reasonable award rests in the sound discretion of the Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That discretion is especially capacious in this context because the Court \u201cis intimately familiar with the nuances of the case [and] is in a far better position to make [such] decisions than is an appellate court.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court evaluates a request for fees as a fiduciary for the class.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It therefore is obliged to protect the settlement fund from excessive fee awards. The party seeking fees bears the burden of establishing the reasonableness of the fee award requested, including the number of hours for which compensation is sought.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In evaluating the reasonableness of a proposed fee, a court may elect either the \u201cpercentage of the fund\u201d or the \u201clodestar\u201d method.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under the former, a court simply determines what percentage of the recovery would constitute an appropriate fee. Under the latter, a court \u201cscrutinizes the fee petition to ascertain the number of hours reasonably billed to the class and then multiplies that figure by an appropriate hourly rate.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court then may \u201cincrease the lodestar by applying a multiplier\u201d based on factors such as \u201cthe risk of the litigation and the performance of the attorneys\u201d \u2014 that is, the six case-specific factors delineated by the Second Circuit in <em>Goldberger v. Integrated </em>Resources.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Many, though not all, courts in this circuit begin with the percentage of the fund method and then perform a lodestar \u201ccross-check\u201d to \u201censure that the percentage of the fund method yields appropriate compensation without resulting in a windfall for plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">While the framework for scrutinizing fee awards is clear, the waters quickly muddy. Neither the lodestar nor the percentage method closely aligns the incentives of the class and those of its attorneys. Focusing on the lodestar encourages investment of needless hours, while the percentage of the fund method can generate egregiously high fees for the lawyers and encourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>counsel to settle a case prematurely.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Nor do the difficulties stop there. As this Court has stated previously</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOl\">\u201cIt is common knowledge that almost all securities class actions are settled. Those that are settled typically are resolved on terms pursuant to which any fee award comes out of the overall settlement fund and thus is of no concern to the defendant and its counsel. The courts asked to approve these fees thus are left without any effective adversarial testing of the claimed lodestar except in rare cases.... In consequence, courts in the position in which this one finds itself are left pretty much at sea, aided however by the principles that (1) the Court is a fiduciary for the class members who ultimately pay any fee, (2) the class lawyers\u2019 interests at this stage diverge sharply from those of the class members, (3) it is the lawyers who bear the burden of justifying the size of the award they seek at their clients\u2019 expense, and (4) the risk of non-persuasion is with those lawyers.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW2\">In the final analysis, then, the Court\u2019s determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee rests on its own experience twenty-four years in practice, including the litigation of securities cases generally and class actions in particular, and more than twenty years on the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">For reasons that will appear, the Court finds that the requested fee of $44.89 million is unreasonably high. Instead, the Court approves an aggregate fee award of approximately $28.48 million, a figure at which it arrives by cutting that portion of the aggregate lodestar attributable to discovery costs by 25 percent and by adopting reduced multipliers. The bottom-line award is still over 115 percent of counsel\u2019s original lodestar and, in the Court\u2019s view, strikes a more salutary balance between the interests of the class and the attorneys than the fee proposed by counsel. Thus, counsel will be rewarded generously.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">\n<em>II. The Requested Fee Award Would Be an Unreasonably High Percentage of the Fund</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">The Court begins in this case by considering the proposed $44.89 million fee as a percentage of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argue that the proposed fee, which would amount to 13 percent of the $346 million settlement fund, would be \u201cmodest and very much on the low end of percentage fee awards by other courts in similar [mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d) ] and securities litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In support of this proposition, they cite orders in five other MBS cases in which counsel received fees amounting to between 17 and 20 percent of recoveries exceeding $100 million.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">While comparisons to fee awards in similar cases can be helpful, their utility here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>is limited. In the first place, only one of the fee orders submitted by counsel contains any substantive analysis.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The remainder appear to be lawyer-authored boilerplate. At least one of my colleagues has expressed concern at the attempted use of such orders as precedential authority to support fee applications.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> More troubling, a non-random sample of five fee awards amounts to no more than looking out over a crowd and picking out one\u2019s friends. This approach just as easily could support a fee much lower than 13 percent.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It does not take a statistical whiz to appreciate that a more helpful, though certainly not conclusive, approach would be to consider the proposed fee in light of the <em>distribution </em>of all attorney fee awards in cases involving comparable settlement funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Counsel do bring to the Court\u2019s attention at least one such authority \u2014 a 2014 report regarding trends in securities litigation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It states that the median fee award in securities eases with recoveries between $100 million and $500 million in the period from 1996 to 2013 was 22.2 percent of plaintiffs\u2019 total recovery.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The report further notes that court-approved awards seem to be getting smaller, with the median fee in the same recovery range shrinking to 20 percent of settlement amounts in the period from 2011 to 2013.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> These figures roughly match those appearing in a 2010 study published in the <em>Journal of Empirical Legal Studies</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Focusing only on settlements reached in 2006 and 2007,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> that article found that the mean and median fees were 17.8 percent and 19.5 percent of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery in eight cases with class settlements between $250 million and $500 million.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Both reports conclude that fee awards decrease on a percentage basis as total recoveries for a class increase.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Another study, also published in the <em>Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, </em>reports somewhat more conservative findings.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> There, Professors Eisenberg and Miller examined 689 settlements in common fund cases between 1993 and 2008.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Two key conclusions emerge from their data. First, the class recovery of $346 million in this case is high \u2014 larger than 90 percent of settlements in common fund cases.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> By way of comparison, mean and median class recoveries in the Second Circuit were $119.06 million and $11.63 million during this period.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Second, Eisenberg and Miller reported smaller fee percentages for large-recovery cases than either of the two studies mentioned in the previous paragraph. For cases with total recoveries of $175.5 million or higher, they found a mean fee of 12 percent of the settlement amount and a median fee of 10.2 percent.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">How, then, to reconcile these different benchmarks? The Court ultimately concludes, in light of its own experience<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> as well as its knowledge of this case, that a fee of eight to ten percent of the settlement fund (i.e., $27.68 million to $34.6 million) would be more appropriate. Such a fee would be closer to the average figures reported in the Eisenberg-Miller study, to which several courts in this circuit have looked for guidance in recent years.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> More fundamentally, the Court finds that counsel\u2019s proposed fee of 13 percent of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery is simply too high. Taking into account the total number of lawyer and professional staff hours reflected in counsel\u2019s billing records \u2014 55,-372 \u2014 the proposed fee of $44.89 million would result in a blended hourly rate for <em>all </em>attorneys and other time-keeping staff of $810.71, which strikes the Court as quite excessive.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Any fee in the Court\u2019s adopted range would remunerate plaintiffs\u2019 counsel beyond their lodestar of $24.57 million and would reflect a more reasonable proportion of the total recovery. The Court rejects also any notion that a fee in this range would penalize plaintiffs\u2019 coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>sel. In light of the $846 million recovery for the class, it is eminently sensible that the fee percentage should be smaller than in a more typical litigation.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\n<em>III. Consideration of the Goldberger Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Irrespective of whether a court adopts the percentage of the fund or the lodestar approach, it must assess the six factors delineated jn Goldberger,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> These include \u201c(1) counsel\u2019s time and labor, (2) the litigation\u2019s magnitude and complexity, (3) the risk of the litigation, (4) the quality of representation, (5) the requested fee in relation to the settlement, and (6) public policy considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> While plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argue that the <em>Goldberger </em>factors support their proposed fee, this Court is dubious.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">(1) Counsel\u2019s time and labor. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argue that their labor on this case was intensive and state that it was not until after class certification and \u201cextensive fact discovery\u201d that negotiations led to a settlement.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The total number of hours \u2014 55,872\u2014certainly indicates that much effort was expended in litigating this case. Of course, it remains to be seen whether the total number of hours devoted to it was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">(2) The magnitude and complexity of the action. Counsel assert that the complexities of this case were myriad. The case involved over 50 offerings based on more than 74,000 loans. Those 50 offerings in turn involved 465 certificates, each of which arguably might have required expert proof as to valuation.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">(3) The litigation risks involved. Counsel assert that litigation risks in this case were high, principally because Indy-Mac is insolvent and the underwriter defendants had viable affirmative defenses. They argue also that evidence as to proof of falsity would have been complex and required expert testimony, and they highlight the parties\u2019 disagreement over the proper calculation of damages.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Nevertheless, there are at least two cross-cutting considerations. First, securities cases like this practically always settle, meaning that the risk of total non-recovery was almost nonexistent.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Second, plaintiffs in this case had the benefit of pre-existing investigations by government authorities,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>that rendered the case less risky than it otherwise might have been.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">(4) The quality of class counsel\u2019s representation. The Court is satisfied that class counsel litigated this case effectively. Moreover, the Court is mindful that this is the second largest MBS settlement on record and the largest reported settlement against underwriters in the absence of a solvent issuer,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> although the significance of these facts is not as strong as counsel would have it.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">(5) The requested fee in relation to the settlement. Counsel assert that lead plaintiffs, who are \u201csophisticated institutional investors,\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> have reviewed the fee request and find it reasonable. That may be so, but such an agreement between plaintiffs and their lawyers is no substitute for an adversary testing of counsel\u2019s assertions.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The Court already has determined that 13 percent of the settlement fund is too high a proportion of the recovery in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">(6) Public policy considerations. Counsel contend that public policy supports class actions ending in settlement and fee awards sufficient to encourage plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to bring future actions.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The Court agrees. But the ultimate determination as to the incentive effects of any given award is left to the Court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The Court has concluded that an award at or above counsel\u2019s lodestar is warranted, albeit below the 13 percent of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery sought. In the final analysis, if such an award \u201camounts to punishment ... there will be many attempts to self-inflict similar punishment in future cases.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">The Court has considered all of the <em>Goldberger </em>factors and is confident in its conclusion that an award between eight and ten percent of the settlement fund is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">\n<em>TV. The Lodestar Cross-Check Confirms that the Proposed Fee Is Too High</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">Counsel helpfully have adopted a common format for the presentation of their time records that distinguishes hours billed by category of task. These categories include (1) investigations and factual research, (2) discovery, (3) pleadings and pretrial motions (including legal research), (4) court appearances, (5) settlement, (6) litigation strategy and analysis, (7) class certification issues, and (8) appeal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">The aggregate lodestar is built upon hourly rates between $210 and $420 for associates and between $410 and $835 for partners,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and counsel have agreed to certain self-imposed rate caps \u201cfor greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>consistency\u201d across firms.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The Court finds that these hourly rates are reasonable in this context, at least in the absence of any objections or contrary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">As to hours expended, however, the Court has concerns \u2014 particularly as it relates to hours spent on discovery. Counsel report that they devoted 32,658 hours to discovery, a figure amounting to nearly 60 percent of all hours spent on this case. Figure 1 below helps illustrate the extent to which work on discovery drove the total number of hours.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> In turn, the hours devoted to discovery accounted for $12.6 million, or about 51 percent of the total lodestar.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Counsel have attempted to document exactly what tasks underlay this figure.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> They included four discovery motions,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> propounding over a dozen document requests,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> participation in 15 depositions,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and \u201creviewing and analyzing over eleven million documents produced by parties and third parties,\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> among others. Even so, the sheer number of hours here is eyebrow-raising. Assuming an industrious attorney billing 200 hours per month, the lawyers in this case claim to have spent the equivalent of 13.6 years\u2019 worth of effort on discovery. That would be surprising even in a case with many depositions; it borders on astounding in this one, in which only 15 were taken. And the astonishment is not fully mitigated by the volume of the documents produced. In a case such as this, it is likely that many of the documents consisted of duplicates produced by similarly situated defendants (especially the underwriters) as well as nearly identical offering documents and other voluminous materials, relatively few of which contained much if anything that mattered to the case.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The Court, having conducted a \u201cconscientious and detailed inquiry\u201d into whether such hours were expended \u201cusefully and reasonably,\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> and bearing in mind plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s burden of persuasion, cannot conclude that an efficient attorney \u201cwould have engaged in similar time expenditures.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">The Court therefore makes the following two adjustments to counsel\u2019s proposed fee. First, it exercises its discretion to cut \u201csur-plusage\u201d on a percentage basis by reducing the portion of each firm\u2019s lodestar attributable to discovery by 25 percent.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>This results in a revised aggregate lodestar of $21.42 million. Second, while the Court believes that the recovery for the class justifies a multiplier, it is not convinced that the blended multiplier of 1.83 suggested by counsel is warranted. It therefore reduces the portion of any multiplier greater than 1 by 60 percent across the board (i.e., a multiplier of 1.92 becomes 1 plus 40 percent of 0.92, or 1.37). This yields a new blended multiplier of 1.33 and a total fee award of $28.48 million. Updated firm-by-firm numbers appear below in Table 1. The revised award is almost 116 percent of counsel\u2019s original lodestar, 133 percent of counsel\u2019s adjusted lodestar, 8.2 percent of the total $346 million recovery, and results in a blended hourly rate of $514.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\">To be sure, these cuts represent \u201crough justice [rather than] auditing perfection.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Still, the Court believes that this revised fee award more reasonably balances the interests of the class\u2014which the Court must guard jealously<footnotemark>73</footnotemark>\u2014with the goal of adequately compensating counsel for their work on this litigation. None of the Court\u2019s statements are intended to impugn the lawyers who toiled on this case. Rather, the Court \u201chas merely done the best it can with the tools at hand, given the lack of any real adversarial testing of any of the key issues.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">\n<em>V. The Request for Reimbursement of Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel seek $2.99 million in reimbursement of expenses. The Court has reviewed this request and finds nothing objectionable. Counsel\u2019s request is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Lead plaintiffs, the Wyoming State Treasurer and the Wyoming Retirement System, further request reimbursement of costs and expenses of $27,725. These expenses relate to preparation for a mediation, attending the mediation, and preparing for (and attending) Rule 30(b)(6) depositions.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Lead plaintiffs recognize that the Court has denied such applications previously,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> but they assert that, unlike plaintiffs in these prior cases, they have explained adequately the basis for their request.
