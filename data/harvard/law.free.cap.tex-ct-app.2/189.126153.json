Witness never saw the accused do anything about the house except to take the place of his barkeeper whenever the latter went out; but never saw any one but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>accused do that. The house had the general reputation of being a common resort for lewd women; that he always saw such women there, and always saw the accused there. The house was generally called a \u201c dance-house,\u201d but witness never saw the accused exercise authority in regulating the dancing, though he sometimes saw him talking to the guests.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-4\">Another witness stated that the house was reputed to be a place where a man could go and dance with prostitutes for partners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">A third witness stated that the reputation of the house was that of a house of public prostitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">The defense introduced no witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">The verdict was guilty, and assessed a fine of $225.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">Accused moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, but both motions were overruled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-9\"><em>Walton, Green &amp; Hill, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A87\">cited <em>Stephanes </em>v. <em>The State, </em>21 Texas, 206.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-10\"><em>George McCormick, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-11\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6Po\">The appellant was tried and convicted for keeping a disorderly house. The complaint and the information based upon it stated the offense as defined in the-Code. Pasc. Dig., Arts. 2027, 2028. The accused lived at the house and kept a bar there and the evidence certainly established a <em>prima facie </em>case against him, which he did not attempt to rebut. The case of <em>Couch </em>v. <em>The State, </em>24 Texas, 559, is similar in many respects. There are no questions raised in the case which are considered well taken, or of sufficient importance to require a reversal. Most of them have frequently been passed upon and settled by the supreme court and by this court. See <em>Cora Morris </em>v. <em>The State, </em>38 Texas, 603; <em>Mary Sylvester </em>v. <em>The State, </em>42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Texas, 496; <em>Ada Thompson </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Texas Ct. of App. 56, and <em>Jennie Thompson </em>v. <em>The State, </em>decided at the present term, <em>ante, p. </em>82.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The information charged that the offense was <em>unlawfully </em>committed, and, therefore, met and obviated the objection which was otherwise held good in the case of <em>Stephanes </em>v. <em>The State, </em>21 Texas, 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
