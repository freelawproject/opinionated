Morton, marshal of Dallas, under a writ of <em>copias pro fine </em>issued for the enforcement of a fine adjudged against him by the mayor\u2019s court of said city of Dallas. He sued out a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>and was carried before the county court of Dallas county, and the county court, on the hearing of the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>refused to release the appellant from the custody of said marshal. Thereupon the appellant gave notice of appeal to this court, and entered into a recognizance to perfect his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab8\">The assistant attorney general has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, because the recognizance does not state any offense known to the law; and, second, because the record does not show that appellant was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is granted. This court cannot acquire jurisdiction on appeal on the trial of the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in this case, unless the appellant is shown to be in the custody of the marshal of the city of Dallas. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">\n<em>Dismissed,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
