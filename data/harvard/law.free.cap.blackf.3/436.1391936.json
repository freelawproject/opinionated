But his acts, within the scope of his powers, are obligatory upon Ms principal, and those acts may be proved in the same manner as if dono by the principal. The agent, acting within his authority, is substituted for the principal in every respect; and his statements, which form apart of the <em>res gestie, </em>maybe proved.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>The Brig Burdett, </em>9 Peters, 689.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
