The applicant testified that his two uncles had no daughters. He claimed to have lived in the same village ih China as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>his \u2022 two uncles, and the difference between the ages of the two daughters as given by the father and his own age was not so great that he would not have known them had the relationship which he claimed existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">The District Court therefore found that there was some substantial evidence upon which the order of deportation was based and denied the petition as beyond its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">The deeree of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
