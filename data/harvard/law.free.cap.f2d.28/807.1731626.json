It made part of its corpora^ tion and its trade-name, \u201cTerminal,\u201d suggested by the name of the building of its first location. For 20 years it has continued to expand and grow and establish shops in railroad stations, large hotels, and office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>buildings, using the word \u201cTerminal\u201d in all its window signs and advertising. In 1917 it opened its first separate ladies\u2019 hair-dressing establishment, and since then has developed an extensive business in this field. At all times it has used the word \u201cTerminal.\u201d The business has grown so that, on the date of the commencement of this suit, it had 31 shops, and it had under lease additional space to make a total of 38 places of business. The gross business in 1927 was $2,409,000, of which $750,000 represented the proceeds from the ladies\u2019 hair-dressing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">When the plaintiff commenced business, it organized to improve the barber business along more sanitary lines. It eliminated the then universal use of the shaving mug and a cake of soap, one brush, comb, and towel used by several customers. It provided for cleanliness of the barber and cleanliness toward the customer by a novel service of individual brush, comb, and towel. Other sanitary conditions within the shop were provided. This gained for the plaintiff a reputation which helped to establish and expand its business. Now its shops and salons are located in New York, Michigan, Illinois, and Ohio. The plaintiff advertised, using the name \u201cTerminal,\u201d extensively 'in magazines and newspapers, not only in the city of New York, but elsewhere, and, during the past three years, has expended annually $75,000 for such purpose. It has no shops in New Jersey, where the defendants are located, but it advertises extensively. in trains used by commuters of New Jersey; also in newspapers in that state. The affidavits establish that the plaintiff\u2019s reputation for \u201cterminal service\u201d has become such that there constantly come to it proposals unsolicited from important cities in the United States, and from owners of buildings, stores, and hotels, desiring to introduce its service in their enterprises. This results in the plaintiff\u2019s ability to secure advantageous leases, frequently without competition, and is said to be based upon the high reputation for the type of service rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The defendants, copartners, on June 22, 1927, filed a certificate for doing business under the assumed name of \u201cTerminal Beauty Parlors\u201d in Hudson county, and on August 26, 1927, in Essex county, New Jersey, and in New York county, New York, on January 24, 1928. At the time of the commencement of this suit, they operated a place of business as the \u201cTerminal Barber Shop\u201d in Union City, N. J., \u201cTerminal Beauty Parlors,\u201d Union City, N. J., \u201cTerminal Beauty Parlors,\u201d in West New York, N. J., \u201cTerminal Beauty Parlors,\u201d Jersey City, N. J., \u201cTerminal Beauty Parlors,\u201d Newark, N. J., and \u201cTerminal Beauty Parlors,\u201d New York City. All of these, except the shop at Union City, were opened after June, 1927. These places of business are located within a few miles of Jersey City, which is but across the Hudson river from the Hudson Terminal Building in New York City. The defendants advertised their place of business in New York, when it was opened about the end of March, 1928, at 3652 Broadway, New York City, as an uptown branch of the \u201cTerminal Beauty Parlors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">In October, 1909, the defendant Lenneper opened a barber shop on the west side of Eighth avenue and 128th street, New York City, and in his affidavit swears that he conducted this business for 2 years as the \u201cTerminal Barber Shop.\u201d In 1911 he moved to Hoboken, N. J., where he went to work for another barber for 1 year. Thereafter he established himself, using the name \u201cTerminal Barber Shop,\u201d in Hoboken, N. J., but sold this shop and then worked in New York City for another for 3 years. In 1918 he opened a shop at Union Hill, N. J., and did business under the name of \u201cTerminal Barber Shop\u201d for 2% years. In 1921 he sold out his business and in 1923 again embarked in business as the \u201cTerminal Barber Shop\u201d at Union Hill, N. J. He conducted this shop for about 2 years and was forced to vacate the premises because, as he says, of a leaky condition in the cellar. He opened across the street as the \u201cTerminal Barber Shop,\u201d and in 1926 opened his first ladies\u2019 hair-dressing establishment as the \u201cTerminal Beauty Parlor\u201d at Union City, N. J. Thereafter in 1927 he became associated with Zoberg. In January, 1928, after the commencement of this suit, they formed a corporation and transferred to it the business of the copartnership, consisting of four beauty parlors and one barber shop in New Jersey. There is evidence of confusion in the trade, both of customers and sellers of barbers\u2019 supplies. When the defendants opened their shop in New York, some of the bills for construction work were sent to the plaintiff. The defendant Lenneper explains the original use of \u201cTerminal\u201d by saying that, when he opened his first New York shop, a plumber suggested the name because it was a term known in the plumbing business. This is contradicted by an affidavit of an experienced plumber.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The District Judge granted an injunction, but confined its restraining provisions to New York state, and denied the prayer for injunctive relief in the state of New Jersey. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>As to New Jersey,-it is apparent to us that the facts present the plaintiff and defendants competing under the same name in the same market. Newark is but 7 miles from Jersey City and Union Hill, and West New York 3 to 4 miles. A tunnel connects Jersey City with the Hudson Terminal Building, and the time of transportation is but 3 minutes. Jersey City, in time, is nearer to the plaintiff\u2019s downtown shops than Forty-second street, New York. The uptown terminal of the Hudson tubes is in close proximity to the establishment of the plaintiff at the Pennsylvania Hotel. New York City newspapers have a large circulation in New Jersey, and thus the plaintiff\u2019s advertisements are furnished to New Jersey patrons. New Jersey is a part of the New York retail market, and the geographical or state line in no way interferes with this conclusion. The plaintiff has carried on a continuous campaign of advertising, directed to the patronage of residents of New Jersey. The record establishes that the plaintiff has a very substantial business in New Jersey, both in its barber shops and ladies\u2019 hair-dressing establishments. Records were kept of women securing hair treatment, and from such records one-third of the customers of the ladies\u2019 hair-dressing establishments gave New Jersey as their residence. It is clearly shown that patrons come from all-parts of New Jersey to the plaintiff\u2019s establishment. The defendants, carrying on their business in New Jersey in such close proximity to New York, using the name \u201cTerminal,\u201d have come into sharp competition with the plaintiff, and are endeavoring to capture, not alone the plaintiff\u2019s established business, but the business promised to it by normal expansion. As stated, the defendant Lenneper several times ceased using the term \u201cTerminal\u201d when he closed his shop. The plaintiff has constantly extended the use of its name within the territory where the defendants are tnow carrying on business, and there was extensive knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s name and what it stood for in the matter of efficient service in the field where the defendants subsequently came to establish themselves. \u2022 As a subsequent user of the name, endeavoring to take the benefit of the reputation of the plaintiff\u2019s goods in this way, or to forestall the extension of its trade, they committed an injury for which equity will afford injunctive relief, even though the trade-mark has not been registered under the statute. The defendants are unquestionably attempting <em>to </em>benefit by the reputation of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"AsWi\">In Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U. S. 403, 416, 36 S. Ct. 357, 361 (60 L. Ed. 713), the Supreme Court said that \u201csince it is the trade, and not the mark, that is to be protected, the trade-mark acknowledges no territorial boundaries of municipalities or states or nations, but extends to every market where the trader\u2019s goods have become known, and identified by his use of the mark,\u201d and further that, where two parties independently are employing the same mark upon goods of the same class, in separate markets, one wholly remote from the other, prior appropriation is immaterial, unless it appears that the second adopter has selected the mark with the same design inimical to the interest of the first user, so as to take the benefit of his reputation for his goods or to forestall the expansion of his trade. Whether the name of a corporation be recorded as a trade-mark or trade-name, or both, the law affords protection against its appropriation, where the general purpose thereof is to obtain a competitor\u2019s business, which he has established or which might be justly in the field of the expansion of his business. American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, 269 U. S. 372, 46 S. Ct. 160, 70 L. Ed. 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">In Sweet Sixteen Co. v. Sweet \u201c16\u201d Shop, Inc. (C. C. A.) 15 F.(2d) 920, the plaintiff had established its business for women\u2019s retail clothing under the name \u201cSweet Sixteen Co.,\u201d with shops in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, and Seattle. The defendant incorporated under the laws of Utah and began planning the establishment of a store in Salt Lake City using a similar name \u201cSweet \u201816\u2019 Shop.\u201d The argument was there advanced that the defendant had started in a distant city, but the court held that although the plaintiff had no shop in Utah, it should be protected by injunction against the use by defendant of its name. In Buckspan v. Hudson Bay Co. (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 721, an injunction was granted against the name of \u201cHudson Bay Fur Company\u201d by a firm in Dallas, Tex., where the plaintiff had no place of business, and where the defendant was engaged in the sale of manufactured furs and fur garments, whereas the plaintiff, which had been in existence since 1670, had estabO . ' lished a world business, with a valuable good will and having periodical sales in London, which were attended by buyers from the United States, and where the plaintiff dealt in raw furs. The defendant had been in business for more than 10 years, but the court held that the trade-name, having a deceptive similarity to that of the plaintiff, enabled the defendant to sell furs as those of the plaintiff, thereby deceiving the public. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>tiff had no place of business in the United States, but had a market here. In the ease under consideration, the plaintiff had no place of business in New Jersey, but had patrons and a good will established there. See, also, Rice &amp; Hutchins v. Vera Shoe Co. (C. C. A.) 290 F. 124; Hub Clothing Co. v. Cohen, 270 Pa. 487, 113 A. 677; British-American Tobacco Co. v. British-American Cigar Stores Co. (C. C. A.) 211 F. 933, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">United Drug Co. v. Rectanus Co., 248 U. S. 90, 39 S. Ct. 48, 63 L. Ed. 141, relied upon by the court below in denying part of the relief asked, is distinguishable. The decision there was grounded upon the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor had never, either by sales agency or by advertising, made any attempt to make her product or its name known outside of the New England States, and had never made any effort to extend her trade to Kentucky, where the defendant carried on a valuable trade under, the name of \u201cRex\u201d for many years, before the plaintiff first attempted, with full knowledge of the defendant\u2019s activities, to extend her business into that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">It is argued that, because the defendants formed a New Jersey corporation in January, 1928, it is an indispensable party, and the plaintiff must proceed in the New Jersey courts to obtain relief against it. The .defendants have turned over their business to the New Jersey corporation, and are its principal stockholders and officers. Some of the stoek is not held in their name, but held for them. If they continued doing business as a corporation, they would be active in the unfair competition, and continue in the commission of wrong against the plaintiff. Their continuance as officers and interested stockholders in the new corporation makes them, for all practical purposes, the corporation, managing and controlling its affairs as if it were still a partnership. They may not pirate plaintiff\u2019s business in New York or New Jersey, using the word \u201cTerminal,\u201d without being personally responsible. To permit it would be to allow the corporation to be a successful cover for interested individuals. General Electric Co. v. Alexander (C. C. A.) 280 F. 852; Saxlehner v. Eisner (C. C. A.) 147 F. 189; National Cash-Register Co. v. Leland (C. C. A.) 94 F. 502; Poppenhusen v. Falke, Fed. Cas. No. 11,279 (So. Dist. N. Y.).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">\u201cAn executive officer of a corporation \u2018cannot shield himself behind an artificial and sometimes irresponsible creation from the consequences of his own acts, even though performed in the name of an artificial body.\u2019 \u201d Hitchcock v. American Plate Glass Co. (C. C. A.) 259 F. 948. No relief is sought here against the New Jersey corporation and an injunction against the defendants only is asked. After 20 years of industry and erudition, and the expenditure of large sums of money, plaintiff has established an extensive and valuable good will, using the mark \u201cTerminal\u201d throughout this period of years. It has become so well defined and associated with the plaintiff\u2019s business that to permit another to use the word \u201cTerminal\u201d would be a serious and constant injury to the plaintiff\u2019s business, and must be prohibited. The harm done is irreparable, and the plaintiff must be protected in the time intervening between its application for a preliminary injunction and final hearing. The decree will be modified, so as to enjoin the defendants\u2019 use of the word \u201cTerminal,\u201d alone or in combination with other words, as a trade-name under which they shall conduct their business in both New Jersey and New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Decree modified accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
