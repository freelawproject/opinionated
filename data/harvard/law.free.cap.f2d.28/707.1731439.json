This is an appeal from a judgment of the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia, at Richmond, in an action at law wherein Annie Scott Willis, the appellee, was plaintiff, and the Continental Casualty Company, appellant, was defendant below. The parties will be referred to here, respectively, as plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Plaintiff was the beneficiary in an,accident insurance policy, issued to Bessie Milton Willis, her sister. Insured was a trained nurse. The pertinent clauses of the policy are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">\u201cThe insurance given by this policy is against loss of life, limb, limbs, sight or time resulting from personal bodily injury (suicide or self-destruction while either sane or insane not included) which is effected solely and independently of all other causes by the happening of an external, violent and purely accidental event, all in the manner and to the extent hereinafter provided. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">\u201cBlood poisoning or septicaemia resulting directly from bodily injury shall be deemed to be included in the term \u2018bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Insured in the practice of her profession contracted septicaemia, and went to a hospital in Richmond, where she died after an illness of about three weeks. On first being examined by physicians an abrasion or break was found in the skin of the ball of the index finger of deceased\u2019s right hand, and it was the uncontradicted evidence that her death was caused by septieeemia. It is admitted that the germs of the disease entered through the abrasion on her finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">It is admitted that the policy was in force at the time of the death of insured, and that the requirements of the policy as to notice and proof of death had been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">There was evidence to the effect that insured had repeatedly used a disinfectant, the use of which was usual and proper, and which ordinarily would not cause such an abrasion or puncture of the skin, as insured had on her finger, but which might have produced such a result when improperly used or when used by one whose skin was unusually tender or especially susceptible to cracking from its use. The evidence on this question tended to prove that the break in insured\u2019s skin on her finger was caused by a puncture rather than by the use of the disinfectant.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">In his charge to the jury, the trial judge said: \u201cIf the jury are satisfied by a clear preponderance of the evidence that there was an injury, visible external injury, as a result of which a germ was taken into the system which eventually resulted in death, and that that injury occurred either as a result of contact with some other object, unintentional contact, or that it resulted from the use of some medicine or antiseptic solution, which in the ordinary course of events in its careful use would not have occurred, then it is my opinion the jury would, in such circumstances, be justified in finding a verdict for the plaintiff. \u2019 \u2019 To this charge, the attorneys for the defendant objected, and the alleged error in the charge is the main point relied upon here.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">The court also refused to instruct the jury, on motion of defendant\u2019s attorneys, that: \u201cIf insured washed her hands in Lysol, intending to wash her hands in Lysol, and doing everything and nothing more than she intended to do, there was no liability upon the defendant company, even though the result of such washing was unexpected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">The insured was a trained nurse by profession, and it can readily be understood how the provision as to septicsemia, commonly known as blood poisoning, would especially appeal to one following a profession, peculiarly liable to the attacks of this disease. The contract of the policy was to insure against this disease if \u201cresulting directly from bodily injury * * * effected * * * by the happening of an external, violent, or purely accidental event. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">The elaborate argument of appellant\u2019s counsel is based on what we conceive to be a false premise, that is, that the language in the policy, \u201cpersonal bodily injury which is effected * * * by the happening of an external, violent and purely accidental event,\u201d has exactly the same significance as the standard expression, \u201cbodily injury effected by violent, external and accidental means.\u201d Surely \u201caccidental event\u201d does not have, nor can it possibly have, the same significance or meaning as \u201caccidental means. \u2019 \u2019 An event is the culmination or end that the \u201cmeans\u201d may have produced or brought about. There is the same relation^ship between means and the event that results, that there is between cause and effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The means may not have been in any way accidental, yet the event because of some unknown and unknowable factor highly accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">An \u201caccident\u201d as defined by Webster is: \u201cAn event which takes place without one\u2019s foresight or expectation; an event that proceeds from an unknown cause, or is the unusual effect of a known cause, and therefore not expected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">This definition of an accident has received the approval of many courts (Fidelity <em>&amp; </em>Casualty Co. v. Stacey\u2019s Ex\u2019rs [C. C. A.] 143 F. 271, 274, 5 L. R. A. [N. S.] 657, 6 Ann. Cas. 955), and it has been supplemented by the Supreme Court\u2019s declaration that an \u201caccidental event\u201d is one \u201c <em>3 </em>* * \u2018happening by chance; unexpectedly taking place; not according to the usual course of things;\u2019 or not as expected.\u201d U. S. Mutual Acc. Ass\u2019n v. Barry, 131 U. S. 100, 9 S. Ct. 755, 33 L. Ed. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"Adg6\">The deceased was insured against septieeemia resulting from the happening of an external, violent, and purely accidental event, and whether the breaking of the skin of the deceased\u2019s finger was caused by pricking it, or was the unexpected and unusual result of the proper use of the disinfectant, in either ease it was an accidental event, and came within the meaning of the words of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">But even were attorneys for the defendant correct in their assumption that accidental event and accidental means have \u201cexactly the same significance,\u201d yet under the holding in the case of the Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Dodge, 11 F.(2d) 486; recently decided by this court, the defendant would be liable. In that case, in a well-reasoned opinion, Judge Parker says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">\u201c \u2018Accidental\u2019 is defined in Webster\u2019s Dictionary as \u2018happening by chance, or unexpectedly; taking place not according to the usual course of things; casual; fortuitous; as an accidental visit.\u2019 And in defining the term \u2018accidental means\u2019 Corpus Juris says: \u2018Where the effeqt is not the natural and probable consequence of the means which produce it \u2014 an effect which does not ordinarily follow and cannot be reasonably anticipated from the use of the means, or an effect which the actor did not intend to produce and which he cannot be charged with a design of producing \u2014 it is produced by accidental means.\u2019 1 C. J. 427.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">\"Cooley\u2019s Briefs on Insurance, at page 3156, gives practically the same definition. Judge Sanborn, speaking for the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, says: \u2018An effect which is the natural and probable consequence of an act or course of action is not an accident, nor is it produced by accidental means. It is either the result of actual design, or it falls under the maxim that every man must be held to intend the natural and probable consequence of his deeds. On the other hand, an effect which is not the natural or probable consequence of the means which produced it, an effect which does not ordinarily follow and cannot be reasonably anticipated from the use of those means, an effect which the actor did not intend to produce and which he cannot be charged with the design of producing, * * * is produced by accidental means. It is produced by means which were neither designed nor calculated to cause it. Such an effect is not the result of design, cannot be reasonably anticipated, is unexpected, and Is produced by an unusual combination of fortuitous circumstances; in other words, it is produced by accidental means.\u2019 Western Com. Travelers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Smith, 29 C. C. A. 223, 85 F. 401, 40 L. R. A. 653, approved in \u00c6tna Ins. Co. v. Brand (C. C. A. 2d) 265 F. 6 [13 A. L. R. 657].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">\u201cMr. Justice Blatehford, speaking for the Supreme Court of the United States, says: \u2018If a result is such as follows from ordinary means, voluntarily employed, in a not unusual or unexpected way, it cannot be called a result effected by accidental means; but if, in the act which precedes the injury, something unforeseen, unexpected, unusual occurs, which produces the injury, then the injury has resulted through accidental means.\u2019 Mutual Accident Ass\u2019n v. Barry, 131 U. S. 100, 9 S. Ct. 755, 33 L. Ed. 60.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">The Dodge Case is cited and approved in Newsoms v. Commercial Casualty Ins. Co., 147 Va. 471, 137 S. E. 456, 52 A. L. R. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">The Barry Case, supra, is the leading ease in the Supreme Court on this question, and undoubtedly sustains the position taken by this court in the Dodge Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">The cause of the death of the insured was septicjemia, which was directly caused by the entrance of a germ through the broken or punctured skin of insured\u2019s finger; the break or puncture was directly caused by violent, external, and purely accidental means within the meaning of the policy, which was especially made to cover septicasmia contracted under precisely the conditions existing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-16\">The case was properly submitted to the jury, and there was ample evidence upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>which to base the verdict. There was no error in the charge of the learned trial judge, or in the trial, and the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
