Thereafter, the defendant appealed from the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>of conviction to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>65 Conn. App. 126, 128, 782 A.2d 175 (2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We then granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court was not required to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>258 Conn. 930, 783 A.2d 1032 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following relevant facts, as set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cIn the evening of May 12, 1995, the defendant went to a bar in Bridgeport, where he consumed several beers and brandy, and met Timothy Solek. The two left for Solek\u2019s apartment, where they consumed more alcohol. They later returned to the bar. They then went to the home of the victim, an acquaintance, and the three played cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u201cAt some point in the evening, the defendant left the room to use the bathroom. When he returned, he found the victim and Solek arguing and pushing each other. The victim yelled at Solek to leave. The defendant then grabbed the victim and placed her in a choke hold. The victim resisted, gasped for air and, finally, fell to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">\u201cSolek then kicked the victim in the head repeatedly and hit her in the head with a clothes iron three or four times. He also stabbed her repeatedly with a can opener. The defendant took off his pants and fondled the victim\u2019s breasts. Solek had taken off his pants, covered the victim\u2019s face with a towel, masturbated, and forcibly had anal and vaginal intercourse with her. Before the defendant and Solek left, the defendant took the vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tim\u2019s Walkman. They returned to Solek\u2019s apartment, where the defendant borrowed a pair of pants. At about 2:30 a.m., Solek called the police and accompanied the responding officer to the victim\u2019s apartment, where she was found dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u201cThe defendant subsequently was arrested at his girlfriend\u2019s home, where police recovered a pair of his jeans covered with the victim\u2019s blood. The victim\u2019s blood also was found under the defendant\u2019s fingernails and on his left hand. The defendant gave a signed, written statement at the police station. In the statement, the defendant admitted that he and Solek had been at the victim\u2019s apartment, that he got involved in a fight between Solek and the victim, and that he strangled her.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the police detectives who took the defendant\u2019s statement asked whether he had killed the victim, the defendant stated, \u2018I guess you could say we both did, but not on purpose.\u2019 He further admitted in the statement that he took off his pants and that, although he did not have sex with the victim, he fondled her breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u201cAt trial, the state put on evidence that showed that the victim\u2019s death was caused by strangulation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>defendant testified in his own behalf. [See footnote 24 of this opinion.] The jury, however, found him guilty, and [the defendant\u2019s] appeal followed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 128-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly had refused to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 128. The Appellate Court applied the conjunctive four prong test set forth by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), under which \u201ca defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense if he can demonstrate compliance with each of four conditions: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 130; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>228 Conn. 147, 152, 635 A.2d 777 (1993). Although both parties conceded that the second prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test had been satisfied, the state argued that the defendant failed to meet the first, third and fourth prongs of the test. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The Appellate Court declined to address the state\u2019s argument that, by not providing \u201cin his request to charge any discussion of the evidence that would support an instruction on manslaughter,\u201d the defendant failed to satisfy the first prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>Id. The Appellate Court, relying on its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 Conn. App. 51, 60 n.5, 644 A.2d 923 (1994), concluded that, because the state did not make that claim in the trial court, it could not do so on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The Appellate Court then shifted its analysis to the third and fourth prongs of <em>Whistnant. </em>It relied on its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sotomayor, </em>61 Conn. App. 364, 379, 765 A.2d 1, appeal dismissed, 260 Conn. 179, 794 A.2d 996, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 922, 123 S. Ct. 313, 154 L. Ed. 2d 212 (2002), for the proposition that, \u201c[f]or the third and fourth conditions of <em>Whistnant </em>to be satisfied, there must be <em>sufficient </em>evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, to justify a finding of guilt of the lesser offense.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 133. Applying this rule, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that his statement to the police, as well as the lack of any evidence of planning or premeditation, constituted sufficient evidence to justify an inference that the defendant \u201chad intentionally beaten the victim into submission so that he could sexually assault her and that this resulted in her death.\u201d Id., 133-34. The Appellate Court, instead, placed greater emphasis on the defendant\u2019s position at trial, namely, that \u201che not only did not intend to kill the victim, but that he also never intended to injure her,\u201d than on the inferences that could be drawn from his statement to the police.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 134. Ultimately, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the Appellate Court concluded, even \u201c[v]iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant . . . his state of mind was not sufficiently in dispute so as to entitle him to a jury instruction on manslaughter in the first degree\u201d; id.; and, accordingly, affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction. Id., 144. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>260 Conn. 730, 744\u201446, 799 A.2d 1056 (2002), we reiterated the well established principles governing whether a defendant is entitled to a lesser included offense instruction under the <em>Whistnant </em>test: \u201cThis court repeatedly has recognized that \u2018[t]here is no fundamental constitutional right to a jury instruction on every lesser included offense . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>[supra, 179 Conn. 583]. Rather, the right to such an instruction is purely a matter of our common law. \u2018A defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser [included] offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u2019 Id., 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u201c \u2018In considering whether the defendant has satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>179 Conn. 588, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser included offense. ... On appeal, an appellate court must reverse a trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction if we cannot as a matter of law exclude [the] possibility that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense.\u2019 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 260-61, 681 A.2d 922 (1996).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The <em>Whistnant </em>test is conjunctive, requiring satisfaction of all four prongs. The defendant claims that he has done so. The state contends that the defendant failed to satisfy the first, third and fourth prongs of the test. Inasmuch as each prong has spawned its own voluminous body of case law, we consider separately the claims of the state and the defendant under each prong.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant satisfied all four prongs, and, accordingly, that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the defendant was not entitled to have the trial court instruct the juiy on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The first prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test requires that either the state or the defendant request \u201can appropriate instruction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Whistnant, supra, 179 Conn. 588. The state claims that the defendant\u2019s written request to charge did not satisfy the first prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test because, by not complying with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 42-18,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the request did not ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>quately alert the trial court to evidence that supported his proposed lesser included offense instruction. The defendant claims that his written request, taken together with a colloquy with the trial court and a post-instruction exception, satisfies the first prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test. We agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to the disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant filed a written request to charge with the trial court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Three days later, the trial court conferred with the state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the defendant about the proposed jury instructions. At this conference, both parties and the court engaged in a lengthy discussion about the proposed manslaughter charge, including its factual basis and the applicable law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The state informed the court and defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>that it had not received a copy of the defendant\u2019s proposed charge. Although the trial court inquired about why the state had not received a copy of the proposed charge, the state represented that it could proceed at the conference without it. After some discussion about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the facts of the case and the differing mental states of murder and manslaughter as applied to the evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court denied the defendant\u2019s request to charge the jury on manslaughter in the first degree as a lesser included offense. After the jury was instructed, the defendant took an exception to the trial court\u2019s refusal to charge on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">It is well settled that, \u201c[a] proposed instruction on a lesser included offense constitutes an appropriate instruction for purposes of the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>if it complies with Practice Book [\u00a7 42-18]. . . . We previously have held, in the context of a written request to charge on a lesser included offense, [that the] requirement of [\u00a7 42-18] is met only if the proposed request contains such a complete statement of the essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 746-47; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>199 Conn. 155, 158-59, 506 A.2d 104 (1986). For example, in <em>Corbin, </em>we concluded that the defendant did not satisfy the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>because his written request was \u201cconfusing\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>supra, 747; as it did not follow the rules of \u00a7 42-18 requiring a separate paragraph for each requested instruction and a \u201ccomplete statement of the essential facts to justify the charge as requested.\u201d Id., 746. This court favors adherence to the prescriptions of \u00a7 42-18 to further that section\u2019s purpose of making instructional requests less confusing. Id. Indeed, we have stated that \u201c[w]hile [we do] not favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>unyielding adherence to rules of procedure where the interests of justice are thereby disserved . . . the ever increasing refinement of our law justifies cooperation of counsel in stating requests for jury instruction. The minor burden of cooperation imposed by [Practice Book \u00a7 42-18] is neither unreasonable nor novel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In the present case, as the defendant conceded at oral argument before this court, the written request to charge, though containing ample citations to relevant legal authority, lacked a statement of the essential facts and, therefore, did not comply completely with the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 42-18. This does not mean, however, that the defendant has not satisfied the first prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>Although strict compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 42-18 is certainly the least perilous method of satisfying <em>Whistnant's </em>first prong, failure to do so is not, by itself, fatal to the defendant\u2019s claim. We have deemed the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>satisfied when the record indicates that \u201cthe trial court knew the precise point to which the defendant wished to call attention.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>235 Conn. 67, 77, 663 A.2d 972 (1995); id. (noting written request adequately drew trial court\u2019s attention to relevant facts when legal basis for lesser included offense charge had been discussed previously in chambers; emphasizing that \u201ctrial court was aware of the defendant\u2019s request prior to formulating its charge and thus was afforded the time to scrutinize the requests\u201d). Indeed, even partial compliance with \u00a7 42-18, accompanied by substantial additional support in the record from either party, such as detailed colloquies with the court and opposing counsel and a postcharge exception, will also satisfy the first prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>This is true as long as the trial court is informed adequately of the factual and legal bases for the instructional request. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 153 n. 7 (first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>prong satisfied despite written request lacking statement of supporting evidence when defendant took post-charge exception; noting \u201cstatement by the trial judge that he had reviewed the evidence and decided not to give the requested charge\u201d), <em>State </em>v. Herring, 210 Conn. 78, 105 n.25, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989) (first prong satisfied despite noncompliant written instruction when \u201cdefense counsel, upon inquiry to the trial court, had been reassured that he need not file a formal, written request to charge and that his oral request sufficed\u201d), <em>State </em>v. <em>Faria, </em>47 Conn. App. 159, 182-83, 703 A.2d 1149 (1997), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 965, 707 A.2d 1266 (1998) (first prong satisfied despite incomplete factual statement in written request when trial court was aware of \u201clegal and factual basis for the request to charge\u201d via off-record chambers conference and on-record colloquy) and <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>46 Conn. App. 778, 783, 700 A.2d 1190 (1997) (\u201cdefendant\u2019s written request to charge and the colloquy between the court and defense counsel complied with the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>and sufficiently alerted the trial court of the basis for the request\u201d), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 248 Conn. 472, 728 A.2d 1087 (1999), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 746-47 (first prong not satisfied when written request failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 42-18; no indication that trial court was otherwise aware of factual or legal bases for defendant\u2019s request).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In the present case, despite the deficiency in the written request, the colloquy among the trial court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>state and the defendant indicates that the trial court was aware of and understood the facts underlying the defendant\u2019s request for the lesser included manslaughter instruction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The trial court, during the colloquy, acknowledged the significance of the defendant\u2019s statement in the context of the request. Moreover, after the jury was charged, the defendant took an exception, further alerting the trial court to his disagreement with the refusal to give the lesser included offense instruction. Because the record in the present case demonstrates that the trial court\u2019s attention amply was drawn to the factual and legal bases for the request to charge on the lesser included offense, we conclude that the defendant requested an \u201cappropriate instruction,\u201d thereby satisfying the first prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Despite being conceptually distinct parts of the <em>Whistnant </em>formulation, the third and fourth prongs are subject to the same evidentiary analysis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>226 Conn. 237, 250-51, 627 A.2d 877 (1993). We will, therefore, analyze them simultaneously. The third prong of <em>Whistnant </em>requires that \u201cthere [be] some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588. The fourth prong requires that \u201cthe proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The defendant, relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 138-40, 646 A.2d 169 (1994), claims that his statement to the police, offered into evidence by the state, is sufficient to \u201cprove that he acted with a lesser intent than that of the specific intent to kill\u201d and sustain a conviction for manslaughter in the first degree. The state contends that the defendant has not satisfied the third or fourth prongs of <em>Whistnant </em>because he failed to advance any arguments at trial that he had acted with intent to cause serious physical injury, positing instead general denials of any criminal intent or responsibility for the victim\u2019s death. The state also claims that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Sivri </em>is misplaced because, when that case was argued before this court, the exact manner of the victim\u2019s death was unknown. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 65-73, 621 A.2d 728 (1993), we . . . reviewed the standard of evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>dence required to satisfy the [third and fourth prongs] of the <em>Whistnant </em>test. We there held that \u2018there must be sufficient evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, to justify a finding of guilt of the lesser offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. Crafts, supra, 226 Conn. 251. Although \u201c[we] expressly [reject] the proposition that a defendant is entitled to instructions on lesser included offenses based on merely theoretical or possible scenarios\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 78; we will, however, \u201cconsider the evidence available at trial in- the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request. . . . [T]he jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested. . . . Otherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>supra, 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Lesser included offense instructions are frequently appropriate in cases when the defendant is charged with murder. This is because \u201c[t]he critical element distinguishing murder from its lesser included offenses is intent, \u2018often the most significant and, at the same time, the most elusive element of the crime charged.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>[180 Conn. 382, 404, 429 A.2d 919 (1980)]. We must determine if the \u2018evidence suggests at least a possibility\u2019 that the defendant acted with a lesser intent than that of the specific intent to kill. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 30, 444 A.2d 213 (1982). If \u2018we cannot as a matter of law exclude this possibility\u2019; id.; then the defendant was entitled to lesser included offense instructions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 138-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">To gain a better illustration of the degree of proof needed to satisfy the third and fourth prongs of the <em>Whistnant </em>test, we begin our analysis by parsing this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>court\u2019s opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 137-40. In <em>Sivri, </em>the defendant appealed from a murder conviction, claiming that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses, including manslaughter in the first degree. Id., 137. In that case, the victim\u2019s body and any evidence of it was still missing at the time of trial.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Id., 125. Large, partially cleaned, quantities of blood that matched the victim\u2019s blood type, the victim\u2019s earring, and hairs similar to those of the victim, were found in the defendant\u2019s home three days after her disappearance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Id., 121-24. The victim\u2019s blood also was present in the defendant\u2019s car. See footnote 22 of this opinion. Moreover, beyond the defendant\u2019s attempts to conceal or destroy evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the act, the state presented additional evidence relevant to the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, including his flight and subsequent use of several aliases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 125-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">This court concluded therein that, although there was sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had the specific intent to cause the victim\u2019s death,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the defendant had, nevertheless, satisfied the third and fourth prongs of <em>Whistnant. </em>Id., 139-40. Noting the critical nature and fine distinctions of the intent element in differentiating the various homicide crimes, this court \u201cagree [d] with the defendant that the evidence was such as to permit the jury to infer that there was also a possibility that there was a sudden or spontaneous incident . . . resulting in the unintended death of [the victim].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 139. The court held that, even with the copious amounts of the victim\u2019s blood, \u201cand the setting of the injury\u2014a family room in a home, where one does not expect accidental conduct to produce an injury causing the loss of that much blood\u2014a jury could reasonably infer that the defendant acted with an intent to cause the victim serious injury . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. The court also stated that \u201cthe evidence of intent to kill was not overwhelming. . . . [P]rior cases in which this court has held that the defendant was not entitled to any lesser included offense instructions are distinguishable .... For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 251, there was evidence of prior planning and preparation\u2014the defendant had arranged for the rental of a woodchipper to dispose of the victim\u2019s body prior to causing the victim\u2019s death, making the defendant\u2019s claim of a \u2018sudden confrontation . . . too speculative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to put the issue of intent sufficiently in dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We conclude that, as in <em>Sivri, </em>in the present case, there was sufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference by the jury that a sudden or spontaneous incident occurred, resulting in the victim\u2019s unintended death. Moreover, we further agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that, unlike <em>Sivri, </em>in the present case, affirmative evidence actually was introduced to support that theoiy, namely, the defendant\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and his statement to the police about the alcohol-fueled altercation and struggle with the victim. Indeed, as the Appellate Court noted in its opinion: \u201cWhen the police detectives who took the defendant\u2019s statement asked whether he had killed the victim, the defendant stated, \u2018I guess you could say we both did, <em>but not onpurpose.\u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>The state claims that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Sivri </em>is misplaced because, unlike that case, wherein the manner of death was unknown, the manner of the victim\u2019s death in the present case, namely, strangulation, is inconsistent with a sudden or spontaneous killing. We disagree with the state because, on the evidence in this record, particularly the defendant\u2019s statement, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that the evidence does not suggest \u201cat least a possibility that the defendant acted with a lesser intent than that of the specific intent to kill.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 139; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 30. Indeed, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Falby </em>is particularly instructive on this point. In <em>Falby, </em>this court held that, in a murder trial wherein the defendant was convicted of killing a child by manual strangulation, the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of second degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>supra, 30.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We find <em>Falby </em>especially persuasive because, in that case, when the defendant claimed that during the act of strangling, he became scared and threw the child, we concluded that the \u201cevidence suggested] <em>at least a possibility </em>that the defendant acted recklessly or with criminal negligence in leaving a child with her face in the dirt following another such attack.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.; compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 72 (first degree manslaughter instruction not justified because \u201c[i]t requires nothing more than common sense to conclude that slashes to the neck of a conscious victim that severed the victim\u2019s jugular vein, trachea, larynx and esophagus and the impalement of the victim by a spear are evidence of intent to kill rather than mere recklessness or intent to injure seriously\u201d) and <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 210 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>93-94, 106 (defendant\u2019s intent not sufficiently in dispute when victim\u2019s head, with fatal shotgun wound, found wrapped in plastic).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The state also contends that the defendant failed to advance any arguments at trial in support of his contention that he only intended to injure, and not kill, the victim. According to the state, the defendant argued that he was not responsible for the victim\u2019s death; therefore, the only possible conviction could be for murder.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We disagree with this contention, and conclude that the Appellate Court\u2019s emphasis on the defendant\u2019s position at trial that \u201che not only did not intend to kill the victim, but that he also never intended to injure her\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 134; rather than on the inferences that could be drawn from his statement to the police, was improper. So long as the evidence reasonably can \u201cjustify a finding of guilt of the lesser offense\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 68; a \u201cdefendant\u2019s claim of innocence [does] not automatically preclude him from requesting an instruction on lesser included homicides that require a less serious degree of culpable intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 65; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>214 Conn. 57, 65, 570 A.2d 193 (1990) (\u201c[t]here is . . . nothing inherently inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s pressing for an acquittal based on a theory of pure accident while simultaneously requesting instructions on lesser included offenses within the crime of murder\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>207 Conn. 1, 14, 540 A.2d 659 (1988) (\u201c[t]he fact that a defendant denies having any involvement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>a crime . . . does not necessarily preclude him from obtaining an instruction on a lesser included offense if there are facts in evidence that would reasonably support such an instruction\u201d).

There is no contest. The defendant just claims he didn\u2019t commit the crime. The other person committed the crime and there is no evidence that even when that other person committed the crime in alternative means, that is with an intent to cause serious physical injury and she dies, whoever choked her intended to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s what the issue has been over the years on the intent of an actor and in the commission of crime. It first used to crop up in my mind with the assault. I remember there was a case in Norwalk and the Supreme Court allowed for the jury to play around with the intent exhibited in the mind of the actor where he is firing indiscriminately the gun into the body of the victim. The guy survived, but I didn\u2019t find it to be assault in the first degree. I didn\u2019t know how you could maintain two distinct intents at the same time, but that had been they ruled that you could have two intenis and so has been done away with.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u201cNow, we have this. We have in this case an accessorial liability in the attempt to commit a murder. The statement of the accused indicates that he participated in the murder. His testimony here in contradiction to the statement doesn\u2019t admit to participation in the crime. What about the position of putting his hands around her neck, didn\u2019t he admit that on the stand?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: On the stand he stated that he put the hands on the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">\u201cThe Court: On the shoulder?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">\u201cThe Court: So he is trying to isolate himself, if at all; he is probably telling the truth that he didn\u2019t strangle her at all. He denies that.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">\u201cThe Court: She died, we know, by strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">\u201cThe Court: If he didn\u2019t kill her, who killed her? Solek. And if Solek killed her, he did so with the assistance of himself and his accessory defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">\u201cI don\u2019t think I will charge on manslaughter. I don\u2019t see where there is any evidence that is in dispute as to that claim being raised by the defense. It\u2019s a narrow, thin line. ... I think the courts are taking a better look at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>it. If\u2014you used to, if you hit one of the four prongs of <em>Whistnant </em>that they let the defendant serving\u2014they let him have an opportunity of persuading them on that issue, but I have seen in recent cases there have been some judges who have made an appellate determination of the facts and found that there was not sufficient evidence, any evidence usually, to go to the jury on an issue of a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u201cNow, if we take a look at the statute, it says ... a person is guiliy of manslaughter in the first degree when you have to have an intent to cause serious physical injury to a person, [the victim], and [the defendant] caused the death of such [victim]. No. There is no conflict in the evidence in regard to that. He denies it and the state\u2019s claim is that he didn\u2019t intend to cause any serious physical injury, that he intended to kill her. How do you prove that in this case? You take his statement, if they find it\u2019s persuasive, and you take the reasonable and logical inferences drawn from the manner and the extent of the conduct of the accused in relation to causation. The cause of death, strangulation. So there is no shoulder injury here that we are concerned with. We are talking about a strangulation by garroting her neck. Do you think you could support that? [State\u2019s Attorney], it is your test.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: I haven\u2019t seen the request, but I think the evidence, the analysis\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u201cThe Court: You haven\u2019t seen the request to charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">\u201cThe Court: Didn\u2019t you serve a copy on the state?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I delivered it in the state\u2019s office on Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Well, I didn\u2019t get a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Myself, personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: It\u2019s no problem. I didn\u2019t get a copy of it. I can work without it. I think that the analysis the court indicated which the more recent cases indicate there has to be evidence of dispute. The claim is he did not commit the crime. That is one version. The other version is [that] he choked her and there is a reasonable inference to be drawn on choking. There was an intent to cause death. He started choking and stopped. She had a weird breath and he went back to choking. We are not talking about accidental killing, a couple of bullets fired around a group of people and one person gets struck. The issue is intent here. The case is rather clear, the manner of death and cause. The only reason is the intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">\u201cThe Court: I will not charge on the lesser included.

App. 578, 580, 700 A.2d 96, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 938, 702 A.2d 644 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> In <em>Sivri, </em>the defendant arranged, though a massage service, to have a masseuse come to his home. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 118. The masseuse went to the defendant\u2019s home for the appointment and did not follow her employer\u2019s safety policy by calling in at the conclusion of the appointment. Id., 119. A newspaper carrier confirmed her van at the defendant\u2019s home. Id. After repeated, unsuccessful attempts to contact the victim by calling the defendant\u2019s home, her employer contacted the police. Id. The police found neither the defendant\u2019s nor the victim\u2019s vehicle at the defendant\u2019s home. Id., 120. The victim\u2019s van subsequently was found eight to ten miles from the defendant\u2019s home. Id. The defendant\u2019s car was found one week after the victim\u2019s disappearance, stripped of its license plates. Id., 124. Numerous, partially cleaned, bloodstains were found in the car, which was missing its standard floor mats. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Three days after the victim\u2019s disappearance, the police obtained a warrant and searched the defendant\u2019s home, finding human bloodstains and spatters of the victim\u2019s type scattered throughout the house. Id., 121. The police found one bloodstain that, alone, would have \u201cconstitute [d] one fourth to one fifth of the blood in the body of a woman of medium build.\u201d Id., 122. The police also noted attempts to clean up the blood throughout the house. Id., 122-23. The police also found one of the victim\u2019s earrings and hair similar to the victim\u2019s, in the house. Id., 123-24. Despite a search of a ten mile radius from the defendant\u2019s residence, the victim\u2019s body was never found, and the state forensic scientist, therefore, could not say what caused the victim\u2019s injuries. Id., 123.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> The defendant also had raised a separate sufficiency of the evidence claim, which this court rejected, concluding that the circumstantial evidence presented at trial \u201creasonably supports the inference of an intent to kill that the jury drew.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> The defendant testified on direct examination that after he had exited the bathroom and had seen Solek and the victim fighting, the victim struck the defendant in his mouth with her elbow. After he pushed her, she struck him again on the face with sufficient force to push him back into the bathroom. At this time, the victim and Solek were still fighting. The defendant then testified that he had grabbed the victim in a headlock and held her in that position while telling her to \u201ccalm down.\u201d After she stopped fighting for a few seconds, he released her from the hold. The defendant testified that file victim then began to swing at him and Solek again. The victim and Solek struck each other; the victim then hit the defendant again. At this point, the defendant grabbed the victim and put her in a choke hold again, again telling her to \u201ccalm down.\u201d The defendant testified that Solek and the victim, however, had continued to scream at and fight with each other. The defendant testified that although he had tried to persuade Solek to leave, Solek refused to go and continued to fight with the victim. The defendant testified that the victim had continued to fight with them. He then placed her in another headlock, testifying that \u201cI just put her on her back and I grabbed her shoulders, kind of like half neck half shoulder,\u201d and tried to calm her. The defendant testified that the victim continued to fight and scream. The defendant then kept the victim in the hold; it was at this point that Solek struck the victim with the clothes iron before kicking her and sexually assaulting her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\"> The trial court, however, did instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of first degree manslaughter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\"> The state specifically claims that, because the defendant\u2019s position at trial was that his actions were only intended to \u201ccalm\u201d the victim, he can not now claim that he merely had the intent to injure, rather than kill, her. The state also claims that the content of the defendant\u2019s statement to the police, while suggestive of panic, fear and even self-defense, does not support a first degree manslaughter instruction. We disagree with these contentions because of the elusive nature of the mental state element, particularly given the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b500-8\">SULLIVAN, C. J., with whom VERTEFEUILLE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Akg\">joins, dissenting. I disagree with parts II and III of the majority opinion. Thus, I believe that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the defendant, Scott Smith, was not entitled to the instruction he requested on manslaughter in the first degree as a lesser included offense of the crime of murder, and, accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">As the majority correctly notes, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In the present case, there is no dispute that the defendant did not explain to the trial court why he believed that his requested charge was proper. For this reason, I believe that the defendant failed to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test. \u201cThe first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>requires that the defendant request \u2018an appropriate instruction,\u2019 and a proposed instruction on a lesser included offense, like any other proposed jury instruction, is not appropriate unless made in compliance with [the Connecticut Practice Book].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>199 Conn. 155, 158, 506 A.2d 104 (1986). Practice Book \u00a7 42-18 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) When there are several requests, they shall be in separate and numbered paragraphs, each containing a single proposition of law clearly and concisely stated with the citation of authority upon which it is based, <em>and the evidence to which the proposition would apply. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">As the majority notes, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>260 Conn. 730, 746, 799 A.2d 1056 (2002), \u201c[w]e previously have held, in the context of a written request to charge on a lesser included offense, [that the] requirement of [\u00a7 42-18] is met only if the proposed request contains such a complete statement of the essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Page 465 of the majority opinion. As the majority further notes, the defendant concedes that he did not comply with \u00a7 42-18 because his written request for an instruction on the lesser included offense of manslaughter did not explain how the requested charge was justified by the evidence before the court. Page 466 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The majority, however, states further that \u201ceven partial compliance with \u00a7 42-18, accompanied by substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>tial additional support in the record for either party, such as detailed colloquies with the court and opposing counsel and a postcharge exception, will also satisfy the first prong of <em>Whistnant. This is true as long as the trial court is informed adequately of the factual and legal bases for the instructional </em>request.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Page 466 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The majority cites as evidence that the court was adequately informed of the factual basis for the requested charge a discussion between the court and the attorneys for both the state and the defendant. Footnote 15 of the majority opinion. At no point in that discussion, however, did the defendant explain any possible factual basis for the requested manslaughter charge, even after the court explained its decision not to give the requested charge by stating that it did not believe that there was any evidence of an intent to cause serious physical injury to the victim. Thus, although, as the majority states, the court engaged in \u201csome discussion about the facts of the case and the differing mental states of murder and manslaughter as applied to the evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d; pages 464-65 of the majority opinion; I believe that this colloquy, rather than indicating that the trial court was apprised of the basis for the requested charge, clearly indicates that that court did not believe that there was any evidence of the state of mind required for a manslaughter conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Similarly, although, as the majority indicates, the defendant\u2019s taking of an exception to the court\u2019s charge to the jury \u201cfurther alertfed] the trial court to [the defendant\u2019s] disagreement with the refusal to give the lesser included offense instruction\u201d; page 468 of the majority opinion; the defendant did not at that time explain to the court how the requested charge could be justified by the evidence. Neither the defendant nor the majority maintain otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The trial court is not required to speculate as to how the evidence could fit a charge requested by the defendant where the state asserts that the evidence does not fit that charge and the defendant\u2019s attorney provides no explanation whatsoever of how the evidence could fit that charge. The fact that this court can devise a possible explanation that <em>could </em>have been provided to the trial court by the defense counsel does not mean that the trial court should have divined that hypothetical defense argument on its own. Nor does the fact that the court knows what evidence is before it\u2014as, presumably, courts always do\u2014mean that the court is charged with knowing how that evidence might justify a requested charge. This is particularly so where the justification for the requested charge requires the drawing of inferences from the evidence, such as inferences regarding a state of mind, and where the issue of whether the evidence can justify the charge at all is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Thus, in the present case, I believe that the defendant did not comply with the first prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test, either in form or in substance, because at no time did the defendant apprise the trial court of any basis in the evidence for his requested charge, even when the trial court affirmatively indicated that it was aware of no such basis and was refusing to make the requested charge for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In addition, I disagree with part III of the majority opinion, regarding the third and fourth prongs of the <em>Whistnant </em>test. I believe that the trial court is in the best position to evaluate the evidence before it and to determine whether that evidence justifies a requested charge on a lesser included offense. In the present case, the trial court determined that the issue of whether the defendant acted with the mental state necessary to justify a conviction for manslaughter was not sufficiently in dispute so as to justify the requested instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tion. I believe that this determination by the trial court is adequately justified by the evidence and should not be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
