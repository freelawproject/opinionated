The plaintiff, Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd., filed an action alleging, inter alia, equal protection and antitrust violations against the defendant, the city of Hartford. The plaintiff sought money damages as well as temporary and permanent injunctive relief preventing the defendant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>awarding the contract to any company other than itself. The trial court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>denied the plaintiffs request for a temporary injunction. After a jury trial on the plaintiffs claim for damages, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of the defendant on the equal protection claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the jury reached its verdict on the antitrust claim, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, which had awarded the plaintiff $500,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff now appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment setting aside the verdict, and claims that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that, under our decision in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>247 Conn. 407, 722 A.2d 271 (1999), the plaintiff, as an unsuccessful lowest bidder in a municipal bidding process, lacks standing to bring an antitrust claim against the defendant; (2) directed a verdict on the plaintiffs equal protection claims on the ground that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law through its antitrust claim, and improperly ruled thereon because the court subsequently set aside the verdict on the antitrust claim, thereby depriving the plaintiff of its adequate remedy; (3) found that Connecticut\u2019s antitrust statute interferes with state policy as it is reflected in the bidding statute; (4) found that the successful bidder was a necessary party to the action; and (5) found that the plaintiffs proof of damages was speculative. Because we conclude that the judgment of the trial court granting the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the plaintiffs antitrust claim was not a final judgment, we decline to review the plaintiffs claims on the merits. We, therefore, dismiss the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history that are relevant to our disposition of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>appeal. The plaintiff is a school bus company based in Hartford. The president of the company, Cheryl Terry, has worked in the school transportation business for more than thirty years. The plaintiff was one of three vendors who had submitted sealed bids to the defendant in response to an invitation to bid for a proposed five year contract to provide bus transportation services for Hartford public schools, commencing with the 1998-1999 school year. The plaintiffs bid was lower than either of the other vendors, Laidlaw Transit, Inc. (Laid-law),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Dattco, Inc. (Dattco). Despite being the highest bidder, Laidlaw was awarded the five year contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">After Laidlaw was awarded the contract, the plaintiff brought the action underlying this appeal, claiming violations of its equal protection rights and state antitrust law, as well as breach of contract. The plaintiff also claimed that, by awarding the contract to an entity other than the lowest responsible bidder, the defendant violated \u00a7 2-548 of the Hartford municipal code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs complaint alleged a violation of the Connecticut Antitrust Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 35-24 et seq.;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>in that it was not awarded the contract due to a conspiratorial agreement between a union and the defendant, with the purpose of obtaining a union contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief relating to the contract, monetary damages and equitable relief. At trial, the defendant acknowledged that the plaintiffs bid was the lowest submitted, but it maintained that the plaintiff was not awarded the contract because the defendant had been informed that the plaintiff had a pending labor case with the National Labor Relations Board, and because its bid did not conform to the specifications of the bid request. Terry testified, however, that the plaintiff had \u201cfully complied with each and every material term of [the] defendant\u2019s bid specifications . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Thereafter, the trial, court held a hearing on the plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order. On August 4, 1998, subsequent to the completion of the hearing, but prior to the issuance of the trial court\u2019s decision, the defendant executed its contract with Laid-law. The trial court issued a decision denying the plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order on August 7, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">After a trial on the plaintiffs equal protection and state antitrust claims,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict as to the plaintiffs equal protection claims, and submitted to the jury only the claim alleging an antitrust violation. Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $500,000 on that claim. The defendant then filed a motion to set aside the verdict. The trial court granted this motion and, thereafter, set aside the verdict for the plaintiff. The trial court reserved the question as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>whether Laidlaw was a necessary party on the injunction portion of the claim and noted that it would hold a hearing on the plaintiffs request for permanent injunctive relief ab initio if it were to decide that Laidlaw was indeed a necessary party. The court ultimately determined that Laidlaw was a necessary party and that it should be joined as a party within thirty days of that order. Prior to a resolution of the claim for permanent injunctive relief, the plaintiff appealed<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court setting aside the verdict on its antitrust claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u201cBecause our jurisdiction over appeals, both criminal and civil, is prescribed by statute, we must always determine the threshold question of whether the appeal is taken from a final judgment before considering the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). Additionally, with the exception of certain statutory rights of appeal not relevant here, our jurisdiction is restricted to appeals from final judgments. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>228 Conn. 630, 634, 637 A.2d 1111 (1994). The threshold question in this appeal is, therefore, whether a final judgment has been rendered on all of the counts of the plaintiffs complaint. Because we conclude that the judgment of the trial court granting the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the plaintiffs antirust claim was not a final judgment, we dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>A judgment that disposes of only a part of a complaint is not a final judgment. <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>197 Conn. 82, 84, 495 A.2d 1063 (1985). Our rules of practice, however, set forth certain circumstances under which a party may appeal from a judgment disposing of less than all of the counts of a complaint. Thus, a party may appeal if the partial judgment disposes of all causes of action against a particular party or parties; see Practice Book \u00a7 61-3;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or if the trial court makes a written determination regarding the significance of the issues resolved by the judgment and the chief justice or chief judge of the court having appellate jurisdiction concurs. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-4 (a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Neither of these exceptions applies to the case presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">First, the judgment of the trial court in setting aside the verdict did not dispose of all causes of action against the defendant. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim for permanent injunctive relief is still pending, and there is an unresolved count alleging that a section of the Hartford municipal code is illegal and unenforceable. Second, neither the trial court, nor this court made any written determination pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-4 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>regarding the significance of the issues presented in this case. Accordingly, this appeal does not fall within the ambit of either rule permitting an appeal from a judgment on less than all counts in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry as to whether the order is immediately appealable. See <em>Daginella </em>v. <em>Foremost Ins. Co., </em>197 Conn. 26, 30, 495 A.2d 709 (1985). An otherwise interlocutory ruling can be immediately appealed in two circumstances: (1) where the order terminates a separate and distinct proceeding; or (2) where the order so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. <em>States. Curdo, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31. In the present case, neither prong of the <em>Curdo </em>test is satisfied. Under the first prong, the trial court\u2019s ruling setting aside the verdict on the antitrust count, as well as its order that Laidlaw was a necessary party, did not terminate a separate and distinct proceeding. They were, instead, \u201cstep[s] along the road to [a] final judgment\u201d on the entire complaint. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>194 Conn. 650, 653, 485 A.2d 139 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Nor did the trial court\u2019s ruling so conclude the parties\u2019 rights that further proceedings could not affect them. In applying this prong of the <em>Curdo </em>test, our focus is on whether \u201cappellate review is necessary [in order] to prevent the irreparable loss of a cognizable legal right.\u201d <em>Daginella </em>v. <em>Foremost Ins. Co., </em>supra, 197 Conn. 31. An essential predicate to the applicability of this prong is the \u201cidentification of jeopardy to [either] a statutory or constitutional right that the interlocutory appeal seeks to vindicate.\u201d Id. In the present case, we see no risk of the loss of any cognizable right if appellate review is delayed until final adjudication. To the contrary, after the plaintiffs claim for permanent injunctive relief is adjudicated and a final judgment is rendered on the complaint, the plaintiff will have the opportunity to challenge the judgment setting aside the verdict, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>well as the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the necessity of Laidlaw as a party. This route to appellate review protects the well established policy behind the final judgment rule, namely, avoiding piecemeal appeals. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the judgment of the trial court granting the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the plaintiffs antitrust claim, without the disposition of the plaintiffs claim for permanent injunctive relief, and of the count alleging a violation of the municipal code, is not a final judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> The plaintiff claimed violations of its constitutional rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 8 and 20, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> The plaintiff alleged violations of the Connecticut Antitrust Act, General Statutes \u00a7 35-24 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\"> Laidlaw was performing the school bus contract that was to expire in 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> Section 2-548 of the Hartford municipal code provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The contract for which sealed bids are invited shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.

See, <em>e.g., Lynch </em>v. <em>Granby Holdings, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 95, 97-98, 644 A.2d 325 (1994) <em>Q\u2018[i]n the absence of a question relating to subject matter jurisdiction, </em>the Appellate Court had only limited authority to reach the issue of possible confusion in the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Additionally, the parties were apprised of the fact that a final judgment question had arisen and were instructed to prepare for questions regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the final judgment of the trial court\u2019s decision at oral argument before this court. Thus, the dismissal of this appeal for lack of final judgment should not be construed as an unfair surprise to either of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 61-3 provides in relevant part: \u201cA judgment disposing of only a part of a complaint, counterclaim, or cross complaint is a final judgment if that judgment disposes of all causes of action in that complaint, counterclaim, or cross complaint brought by or against a particular party or parties. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 61-4 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen the trial court renders a judgment to which this section applies, such judgment shall not ordinarily constitute an appealable final judgment. Such a judgment shall be considered an appealable final judgment only if the trial court makes a written determination that the issues resolved by the judgment are of such significance to the determination of the outcome of the case that the delay incident to the appeal would be justified, and the chief justice or chief judge of the court having appellate jurisdiction concurs. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b272-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 provides that an aggrieved party may appeal from a final judgment <em>or </em>from the \u201cgranting [of] a motion to set aside a verdict . . . .\u201d This language creates a right to appeal from an otherwise nonftnal order, that is, the setting aside of a verdict. 2 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1971) \u00a7 205 (k), p. 847; W. Maltbie, Connecticut Appellate Procedure (2d Ed. 1957) \u00a7 182, p. 223. We do not, however, read the language creating this right as overriding the requirement of a final judgment in a case, such as this, where not all claims have been adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">Moreover, the present case is distinguishable from cases in which a ruling has been made as to equitable relief but no determination has been made as to damages.

In those cases, the order as to the equitable relief was held to be so determinative of the parties\u2019 rights that an immediate appeal would lie.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
