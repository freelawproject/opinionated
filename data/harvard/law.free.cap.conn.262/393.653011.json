The board approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application and adopted a new regulation proposed by Stop &amp; Shop. Thereafter, the plaintiff, Alliance Energy Corporation (Alliance), filed an administrative appeal in the Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 8-8,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenging the board\u2019s approval of Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application and the adoption of the new regulation. Stop &amp; Shop filed a motion to dismiss Alliance\u2019s appeal, claiming that Alliance lacked standing to appeal from the board\u2019s action. The trial court granted Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s motion and rendered judgment dismissing Alliance\u2019s appeal, from which Alliance appealed to the Appellate Court upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the granting of certification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the trial court properly concluded that Alliance was not aggrieved by the board\u2019s action and, consequently, lacked standing to appeal therefrom. We conclude that the trial court improperly concluded that Alliance was not aggrieved by the board\u2019s action. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The record discloses the following facts that are relevant to this appeal. Stop &amp; Shop operates a supermarket in the city of Milford. Stop &amp; Shop possesses a permit to sell beer and certain other alcoholic beverages on the premises where its supermarket is located and sought to construct a gasoline station on those premises. Stop &amp; Shop filed an application with the board seeking a change in \u00a7 5.4 of the regulations, which prohibited, inter alia, the sale of alcohol on property devoted to the retail sale of gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The particular provision of the regulations with which Stop &amp; Shop was concerned is \u00a7 5.4.5.1, which provides that \u201c[n]o alcoholic liquor shall be sold from the premises of or the site area allocated to any use regulated in this Section.\u201d Milford Zoning Regs., \u00a7 5.4.5.1. Stop &amp; Shop sought to have the board adopt a new regulation, which would provide: \u201cSection 5.4.5.1 shall not apply to the sale of gasoline by a grocery store, as defined in Connecticut General Statutes [\u00a7] 30-20 (c), containing at least 40,000 square feet of gross floor area which sells only beer and other beverages pursuant to a grocery beer permit provided: (i) the premises shall be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>minimum of five (5) acres and, (ii) the distance between any public entrance to the grocery store and any gasoline pump shall not be less than one hundred fifty feet (150\u2019).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The board held a public hearing on Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application, which was unopposed. Thereafter, the board granted Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application and adopted Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s proposed regulation as \u00a7 5.4.5.2 of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Thereafter, Alliance appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 8-8. In its complaint, Alliance alleged that it owned several parcels of real property located within the city of Milford and that it paid taxes to the city. Alliance further alleged that it operated businesses on some of its property and leased the remaining property to business tenants, and that Alliance and its lessees engaged in the retail sale of gasoline and various food and related goods normally sold at convenience stores. Alliance claimed that it was aggrieved by the board\u2019s action because the approval of Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application would allow Stop &amp; Shop to operate a gasoline station, which was contrary to \u00a7 5.4.5.1 of the regulations, and would result in \u201cadverse traffic and pedestrian impacts, environmental impacts, unfair commercial competition, and unfair and inequitable administration and enforcement of [the] [z]oning Regulations.\u201d In addition, Alliance alleged that, as a taxpayer, it was automatically aggrieved because the board\u2019s action \u201cinvolve[d] a liquor outlet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Stop &amp; Shop moved to dismiss Alliance\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, claiming that. Alliance lacked standing to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 because it was not aggrieved by the board\u2019s action. The trial court granted Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s motion and rendered judgment dismissing Alliance\u2019s appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Alliance claims that the trial court improperly concluded that Alliance lacked standing. Specifically, Alliance claims that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) Alliance, as a taxpayer of the city of Milford, was not automatically aggrieved because the board\u2019s decision to grant Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application did not involve the sale of liquor, involve a liquor outlet or affect liquor commerce; (2) Alliance\u2019s allegation of unfair commercial competition was insufficient to confer standing; and (3) Alliance did not otherwise identify or possess any specific legal interest sufficient to confer standing. We agree with Alliance\u2019s first claim and, consequently, need not consider its other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">As a threshold matter, we address our standard of review. We have long held that \u201cbecause [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. Branford, 247 Conn. 407, 410, 722 A.2d 271 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We now review the law regarding aggrievement. \u201cStanding is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless [one] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action .... Standing is established by showing that the party claiming it is authorized by statute to bring suit or is classically aggrieved. . . . The fundamental test for determining [classical] aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all the members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that the specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blumenthal </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>261 Conn. 434, 441-42, 804 A.2d 152 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The crux of Alliance\u2019s first claim is that, as a taxpayer of the city of Milford, it automatically satisfies the classical aggrievement test because it contends that the board\u2019s decision to grant Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application involves the sale of liquor or a liquor outlet, or affects liquor commerce. The plaintiffs contention that it is classically aggrieved by the board\u2019s action is based on our decision in <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>237 Conn. 184, 196, 676 A.2d 831 (1996), in which we reaffirmed the automatic aggrievement rule, under which \u201cany taxpayer in a municipality has automatic standing to appeal from a zoning decision involving the sale of liquor in that community.\u201d Id., 186-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In <em>Jolly, Inc., </em>the defendant, Cyrco, Inc., petitioned the zoning board of appeals of the city of Bridgeport for a variance from a city zoning regulation, which required a minimum of 1500 feet between liquor establishments. Id., 188-89. Cyrco, Inc., sought to relocate its existing liquor store to a location that would be within 1430 feet of another liquor store. Id., 189. The variance was approved and the plaintiffs, owners of another liquor store located in the city of Bridgeport, appealed from the board\u2019s approval of the variance. Id. \u201c[W]hile acknowledging that the plaintiffs, as taxpayers challenging a zoning decision involving the sale of liquor, had established that they were automatically aggrieved under existing case law, the [trial] court, nevertheless, refused to allow the plaintiffs the benefit of this long-standing rule because it concluded that the reasoning of such prior cases was flawed, anachronistic and should be overruled.\u201d Id., 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">On appeal to this court, the principal issue was \u201cwhether [this court] should continue to adhere to [the] long-standing interpretation of \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>... \u00a7 8-8.\u201d Id., 185-86. Our long-standing interpretation of the term \u201caggrieved person,\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1), is that \u201cany taxpayer in a municipality has automatic standing to appeal from a zoning decision involving the sale of liquor in that community.\u201d Id., 186-87. In <em>JoUy, Inc., </em>we reversed the judgment of the trial court and reaffirmed the automatic aggrievement rule; id., 196, 203; relying primarily on long-standing precedent, which derived from inherent public policy concerns regarding the societal costs of policing liquor activity in our communities. See id., 197-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">For example, in <em>Jolly, Inc., </em>we stated: \u201cIn <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>[140 Conn. 65, 71-72, 98 A.2d 515 (1953)], we interpreted the aggrievement requirement for zoning appeals relying on the court\u2019s reasoning in an earlier decision, <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>64 Conn. 526, 534, 30 A. 775 (1894). Although <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal </em>involved our interpretation of the term \u2018aggrievement\u2019 as used in a statute dealing with the granting of liquor licenses, in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>we concluded that the reasoning in <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal </em>applied \u2018with like force and reason to the same word as used in [the zoning appeals statute].\u2019 <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 72. \u2018In <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>[supra, 534] Justice Simeon E. Baldwin [stated]: \u201c[EJvery owner of property, assessed in the grand list of the town in which he resides, has a substantial interest in the prosperity and good order of that town. The expense of the local police of any town, as well as of criminal proceedings before its local tribunals, is largely dependent on the number of the liquor saloons and bar rooms within its limits, and the character of those who keep them. If licenses are granted with too free a hand, or without proper discrimination, the burdens of taxation are likely to be increased. Every taxpayer therefore has a certain, though it may be small, pecuniary interest in having the license law well administered; and if he is also a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>resident in the town where he pays his taxes, he has an additional interest, common to every citizen, in promoting the general welfare of the community. In view of these considerations, we think that any resident taxpayer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of a town who feels aggrieved at the granting of a license for the sale of liquors therein, has the right of appeal . . . and that he is not bound to show any grievance or interest in the matter peculiar to himself . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u201cLater, in <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>[145 Conn. 655, 661, 145 A.2d 832 (1958)], another case in which we considered aggrievement in the context of a zoning appeal, we observed: \u2018The essence of the holdings in <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal </em>. . . and the cases which have followed it, is that to be an aggrieved person within the meaning of the statute one must show a pecuniary interest injuriously affected by the action of the zoning board of appeals and that such a showing may be sufficiently made, in a case [in which] liquor traffic is involved, by proof that one is a taxpayer in the town, in view of the pecuniary effect upon every taxpayer resulting from the incidents of such traffic. Such a distinction recognizes, again, that in liquor traffic there is a possible source of danger to the public which is not inherent in other businesses and that therefore such traffic warrants distinctive and particular treatment.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u201cMore recently, we again addressed the policy reasons behind the automatic aggrievement rule. In <em>Maca</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>luso </em>[v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>167 Conn. 596, 600-601, 356 A.2d 885 (1975)], the defendant had \u2018attacked as anachronistic the policy considerations underlying our longstanding principle that in cases in which traffic in liquor is involved and a statute similar to \u00a7 8-8 conferring a right of appeal upon persons aggrieved by decisions of a zoning board of appeals is applicable, a resident taxpayer of a town is a priori an aggrieved person with standing to prosecute the appeal . . . and need not show that he has an interest peculiar to himself. . . . These cases have recognized that the sale and use of liquor may involve such a risk that a resident taxpayer of a town has a sufficient pecuniary interest as well as a sufficient interest in the general well-being of his community to allow him to appeal such decisions.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 197-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In <em>Jolly, Inc., </em>we also indicated that a zoning board\u2019s action can involve the sale of liquor or a liquor outlet even though it does not change the number of liquor outlets. See id., 199-200. \u201cIn <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>we construed a zoning regulation similar to the 1500 foot regulation at issue in <em>[Jolly, Inc.] </em>as a declaration of policy by the town that the location of existing liquor stores has an effect on the general welfare of the community. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 140 Conn. 70. \u2018[T]he town council took cognizance of the potential danger from this traffic and that the [1500 foot] restriction was enacted as one means of attempting to keep it within bounds. Although under the . . . Liquor Control Act the so-called \u201cold fashioned saloon\u201d of earlier days has been supplanted by the variously designated places of the licensed dispensing permittees for which it provides, the potential menace of the traffic persists. It is a matter of common knowledge that a large percentage of today\u2019s serious crimes stems from the excessive use of alcohol and that the hazard to life and limb from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>intoxication has been tremendously increased by the advent of present-day automobile traffic. These are material considerations in determining the meaning of the word \u201caggrieved\u201d as used in [the zoning appeal statute] . . . .\u2019 Id., 70-71. We agree with the reasoning in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>that Bridgeport has expressed a policy in its 1500 foot rule, namely, that the specific location of liquor stores within city bounds substantially affects the public welfare, regardless of any increase or decrease in the number of liquor stores in the aggregate.\u201d <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><em>Jolly, Inc., </em>therefore, stands for the proposition that when an action taken by a zoning board involves the sale or use of liquor or affects traffic in connection with the sale or use of liquor, taxpayers are presumed to be classically aggrieved. See id., 199-200. Specifically, because public policy concerns about the adverse effects of liquor sales and consumption cause municipalities to devote numerous resources to monitor and police those activities, an action of a zoning board that involves the sale or use of liquor or that affects traffic in connection with the sale or use of liquor is presumed to have a negative effect on the pecuniary interest of each taxpayer in the community. A taxpayer claiming aggrievement by such an action, therefore, is presumed to have successfully demonstrated a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the zoning board\u2019s action, and such interest is presumed to have been specially and injuriously affected by that action. Thus, a taxpayer claiming such aggrievement automatically satisfies the classical aggrievement test.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In the present case, Stop &amp; Shop successfully sought to have the board add a new regulation to \u00a7 5.4 of the regulations. The new regulation removed an existing barrier to the simultaneous sale of gasoline, on the one hand, and \u201cbeer and other beverages pursuant to a grocery beer permit\u201d; Milford Zoning Regs., \u00a7 5.4.5.2; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>on the other, provided the criteria in the new regulation are satisfied. The board\u2019s adoption of the new regulation has the potential to increase the number of liquor outlets throughout the city of Milford. For example, prior to the board\u2019s adoption of the new regulation, any business engaged in the retail sale of gasoline in the city of Milford was strictly prohibited from selling liquor on the premises on which it sells gasoline. See Milford Zoning Regs., \u00a7 5.4.5.1. Under the new regulation, however, any grocery store possessing a grocery beer permit, containing at least 40,000 square feet of gross floor area and situated on at least five acres of land may sell gasoline <em>and </em>certain liquor as long as the distance between any public entrance to the grocery store and any gasoline pump is not less than 150 feet.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Milford Zoning Regs., \u00a7 5.4.5.2. The removal of the prohibition, therefore, involves liquor within the meaning of the automatic aggrievement rule that we followed in <em>Jolly, Inc., </em>and its long list of predecessors. See <em>Macaluso </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 167 Conn. 597-98, 600-601 (zoning board\u2019s action allowing defendant to maintain package store on subject premises involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>liquor when continued sale of liquor at that location constituted nonconforming use under existing zoning regulations); <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>156 Conn. 426, 428, 242 A.2d 713 (1968) (zoning board\u2019s decision to grant variance from zoning regulations, which constituted precondition to obtaining liquor permit, involved sale of liquor); <em>M. &amp; R. Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 280, 281-82, 231 A.2d 272 (1967) (same); <em>Cowles </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>153 Conn. 116, 117, 214 A.2d 361 (1965) (same); <em>Zuckerman v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>144 Conn. 160, 162-64, 128 A.2d 325 (1956) (taxpayer automatically aggrieved by planning and zoning board\u2019s zone change and approval of certain parcel as site for package store); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 140 Conn. 70-72 (planning board\u2019s decision to grant waiver of zoning ordinance requiring distance of at least 1000 feet between establishments engaged in sale of alcoholic beverages involved liquor and, thus, conferred automatic standing on plaintiff taxpayers); cf. <em>London </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>149 Conn. 282, 284, 179 A.2d 614 (1962) (planning and zoning commission\u2019s granting of defendant\u2019s request for zone change did not involve liquor when sale of liquor was prohibited on portion of defendant\u2019s property for which zone change was requested, even though defendant was not prohibited from prospectively seeking liquor permit to sell liquor on adjoining property that was not affected by zone change and on which the sale of liquor was not prohibited).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We conclude, therefore, that Alliance, as a nonresident taxpayer, has alleged facts sufficient to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>that it is aggrieved by the board\u2019s decision to approve Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s application and to adopt \u00a7 5.4.5.2 of the regulations because that decision involves the sale of liquor. See, e.g., <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 186-87. The trial court, therefore, improperly dismissed Alliance\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s motion to dismiss and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 8-8 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) As used in this section:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u201c(1) \u2018Aggrieved person\u2019 means a person aggrieved by a decision of a board and includes any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality charged with enforcement of any order, requirement or decision of the board. In the case of a decision by a zoning commission, planning commission, combined planning and zoning commission or zoning board of appeals, \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 includes any person owning land that abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u201c(2) \u2018Board\u2019 means a municipal zoning commission, planning commission, combined planning and zoning commission, zoning board of appeals or oilier board or commission the decision of which may be appealed pursuant to this section, or the chief elected official of a municipality, or his designee, in a hearing held pursuant to section 22a-250, whose decision may be appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">\u201c(b) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section and sections 7-147 and 7-147\u00cd, any person aggrieved by any decision of a board may take an appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located. The appeal shall be commenced by service of process in accordance with subsections (e) and (1) of this section within fifteen days from the date that notice of the decision was published as required by the general statutes.

We emphasize, however, that the automatic aggrievement rule benefits resident taxpayers and nonresident taxpayers alike. \u201cOriginally, we relied upon a plaintiffs status as a taxpayer and as a resident of the municipality in support of the automatic aggrievement rule. Later, however, we clarified that taxpayer status alone is sufficient to establish a presumption of aggrievement.\u201d <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 194 n.14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\"> Stop &amp; Shop claims that the board\u2019s adoption of the new regulation involves the sale of gasoline rather than the sale of liquor inasmuch as the board\u2019s action does not result in \u201cthe [granting] of a new liquor permit or the relocation of an existing liquor [outlet], but rather the modification and relaxation of the [Regulations governing the sale of gasoline.\u201d It is true that some grocery stores, such as Stop &amp; Shop, which already are engaged in the sale of certain liquors pursuant to a grocery beer permit, will rely on the new regulation to engage in the retail sale of gasoline. Under those circumstances, the board\u2019s action can be viewed as one affecting the sale of gasoline. Stop <em>&amp; </em>Shop fails to appreciate the scope of the board\u2019s new regulation, however. Under the new regulation, a convenience store engaged in the retail sale of gasoline but not in the sale of liquor pursuant to a grocery beer permit conceivably could purchase adjoining land and expand its premises to fall within the criteria enumerated in the regulation (e.g., 40,000 square feet of gross floor area situated on five acres of land), successfully apply for the issuance of a grocery beer permit and simultaneously sell gasoline and certain liquors pursuant to a grocery beer permit. Consequently, the board\u2019s adoption of the new regulation involves the sale of liquor within the meaning of the automatic aggrievement rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\"> We note that many of the predecessors to <em>Jolly, Inc., </em>that we cite in this opinion involved variances to existing zoning regulations and that the board in the present case did not grant a variance, but, rather, adopted a new zoning regulation of general applicability. The line of cases preceding and leading up to <em>Jolly, Inc., </em>is instructive, however, because those cases concerned the type of decisions that we have regarded as involving liquor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
