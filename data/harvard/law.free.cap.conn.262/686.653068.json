Following the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion, the defendant, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 54-94a,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere to one count of sale of narcotics<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in violation of \u00a7 2 la-278 (a), reserving the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>his motion to suppress. The court accepted the plea and entered a finding of guilty. Prior to sentencing, the defendant filed a motion requesting the trial court to apply Public Acts 2001, No. 01-99 (P.A. 01-99),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which permits the court to depart from the mandatory minimum five year sentence prescribed under \u00a7 21a-278 (a), and to impose a suspended sentence. The trial court determined that P.A. 01-99 could not be applied to the defendant and accordingly sentenced him to five years incarceration. The defendant appealed<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> from the trial court\u2019s judgment, claiming that the trial court improperly had: (1) denied his motion to suppress; and (2) concluded that it could not sentence the defendant in accordance with P.A. 01-99. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>dence seized from the defendant\u2019s person, his automobile and his home, as well as statements made by the defendant to the police. In its memorandum of decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court found the following facts, which are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On January 18, 2000, an anonymous telephone call was made to the Waterbury police department describing a man, identified by name as the defendant, selling narcotics in the area of Burton, Bishop and Elizabeth Streets. According to the detective who had received the telephone call, Nicholas DeMatteis, a veteran of the Waterbury police department with more than thirty years experience, the informant identified the type of car the defendant was driving and indicated that the narcotics for sale were in a napkin in the vehicle. DeMatteis went to the identified area, which was known to him for \u201cstreet level drug activities,\u201d and spotted the defendant and a vehicle that matched the description he had been given by the informant. Using binoculars, he observed the defendant as he provided drugs to two unknown individuals, first a black female and thereafter a Hispanic male. DeMatteis then notified other officers who took over the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Robert Jones, a Waterbury police department narcotics officer, received DeMatteis\u2019 report and proceeded, along with another narcotics officer, Lawrence Smith,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the area in question where they located the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The officers approached the vehicle from opposite sides, and Jones observed a white napkin containing what he recognized to be packaged crack cocaine on the front passenger seat. He seized the drugs, while Smith opened the driver side door to arrest and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>search the defendant. The officers recovered thirty-five bags of crack cocaine and $2229 from the defendant\u2019s person.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant was transported to the Waterbury police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">According to both Jones and DeMatteis, the defendant, who spoke English and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which he waived. During the course of the ensuing interview, the defendant revealed that there was more contraband in his home. He then willingly signed a form providing the police with consent to search his residence. With a key in their possession that the defendant had provided, the police proceeded to the defendant\u2019s home where they found and seized four grams of narcotics, more than $3000 in cash and a shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The trial court noted as immaterial the testimony of three of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, specifically, two police officers who provided additional background information regarding the incident and an investigator for the public defender\u2019s office. The court expressly rejected as incredible the defendant\u2019s testimony and the testimony of a convicted felon, Todd Ferguson, refuting the state\u2019s evidence regarding the search, the two drug transactions, the defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the consent to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">On the basis of the facts it had found, the trial court determined that the police \u201cat the <em>very least </em>had reasonable articulable suspicion to conduct an investigation of [the defendant\u2019s] car. The state presented evidence beyond that standard and actually satisfied the probable cause test. . . . Once the original investigating officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>corroborated the initial anonymous tip with two separate observations of what he knew to be street sales of narcotics, probable cause to either search or arrest the defendant was present. The additional plain view observations of Jones merely added to the more than sufficient justification for the actions of the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\u201cThe items taken subsequent to the arrest of [the defendant] were legally seized. Police officers can lawfully search an individual after a lawful custodial arrest. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">\u201cThe testimony of the officers supports the court\u2019s finding that the defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent. The defendant was read his rights, he understood his rights, the defendant cooperated, he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, there were no threats or promises. The defendant\u2019s waiver of his rights was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s consent to search his home was his free choice. The court finds that the consent form was explained to the defendant, the defendant responded in an appropriate and cooperative fashion. Once again, the defendant was not confused; there were no threats or promises. The totality of the circumstances leads the court to conclude that the defendant freely consented to the search of his home.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The defendant raises both factual and legal challenges to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly credited the testimony of the police witnesses called by the state, rather than the testimony of the defendant and his witness. Next, predicated on his first contention, the defendant claims that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>improperly denied his motion to suppress regarding: (1) the search of the defendant\u2019s person, because police lacked probable cause; (2) the search of the defendant\u2019s apartment, because his consent to search was not knowing and voluntary; and (3) the defendant\u2019s statements at the police station and the evidence seized from his home, because they were fruits of the prior unlawful arrest and search. We reject the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">As a threshold matter, we set forth the appropriate standard pursuant to which we review a challenge to a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a suppression motion. \u201cThis involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. That is the standard and scope of this court\u2019s judicial review of decisions of the trial court. Beyond that, we will not go. ... In other words, to the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether those findings were clearly erroneous. Where, however, the trial court has drawn conclusions of law, our review is plenary, and we must decide whether those conclusions are legally and logically correct in light of the findings of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Velasco, 248 Conn. 183, 188-89, 728 A.2d 493 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In the present case, the defendant claims that \u201cit was clearly erroneous for the trial court to credit the testimony of the police.\u201d Specifically, he asserts that contradictions in the testimony of the three officers testifying for the state regarding their location during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the incident leading to his arrest should have led the trial court to conclude that DeMatteis had not observed the defendant engaged in the drug transactions that had precipitated the search. Additionally, the defendant contends that the testimony that he and Ferguson provided was the more credible evidence and that, if the trial court properly had credited this evidence, it would have granted his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Because a trial court\u2019s determination of the validity of a search implicates a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, we generally engage in a careful examination of the record to ensure that the court\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 68-69, 634 A.2d 879 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>214 Conn. 146, 154, 570 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 819, 111 S. Ct. 65, 112 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Northrop, </em>213 Conn. 405, 414, 568 A.2d 439 (1990). In this case, however, the defendant is not claiming that the court did not have substantial evidence upon which to base its decision, but, rather, that the evidence it had was not to be credited. Accordingly, we need not recite the facts relied upon by the defendant to advance his argument, because this claim distills to a credibility contest that we leave to the trier of fact to judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\u201cThe determination of a witness\u2019 credibility is the special function of the trial court. This court cannot sift and weigh evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 227, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996). Otherwise, \u201c[t]his court would then, byway of fact-finding, be required to adjudicate the validity and the reliability of that evidence. At this stage of the proceedings, we are incapable of making those necessary determinations. In general, [i]t is the function of the trial court, not this court, to find facts. . . . Imposing a fact-finding function on this court, therefore, would be contrary to generally established law. Indeed, it would be inconsistent with the entire process of trial fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>finding for an appellate court to do so.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>256 Conn. 262, 287-88 n.17, 773 A.2d 308 (2001). Thus, viewed through this prism, the testimony was for the trial court to assess and we have no appropriate role at this level in determining which of the various witnesses to credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">We next examine the defendant\u2019s suppression claims regarding the legal determinations by the trial court, over which we exercise plenary review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 189. Specifically, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence obtained through: (1) the search of the defendant\u2019s person; (2) the search of the defendant\u2019s automobile; (3) the search of the defendant\u2019s apartment; and (4) the defendant\u2019s statements following his arrest. Because the first two categories stem from the defendant\u2019s contention that his arrest was unlawful, we address those claims together. Similarly, because the third and fourth categories stem from the defendant\u2019s contention that the statements and consent to search resulted from an unknowing and involuntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, we address those claims in tandem.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">We begin with a brief discussion of the legal principles relevant to the warrantless arrest and concomitant search of the defendant\u2019s person and his automobile. \u201cUnder both the federal and the state constitutions, a warrantless search and seizure is per se unreasonable, subject to a few well defined exceptions. <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 383, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993) .... One of those exceptions is a search incident to a lawful arrest. It is an established rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>a properly conducted warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest is itself lawful. . . . Thus, if the defendant\u2019s arrest was lawful, the subsequent warrantless search of his person also was lawful.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 189. Moreover, \u201cwhen police make a lawful custodial arrest of an occupant of an automobile, and the arrestee is detained at the scene, police may contemporaneously search without a warrant the interior passenger compartment of the automobile. . . . The passenger compartment encompasses all space reachable without exiting the vehicle.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 266-67, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (b) authorizes a police officer to conduct a warrantless arrest of \u201cany person who the officer has reasonable grounds to believe has committed or is committing a felony.\u201d The phrase \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d is synonymous with probable cause. <em>State v. Trine, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 236 n. 16. The determination of whether probable cause exists under the fourth amendment to the federal constitution, and under article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution, is made pursuant to a \u201ctotaiity-of-the-circumstances\u201d test. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 544, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). \u201cProbable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer and of which [the officer] has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a [person] of reasonable caution to believe that a felony has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 236-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In the present case, the trial court first determined that \u201cthe police at the very least had reasonable articulable suspicion to conduct an investigation of [the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>dant\u2019s] car.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court concluded that the state\u2019s evidence went \u201cbeyond that standard and actually satisfied the probable cause test. . . . Once the original investigating officer corroborated the initial anonymous tip with two separate observations of what he knew to be street sales of narcotics, probable cause to either search or arrest the defendant was present.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Finally, the court referred to \u201c[t]he additional plain view observations of Jones [that] merely added to the more than sufficient justification for the actions of the officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The defendant does not claim that the facts, if credited, fail to support the trial court\u2019s determination of probable cause to arrest and search him. Rather, he contends that the trial court should not have credited the testimony of the three police officers testifying for the state. Once again, we abide by the principle previously stated that we do not engage in fact-finding. Accordingly, on the basis of the facts that the trial court reasonably found, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination of probable cause to arrest the defendant was proper and that the search of his person incident to that arrest, resulting in the seizure of $2229 and thirty-five bags of crack cocaine, was therefore lawful. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 189. Similarly, the simultaneous search of the passenger seat area of the defendant\u2019s vehicle incident to his arrest, which resulted in the seizure of thirty-nine bags of crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>cocaine also was lawful.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 266. Therefore, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion with respect to that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s determinations regarding the search of his apartment, as well as the statements he made following his arrest. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly determined that he knowingly and voluntarily consented to the search of his home. We reject the defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">\u201cIt is . . . well settled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search [or seizure] that is conducted pursuant to consent.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>189 Conn. 461, 467, 456 A.2d 1191 (1983). Whether a defendant voluntarily has consented to a search is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court from the totality of the circumstances based on the evidence that it deems credible along with the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>209 Conn. 1, 7-8, 546 A.2d 839 (1988); see also <em>Poulos </em>v. <em>Pfizer, </em>244 Conn. 598, 609, 711 A.2d 688 (1998). \u201cWhether there was valid consent to a search is a factual question that will not be lightly overturned on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zarick, </em>227 Conn. 207, 226, 630 A.2d 565, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1025, 114 S. Ct. 637, 126 L. Ed. 2d 595 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The trial court in the present case credited the testimony of DeMatteis that the defendant spoke English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>and that he was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In addition, the court determined that no threats or promises had been made and that the consent form had been explained to him before he agreed to the search of his home. Once again, the defendant does not claim that the evidence was not sufficient to support the court\u2019s finding, only that the trial court improperly credited the police testimony. Therefore, we do not engage in the fact-finding that the defendant\u2019s claim would require in order for him to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The defendant further claims that the trial court improperly determined that he had waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and therefore the statements he had made at the police station were inadmissible. As with his other claims, the defendant does not assert that the facts as found were insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s determination. Rather, he claims that that the trial court should not have credited the police testimony in this regard. The same factors that led the court to conclude that the consent to search was valid also caused the trial court to conclude that the defendant had waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that any statements he had made properly were admissible. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress any statements made following his arrest was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Finally, we respond briefly to the defendant\u2019s claim that <em>all </em>the evidence seized and the statements he gave were the tainted fruits of the initial search at the scene of his arrest. This claim also is predicated on the defendant\u2019s assertion that the initial search was illegal. Because we already have concluded that the trial court\u2019s legal determinations regarding the initial search legally and logically were correct, no further discussion is necessary. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The second issue on appeal is whether the trial court properly concluded that P.A. 01-99, which would have allowed the trial judge to deviate from the five year mandatory minimum sentence otherwise required by \u00a7 2 la-278 (a), did not apply to this case. The following facts are pertinent to our resolution of this issue. The defendant was arrested on January 18, 2000, and charged, inter alia, with a violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (a). On August 13, 2001, the court accepted his conditional plea of nolo contendere to that violation in accordance with \u00a7 54-94a. Thereafter, the defendant filed an amended sentencing memorandum, as well as a motion for consideration under P.A. 01-99, asking the court to consider sentencing him to a suspended sentence rather than to the mandatory minimum sentence of \u00a7 21a-278 (a). At the hearing on the motion, the trial court determined that P.A. 01-99 applied prospectively only, based on the date of the offense, and thereafter, sentenced the defendant to the mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to \u00a7 21a-278 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">On appeal to this court, the defendant claims that P.A. 01-99 applies to him because it applies to sentences <em>imposed </em>after July 1, 2001, the date the act took effect. He claims that the plain language of P.A. 01-99 dictates that result, that the legislative history of the act supports that interpretation and, finally, that, should there be any ambiguity, the rule of lenity favors his construction of the act. The state responds that the trial court properly rejected the defendant\u2019s claim. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">We begin with an overview of the pertinent legal principles that guide our resolution of this issue. As the parties recognize, whether P.A. 01-99 applies retroactively is a question of law over which this court has plenary review. See, e.g., <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 318, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). \u201cWhether to apply [an act] retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature .... [There is a presumption of] legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only. . . . This presumption in favor of prospective applicability, however, may be rebutted when the legislature clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively. . . . We generally look to the statutory language and the pertinent legislative history to ascertain whether the legislature intended that the amendment be given retrospective effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 804, 819-20, 786 A.2d 1091 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">To determine whether application of a particular act to a criminal defendant would constitute retroactive application, we look to the law in effect on the date the defendant committed his offenses. <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 378, 678 A.2d 462 (1996); see also <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 31, 101 S. Ct. 960, 67 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1981) (criminal law is retroactive if it \u201cchanges the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date\u201d), hi the present case, the offense was committed nearly eighteen months prior to the effective date of P.A. 01-99. There is no language in P.A. 01-99 that compels a retrospective construction; the act merely provides an effective date. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Nor is there anything in the legislative history to indicate that the legislature \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d intended for P.A. 01-99 to apply retroactively. <em>In re Daniel </em>H., supra, 376. The legislative history reflects that the purpose of P.A. 01-99 was to relieve prison overcrowding<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to give trial judges greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>discretion in sentencing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See generally 44 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 2001 Sess., pp. 1879-1929; 44 H.R.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>251 Conn. 617, 626, 628-29, 741 A.2d 902 (1999). Rather, the act provides that it \u201cshall take effect July 1, 2001.\u201d The purpose of this language was to accelerate the effective date of the act from the default date of October 1 otherwise provided for by statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 2-32 (\u201c[a]ll public acts, except when otherwise therein specified, shall take effect on the first day of October following the session of the General Assembly at which they are passed\u201d). Had the legislature intended for P.A. 01-99 to apply to criminal defendants whose offenses had been committed prior to the July 1, 2001 date, but who had not yet been sentenced, it could have stated so, either in the act itself or in the legislative debate surrounding its passage. In the absence of any such expression, the trial court properly determined that P.A. 01-99 must be applied prospectively only, that is, to criminal defendants whose offenses were <em>committed </em>after July 1, 2001.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court properly denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>defendant\u2019s motion requesting the imposition of a suspended sentence under P.A. 01-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (a) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures or substances containing an aggregate weight of one ounce or more of heroin, methadone or cocaine or an aggregate weight of one-half gram or more of cocaine in a free-base form or a substance containing five milligrams or more of lysergic acid diethylamide, except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not, at the time of such action, a drug-dependent person, shall be imprisoned for a minimum term of not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and, a maximum term of life imprisonment. The execution of the mandatory minimum sentence imposed by the provisions of this subsection shall not be suspended except the court may suspend the execution of such mandatory minimum sentence if at the time of the commission of the offense (1) such person was under the age of eighteen years, or (2) such person\u2019s mental capacity was significantly impaired but not so impaired as to constitute a defense to prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">A very minor technical change was made to \u00a7 21a-278 (a) in 2001.
