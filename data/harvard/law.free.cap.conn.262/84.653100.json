(Griffin),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the defendants, the water pollution control authority of the town of Simsbury (authority) and the town of Simsbury (Simsbury). The sole issue in this appeal is whether the trial court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief because the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-430 (f)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 22a-436,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and that no exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine apply. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. River Bend owns a 363 acre parcel of land in Simsbury. In November, 1999, River Bend and Fairfield 2000 Homes, a nonprofit housing organization, applied to the Simsbury land use commissions for approval of a master plan to develop a 640 unit residential development to be called Meadowood. The portions of the November, 1999 application submitted to the Simsbury zoning commission and to the Simsbury planning commission were filed pursuant to the affordable housing statute, General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g, because the applicants had agreed to preserve at least 25 percent of the housing units for thirty years at prices within the economic reach of households having annual incomes of approximately $50,000 or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The authority is the agency established in Simsbury pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-246 (a) and (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to exercise the powers granted by state law with respect to municipal sewerage systems. Pursuant to \u00a7 7-246 (b), the authority has adopted a plan that identifies areas in Simsbury where properties may be connected to Simsbury\u2019s sewer system. In order to regulate the amount of sewage discharged to the treatment plant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>and to the Farmington River, the authority allocates specific sewage disposal capacity to individual parcels within Simsbury\u2019s sewer district. Of the 363 acres of the Meadowood property, 267 are within Simsbury\u2019s sewer district. The authority has allocated a sewage disposal capacity of approximately 110,900 gallons per day to the 267 acres of Meadowood property within the sewer service area.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The November, 1999 Meadowood development plan proposed 640 residences, consisting of 595 homes within the sewer service district that would be served by sewers and 45 homes outside the sewer district that would be served by on-site septic systems. The residences to be located within the sewer district require 300.000 gallons per day of sewage disposal capacity. In order to provide sewage disposal capacity for the entire Meadowood plan within the sewer area, the plaintiffs applied to the authority for permission to transfer 190.000 gallons of sewage disposal capacity from a 122 acre parcel zoned as industrial, located one-half mile to the east of Meadowood, which the plaintiffs also own. The authority previously had allocated 382,000 gallons of disposal capacity to the industrial parcel. In March, 2000, the authority denied the plaintiffs\u2019 transfer request, stating that the transfer would leave the industrial parcel without adequate capacity for future industrial development.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In response to the authority\u2019s March, 2000 denial, the plaintiffs reduced the Meadowood development plan to a total of 371 homes. The plaintiffs\u2019 revised plan proposed 324 homes to be located within Simsbury\u2019s sewer service area and 47 homes to be located outside the sewer service area. The revised plan proposed that 269 of the 324 homes within the sewer service area be connected to the public sewer, utilizing the entire 110,900 gallons of disposal capacity, and that the remaining 55 homes be served by individual, on-site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>septic systems. The remaining 47 homes located outside the sewer service area also were to be served by individual, on-site septic systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The plaintiffs applied to the Farmington Valley health district (health district) in May, 2000, for approval of the 102 homes to be served by septic systems. The state department of health services (department of health) has authority pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-430 (g) to regulate and issue permits for on-site subsurface sewage disposal systems for single-family homes or to delegate that authority to other agencies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The health district is the agency designated by the department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>health to process applications in Simsbury and to issue permits for on-site household septic systems with capacities of less than 5000 gallons per day. On June 13,2000, after required soil testing was completed, the health district issued a letter to Simsbury approving the soils on all but two of the 102 proposed lots \u201cas being capable of supporting on-site septic systems consistent with public health standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">On May 23,2000, the plaintiffs submitted their revised development plan to the authority, seeking approval of the proposed connection of 269 homes to Simsbury\u2019s sewer system. At a June 28, 2000 meeting, the authority voted to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 revised application for the Meadowood project, giving a variety of reasons,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ing the authority\u2019s belief that the revised Meadowood plan to put fifty-five units, which were to be <em>within </em>the sewer service area, on septic systems was an effort to bypass the authority\u2019s sewer allocation plan. Additionally, the authority indicated that septic systems are unreliable, and that if a septic system within the sewer service area failed, the solution, outside of revoking the certificate of occupancy, would be to connect the failed septic system to the sewer, which was exactly what the authority had been trying to avoid. The authority indicated that the 110,000 gallon allocation was, and would remain, available and that the authority was inclined to approve any application that utilized up to that allocation. Pursuant to the June 28, 2000 vote, the authority issued a letter, dated June 29, 2000, denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application to connect the 269 homes to Simsbury\u2019s sewer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs commenced the action underlying this appeal in the Superior Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in connection with the authority\u2019s denial of their application. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged, inter alia, that the authority\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over, and its prohibition of, the construction of on-site septic systems within the sewer service district was ultra vires because neither state statutes, regulations nor local ordinances authorize water pollution control authorities to prohibit septic systems within sewer service areas. The plaintiffs also alleged that the authority\u2019s action regarding the on-site septic systems was preempted by state statutes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>regulations, which delegate authority to regulate household septic systems to the department of health and its designees, which in fact, had approved all but two of the proposed septic systems. The plaintiffs further alleged that the authority was not authorized to enforce the state building code and, alternatively, that the authority\u2019s action violated the building code because the code permits septic systems. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated General Statutes \u00a7 8-2,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which, the plaintiffs contended, requires municipalities to encourage housing development consistent with existing soil types.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss asserting that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. In its memorandum of decision on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the trial court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 22a-430 (f) and 22a-436, or \u00a7 4-176,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that no exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine were applicable. The trial court, therefore, granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and rendered judgment accordingly, from which the plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>over their action for declaratory and injunctive relief. In support of their claim, the plaintiffs first contend that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7\u00a7 22a-430 (f) and 22a-436, or \u00a7 4-176 (a) provide the plaintiffs with an adequate administrative remedy that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We have long held that \u201cbecause [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>247 Conn. 407, 410, 722 A.2d 271 (1999); see <em>RichTaubman Associates </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>236 Conn. 613, 618, 674 A.2d 805 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In order to analyze properly whether an adequate administrative remedy exists, we must first properly characterize the actions taken by the authority regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 application. In May, 2000, the plaintiffs submitted their revised development plan to the authority, seeking approval of an application to connect 269 homes to the Simsbury sewer system. In June, 2000, the authority voted and issued a letter denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application. The plaintiffs characterize the authority\u2019s denial as a prohibition against the installation of septic systems within the sewer service area.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The plaintiffs, however, confuse the authority\u2019s decision to deny the application for a permit to connect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the sewer system with the rationale behind the decision. The plaintiffs acknowledge that they applied to the authority only for approval to connect 269 homes to the Simsbury sewer system. The authority denied that application. While some of the reasons given by the authority for the denial of the application involved the plaintiffs\u2019 plans to construct fifty-five homes with septic systems within the sewer service area, nevertheless, the actual application that was denied was to connect 269 homes to the sewer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that no administrative agency had the authority to provide an adequate administrative remedy is based on two assertions, both of which are premised on the plaintiffs\u2019 faulty characterization of the authority\u2019s actions. First, the plaintiffs claim that the authority derives its powers from \u00a7 7-246,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which outlines the powers of municipal water pollution control authorities but does not provide recourse for violations. The plaintiffs further claim that applications made pursuant to \u00a7 7-246 do not fall within the purview of the department of environmental protection (department) under \u00a7 22a-430 (f). In other words, the plaintiffs claim that the authority\u2019s power is established by \u00a7 7-246 (b), and that \u00a7 22a-430 (f) is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u00a7 7-246 establishes water pollution control authorities as creatures of the municipality is not in dispute. It is evident from a reading of the statute that the legislature empowered municipalities to establish water pollution control authorities. Section 7-246 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny municipality may, by ordinance, designate its legislative body, except where the legislative body is the town meeting, or any existing board or commission, or create a new board or commission to be designated, as the water pollution control authority for such municipality. Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>municipality located within the district of a regional water authority or regional sewer district established under an act of the General Assembly may designate such water authority or sewer district as the water pollution control authority for such municipality, with all of the powers set forth in this chapter for water pollution control authorities, provided such water authority or sewer district agrees to such designation. . . . The water pollution control authority of the town within which there is a city or borough shall not exercise any power within such city or borough without the express consent of such city or borough, except that such consent shall not be required for any action taken to comply with a pollution abatement order issued by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, it reasonably cannot be disputed that the authority is an entity created by Simsbury under express legislative authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Certain powers vested in the water pollution control authority are set forth in \u00a7 7-246 (b). \u201cEach municipal water pollution control authority designated in accordance with this section may prepare and periodically update a water pollution control plan for the municipality. Such plan shall designate and delineate the boundary of: (1) Areas served by any municipal sewerage system; (2) areas where municipal sewerage facilities are planned and the schedule of design and construction anticipated or proposed; (3) areas where sewers are to be avoided; (4) areas served by any community sewerage system not owned by a municipality and (5) areas to be served by any proposed community sewerage system not owned by a municipality. Such plan shall also describe the means by which municipal programs are being carried out to avoid community pollution problems. The authority shall file a copy of the plan and any periodic updates of such plan with the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>sioner of Environmental Protection and shall manage or ensure the effective management of any community sewerage system not owned by a municipality.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-246 (b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The plaintiffs contend, however, that \u00a7 7-246 does not contain any language regarding approval processes or the authority to issue permits and, therefore, that the department has no administrative authority to review the legality of authority actions. This contention, however, is faulty because it disregards the distinct grant of authority from the department to water pollution control authorities contained in \u00a7 22a-430 (f). Further, the plaintiffs\u2019 contention is premised on their mischaracterization of the authority\u2019s decision as a denial of septic system installation, rather than as a denial of a sewer connection application.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Section 22a-430 (f) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he commissioner may, by regulation, establish and define categories of discharges, <em>including but not limited to, </em>residential swimming pools, small community sewerage systems, household and small commercial disposal systems . . . for which he may delegate authority to any other state agency [or] water pollution control authority ... to issue permits or approvals . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The broad \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d language of \u00a7 22a-430 (f) establishes that the department may delegate authority to water pollution control authorities to issue permits for all types of discharges that involve sewer connections.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">As it applies to discharge permits other than septic systems,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> including sewer connection permits, \u00a7 22a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>430 (f) requires that the commissioner of the department (commissioner) act by way of regulation to effect the permissive delegation of authority. The commissioner has promulgated \u00a7 22a-430-l (b) (1) (A) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which provides for the delegation of permitting authority to water pollution control authorities. Specifically, \u00a7 22a-430-l (b) (1) (A)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> authorizes the commissioner, by agreement, to delegate to any agent as defined in \u00a7 22a-430-1 (a) the authority to issue permits or approvals for the various categories of discharges.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Section 22a-430-1 (a) defines agent as \u201cany state agency other than the Department of Environmental Protection, any <em>municipal water pollution control authority, </em>any municipal building official or municipal or district director of health.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, \u00a7 22a-430-1 (a) includes a category of discharge entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201c[d]omestic sewage.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 22a-430 (f) of the General Statutes and \u00a7 22a-430-l of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies set forth the power of the authority and department to approve or deny sewer connection applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second claim is that, although \u00a7 22a-430 (f) gives the department broad delegation authority over sewer systems, \u00a7 22a-430 (g) directs the commissioner to delegate the authority to issue permits and approvals for septic systems to the department of health/health district. Thus, the plaintiffs contend that because the authority to issue approvals for septic systems has been divested from the department, an appropriate administrative remedy with the department does not exist. This conclusion, as previously noted, is premised upon the plaintiffs\u2019 faulty characterization of the authority\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Section 22a-430 (g) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he commissioner shall, by regulation . . . establish and define categories of discharges which constitute household and small commercial subsurface disposal systems for which he shall delegate to the Commissioner of Public Health the authority to issue permits or approvals . . . .\u201d Thus, \u00a7 22a-430 (g) mandates that the commissioner, by regulation, delegate permitting and approval authority over septic systems to the department of health. The commissioner has effected this delegation through \u00a7 22a-430-l (b) (1) (A), which provides in relevant part that \u201cthe Commissioner hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>delegates authority to the Commissioner of Health Services in accordance with Section 22a-430 (g) of the Connecticut General Statutes to issue permits [and] approvals . . . .\u201d Thus, \u00a7 22a-430 (g) applies only to septic system permits, not sewer connection permits. As previously discussed, while some of the reasons given for denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application involved the plaintiffs\u2019 plan to construct fifty-five homes with septic systems within the sewer service area, the application that was denied was to connect 269 homes to the sewer system. Consequently, the plaintiffs confuse what was denied with the rationale behind the denial. The mandatory delegation of authority over septic systems found in \u00a7 22a-430 (g) is, therefore, irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction over the authority\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We have determined that the department has jurisdiction over the authority\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 sewer connection application. We must now determine whether an adequate administrative remedy is available to the plaintiffs that will resolve the issues raised in their request for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is well established in the jurisprudence of administrative law. . . . The doctrine provides that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted. . . . Where a statutory requirement of exhaustion is not explicit, courts are guided by [legislative] intent in determining whether application of the doctrine would be consistent with the statutory scheme. . . . Consequently, [t]he requirement of exhaustion may arise from explicit statutory language or from an administrative scheme providing for agency relief. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 529-30, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u201cIf the available administrative procedure . . . provide [s] the plaintiffs with a mechanism for attaining the remedy that they seek . . . they must exhaust that remedy.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 629-30 n.9, 577 A.2d 1017 (1990). \u201cThe plaintiffs preference for a particular remedy does not determine the adequacy of that remedy. [A]n administrative remedy, in order to be adequate, need not comport with the [plaintiffs\u2019] opinion of what a perfect remedy would be.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kish </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>59 Conn. App. 236, 240, 756 A.2d 313 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Section 22a-430 (f) provides that any permit denied or order issued pursuant to that section shall be subject to a hearing and appeal as provided in \u00a7 22a-436 and General Statutes \u00a7 22a-437.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Section 22a-436 provides that any person aggrieved by an order or decision to deny an application may request a hearing before the commissioner. Section 22a-437 provides that any person aggrieved by a decision by the commissioner may appeal from a final determination of the commissioner to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We do not reach the merits of whether the authority properly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application solely because the Meadowood plan included fifty-five homes within the sewer service area that would be served by individual septic systems. We do, however, conclude that available administrative remedies pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 22a-430 (f), 22a-436 and 22a-437 exist. When an appeal is taken as authorized under \u00a7 22a-430 (f), the commissioner has full authority under \u00a7 22a-436 to consider facts and evidence and to revise the authority\u2019s action on the application as appropriate. If the plaintiffs are aggrieved by the commissioner\u2019s decision, then they can pursue an appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 22a-437.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the authority had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs\u2019 application to connect 269 homes to the Simsbury sewer system and that the department was the appropriate agency to which the plaintiffs could have appealed the denial of the application. Thus, the plaintiffs had an adequate administrative remedy that they failed to exhaust.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Finally, the plaintiffs argue that declaratory relief is authorized by Practice Book \u00a7 17-55 (3) despite the availability of other remedies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The plaintiffs claim that Practice Book \u00a7 17-55 (3) vests the trial court with the discretion to allow a declaratory action to proceed despite the existence of alternative procedures. This conclusion, however, if allowed to stand in cases where an adequate administrative remedy exists, would contravene our well established precedent regarding the exhaustion doctrine and subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>grounded in a policy of fostering an orderly process of administrative adjudication and judicial review in which a reviewing court will have the benefit of the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions. . . . The doctrine . . . furthers the salutary goals of relieving the courts of the burden of deciding questions entrusted to an agency ... in advance of possible judicial review. . . . Most important, a favorable outcome will render review by the court unnecessary [because] as the United States Supreme Court has noted: A complaining party may be successful in vindicating his rights in the administrative process. If he is required to pursue his administrative remedies, the courts may never have to intervene.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>248 Conn. 87, 95, 726 A.2d 1154 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u201cIt is a settled principle of administrative law that, if an adequate administrative remedy exists, it must be exhausted before the Superior Court will obtain jurisdiction to act in the matter. . . . Exhaustion is required even in cases where the agency\u2019s jurisdiction over the proposed activity has been challenged. . . . This requirement reflects the legislative intent that such issues be handled in the first instance by local administrative officials in order to provide aggrieved persons with full and adequate administrative relief, and to give the reviewing court the benefit of the local board\u2019s judgment. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u201cWe have recognized, however, certain limited exceptions to the exhaustion requirement. Such exceptions include where the available relief is inadequate or futile ... or where local procedures cannot effectively, conveniently or directly determine whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief claimed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O &amp; G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 419, 425-26, 655 A.2d 1121 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 17-55 (3) is not a viable exception to the exhaustion doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 17-55 provides that \u201c[a] declaratory judgment action may be maintained if all of the following conditions have been met: (1) The party seeking the declaratory judgment has an interest, legal or equitable, by reason of danger of loss or of uncertainty as to the party\u2019s rights or other jural relations; (2) There is an actual bona fide and substantial question or issue in dispute or substantial uncertainty of legal relations which requires settlement between the parties; and (3) In the event that there is another form of proceeding that can provide the party seeking the declaratory judgment immediate redress, the court is of the opinion that such party should be allowed to proceed with the claim for declaratory judgment despite the existence of such alternate procedure.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 51-14 (a), however, provides in relevant part that the rules of practice \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right nor the jurisdiction of any of the courts. . . .\u201d Consistent with \u00a7 51-14 (a), we have stated that \u201c[t]he subject matter jurisdiction of this court is defined by statute.\u201d <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 181, 640 A.2d 601 (1994). \u201cProvisions of the Practice Book cannot confer jurisdiction on this court.\u201d Id., 184. Thus, Practice Book \u00a7 17-55 (3) does not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court. We agree with the defendants\u2019 characterization of Practice Book \u00a7 17-55 (3) as a rule that merely establishes a test to determine the availability of declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We have acknowledged, however, that certain statutes give the Superior Court subject matter jurisdiction to render declaratory judgments. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 52-29 (a)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Superior Court in any action or proceeding may declare rights and other legal relations on request for such a declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. . . .\u201d Nevertheless, \u201c\u00a7 52-29, granting declaratoiy judgment jurisdiction to the Superior Court, does not qualify as the type of separate statutory authorization\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. Jackson, 173 Conn. 352, 358, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977); that allows for a \u201ccomplete bypassing of an administrative agency with undeniable jurisdiction over the subject matter . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion is grounded in a policy of fostering an orderly process of administrative adjudication and judicial review in which a reviewing court will have the benefit of the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions. To allow a party seeking a declaratory judgment to bypass the entire process under certain circumstances would be to interject an unnecessary and potentially confusing element into an otherwise well-defined area of the law.\u201d Id., 358-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Finally, we have acknowledged that certain statutory schemes do not embody the exhaustion doctrine because the statutes clearly express the legislative intent to bypass exhaustion requirements. For example, in <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 530, we stated that \u201cthe exhaustion doctrine is based on a judicial determination of a legislative intent that in certain cases the courts do not have initial subject matter jurisdiction because the legislature has committed the initial resolution of the matters in question to an administrative agency. Therefore, this doctrine does not apply when the legislature determines, by appropriate legislation, that a court may exercise subject matter jurisdiction despite the fact that there also may be administrative procedures available that would, absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>such legislation, normally deprive the court of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The facts in <em>Waterbury </em>are sharply distinguishable from the facts in the case at hand. In <em>Waterbury, </em>we determined that exhaustion was not required because a very specific provision of the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-14 et seq.; could not be reconciled with the exhaustion doctrine, and the provision clearly expressed the legislative intent to bypass exhaustion requirements. <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 531-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Thus, our case law makes clear that court rules, such as Practice Book \u00a7 17-55 (3), and broad statutory grants of jurisdiction, such as \u00a7 52-29, are not intended to circumvent the well established principles of exhaustion. To bypass the requirement of exhaustion and confer upon the courts subject matter jurisdiction where there otherwise would be no jurisdiction, a statute must exist that expresses the legislature\u2019s intent to bypass exhaustion requirements. In the case at hand, the plaintiffs have not set forth such a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We conclude that the plaintiffs have adequate administrative remedies available to them. Furthermore, we conclude that the plaintiffs have not presented any viable exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine. Consequently, the plaintiffs are required to exhaust their administrative remedies before the trial court has subject matter jurisdiction over their declaratory and injunctive relief actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-4\"> River Bend is a subsidiary of Griffin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-430 (f) provides: \u201cThe commissioner may, by regulation, establish and define categories of discharges, including but not limited to, residential swimming pools, small community sewerage systems, household and small commercial disposal systems and clean water discharges, for which he may delegate authority to any other state agency, water pollution control authority, municipal building official or municipal or district director of health to issue permits or approvals in accordance with this section or to issue orders pursuant to sections 22a-428, 22a-431, 22a-432 and 22a-436.

The only exceptions are isolated instances where topographical or environmental considerations make septic a more logical choice for a small number of units.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\u201cAlthough there have been numerous discussions concerning the durability of present day septic systems, the fact remains that the State of Connecticut is adamant, as indicated by the Public Health Regulations, [t]hat a secondary reserve septic field be provided before any subsurface system is approved.
