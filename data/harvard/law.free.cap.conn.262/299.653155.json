The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the trial court improperly relied on the parties\u2019 gross income, rather than net income, in modifying the defendant\u2019s child support obligation. We conclude that the trial court improperly relied on the parties\u2019 gross income. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. In May, 1997, the trial court dissolved the marriage of the plaintiff, Paula Morris, and the defendant, Timothy Morris. Prior to this proceeding, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a separation agreement whereby the defendant was required to pay alimony to the plaintiff in the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>of $3033 per month commencing as of May, 1997, and continuing thereafter through April, 2001, and then in the amount of $2383 per month commencing as of May, 2001, and continuing thereafter through April, 2005. In addition, the defendant was required to pay child support of $433 per month commencing May, 1997, and continuing thereafter through April, 2005, and, commencing May, 2005, an amount to be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The defendant was also required to pay 75 percent of the costs associated with the child\u2019s extracurricular and recreational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">During the dissolution proceedings, the plaintiff, when questioned by her attorney about the terms of the separation agreement, stated that she understood that a strict application of the Connecticut child support guidelines would result in a payment of about $350 <em>per week, </em>but that she was seeking the deviation from the child support guidelines on the grounds that, if the alimony and support obligations were considered together, there would be sufficient support for the plaintiff and her child. The trial court then canvassed the plaintiff to verify that she had entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily and that she considered the agreement to resolve the matter fairly and equitably.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court approved the separa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>tion agreement, dissolved the marriage and incorporated, by reference, the agreement into the decree of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In March, 2000, the plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment and for upward modification of child support. After several days of testimony during the hearing on the plaintiffs motion, the trial court modified the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>dant\u2019s child support obligation from $433 per month to $1250 per week.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its memorandum of decision, the court stated: \u201cTo properly determine whether or not there has been a change in circumstances [to warrant modifying the support order], the court needs to decide what the respective parties have available for support consideration now. [The defendant] has the following gross amounts which are properly included in his support income consideration . . . [the defendant\u2019s total] $5308.08; [the plaintiffs] [gross] income is $759.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u201cThus, it is readily discemable that there has been a significant change in the circumstances and modification is appropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u201cThe child support guidelines DO NOT apply to this child and these parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus the court must use its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>common sense experience and sense of equity to allocate the available familial support resources fairly. In light of the existing and continuing alimony obligation, having full cognizance of the earnings and earnings potential of the parties, allocating all available resources in an equitable maimer to be sure the best interests of the child are met, having stricken the so-called \u2018extracurricular\u2019 obligation and in light of the financial affidavits at this time, I find that the appropriate child support award, payable from [the defendant] to [the plaintiff] is $1250.00 per week.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Thereafter, the defendant moved for reconsideration, claiming that the evidence presented did not warrant such a modification and that the court\u2019s decision did not reflect the statutory criteria enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for determining child support orders. Specifically, the defendant claimed that \u201c \u2018[c]hild support orders must be based on the statutory criteria enumerated in ... \u00a7 46b-84 of which one of the most important is the needs of the child.\u2019 \u201d The defendant contended that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s decision, however, is silent on this very important facet.\u201d After hearing oral argument on the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court granted the motion to the limited extent of \u201ccleaning up typos . . . .\u201d The trial court\u2019s corrected memorandum of decision did not modify the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay $1250 per week in child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. Pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, we transferred the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court: (1) improperly relied on the parties\u2019 gross incomes in modifying child support; (2) improperly determined the weekly child support award with no reasonable or rational relation to the child\u2019s needs; and (3) failed to consider those components of the parties\u2019 original separation agreement that constituted child support as the base against which to modify child support given the increase in the defendant\u2019s income. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim. This renders it unnecessary to consider his other two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">As a threshold matter, we must address the standard of review. \u201cAn appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented. ... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>249 Conn. 265, 282-83, 752 A.2d 1023 (1999). \u201cNotwithstanding the great deference accorded the trial court in dissolution proceedings, a trial court\u2019s ruling on a modification may be reversed if, in the exercise of its discretion, the trial court applies the wrong standard of law.\u201d <em>Borkowski </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>228 Conn. 729, 740, 638 A.2d 1060 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly relied on the parties\u2019 gross incomes in modifying the defendant\u2019s child support obligation. Specifically, the defendant claims in his brief that \u201c\u00a7 46b-84 (d) requires the court to consider the \u2018amount and sources of income\u2019 of the parties when rendering an award of child support. ... It is well established in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>this state\u2019s jurisprudence that \u2018amount and sources of income\u2019 has been consistently construed by the appellate courts of this state as limited to \u2018available net income, however, rather than gross income.\u2019 \u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">It is well settled that a court must base child support and alimony orders on the available net income of the parties, not gross income. <em>Collette </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>177 Conn. 465, 469, 418 A.2d 891 (1979); <em>Tobey v. Tobey, </em>165 Conn. 742, 747, 345 A.2d 21 (1974); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>67 Conn. App. 108, 111, 786 A.2d 525 <em>(2001);Ludgin v. McGowan, </em>64 Conn. App. 355, 358, 780 A.2d 198 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In the present case, the trial court stated in its memorandum of decision that \u201cthe court needs to decide what the respective parties have available for support consideration now. [The defendant] has the following <em>gross </em>amounts which are properly included in his support income consideration .... [The plaintiffs] [gross] income is . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the court affirmatively and expressly stated that it relied on gross income to determine available funds for support consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The plaintiff, however, cites two Appellate Court decisions for the proposition that a trial court does not commit reversible error when the evidence submitted amply demonstrates both net and gross income. See <em>Febbroriello </em>v. <em>Febbroriello, </em>21 Conn. App. 200, 202-203, 572 A.2d 1032 (1990); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 67 Conn. App. 111-12. Thus, the plaintiff contends that because the trial court\u2019s determination was based, in part, on the financial affidavits and tax returns submitted by the parties, which included both gross and net incomes, the trial court did not commit reversible error solely because it mentioned gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The cases upon which the plaintiff relies, however, are inapposite because, in the present case, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>court affirmatively and expressly stated that it relied on gross incomes in determining support, as the trial court did in the case at hand. Although the court broadly stated that its support order was based on financial affidavits, the court, nonetheless, expressly and affirmatively stated that the defendant \u201chas the following <em>gross </em>amounts which are properly included in his support income consideration . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, we conclude that the trial court applied the wrong legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Additionally, because the trial court improperly relied on gross income in determining the defendant\u2019s support obligation, all of the other financial orders appurtenant to the modification proceeding must fail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThis court and the Appellate Court have often described financial orders appurtenant to dissolution proceedings as entirely interwoven and as a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other. . . . Consequently, when an appellate court reverses a trial court judgment based on an improper alimony, property distribution, or child support award, the appellate court\u2019s remand typically authorizes the trial court to reconsider all of the financial orders.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. Smith, supra, 249 Conn. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We conclude, therefore, that, because the trial court expressly and affirmatively stated that it relied on gross income in determining the defendant\u2019s support obligation, the trial court abused its discretion because it applied the wrong legal standard. Additionally, we conclude that, because the child support order is interwoven with other financial orders that are part of the modification, the trial court, on remand, must reconsider all of the financial orders associated with the modification proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new hearing on the motion for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\"> The following colloquy took place between the plaintiffs attorney, the plaintiff and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Attorney]: Have you also agreed that your husband will pay you the sum of four hundred and thirty-three dollars per month as child support as long as he is obligated to pay support for your child?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u201cQ.

And I did explain to you that a strict application of the guidelines would result in a probable payment of about three hundred and fifty dollars per week of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">\u201cQ. And you do understand that we are deviating from the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">\u201cQ. You understand that we are asking the court to deviate from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>guidelines on the grounds that given the alimony and support obligations as seen together, as a package, are sufficient for your support and that of your child?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u201cQ. There is also a provision in here that if [the] alimony is terminated for any reason, then a reasonable child support order would enter in accordance with those guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">* ** *</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right. I will ask some questions now, Mrs. Morris, so we will all get a chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">\u201cHave you had an adequate opportunity to discuss this separation agreement with Attorney [Veronica] Reich?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes, I have.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">\u201cThe Court: All right.

Do you understand it completely?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: I believe so.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-23\">\u201cThe Court: Well ....</p>\n<p id=\"b326-24\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes.

The financial affidavits filed by the parties in 2000 indicated that the plaintiff had a gross weekly income of $759.26 and a net weekly income of $556.26, and that the defendant had a gross weekly income, including base salary and incentive compensation, of $5308.08 and a net weekly income of $3246.63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> Section 46b-215a-2a (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: \u201c(2) . . .
