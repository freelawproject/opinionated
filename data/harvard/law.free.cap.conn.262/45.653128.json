The plaintiff initiated the present action against the town, alleging that the denial of its application for a zoning variance by the town\u2019s zoning board of appeals (board) effected an inverse condemnation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of its property entitling the plaintiff to compensation under the takings clauses of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 11, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>granted the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that the town was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-49. In so concluding, the court determined that the plaintiff was barred, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, from litigating certain factual issues that had been decided by the board in denying the plaintiffs variance application and that ostensibly had been decided by the trial court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>in denying the plaintiffs administrative appeal from the adverse decision of the board. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>improperly gave preclusive effect to the resolution of certain factual issues by the board and the court, <em>Purtill, J. </em>We agree with the plaintiff that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar the plaintiff from litigating, in its inverse condemnation action, any factual issues that are pertinent to its inverse condemnation claim. In light of our conclusion, which compels us to reverse the judgment of the trial court, <em>Martin, J., </em>and remand the case for a determination on the merits of the plaintiffs inverse condemnation claim, we must decide a second issue raised by the plaintiff, namely, whether the court, <em>Hon. D. Michael Hurley, </em>judge trial referee <em>(Hurley, J.), </em>improperly granted the town\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs case from the jury docket. The plaintiff challenges the decision to grant the town\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs case from the jury docket, claiming that the plaintiffs inverse condemnation claim gives rise to a right to a jury trial under article first, \u00a7 19, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reject the plaintiffs claim regarding its right to a jury trial and, accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>affirm the decision of the court, Hurley, to grant the town\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs case from the jury docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">This appeal marks the second occasion that we have had these parties before us in this matter. In <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>247 Conn. 196, 197, 201-202, 719 A.2d 465 (1998), we concluded that the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs application for a variance constituted a final decision that enabled the plaintiff to maintain this separate and independent inverse condemnation action without first pursuing its administrative appeal to completion. Our opinion in that case sets forth the following facts relating to the plaintiffs variance application. \u201c[T]he plaintiff . . . owns land with a building, other structures and improvements in Groton. The building is more than twenty years old and was used as a car repair garage and gasoline service station since before the area was zoned residential by the . . . town. Three underground gasoline storage tanks are also located on the property. The car repair use of the building was abandoned in 1979. The remainder of the building continues to be used to sell gasoline and, to a limited extent, snacks and sundries.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u201cTo comply with environmental laws and regulations, the plaintiffs property requires substantial upgrading. To offset the costs of these improvements, the plaintiff applied to the . . . board . . . for a variance to the zoning regulations so that the [existing] nonconforming use of the property could be expanded to include a convenience store, as well as the existing gasoline service station.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 198. The board denied the plaintiffs variance application after a hearing, stating as its reasons: \u201cNo hardship [was] shown. [The] [v]ariance request did not meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>criteria of [\u00a7 8.5-8]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the [1996] town . . . zoning regulations. [The] [proposed expansion to a convenience store . . . was considered financial. Also, [the] applicant is presently making reasonable use of the property. In addition, the applicant purchased [the] property knowing the nature of the nonconformity].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed from the board\u2019s denial of its variance application to the Superior Court; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 8-8 (b);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> claiming that the board\u2019s decision was illegal, arbitrary and an abuse of its discretion. The plaintiff contended, inter alia, that the board improperly had declined to credit certain expert opinion indicating that the combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>effect of state environmental regulations and the town\u2019s zoning regulations was a diminishment in the value of the plaintiffs property such that the value was \u201cpractically destroy[ed] . . . for any of the uses to which it could reasonably be put . . . .\u201d The court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>rejected the plaintiffs claim, explaining that it was bound, under the deferential standard of review applicable to appeals from the administrative decisions of zoning boards of appeals,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to deny the plaintiffs appeal if any one of the reasons articulated by the board was supported by the record. The court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>then examined each of those reasons and concluded that each reason was \u201creasonably supported by the record.\u201d Consequently, the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>rendered judgment denying the plaintiffs appeal. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a petition for certification to appeal to the Appellate Court, which that court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">During the pendency of the plaintiffs appeal from the board\u2019s denial of its variance application, the plaintiff commenced the present action, alleging that the board\u2019s denial of its application for a variance constituted an inverse condemnation entitling it to compensation under the takings clauses of the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed that the cost of upgrading its property to conform with environmental laws and regulations made it economically unfeasible to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>to use the property under the existing, limited, nonconforming use or to change the use of the property to a conforming use. The plaintiff further claimed that the property was not suitable for redevelopment for uses permitted under the town\u2019s zoning regulations because a gasoline station previously had been operated on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The town moved to dismiss the plaintiffs inverse condemnation claim on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction owing to the plaintiffs pending administrative appeal. The court, <em>Hurley, J., </em>granted the town\u2019s motion to dismiss<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and rendered judgment thereon, from which the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court affirmed. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>46 Conn. App. 514, 520, 699 A.2d 310 (1997). We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal to this court; <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>243 Conn. 936, 702 A.2d 641 (1997); and thereafter reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court, concluding that \u201cthe board\u2019s denial of the variance application constituted a final decision that enabled the plaintiff to maintain an independent inverse condemnation action against the town for an alleged unconstitutional taking without first pursuing its administrative appeal to completion.\u201d <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 201-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">After the case was remanded to the Superior Court, the plaintiff filed a claim for a jury trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-215.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The town moved to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the plaintiffs case from the jury docket, contending that an inverse condemnation claim is equitable in nature and, therefore, does not give rise to a constitutional right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court, <em>Hurley, J., </em>granted the town\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs case from the jury docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Thereafter, the town moved for summary judgment, claiming that no material facts were in dispute because the doctrine of collateral estoppel operated to bar the plaintiff from: (1) relitigating certain factual issues that the board had resolved in denying the plaintiffs vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>anee application; and (2) litigating certain factual issues that, according to the town, had been litigated and decided by the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>in denying the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs variance application. The town further maintained that, on the basis of the apparent resolution of those factual issues by the board and the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>the town was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The court, <em>Martin, J., </em>granted the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment, reasoning that, \u201c[b]ecause the viability of a taking claim based on the denial of a variance application hinges on whether the denial has deprived the property of any reasonable use, the determination of the issue of reasonable use is necessary and essential to the taking claim for purposes of issue preclusion.\u201d After reviewing the memorandum of decision on the merits of the plaintiffs appeal from the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs variance application and the record of the proceedings before the board, the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>concluded that \u201c[t]here [was] ample evidence . . . that the issue [of reasonable use] was raised, litigated and decided in both proceedings.\u201d The court, <em>Martin, J., </em>also observed that the issues of whether a zoning board\u2019s denial of a variance application has deprived the applicant of any reasonable use of the applicant\u2019s property and whether that denial has resulted in a \u201cpractical confiscation\u201d of the applicant\u2019s property are common both to a claim of undue hardship under the zoning regulations and to an inverse condemnation claim. The court, <em>Martin, J., </em>further noted that, although the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>primarily had focused on the relatively narrow issue raised by the plaintiffs administrative appeal, namely, whether the record supported the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs variance application based on a perceived lack of hardship, the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>also expressly had considered, and rejected, the merits of the plaintiffs claim of a regulatory taking. In this regard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>referred to certain statements in the memorandum of decision of the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>to the effect that the plaintiffs alleged economic hardship arose not out of the necessity of complying with the town\u2019s zoning regulations but, rather, out of the necessity of complying with the regulations of the state department of environmental protection. After determining that this issue, like the reasonable use issue, was necessary and essential to the decision of the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>concluded: \u201c[T]he plaintiff has failed to demonstrate the existence of genuine issues as to the facts of no deprivation of any reasonable use under the challenged zoning regulations and the source of claimed financial hardship experienced by the plaintiff. Because there is no genuine issue as to those facts and those issues or facts have been decided against the plaintiff by the board, supported by ample evidence and affirmed by the court <em>[Purtill, J.] </em>in the administrative appeal, the plaintiffs taking claim is foreclosed and the [town] is entitled to judgment in its favor as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>improperly granted the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>court, <em>Martin, J., </em>improperly concluded that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the plaintiff from litigating, in its inverse condemnation action, issues of fact that the board had resolved in denying the plaintiffs variance application and that the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>ostensibly had decided in denying the plaintiffs appeal from the adverse decision of the board. The plaintiff also contends that the court, <em>Hurley, J., </em>improperly granted the town\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs claim from the jury docket. We address each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The plaintiff advances two primary arguments in support of its claim that the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>improperly concluded that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the plaintiff from litigating, in its inverse condemnation action, factual issues that the board had resolved and that the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>ostensibly had decided in denying the plaintiffs administrative appeal. First, the plaintiff contends that the application of that doctrine violated its due process right to a de novo determination of the merits of its inverse condemnation claim. Second, the plaintiff contends that, even if principles of due process do not erect a per se bar to the application of the doctrine, the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>improperly concluded that the issues of fact essential to the plaintiffs takings claim actually had been decided by the board and by the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In response, the town claims that the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>properly precluded the plaintiff from litigating the factual issues that, according to the town, were fully and fairly litigated before the board and subject to review by the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>on appeal. The town further claims that, in applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>properly determined that the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>had resolved two particularly significant fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tual issues, the determination of which was binding on the parties to the plaintiffs inverse condemnation action, namely, that: (1) the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs variance application did not result in a practical confiscation of the plaintiffs property; and (2) the town\u2019s zoning regulations were not the source of the plaintiffs economic hardship. In the town\u2019s view, these purported findings are equally applicable to, and dispositive of, the plaintiffs inverse condemnation claim. We reject the town\u2019s arguments and conclude that: (1) for policy reasons, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar the plaintiff from litigating, in its inverse condemnation action, any and all factual issues relevant to its claim of inverse condemnation regardless of whether those issues were decided by the board;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (2) because none of the factual issues raised by the plaintiff in its inverse condemnation claim actually was litigated and decided in the administrative appeal, the decision of the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>cannot have preclusive effect as to the factual issues raised in the plaintiffs inverse condemnation action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The applicability of the doctrine of collateral estoppel, like the applicability of the closely related doctrine of res judicata,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> presents a question of law that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>review de novo. E.g., <em>R &amp;R Pool &amp; Patio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>257 Conn. 456, 466, 778 A.2d 61 (2001); <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>247 Conn. 575, 594, 726 A.2d 502 (1999). The fundamental principles underlying the doctrine of collateral estoppel are well established. \u201cThe common-law doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, embodies a judicial policy in favor of judicial economy, the stability of former judgments and finality. . . . Collateral estoppel means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit. . . . Issue preclusion arises when an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and that determination is essential to the judgment. . . . Collateral estoppel express [es] no more than the fundamental principle that once a matter has been fully and fairly litigated, and finally decided, it comes to rest.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gladysz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>256 Conn. 249, 260, 773 A.2d 300 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel is neither statutorily nor constitutionally mandated. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>doctrine, rather, is a judicially created rule of reason that is \u201cenforced on public policy grounds.\u201d <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, Local 998, </em>248 Conn. 108, 127, 728 A.2d 1063 (1999). Accordingly, as we have observed in regard to the doctrine of res judicata, the decision whether to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel in any particular case \u201cshould be made based upon a consideration of the doctrine\u2019s underlying policies, namely, the interests of the defendant and of the courts in bringing litigation to a close . . . and the competing interest of the plaintiff in the vindication of a just claim. . . . These [underlying] purposes are generally identified as being (1) to promote judicial economy by minimizing repetitive litigation; (2) to prevent inconsistent judgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial system; and (3) to provide repose by preventing a person from being harassed by vexatious litigation. . . . The judicial doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel are based on the public policy that a party should not be able to relitigate a matter which it already has had an opportunity to litigate. . . . Stability in judgments grants to parties and others the certainty in the management of their affairs which results when a controversy is finally laid to rest.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Truck Service, Inc., </em>253 Conn. 416, 422-23, 752 A.2d 509 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We also have recognized, however, that \u201cthe application of the collateral estoppel doctrine has dramatic consequences for the party against whom the doctrine is applied. [Consequently] [c]ourts should be careful that the effect of the doctrine does not work an injustice.\u201d <em>Gladysz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 261. Thus, \u201c[t]he doctrines of preclusion . . . should be flexible and must give way when their mechanical application would frustrate other social policies based on values equally or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>important than the convenience afforded by finality in legal controversies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Truck Service, Inc., </em>supra, 253 Conn. 423; see also <em>Quinones Candelario </em>v. <em>Postmaster General of the United States, </em>906 F.2d 798, 801 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 919, 111 S. Ct. 1307, 113 L. Ed. 2d 242 (1991) (eschewing automatic or rigid application of doctrine of res judicata to determinations in administrative proceedings in face of contrary public policy). Accordingly, on occasion, we have recognized exceptions to the general policy favoring application of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. See, e.g., <em>Isaac v. Truck Service, Inc., </em>supra, 422, 429 (preclusion doctrines do not bar relitigation of property damage claim, which initially was litigated in small claims court, in subsequent personal injury action pending on regular civil docket even though both small claims and personal injury actions were predicated on same events); <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, Local 998, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 124-25 (second arbitration panel need not give preclusive effect to issues decided by first arbitration panel even when decisions of both panels involve same parties and interpretation of same contract provision); <em>State </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>242 Conn. 648, 654, 657, 699 A.2d 987 (1997) (doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar state from bringing defendant to trial on criminal charges even though state had failed to prove those charges as basis for probation violation); <em>Connecticut Natural Gas Corp. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>239 Conn. 313, 323, 684 A.2d 1173 (1996) (doctrine of res judicata cannot be invoked to preclude relitigation of determination made in summary proceeding for appointment of receiver of rents brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-262f); <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 582, 598, 674 A.2d 1290 (1996) (doctrine of res judicata does not bar relitigation of tort claim that had been litigated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>and decided in prior marital dissolution proceeding); <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, </em>Inc., 226 Conn. 475, 486-89, 628 A.2d 946 (1993) (adverse determination on issue in arbitration proceeding does not preclude employee from relitigating issue in subsequent action for retaliatory discharge). In establishing exceptions to the general application of the preclusion doctrines, we have identified several factors to consider, including: (1) whether another public policy interest outweighs the interest of finality served by the preclusion doctrines; see, e.g., <em>Stratford v. International Assn. of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, Local 998, </em>supra, 127-28; (2) whether the incentive to litigate a claim or issue differs as between the two forums; <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Truck Service, Inc., </em>supra, 428-29; <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 594; (3) whether the opportunity to litigate the claim or issue differs as between the two forums; see, e.g., <em>Connecticut Natural Gas Corp. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 323; <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>supra, 489; and (4) whether the legislature has evinced an intent that the doctrine should not apply. See, e.g., <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>supra, 487-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">As a general matter, administrative decisions are entitled to preclusive effect. E.g., <em>Lafayette </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>255 Conn. 762, 773, 770 A.2d 1 (2001); <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>226 Conn. 105, 129, 627 A.2d 1257 (1993); see <em>Wade\u2019s Dairy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>181 Conn. 556, 561, 436 A.2d 24 (1980); <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Avco-Lycoming Division, </em>163 Conn. 309, 318, 307 A.2d 155 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1116, 93 S. Ct. 903, 34 L. Ed. 2d 699 (1973); see also 2 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 83 (1), p. 266 (1982) (\u201ca valid and final adjudicative determination by an administrative tribunal has the same effects under the rules of res judicata, subject to the same exceptions and qualifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tions, as a judgment of a court\u201d). We are persuaded, however, that this case necessitates an exception to the general rule and, consequently, the plaintiff should not have been precluded from relitigating any issue relating to its constitutional takings claim that may have been decided in the course of the plaintiffs administrative efforts to obtain a zoning variance. We premise this conclusion primarily on the nature of the right that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate through its inverse condemnation claim and the particular administrative context in which the board made its findings in denying the plaintiffs variance application.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We begin by emphasizing, as we did in our opinion addressing the plaintiffs earlier appeal; see <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 207-208; the distinction between an administrative appeal to the Superior Court from an adverse decision of a zoning board of appeals and an inverse condemnation action. Although our statutory scheme affords an aggrieved applicant the right to judicial review of the denial of a variance application, the scope of that review is limited. See id., 207. See generally General Statutes \u00a7 8-8. As we have indicated; see footnote 8 of this opinion; when, as in the present case, a zoning board of appeals has articulated its reasons for the action it has taken, the trial court\u2019s review of those reasons is limited to determining whether they are supported by the record and, if so, whether, under the applicable zoning regulations, the reasons given provide a legally sufficient basis for the zoning board\u2019s action. Thus, the trial court <em>does not find facts, </em>and it may not substitute its judgment for that of the zoning board.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> E.g., <em>R &amp; R Pool &amp; Patio, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 470. Furthermore, no monetary remedy is available in an administrative appeal. E.g., <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 207. See generally General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (k).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">By contrast, a plaintiff in an inverse condemnation action seeks to demonstrate that the action of a zoning board of appeals resulted in a taking that, in turn, gives rise to a constitutional right to compensation. E.g., <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 207-208. A plaintiff who brings an inverse condemnation action may vindicate that right in the Superior Court, where the court<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> hears evidence, finds facts and determines whether the action of a zoning board amounts to a practical confiscation. See id., 208. If so, the couit also determines what compensation is due. Id. If a plaintiff does not prevail in the Superior Court, he is entitled, as a matter of law, to appellate review. General Statutes \u00a7 52-263. With these distinctions in mind, we now turn to the issue of whether the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>properly invoked the doctrine of collateral estoppel under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">As we noted previously, the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>applied a deferential standard of review to the board\u2019s factual findings. Therefore, to accord preclusive effect to the board\u2019s findings in the context presented would be to vest the board with the responsibility of deciding the facts underlying the plaintiffs constitutional claim and, in effect, would give the board the authority to settle the issue raised by that claim. Under such a regime, local zoning boards would have the power to decide virtually all inverse condemnation actions that are predicated on a claim that the denial of a variance application constitutes a practical confiscation. Such a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>would run counter to the well established common-law principle that administrative agencies lack the authority to determine constitutional questions. See, e.g., <em>Genden </em>v. <em>American Airlines, </em>257 Conn. 520, 525, 778 A.2d 58 (2001); <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 490 n.8, 778 A.2d 33 (2001); <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>209 Conn. 544, 551, 552 A.2d 796 (1989), overruled on other grounds, <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>245 Conn. 551, 715 A.2d 46 (1998); <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 343-44, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985). Moreover, we are particularly reluctant to relegate to zoning boards the responsibility for constitutional fact-finding in view of the fact that the citizen volunteers who compose such boards generally are not land use professionals but, rather, \u201claypersons with little or no technical expertise.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Kelley Property Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>226 Conn. 314, 341, 627 A.2d 909 (1993); see also <em>DeBeradinis </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>228 Conn. 187, 198-99 n.7, 635 A.2d 1220 (1994) (\u201clocal land use commission [is] composed of laypersons whose procedural savoir-faire may not rise to the sophisticated level needed to achieve strict compliance with the statutory directions under which they operate\u201d); <em>Carini </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>164 Conn. 169, 172, 319 A.2d 390 (1972), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 831, 94 S. Ct. 64, 38 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1973) (\u201cpublic-spirited citizens volunteer to perform their civic duties in serving on boards such as those involving zoning\u201d). Furthermore, although members of local zoning boards undoubtedly strive to attain a high degree of impartiality, especially when acting in their adjudicative capacity, they nevertheless are governed by rules that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>contrast to those governing court proceedings, encourage input by members of the general public with an interest in the outcome of the board\u2019s deliberations. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-7;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> see also <em>Willimantic Car Wash, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>247 Conn. 732, 739, 724 A.2d 1108 (1999) (\u201c[b]ecause of the public impact of land use decisions, Connecticut\u2019s governing statutory scheme promotes public participation in such decision making\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Our conclusion is reinforced by virtue of the fact that, in the present case, <em>the board\u2019s decision itself is the action that gives rise to the constitutional claim. </em>Cf. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 208. Thus, this case presents a fact pattern that is readily distinguishable from the scenario involving a proceeding in which the doctrine of collateral estoppel is applied to preclude the relitigation of certain factual issues and in which the claim being asserted does not arise out of the agency\u2019s actions. See, e.g., <em>University of Tennessee </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>478 U.S. 788, 796-99, 106 S. Ct. 3220, 92 L.

Moreover, as we mentioned previously, the board\u2019s decision is subject to highly deferential judicial review.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The town claims that even if the board\u2019s resolution of factual issues is not entitled to preclusive effect, the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>properly gave such effect to certain findings ostensibly made by the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>in rejecting the plaintiffs administrative appeal. Specifically, the town contends that the memorandum of decision of the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>reflects the following findings: (1) that the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs variance application did not result in a practical confiscation; and (2) that certain state and federal environmental regulations, and not the town\u2019s zoning regulations, constituted the source of the plaintiffs alleged hardship.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The town further contends that these findings are dispositive of the plaintiffs inverse condemnation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We disagree with the town\u2019s contention. With respect to the issue of practical confiscation, the passing reference to a regulatory taking found in the memorandum of decision of the court, <em>Purtill, </em>J.; see footnote 24 of this opinion; reasonably cannot be considered a finding on that issue. Moreover, that issue was not raised by the plaintiff in its administrative appeal,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and it, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>fore, was not an issue subject to review by the court, <em>Purtill, </em>J.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Consequently, even if the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>had intended to make a finding on the issue\u2014and it is clear from the record that it did not\u2014any such finding would be dictum and, therefore, not entitled to preclusive effect. See <em>Leydon </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>257 Conn. 318, 357 n.46, 777 A.2d 552 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">For similar reasons, the observation of the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>that the source of the plaintiffs alleged hardship was not the town\u2019s zoning regulations but, rather, state and federal environmental regulations, also does not have preclusive effect in the plaintiffs inverse condemnation action. Even if we assume, arguendo, that the court\u2019s statement on that issue can be characterized as a finding, neither of the parties raised that issue during the proceedings before the board, and it was not addressed in the board\u2019s decision. As we have indicated, the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inapplicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>in such circumstances.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 374 (\u201c[t]o assert successfully the doctrine of issue preclusion . . .

We also conclude that the decision of the court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>to deny the plaintiffs administrative appeal does not preclude the plaintiff from litigating any factual issues in its inverse condemnation action.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Because the court, <em>Mar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>tin, J., </em>improperly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel in granting the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judgment of the court, <em>Martin, J., </em>must be reversed and the case must be remanded to the trial court for a determination on the merits of the issues raised by the plaintiff in its inverse condemnation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In light of our conclusion in part I of this opinion, we also must decide whether, contrary to the decision of the court, <em>Hurley, J., </em>to grant the town\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs case from the jury docket, the plaintiffs inverse condemnation action gives rise to a right to a jury trial.

Our resolution of this issue, however, is guided by well settled principles. \u201c[A]rticle first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution . . . guarantees the right to a jury trial in all cases for which such a right existed at the time of the adoption of that constitutional provision in 1818 . . .

Accordingly, in determining whether a party has a right to a trial by juiy under the state constitution and ... \u00a7 52-215, we must ascertain whether the action being tried . . . has roots in the common law, and if so, whether the remedy involved was one in law or equity.

This test is \u201cflexible and may require a jury in a new cause of action, not in existence in [1818], if it involves rights and remedies of the sort traditionally enforced in an action at law or if its nearest historical analogue is an action at common law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The federal courts apply a similar test when determining whether the right to a jury trial exists under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>seventh amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Boschen, </em>143 Conn. 159, 162, 120 A.2d 546 (1956) (recognizing similarity in federal and state tests). Under the federal approach, federal courts consider whether the cause of action was one tried at law when the seventh amendment was adopted in 1791 or whether the action is substantially similar to such an action. See, <em>e.g., Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>517 U.S. 370, 376, 116 S. Ct. 1384, 134 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1996); <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 193, 94 S. Ct. 1005, 39 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1974). Accordingly, although the seventh amendment guarantee to a jury trial applies only to actions in federal courts; e.g., <em>GTFM, LLC </em>v. <em>TKN Sales, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 235, 245 (2d Cir. 2001); <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 379 n.9; we nevertheless may look to federal case law for guidance in determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial under article first, \u00a7 19, and \u00a7 52-215, in light of the similarity between the federal and state tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Inverse condemnation is a modem day concept, unknown at the time of the adoption of the Connecticut constitutional provision guaranteeing a jury trial. See <em>Monterey </em>v. <em>Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., </em>526 U.S. 687, 711-17, 119 S. Ct. 1624, 143 L.

We therefore must determine whether an inverse condemnation action is analogous to any com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>mon-law action that was triable to a jury prior to 1818, the year in which the provision of our state constitution guaranteeing the right to a jury trial in civil cases was adopted. We begin by examining the nature of the action at issue. Inverse condemnation is \u201ca cause of action against a governmental defendant to recover the value of property which has been taken in fact by the governmental defendant, even though no formal exercise of the power of eminent domain has been attempted by the taking agency.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>445 U.S. 253, 257, 100 S.

Accordingly, an inverse condemnation action has been aptly described as \u201can eminent domain proceeding initiated by the property owner rather than the condemnor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Dept. of Water &amp; Power, </em>219 Cal. App. 3d 1124, 1138, 268 Cal. Rptr. 559 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The close relationship between eminent domain and inverse condemnation is further evidenced by the fact that the evolution of inverse condemnation as a cause of action may be traced directly to eminent domain jurisprudence.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, the legal principles that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>apply in eminent domain proceedings generally apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>with equal force in inverse condemnation actions. See <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>482 U.S. 304, 315, 107 S. Ct. 2378, 96 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1987) (\u201cThe fact that condemnation proceedings were not instituted and that the right was asserted in suits by the owners [does] not change the essential nature of the claim. The form of the remedy did not qualify the right. It rested upon the Fifth Amendment.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>New Port Largo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Monroe County, </em>95 F.3d 1084, 1092 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S.

Because the principles underlying a constitutional taking by eminent domain or inverse condemnation are essentially sui generis, it is not surprising that there is no other claim or cause of action, extant before or after 1818, that is comparable to an inverse condemnation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Our determination that an inverse condemnation action is analogous to an eminent domain proceeding\u2014 and to no other cause of action that existed prior to 1818\u2014is fatal to the plaintiffs claim that it is entitled to a jury trial, for it is well settled that eminent domain proceedings are equitable in nature. <em>Northeast Ct.

Consequently, it is well settled, under both federal and Connecticut law, that no right to a jury trial existed at common law in eminent domain proceedings.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>397 U.S. 14, 18, 90 S.

Id., 695-98 (opinion announcing judgment). A jury awarded Del Monte Dunes damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>on its takings claim; id., 701 (opinion announcing judgment); and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict.

The city appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, claiming, inter alia, that Del Monte Dunes\u2019 takings claim did not give rise to a right to a jury trial. <em>Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Monterey, </em>95 F.3d 1422, 1425 (9th Cir. 1996). The Ninth Circuit rejected the city\u2019s contention and affirmed. Id., 1427-28, 1430, 1435. A majority of the United States Supreme Court agreed that Del Monte Dunes was entitled to a jury trial on its action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking damages for an unconstitutional regulatory taking. <em>Monterey </em>v. <em>Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., </em>supra, 526 U.S. 721-22 (opinion announcing judgment); id., 732 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In evaluating the jury trial issue, the court engaged in a historical analysis; see id., 712-16 (opinion announcing judgment); see also part IIA of this opinion; to determine whether Del Monte Dunes\u2019 claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 was analogous to a cause of action that was \u201ctried at law at the time of the founding [of the seventh amendment] . . . .\u201d <em>Monterey </em>v. <em>Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., </em>supra, 526 U.S. 708 (opinion announcing judgment), quoting <em>Markman </em>v. <em>Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>supra, 517 U.S. 376. The court further explained that the seventh amendment \u201cjury guarantee extends to statutory claims unknown to the common law, [e.g., a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983] so long as the claims can be said to soun[d] basically in tort, and seek legal relief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Monterey </em>v. <em>Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., </em>supra, 709 (opinion announcing judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In concluding that Del Monte Dunes\u2019 claim met that test, the court relied on two important and related considerations, the first of which is the \u201cessential character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983] . . . .\u201d Id. After noting the importance of that consideration to its seventh amendment analysis, the court stated: \u201c[T]here can be no doubt that claims brought pursuant to [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983 sound in tort. Just as common-law tort actions provide redress for interference with protected personal or property interests, [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983 provides relief for invasions of rights protected under federal law. . . . [Thus, the court has] repeatedly noted that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 creates a species of tort liability . . . and ha[s] interpreted the statute in light of the background of tort liability .... [The court\u2019s] settled understanding of [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983 and the Seventh Amendment thus compel[s] the conclusion that a suit for legal relief brought under the statute is an action at law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 709-10 (opinion announcing judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In concluding that Del Monte Dunes had \u201csought legal relief\u2019; id., 710; the court identified a second factor critical to its analysis: when the applications of Del Monte Dunes and its predecessor in interest were denied by the city, California law provided no remedy for regulatory takings. Id. As the court explained, \u201c[Del Monte Dunes] was entitled to proceed in federal court under [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983 because, at the time of the city\u2019s actions, the [s]tate of California did not provide a compensatory remedy for temporary regulatory takings. . . . The constitutional injury alleged, therefore, is not that property was taken but that it was taken without just compensation. Had the city paid for the property <em>or had an adequate postdeprivation remedy been available, Del Monte Dunes would have suffered no constitutional injury from the taking alone.</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> . . . </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Because its statutory action did not accrue until it was denied just compensation, in a strict sense Del Monte Dunes sought not just compensation <em>per se </em>but rather damages for the unconstitutional denial of such compensation. Damages for a constitutional violation are a legal remedy.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The court in <em>Del Monte Dunes </em>repeatedly underscored the significance of the fact that California law afforded Del Monte Dunes no procedure for obtaining compensation for a regulatory taking. E.g., id., 712 (opinion announcing judgment) (\u201c[w]here, as here, the government not only denies liability but fails to provide an adequate postdeprivation remedy [thus refusing to submit the question of liability to an impartial arbiter], the disadvantage to the owner becomes all the greater\u201d); id., 715 (opinion announcing judgment) (\u201c[i]n this case . . .

Moreover, in light of the significant differences between an inverse condemnation action and an administrative appeal from an adverse decision of a zoning board, we see no reason why a property owner who wishes to pursue both of those separate and independent legal avenues should be required to seek a consolidation of both actions.

In <em>Scalzo, </em>the plaintiff, Peter V. Scalzo, had sought both a variance and an amendment to the Danbury zoning regulations to permit him to gain access to certain residential property via property located in an industrial zone. The defendant zoning board of appeals denied Scalzo\u2019s application for a variance, and the defendant zoning commission denied his request for an amendment to the zoning regulations. Id., 126. Scalzo filed two separate appeals, one from the adverse decision of the zoning board and one from the adverse decision of the zoning commission. Id. In both appeals, Scalzo claimed, inter alia, that the zoning authorities had acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of their discretion because their actions constituted an unreasonable taking of Scalzo\u2019s property. Id. The trial court, <em>Stodolink, J., </em>rejected both appeals, concluding, inter alia, that neither the denial of the variance application nor the denial of the amendment application resulted in a taking. Id. While those administrative appeals were pending, Scalzo filed an independent action against the city of Danbury, its zoning board and its zoning commission (the defendants), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>claiming that the adverse actions of the board and the commission had resulted in a taking of his property for which he was entitled to compensation. Id., 126-27. The trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that Scalzo\u2019s takings claim had been fully and fairly litigated in Scalzo\u2019s previous administrative appeals and, consequently, Scalzo was precluded from relitigating that claim in connection with his regulatory takings action. Id., 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">On appeal to this court, Scalzo \u201cconceded . . . that the taking issue had been litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment.\u201d Id., 129.

Id. We determined, contrary to Scalzo\u2019s claim, that the court\u2019s finding was essential to the resolution of Scalzo\u2019s administrative appeals; id., 132; a conclusion that we have no occasion to reconsider in this appeal. In <em>Scalzo, </em>however, we were not asked to decide the issue presented by this appeal, namely, whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel properly may be invoked to preclude the plaintiff from litigating certain factual issues relating to its inverse condemnation claim.

The suit by B, to require the government to pay just compensation for the taking of B\u2019s property as well, acquired the name of inverse condemnation.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Hendler </em>v. <em>United States, </em>952 F.2d 1364, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Initially, however, the United States Supreme Court \u201cdid not view overly restrictive regulation as triggering an award of compensation, but as an invalid means of accomplishing what constitutionally can be accomplished only through the exercise of eminent domain. See, e.g., <em>Block </em>v. <em>Hirsh, </em>256 U.S. 135, 156 [41 S. Ct. 458, 65 L. Ed. 865] (1921); <em>Hudson County Water Co. </em>v. <em>McCarter, </em>209 U.S. 349, 355 [28 S. Ct. 529, 52 L. Ed. 828] (1908); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>205 U.S. 135, 139 [27 S. Ct. 440, 51 L. Ed. 743] (1907).\u201d <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>473 U.S. 172, 199, 105 S. Ct. 3108, 87 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1985). Thus, \u201cfor many years a landowner\u2019s sole relief in a constitutional challenge based on a land use regulation was invalidation of the regulation. . . . The constitutional alternative provided by the Fifth Amendment of upholding an overly-intrusive regulation by treating it as a lawful taking requiting just compensation was not an issue that attracted judicial attention.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Hendler </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 952 F.2d 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">This court\u2019s first recognition of the principles underlying a regulatory taking traces its roots to <em>State </em>v. <em>Hillman, </em>110 Conn. 92, 105, 147 A. 294 (1929). For many years after <em>Hillman, </em>this court dealt with takings resulting from the application of land use regulations by invalidating the applicable ordinance or amendment thereto. See, e.g., <em>Corthouts </em>v. <em>Newington, </em>140 Conn. 284, 290, 99 A.2d 112 (1953) (invalidating amendment to zoning ordinance \u201cso far as it affect[ed] the plaintiffs property\u201d); cf. <em>Strain </em>v. <em>Mims, </em>123 Conn. 275, 290-91, 193 A. 754 (1937). In 1971, our legislature authorized the payment of compensation to aggrieved property owners who could establish a regulatory taking. See Public Acts 1971, No. 518, \u00a7 2, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 48-17b. Even after the legislature granted such authority, however, this court noted that injunctive relief ordinarily would be the proper remedy. See <em>DeMello </em>v. <em>Plainville, </em>170 Conn. 675, 680, 368 A.2d 71 (1976) (\u201c[GJovemmental action under the guise of the police power which is claimed to be arbitrary and confiscatory may be challenged by seeking injunctive or declaratory relief, or as a defense to enforcement proceedings. But such an abuse of the police power does not generally give rise to a cause of action for compensatory damages.\u201d). See generally <em>Laurel, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>169 Conn. 195, 200-202, 362 A.2d 1383 (1975) (discussing development of takings jurisprudence).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>In 1987, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>482 U.S. 304, 319-20, 107 S. Ct. 2378, 96 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1987), squarely addressed the issue of compensation for a regulatory taking. In that case, \u201c[t]he regulation at issue prevented the landowner from rebuilding alter a flood destroyed buildings on the property. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u201cThe state argued that the landowner\u2019s remedy [for the regulatory taking] could be limited by state law simply to a determination of [the] validity of the uncompensated regulatory enactment; only if the state insisted on enforcement <em>after </em>the regulation was judicially determined to require compensation would compensation be due. The [United States] Supreme Court rejected that reading of the Fifth Amendment. The Constitution, said the Court, requires just compensation for a regulatory taking from the date it occurs until the date of the regulation\u2019s rescission or amendment.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Hendler v.

Rev. 2000) \u00a7 4.105 [1], p. 4-115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\"> In an inverse condemnation action, the court is required to determine, first, whether the regulatory action gives rise to an unconstitutional taking. Although this determination may involve fact-finding, that circumstance alone does not suffice to entitle the plaintiff in such an action to a jury trial. See, e.g., <em>Meigs </em>v. <em>Theis, </em>supra, 102 Conn. 594 (\u201cproceedings for condemnation of land . . . [are also actions in] which serious questions of fact might be contested; yet in such matters there has never been any question as to the right of the tribunal provided to try issues of fact without a jury\u201d). Indeed, it is not uncommon for trial courts to engage in fact-finding in eminent domain proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Towpath Associates, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 554 (reviewing trial court\u2019s findings of fact in eminent domain proceeding regarding value of condemned property); <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>221 Conn. 736, 748, 607 A.2d 402 (1992) (reviewing trial court\u2019s findings of fact in eminent domain proceeding regarding probability of future zone change); <em>Bugryn </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>63 Conn.

General Statutes \u00a7 48-17b provides: \u201cThe state court rendering a judgment for the plaintiff in an inverse condemnation proceeding brought against the state by the owner of real property, or the Attorney General effecting a settlement of any such proceeding, shall determine and award or allow to such plaintiff, as a part of such judgment or settlement, such sum as will in the opinion of the court or the Attorney General reimburse such plaintiff for his reasonable costs, disbursements and expenses, including reasonable attorney, appraisal and engineering fees, actually incurred because of such proceeding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b106-5\"> We acknowledge that a plurality of the court in <em>Del Monte Dunes </em>addressed at some length the distinctions between inverse condemnation actions and eminent domain proceedings. See generally <em>Monterey </em>v. <em>Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., </em>supra, 526 U.S. 711-15 (opinion announcing judgment). The plurality did so, however, in order to address the city\u2019s contention that the two actions were analogous; id., 711 (opinion announcing judgment); as well as to respond to the separate concurring and dissenting opinion of Justice Souter, which was joined by Justices O\u2019Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer, in which Justice Souter concluded that the city\u2019s analogy was an appropriate one. See id., 734-36, 739-40 (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The plurality indicated that, even though it addressed the differences between direct and inverse condemnation, its discussion in that regard was not essential to its holding regarding Del Monte Dunes\u2019 right to a jury trial in its action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See id., 721 (opinion announcing judgment). Moreover, we are not persuaded that the differences between eminent domain proceedings and inverse condemnation actions outweigh their similarities for the purpose of determining whether an inverse condemnation action gives rise to a jury trial under our state constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b107-5\"> The plaintiff also relies on language in <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 209, in which we highlighted certain similarities between inverse condemnation actions and takings claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We stated: \u201cThere is no relevant distinction between the procedure and the substance of a pure taking claim and a \u00a7 1983 taking claim that would justify different treatment <em>with respect to the applicability of the exhaustion and finality doctrines. </em>In reviewing our precedent and the policy considerations underlying taking claims of either genre, we conclude that the <em>inapplicability of the exhaustion doctrine is equally applicable </em>to both \u00a7 1983 taking claims and pure taking claims.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The plaintiff s reliance on this language is misplaced because, in its previous appeal, we had no occasion to address the jury trial issue raised in the present appeal. Instead, we considered the applicability of the exhaustion and finality doctrines to inverse condemnation claims, doctrines that implicate this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. Id., 201-202; see, e.g., <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 530, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002) (exhaustion doctrine); <em>Port Clinton Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>217 Conn. 588, 604, 587 A.2d 126, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 814, 112 S. Ct. 64, 116 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1991) (finality doctrine). The reasons that prompted our similar treatment of inverse condemnation claims and claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for those purposes essentially are irrelevant to our analysis of the jury trial issue presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Finally, the plaintiff relies on <em>Filisko </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>176 Conn. 33, 404 A.2d 889 (1978), as precedent supporting the right to a jury trial in inverse condemnation actions. In <em>Filisko, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 inverse condemnation claim, along with two other claims, was tried to the jury. Id., 35. The issue of whether a <em>right </em>to a jury trial in inverse condemnation actions exists, however, was not raised in that case. Apparently, the defendants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>Filisko </em>did not object to a jury determination with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 inverse condemnation claim. Inasmuch as the defendants in <em>Filisko </em>did not object to the plaintiffs\u2019 submission of their inverse condemnation claim to a jury, the mere fact that that claim was tried to a jury lends no support to the contention of the plaintiff in the present case that there is a <em>right </em>to a jury trial in inverse condemnation cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
