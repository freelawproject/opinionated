We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claims, and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the evening of July 2, 1998, Fred Anderson, the victim, drove his car and met up with Juan Maldonado. The two men proceeded to drive around for awhile and sell drugs together. A short time thereafter, Anderson saw the defendant, who was known to Anderson as \u201cMike\u201d or \u201cO.G.,\u201d walking on the street. The defendant subsequently got into Anderson\u2019s car. Stopping only once briefly at the house of the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Anderson, Maldonado and the defendant then drove around together until 2 or 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Anderson then dropped the defendant and Maldonado off at their respective houses before returning to his house in Hartford, where he resided with his girlfriend, Donnette Williamson, and Williamson\u2019s three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">After having been dropped off, Maldonado went to bed, but was awakened about one-half hour later by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the defendant, who was knocking loudly on the windows and doors of his home. Maldonado looked outside and saw that the defendant had returned in a white car driven by a third person known to Maldonado only as \u201cFat Boy.\u201d Maldonado went to the door and the defendant told Maldonado to come out for a ride. Maldonado left his house and got into the car with the defendant and \u201cFat Boy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u201cFat Boy\u201d drove the car to Plainfield Street, one street behind the street where Anderson resided, and parked the car. Before exiting the car, the defendant produced a handgun and told Maldonado that he and \u201cFat Boy\u201d planned to rob Anderson. The defendant and \u201cFat Boy\u201d put on black masks and the three men got out of the car. After leaving the vehicle, they jumped a fence onto Anderson\u2019s property and approached the front door. The defendant pointed the gun at Maldonado and insisted that Maldonado knock on the front door and ring the doorbell while the defendant and \u201cFat Boy\u201d crouched on either side of the door of Anderson\u2019s house. At this time, Maldonado saw that \u201cFat Boy\u201d also was armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Wilhamson was awakened by the doorbell, went to the door and asked who was there. Maldonado told Wilhamson through the closed door that he was stranded and asked to be let in. Wilhamson did not recognize Maldonado\u2019s voice and went to get Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Anderson and Wilhamson then went to the front of the house and Anderson looked out of a front window. He had a brief verbal exchange with Maldonado, whom he recognized, and also noted that there was an armed man crouching behind Maldonado. Maldonado asked repeatedly to be let into Anderson\u2019s home. Anderson told Maldonado to leave immediately and instructed Wilhamson to call the pohce. Anderson then pressed the \u201cpanic switch\u201d of his burglar alarm system. At this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>moment, the defendant stood up and fired gunshots through the front door. The defendant then entered Anderson\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">One bullet fired from the defendant\u2019s gun struck Anderson in his left arm and another bullet traveled through the door of the bedroom where Williamson\u2019s young daughters were sleeping. Anderson retreated into the house and the defendant followed him, through several rooms and into the bedroom he shared with Williamson, where the defendant shot at Anderson again. Anderson retreated to an open closet, but was caught by the defendant. The two men struggled, and Anderson grabbed the defendant\u2019s arms in order to avoid being shot at again. While they struggled, the defendant repeatedly demanded to know where Anderson kept his money.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Anderson recognized the voice and body build of his assailant as belonging to the defendant, whom Anderson had known for approximately ten years, and with whom he earlier had passed the evening. Anderson also recognized the defendant\u2019s clothes as being those worn by the armed person who had crouched behind Maldonado at the front door. The two men continued to struggle and the defendant repeatedly demanded that Anderson let go of the gun. When Anderson\u2019s arm finally gave out, he fell to the floor, at which time the defendant shot him in the hip. The defendant then fled from Anderson\u2019s house. The police arrived shortly thereafter and, Anderson told an officer on the scene that it was the defendant who had shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged with the offenses for which he was later convicted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After his conviction, the defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel by failing to inquire into the decision by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel (defense counsel) to sit a distance of eight to ten feet away from the defendant during voir dire. The defendant maintains that defense counsel's positioning violated the attorney\u2019s duty of loyalty to the defendant and represented a potential conflict of interest into which the trial court had a duty to inquire. The defendant further urges that this deprivation of his right to the effective assistance of counsel was such that an automatic reversal of his conviction is warranted under federal and Connecticut case law. In response, the state argues that defense counsel\u2019s distance from the defendant during voir dire represented only a potential conflict of interest<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the trial court\u2019s inquiry into the conflict was wholly adequate. Pursuant to the holding of the United States Supreme Court in the recent case of <em>Mickens </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>535 U.S. 162, 171, 122 S. Ct. 1237, 152 L. Ed. 2d 291 (2002), the state also asserts that, because the defendant has not shown that the \u201cconflict\u201d between defense counsel and the defendant resulted in any deficiency in counsel\u2019s performance during voir dire or at trial, the defendant\u2019s first claim must fail. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. On the third day of voir dire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>after a brief recess was taken so that the defendant could change out of prison garb and into \u201cstreet clothes,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a strain between the defendant and defense counsel became apparent. This tension was evidenced by the fact that, rather than taking a seat next to the defendant at counsel table, defense counsel sat approximately eight to ten feet away from his client. Later, outside the presence of any venireperson, the defendant informed the court of his dissatisfaction with this arrangement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defense counsel stated that he had chosen to sit some distance from his client for \u201csecurity purposes.\u201d He declined to elaborate further on what had transpired between them explaining that he was concerned that further detail might prejudice the court against the defendant. Defense counsel assured the trial court, however, that he would be able to communicate with his client throughout the voir dire.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant responded that he was not as concerned about being able to communicate with his attorney as he was about the appearance of their seating arrangement, stating to the court: \u201cIt\u2019s about how it looks to the jury if he\u2019s supposed to represent me. How\u2019s that look if he doesn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>want to sit next to me but he wants to be my lawyer and take my money?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The trial court expressed its concern about the situation and acknowledged that conflicts often develop between clients and their counsel dining the emotionally charged process of a trial. The trial court suggested that defense counsel take a seat at the table beside his client.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defense counsel declined to reposition himself, and indicated to the trial court that he was not \u201clooking to be released from representation in this case . . . .\u201d Defense counsel further stated, however, that he wanted to sit with \u201ctwo sheriffs in between us\u201d and that they could \u201ccommunicate in writing or behind glass.\u201d The trial court then asked the defendant if he wanted defense counsel to continue representing him. The defendant reiterated his concern about his attorney\u2019s location but stated that he wanted to retain him as counsel. A brief discussion about the conflict ensued.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Defense counsel assured the court that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d could represent the defendant adequately and the trial court subsequently decided to \u201csee how it develop [ed].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On the first day of trial, defense counsel informed the court that the situation that had led to his decision to sit apart from his client had been resolved.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cAlmost without exception, we have required that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be raised by way of habeas corpus, rather than by direct appeal, because of the need for a full evidentiary record for such [a] claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>246 Conn. 665, 687-88, 718 A.2d 925 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1125, 119 S. Ct. 911, 142 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>233 Conn. 106, 131 n.16, 659 A.2d 683 (1995). \u201cOn the rare occasions that we have addressed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal, we have limited our review to allegations that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights had been jeopardized by the actions of the <em>trial court, </em>rather than by those of his counsel.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>supra, 688; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 414 n.24, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>201 Conn. 74, 83, 513 A.2d 116 (1986). \u201cWe have addressed such claims, moreover, only where the record of the trial court\u2019s allegedly improper action was adequate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>review or the issue presented was a question of law, not one of fact requiring further evidentiary development.\u201d <em>State v. Crespo, </em>supra, 688; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 414 n.24. We, therefore, review the defendant\u2019s claim as a question of law and, as with all questions of law, our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>AvalonBay Communities </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>260 Conn. 232, 240, 796 A.2d 1164 (2002); <em>Millbrook Owners Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Standard, </em>257 Conn. 1, 14, 776 A.2d 1115 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u201cThe sixth amendment to the United States constitution as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, guarantee to a criminal defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932); <em>Festo </em>v. <em>Luckart, </em>191 Conn. 622, 626, 469 A.2d 1181 (1983). Where a constitutional right to counsel exists, our Sixth Amendment cases hold that there is a correlative right to representation that is free from conflicts of interest. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>450 U.S. 261, 271, 101 S. Ct. 1097, 67 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1981). <em>Festo </em>v. <em>Luckart, </em>supra, 626-27. . . . [0]ne of the principal safeguards of this right is the rule announced by this court that [a trial] court must explore the possibility of conflict . . . when it knows or reasonably should know of a conflict .... <em>Festo </em>v. <em>Luckart, </em>supra, 629.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 685-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">\u201cThere are two circumstances under which a trial court has a duty to inquire with respect to a conflict of interest: (1) when there has been a timely conflict objection at trial; <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 488, 98 S. Ct. 1173, 55 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1978); or (2) when the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists .... <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 347, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1980). A trial court\u2019s failure to inquire in such circumstances constitutes the basis for reversal of a defendant\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>viction. <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>supra, 488. In the absence of an affirmative duty by the trial court to inquire, however, a defendant who raised no objection at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance in order to obtain reversal of his conviction. <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 348; <em>Festo </em>v. <em>Luckart, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 626-31.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u201cIn a case of a claimed [actual] conflict of interest ... in order to establish a violation of the sixth amendment the defendant has a two-pronged task. He must establish (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and (2) that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 689. In its recent decision in <em>Mickens </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 535 U.S. 171, 174 the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the general rule that, in order to demonstrate a sixth amendment violation based on the trial court\u2019s failure to inquire into a potential conflict of interest about which it knew or should have known, a defendant must establish that the conflict of interest adversely affected his counsel\u2019s performance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Supreme Court further rejected the habeas petitioner\u2019s claim that the trial judge\u2019s failure to inquire into a potential conflict of interest required automatic reversal of his conviction or relieved him of his burden of demonstrating that the conflict adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim in the present case, we are guided by our previous definition of an attorney\u2019s conflict of interest. \u201cWe have described an attorney\u2019s conflict of interest as that which impedes his paramount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>duty of loyalty to his client. . . . Thus, an attorney may be considered to be laboring under an impaired duty of loyalty, and thereby be subject to conflicting interests, because of interests or factors personal to him that are inconsistent, diverse or otherwise discordant with [the interests] of his client . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 689-90; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 139, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991). Although the weight of federal and Connecticut authority with regard to conflicts of interest focuses on cases where an attorney represents codefendants charged in connection with the same incident, this court concluded in <em>Phillips </em>that the term conflict of interest should be interpreted more broadly.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We are persuaded that, in the present case, the facts presented a potential conflict of interest between the defendant and defense counsel. The evident concern of defense counsel for his own personal safety and his decision to sit apart from the defendant called into question whether he could discharge \u201chis paramount duty of loyalty to his client.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>supra, 246 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Conn. 689. The trial court, therefore, properly perceived the potential for a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, however, the trial court did inquire into the potential conflict between the defendant and defense counsel. As a result of that inquiry, the trial court learned, first, that the defendant and defense counsel could communicate during voir dire and, second, that the defendant wanted defense counsel to continue to represent him, although he also wanted counsel to sit next to him. The trial court further was assured by defense counsel, an experienced criminal defense lawyer, that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d could represent his client adequately. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s inquiry into the potential conflict of interest was sufficient under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Moreover, the defendant made no claim during voir dire or trial that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and he makes no such claim before this court, despite the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent reiteration in <em>Mickens </em>that a defendant must establish that any conflict of interest had a significant adverse affect on his attorney\u2019s p\u00e9rformance. <em>Mickens </em>v. Taylor, supra, 535 U.S. 171, 174. We find it telling that the defendant seeks automatic reversal of his conviction without any assertion that his representation at trial was inadequate. Although the defendant makes no such claim, we note that any claim of deficient performance by his defense counsel is belied by the record in this case, which reveals that the differences between the defendant and his counsel were short-lived, in that they resumed sitting together at counsel table when the presentation of evidence began, and defense counsel advocated zealously for the defendant throughout the trial, even during that period of the voir dire when he allegedly was concerned for his personal safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The defendant further urges this court to exercise its supervisory authority over the administration of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>to require that when a trial court knows or should know that there may be a conflict of interest between the defendant and defense counsel, the trial court must inquire into the conflict, and that when the trial court fails to do so, prejudice is to be presumed such that automatic reversal is required. We decline the defendant\u2019s request because we have concluded that the trial court in the present case adequately inquired into the potential conflict of interest that was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor engaged in harmful prosecutorial misconduct in violation of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (a)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> by commenting on the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify during the trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In response to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim, the state argues that: (1) the jury would not have understood the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment as having invited an adverse inference with respect to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify; and (2) even if this court were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>to determine that the comment was impermissible, it constituted harmless error and is not grounds for reversal. We conclude that, although the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remark was improper, it did not violate the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. During closing argument, defense counsel referred to that portion of Anderson\u2019s testimony in which he made reference to the physical size of the defendant and how Anderson was able to identify the defendant, despite the fact that his assailant wore a mask. Defense counsel questioned the reliability of such an identification because Anderson had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time of the attempted robbery and had claimed that he had been able to identify his masked assailant as the defendant by the feel of his attacker\u2019s arms and chest during their struggle. Counsel further argued that Anderson had testified that he and his assailant were of similar size and build. Defense counsel then commented that there was no evidence presented that the defendant\u2019s appearance had changed since the crime had taken place and that the defendant had a build more like that of defense counsel than that of Anderson.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The state objected to this latter statement on the ground that defense counsel had commented on facts that were not in evidence. Defense counsel responded that he merely was making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>observations and had made permissible comment on the defendant\u2019s appearance. The state then remarked that \u201c[t]he defendant didn\u2019t take the stand . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">After the jury had been excused, defense counsel made an oral motion for a mistrial, arguing, inter alia, that the state\u2019s comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify was prejudicial. The state\u2019s attorney responded that defense counsel\u2019s remarks had gone well beyond mere comment on the defendant\u2019s appearance and as such \u201c[were] clearly within the bounds of objectionable material . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The trial court denied defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and determined that any impropriety could be cured by an appropriate jury instruction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Defense counsel did not request a specific curative instruction that went beyond the court\u2019s proposed general instruction concerning the defendant\u2019s right not to testify.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u201cWe recently have reiterated the legal principles relevant to our review of [a claim of a prosecutor\u2019s improper comment on a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify]. It is well settled that comment by the prosecuting attorney ... on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is prohibited by the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106, reh. denied, 381 U.S. 957, 85 S. Ct. 1797, 14 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1965). . . . Our legislature has given statutory recognition to this right by virtue of its enactment of ... \u00a7 54-84. In determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments have encroached upon a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, we ask: Was the language used manifestly intended to be, or was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify? . . . Further, in applying this test, we must look to the context in which the statement was made in order to determine the manifest intention which prompted it and its natural and necessary impact upon the jury. . . . Finally, [w]e also recognize that the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 570-71, 710 A.2d 1348 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The Appellate Court addressed a similar comment in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>27 Conn. App. 601, 606-607, 605 A.2d 1385 (1992). In an objection addressed to the trial court, the state\u2019s attorney in <em>Cobb </em>remarked on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. The Appellate Court stated that \u201c[although made while the jury was in the courtroom, the comments in the present case were directed to the court, not to the jury. While this fact alone would not excuse an egregious violation of the rule, it is properly taken into consideration as part of the context in which it is made. An indirect comment in argument to the court on a point of law is less serious than a comment in jury summation that asks the jury to infer that the defendant\u2019s silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d Id., 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u201cIn determining the effect of the state\u2019s words on the jury, we may consider the effect they had on defense counsel.\u201d Id., 608-609. Although defense counsel did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>voice an objection to the state\u2019s comment by requesting a mistrial, he did not request a curative instruction, even though the trial court offered to defense counsel the opportunity to make such a request. From defense counsel's silence, we infer that the general instruction offered by the trial court was considered sufficient to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s improper remark was directed to the trial court and not to the jury. The comment was made in the context of argument over an objection, and, although the comment was clearly inappropriate, defense counsel did not specifically request a specific curative instruction. The trial court nevertheless properly instructed the jury that it should not draw any unfavorable inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. See footnote 21 of this opinion. \u201cBarring contrary evidence, we must presume that juries follow the instructions given them by the trial judge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>60 Conn. App. 219, 232, 759 A.2d 518, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 906, 762 A.2d 911 (2000); accord <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 716, 737, 643 A.2d 1226 (1994), on appeal after remand, 38 Conn. App. 546, 662 A.2d 153 (1995). Accordingly, we conclude that, although the prosecutor\u2019s remark was improper, the comment\u2019s \u201cnatural and necessary impact upon the jury\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 571; would not likely have been prejudicial, and there was, therefore, no violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the fifth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when ...

Avcollie, an attorney who had been convicted of the notorious crime of having strangled his wife to death. Avcollie, who was appealing his conviction, had been tried and convicted in the same judicial district where the petitioner\u2019s trial took place. Id. This court stated that \u201c[sjurely, no other attorney in the history of Connecticut or American jurisprudence has ever brought with him to the criminal jury courtroom the potential for prejudice to his client that Avcollie brought to the . . . courtroom .... Under these unique factual circumstances, we are constrained to conclude that there was a constitutionally impermissible risk that the petitioner\u2019s jurors would identify Avcollie\u2019s status as a convicted murderer with his client\u2019s status as an accused rapist, kidnapper and burglar, and that they would transfer to the petitioner the distaste or revulsion that they may have felt for his lawyer.\u201d Id., 141.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 provides: \u201c(a) Any person on trial for crime shall be a competent witness, and at his or her option may testify or refuse to testify upon such trial.
