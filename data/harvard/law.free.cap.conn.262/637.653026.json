Grondin (decedent), appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the trial court\u2019s judgment of nonsuit for failure to establish a prima facie case in a medical malpractice action against the named defendant, Joseph F.J. Curi, a pediatrician.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that an expert need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>be board certified at the time of the alleged malpractice in order to qualify as a \u201c \u2018similar health care provider\u2019 \u201d pursuant to \u00a7 52-184c (c) and (d), and that the trial court\u2019s preclusion of the plaintiffs expert witness on the standard of care, resulting in the judgment of non-suit, was improper. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history as undisputed and relevant to the disposition of this appeal. The decedent was bom on April 7, 1984. The defendant, a board certified pediatrician, was her primary treating physician from 1984 until 1995. The decedent was plagued by respiratory problems throughout her life. In 1984, the defendant treated her for respiratory ailments including colds, choking and bronchitis. The defendant admitted the decedent to Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in September, 1987, with a diagnosis of \u201c \u2018acute asthmatic bronchitis,\u2019 \u201d and took a chest X ray of her at that time. She was admitted again to Charlotte Hungerford Hospital on January 10, 1989, with a diagnosis of \u201c \u2018bronchopneumonia.\u2019 \u201d A chest X ray was taken of her on January 10, 1989. In April, 1990, she was treated at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital for an upper respiratory infection. The decedent was relatively symptom-free in 1991, but she was seen by the defendant on April 29,1992, for what the defendant described as \u201c \u2018a lot of problems, including not wanting to go to school and trying to gag herself.\u2019 \u201d She was treated again at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital on June 2, 1993, for respiratory symptoms, specifically lengthy intermittent coughing.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">On November 16, 1995, the decedent was admitted to Charlotte Hungerford Hospital with complaints of persistent cough, fever and emesis of blood-tinged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>raucous. A chest X ray was taken at that time. It was the first chest X ray taken of her since 1989. On November 17, 1995, a CAT scan indicated a large tumor in the decedent\u2019s lungs and, thereafter, she was transferred to the University of Connecticut Medical Center (UConn) for treatment. At UConn, an examination revealed that the tumor was in the third stage of cancer, which specifically was diagnosed as B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. She received chemotherapy for her cancer, but died on March 17, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The plaintiff initially brought this action against the defendant in October, 1997. In her complaint, she alleged that the defendant had breached the prevailing standard of care by failing to diagnose the decedent\u2019s lung cancer from June 2, 1993, through November 16, 1995, and by failing to monitor properly her respiratory problems by not ordering chest X rays between January 10, 1989, and November 16, 1995. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant had failed to undertake an extensive differential diagnosis that was warranted by the decedent\u2019s respiratory signs and symptoms. She alleged further that the defendant should have realized that additional specialist consultations and referrals were warranted between June 3, 1993, and November 15, 1995. The plaintiff claimed that these alleged breaches of the standard of care deprived the decedent of the chance to have her cancer diagnosed and properly treated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">During discovery, the plaintiff disclosed Marc J. Grella, a board certified<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pediatrician who practices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>primarily in the Boston area, as an expert expected to testify at trial. The defendant deposed Grella on August 10, 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following the completion of discovery, the matter was tried to a jury before <em>Agati, </em>J., commencing on September 11, 2001.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The plaintiff called Grella as her first and only witness. Grella testified on direct examination that he is a physician with a specialty in general pediatrics, practicing at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He attended New York Medical College, and graduated in 1993. After graduating from medical school, he completed a three year pediatric residency at the Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. During his residency, he received training in general pediatrics and the associated subspecialties of, among others, cardiology, hematology, allergy and pulmonology. He completed his residency in June, 1996, and, thereafter, returned to Boston to practice. Grella testified that he is a member of the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Massachusetts Medical Society, the National Organization of the American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Academy of Pediatrics and Alpha Omega Alpha, a general national medical academic honor society. He also testified that he has written several articles for medical academic journals. After presenting his credentials, Grella then testified that he was familiar with the general standard of care for the practice of pediatrics in the United States, and had formed an opinion as to whether the defendant deviated from that standard of care in the present case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Grella then testified about the information contained in the decedent\u2019s death certificate, and the treatments and diagnoses indicated in the defendant\u2019s notes regarding the decedent\u2019s office visits. He discussed the significance of the pneumonia discovered as a result of the decedent\u2019s January 10, 1989 chest X ray. The plaintiffs counsel then asked Grella: \u201c[H]ow soon after January 10, 1989 would proper care require another chest x-ray?\u201d Defense counsel objected to this line of questioning, contending that Grella was not competent to discuss the standard of care for a time when he was not a board certified physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Thereafter, outside the jury\u2019s presence, the plaintiff then conducted a preliminary examination into Grella\u2019s knowledge of the standard of care applicable in 1989. Grella described his knowledge of chest X rays, stating that he knew that the procedure\u2019s use predated his medical career, but, that he was not sure by how long. He stated that he had learned, however, while in his first year of medical school, that proper monitoring of a child with symptoms of respiratory distress requires the use of chest X rays.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Following the defendant\u2019s continued objections to the plaintiffs inquiry regarding the 1989 X rays, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>plaintiff turned the questioning to the 1993 X rays. The defendant objected again, maintaining that the timing change did not alter the basis of his prior objection to Grella\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The jury then returned to the courtroom. Grella opined that any patient with pneumonia serious enough to require hospitalization should receive a follow-up X ray \u201cto document its resolution.\u201d Grella then noted that his review of the decedent\u2019s records from January 10, 1989, to November, 1995, revealed no request by the defendant for a chest X ray during that time period. Grella also stated that he had reviewed the rest of the defendant\u2019s records for the decedent\u2019s medical history from the remainder of 1989 through June, 1993. Grella noted treatment for bronchitis and fever in June, 1993.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Discussion then ensued among counsel and the trial court about the relationship between the applicable standards of care in 1993 and 2001. It was at this point that the objection to Grella\u2019s qualifications, based upon \u00a7 52-184c, resurfaced. The plaintiffs counsel then asked Grella whether he was aware of the standard of care for pediatricians in 1993, a line of questioning to which he gave inconclusive answers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Following this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>exchange, the plaintiffs counsel shifted the line of ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tioning to the 1995 records. At this point, defense counsel renewed his objection to Grella\u2019s qualifications. The trial court then excused the jury and heard legal arguments on Grella\u2019s qualifications under \u00a7 52-184c to discuss the standard of care in 1995, and at any other point before he became board certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The trial court initially ruled that Grella was not a qualified pediatrician under the \u201c \u2018similar health care provider provision\u2019 \u201d of \u00a7 52-184c (b) because he had not practiced or taught for five years prior to the incident giving rise to the plaintiffs claim. Following additional testimony outside the presence of the jury, the trial court suspended the trial and granted the plaintiff permission to file an interlocutory appeal of its ruling. After a conference in chambers with counsel, the court granted the plaintiffs subsequent motion for reconsideration of its original ruling, noting that under subsection (c) of \u00a7 52-184c, which applies to specialists, no time restrictions are prescribed. The trial corut then directed the parties to brief the issue of whether Grella was a \u201c \u2018similar health care provider\u2019 \u201d and return for argument the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The following day, the defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude Grella from testifying about the standard of care. Following the submission of briefs and oral argument, the trial court ruled that \u00a7 52-184c (c) was the applicable subsection for a specialist expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>like Grella. The court noted the absence of applicable case law to clarify the issue of whether a specialist must be board certified at the time of the alleged malpractice, but it observed that the applicable standard of care under the statute was \u201cthe standard prevailing at the time of the treatment in question.\u201d Ultimately, the trial court ruled: \u201c[F]or a similar health care provider to testify on the standard of care at the time of the treatment in question, that similar health care provider must have been board certified during the time period as indicated in subsection (c) of [\u00a7] 52-184c. [Grella] was not board certified at that time, therefore, on the issue of the motion to reconsider my ruling regarding the sustaining of the objection to [Grella\u2019s] testimony on the standard of care, the court reaffirms its previous ruling and sustains the objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The court then granted the defendant\u2019s motion in limine and precluded Grella from testifying. After the trial court granted the motion in limine, the plaintiff rested her case. The defendant subsequently moved for, and the court granted, a judgment of nonsuit pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-210<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> due to the plaintiffs failure to establish a prima facie case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>followed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court improperly construed subsections (c) and (d) of \u00a7 52-184c as requiring, in a medical malpractice action against a board certified physician, an expert witness to be board certified at the time the alleged malpractice occurred in order to qualify as a \u201c \u2018similar health care provider.\u2019 \u201d The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s construction was proper because in light of the statutory scheme as a whole, as well as the practical necessity that an expert be aware of the standard of care prevailing at the time of the alleged malpractice, an expert must be board certified at that time. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">We first set out the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe trial court [generally] has wide discretion in ruling on the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their opinions. . . . The court\u2019s decision is not to be disturbed unless [its] discretion has been abused, or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 550, 757 A.2d 482 (2000). In the present case, however, the dispositive issue is the trial court\u2019s construction of a statute, namely, \u00a7 52-184c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Joshua S., </em>260 Conn. 182, 213, 796 A.2d 1141 (2002). Accordingly, we exercise plenary review over the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">\u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Turning to the merits of this appeal, we begin by parsing the relevant language of \u00a7 52-184c as it applies in the context of a medical malpractice action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 52-184c sets forth four distinct, yet closely intertwined, subsections.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 52-184c (a) requires the plaintiff to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant breached the \u201cprevailing professional standard of care for that health care provider. ...\u201d That subsection then defines the \u201cprevailing professional standard of care for a given health care provider [as] that level of care, skill and treatment which, in light of all relevant surrounding circumstances, is recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent <em>similar health care providers.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (a). For specialists, including physicians who are board certified like the defendant in this case, subsection (c) of \u00a7 52-184c defines \u201c \u2018similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>health care provider\u2019 \u201d as \u201cone who: (1) Is trained and experienced in the same specialty; and (2) is certified by the appropriate American board in the same specialty . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Finally, subsection (d) of \u00a7 52-184c prescribes qualifications for expert witnesses in negligence actions against health care providers. Under that subsection, there are two ways for an expert to qualify to testify in an action against a specialist. The proposed expert may testify against a specialist if he or she is \u201ca \u2018similar health care provider\u2019 pursuant to subsection . . . (c) . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (d). Alternatively, if the expert does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (c), he still may testify if he, \u201cto the satisfaction of the court, possesses sufficient training, experience and knowledge as a result of practice or teaching in a related field of medicine, so as to be able to provide such expert testimony as to the prevailing professional standard of care in a given field of medicine. Such training, experience or knowledge shall be as a result of the active involvement in the practice or teaching of medicine within the five-year period before the incident giving rise to the claim.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (d). In the present case, it is undisputed that Grella had not taught or practiced medicine within five years before the claim of malpractice arose. To qualify as an expert in this case, he must, therefore, be a \u201c \u2018similar health care provider\u2019 \u201d under the board certification provision of subsection (c) of \u00a7 52-184c. Accordingly, we now turn to the question of whether subsection (c) of \u00a7 52-184c requires the expert to be board certified at the time of the alleged malpractice in order to qualify as a \u201c \u2018similar health care provider.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In contrast to subsections (b) and (d) (2) of \u00a7 52-184c, subsection (c) is silent as to any element of time. It requires only board certification and training and experience in the same specialty. In determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>import of this omission, we rely upon well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cWe construe a statute as a whole and read its subsections concurrently in order to reach a reasonable overall inteipretation.\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 116, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991). Moreover, \u201ca court must construe a statute as it finds it, without reference to whether it thinks the statute would have been or could be improved by the inclusion of other provisions.\u201d <em>Battersby </em>v. <em>Battersby, </em>218 Conn. 467, 471, 590 A.2d 427 (1991). Inasmuch as the legislature prescribed explicit time constraints in the text of subsections (b) and (d) (2) of \u00a7 52-184c, but not subsection (c), our application of these principles leads us to conclude that the legislature did not intend for the testimony of a board certified expert physician to be subject to any time-based limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">We note that, although the legislative history is silent about the legislature\u2019s intent as to this specific issue, our construction of \u00a7 52-184c is consistent with the general purpose behind the statute\u2019s enactment. Section 52-184c was enacted by Public Acts 1986, No. 86-338, \u00a7 11, which is popularly known as Tort Reform I. It was not intended to alter dramatically the scope of what constitutes the standard of care in a medical malpractice case or who qualifies to testify about that standard.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>According to Senator Richard Johnston, then chairman of the judiciary committee when the legislature enacted Public Act 86-338, \u00a7 52-184c \u201ccodif[ies] the standard of care as it has been developed through common law and [Connecticut] case law . . . .\u201d 29 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1986 Sess., pp. 3479-80 (explaining statutory phrase \u201cin light of all relevant surrounding circumstances\u201d). In explaining the bill, Representative William Wollenberg stated that \u201cwhat they are trying to set out here is that the witnesses shall be of similar training in similar specialties and so on so that you have . . . witnesses who have . . . similar qualifications of that person who is accused.\u201d 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1986 Sess., pp. 5739-40. Our review of the sparse legislative history leads us to conclude that the legislature did not intend \u00a7 52-184c to impose drastic changes on the existing standards of care or the process of qualifying experts in medical malpractice cases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See footnotes 16 and 17 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>We note that our conclusion is consistent with our sister states\u2019 approach to this issue. In the absence of a statute expressly requiring a physician to be certified at the time of the alleged malpractice, courts considering this issue uniformly have determined that an expert is not required to be board certified, or even to be a physician, at the time of the occurrence giving rise to the claim. See <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Lipman, </em>197 Ga. App. 631, 632, 399 S.E.2d 255 (1990) (\u201ctrial court erred in excluding [the proffered expert\u2019s] testimony based solely on the ground that he was not a physician at the time of the alleged malpractice\u201d); <em>Summit Bank </em>v. <em>Panos, </em>570 N.E.2d 960, 965 (Ind. App. 1991) (allowing physician to testify as expert as to 1983 standard of care for family practice, despite fact that she did not begin family practice residency until 1984, and was not board certified until 1987); <em>McGulpin </em>v. <em>Bessmer, </em>241 Iowa 1119, 1131, 43 N.W.2d 121 (1950) (holding that where proffered expert otherwise was competent to testify, \u201c[h]e should not have been held incompetent merely . . . because he was still a medical student [at the time of the alleged malpractice]\u201d); <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Detroit Receiving Hospital, </em>249 Mich. App. 212, 218, 642 N.W.2d 346 (2002) (stating that statutory requirement that expert must \u201c \u2018specialize ... at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action\u2019 in the same specialty as [the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered]\u201d is consistent with statute\u2019s preclusion of testimony based \u201c \u2018solely on the basis of the witness\u2019 lack of practice or teaching experience in the relevant specialty\u2019 \u201d); see also <em>Durkee </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>714 P.2d 1330, 1332 (Colo. App. 1986) (stating that \u201c[t]he extent of [the proffered expert\u2019s] knowledge of community standards, whether acquired during his short period of practice . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>[before the incident] or learned at a later time, would affect the weight rather than the admissibility of his testimony\u201d); <em>Endorf v. Bohlender, </em>26 Kan. App. 2d 855, 857, 995 P.2d 896 (2000) (discussing statutory requirement that expert witness devote \u201c \u2018at least 50 [percent] of such person\u2019s professional time within the two-year period <em>preceding </em>the incident giving rise to the action ... to actual clinical practice in the same profession in which the defendant is licensed\u2019 \u201d [emphasis added]); cf. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Muniz, </em>125 App. Div. 2d 281, 284, 508 N.Y.S.2d 567 (1986) (noting that former police officer could testify as expert in case involving allegations of police officer negligence; fact that he \u201chad left the police department prior to the time the accident occurred affects only the weight, not the admissibility, of his testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The defendant contends that, in order to testify properly as to the prevailing standard of care, \u201cthe expert must be . . . someone who was in a position to know the [proper] standard of care\u201d and, therefore, it naturally follows, the defendant suggests, that a \u201cproffered expert who was not board certified at the time of the alleged malpractice cannot reasonably be deemed a \u2018similar health care provider\u2019 to the defendant . . . who was so certified.\u201d The defendant also relies on our decision in <em>Fitzmaurice </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>167 Conn. 609, 617, 356 A.2d 887 (1975), as support for his claim that, before the enactment of \u00a7 52-184c, the \u201ccrucial question\u201d was \u201cwhether the expert knows what the standards of practice are.\u201d Finally, to illustrate the \u201cabsurdity]\u201d of the plaintiffs interpretation, the defendant poses the hypothetical situation of a board certified expert who was still in high school at the time an alleged act of malpractice occurred. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">By its language, the statute does not require board certified experts to have gained their knowledge by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>particular method, such as from practice or experience, nor at any particular time. Moreover, the minimum standards set forth in \u00a7 52-184c have done nothing to abrogate the fundamental requirement, which was explicated in the \u201ccrucial question\u201d of <em>Fitzmaurice, </em>that an expert testifying about the standard of care must know what that standard is in a particular situation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Fitzmaurice </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>supra, 167 Conn. 617. Medical expert witnesses have long been permitted to acquire their knowledge of the applicable standard of care via study as well as by experience. See, e.g., <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>209 Conn. 536, 542, 551 A.2d 1254 (1989); <em>Fitzmaurice </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>supra, 618. We note that, under the defendant\u2019s proposed construction of \u00a7 52-184c, a hypothetical young physician who is, via study, and perhaps even a dissertation, the foremost expert in the development of a particular field of medicine, would be precluded from testifying. We deem that situation an absurd result, which we presume that the legislature did not intend; see, e.g., <em>Great Country Bank </em>v. <em>Pastore, </em>241 Conn. 423, 432, 696 A.2d 1254 (1997); that a physician is not board certified at a particular time does not, per se, foreclose that physician from having acquired ample knowledge of the applicable standard of care at that juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">We also emphasize that the requirements under \u00a7 52-184c (d) do not affect the trial court\u2019s discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>determine whether a proffered expert is qualified to testify as an expert. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 and 7-2; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>65 Conn. App. 738, 756-58, 783 A.2d 1085, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 938, 786 A.2d 425 (2001); <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Petrilli, </em>34 Conn. App. 871, 875-76, 644 A.2d 381 (1994); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 550. Indeed, \u00a7 52-184c merely sets out minimum qualification standards for experts in medical malpractice cases. Thus, a trial court that permits a physician to testify as an expert without first determining whether he or she has a sufficient basis for knowing the \u201cprevailing\u201d standard of care is abdicating its evidentiary gatekeeping responsibilities.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 52-184c (d) does not, as a matter of law, preclude a board certified physician, otherwise knowledgeable as to the applicable standard of care, from testifying as an expert \u201c \u2018similar health care provider,\u2019 \u201d solely because the physician was not board certified at the time of the alleged malpractice.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We,</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>therefore, conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling to the contrary was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The defendant urges us to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment on the alternate ground that the plaintiff offered no admissible evidence of causation. He claims that Grella was not disclosed as an expert on the subject of causation and that Grella stated at his deposition both that \u201che does not \u2018pretend to be an expert on lymphoma\u2019 \u201d and that he has no opinions on the progress of the decedent\u2019s disease. The defendant also concedes, however, that Grella presented an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury on causation. We decline to address the merits of these contentions because the trial court record is insufficient to allow for adequate review of this alternate ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">We note that the argument in the trial court centered on Grella\u2019s qualifications to testify as to the standard of care, and that the court\u2019s ruling granting the defendant\u2019s motion in limine never actually reached the issue of whether he was qualified on causation. \u201c[W]e . . . may [only] affirm the court\u2019s judgment on a dispositive alternate ground for which there is support in the trial court record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>259 Conn. 592, 599, 790 A.2d 1178 (2002). Furthermore, we view the issue of Grella\u2019s competence as a causation expert as necessarily tied to the \u00a7 52-184c issue considered in part I of this opinion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018If the alternate issue was not ruled on by the trial court, the issue must be one that the trial court would have been forced to rule in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>appellee.

The trial court either accepted those representations or inferred Grella\u2019s board certification, as of 1996, from his testimony. Accordingly, for purposes of this opinion, we will assume that Grella was board certified at the time of trial; indeed, as in the trial court, the key factual proposition governing the issue before us is that Grella was <em>not </em>board certified <em>at the time of the alleged malpractice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b666-12\"> The defendant contends that Grella was disclosed as an expert solely on the standard of care issue.

That distinction existed in the common law through reference to physicians \u2018in the same line of practice.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">\u201cSubsection (d) of section 11 carries over the definitions of \u2018similar health care provider\u2019 to the qualification of medical expert witnesses. To testify as an expert, the health care provider must qualify as a \u2018similar health care provider\u2019 under subsection (b) or (c), or, if he is not a similar health care provider, must satisfy the court under subsection (d) that he has sufficient training, practice, and knowledge including practice or teaching with the five-year period to qualify. <em>... As a practical matter, because subsection (d) gives the court discretion to qualify any knowledgeable person as an expert, it seems likely that the court will continue to qualify the same witnesses as experts under the Act as under prior law. </em>The underlying test, a demonstrated knowledge of the applicable standard based on \u2018sufficient training experience, experience, and knowledge,\u2019 is essentially the same under the Act as under prior law.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Report of the Law Revision Commission to the Judiciary Committee, Comparing Public Act 86-338, An Act Concerning Tort Reform and Prior Connecticut Law (1987) pp. 26-27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\"> As this court stated in <em>Fitzmaurice </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>supra, 167 Conn. 618: \u201cRecognizing the complexity of knowledge required in the various medical specialties, more than a casual familiarity with the specialty of the defendant physician is required. The witness must demonstrate a knowledge acquired from experience or study of the standards of the specialty of the defendant physician sufficient to enable him to give an expert opinion as to the conformity of the defendant\u2019s conduct to those particular standards, and not to the standards of the witness\u2019 particular specialty if it differs from that of the defendant. It is the scope of the witness\u2019 knowledge and not the artificial classification by title that should govern the threshold question of admissibility-\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> This is illustrated by the following hypothetical. At trial, the plaintiff proffered, pursuant to \u00a7 52-184c, a board certified physician who held such certification at the time of the occurrence giving rise to the claim. If that physician testifies at trial that he or she is not familiar with or does not recall the standard of care applicable to the date in question, it certainly would be an abuse of discretion to allow that physician to submit expert standard of care testimony, despite that physician\u2019s having met the minimal statutory qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">This hypothetical is not implausible. The proper standard of care in any given medical situation may be constantly evolving because of scientific developments. It is certainly possible that in order to testify accurately and competently about the standard of care applicable several years before the trial, an expert might need to supplement his or her own memory and knowledge with additional research. See, e.g., W. Tsushima <em>&amp; </em>K. Nakano, Effective Medical Testifying: A Handbook for Physicians (1998) pp. 16-17,26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b681-9\"> We are obliged to emphasize that our decision in this case affects only the <em>admissibility </em>of an expert\u2019s testimony under \u00a7 52-184c.
