The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Appellate Court correctly concluded that it was procedurally improper for the trial court to consider and decide what the defendant termed an \u201coral motion for summary judgment\u201d because of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements for a motion for summary judgment as set forth by the rules of practice. We conclude that the plaintiff, Joseph R. Krevis,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> waived his right to compel compliance with the rules of practice, and, therefore, that the trial court properly considered the question of law submitted by the parties. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cThe plaintiff, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>former employee of the defendant, brought two separate actions against the defendant. In one complaint, the first count alleged invasion of privacy in connection with the alleged disclosure of medical and personnel file data to agents of the Internal Revenue Service. The second and third counts alleged intentional, wanton or reckless conduct on the part of the defendant in disclosing the same data. The fourth count alleged negligence. The fifth count alleged negligent infliction of emotional distress as a result of the disclosure. The court later consolidated that five count complaint with a second complaint [filed by the plaintiff] alleging disclosure of medical and personnel information to Total Employee Case, Inc., a corporation charged by the defendant with administering certain medical claims, and to a witness for the defendant who testified about the records in a hearing before the workers\u2019 compensation commission in which the plaintiff sought heart and hypertension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">\u201cOn the day jury selection was to commence, the court heard a motion in limine submitted by the defendant to prevent references to punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees during the trial. In the motion, the defendant discussed the nature of the governmental immunity of municipalities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court granted the motion in limine, barring [any] reference to punitive damages or attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">\u201cImmediately thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff questioned the nature of the ruling, stating that \u2018my impression is [that the court is] making a ruling based upon the governmental immunity statute.\u2019 The court replied that \u2018[the governmental immunity statute] applies\u2014if you want me to expand that to the cause of action, I can very easily do that.\u2019 Counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>plaintiff responded, \u2018I\u2019m not exactly sure how I should take that,\u2019 to which the court replied, \u2018[y]ou better take it very carefully, counselor . . . because if I do go into it, it may jeopardize this entire action.\u2019 Counsel for the plaintiff then asked for a recess to confer with his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">\u201cAfter the recess, counsel for the plaintiff stated, T will say for the record that I certainly do not want to go through the effort of a three, four, possibly five day trial only, at the end of the day, to have my case dismissed. If the court at this point is prepared to make a ruling on the applicability of the governmental immunity statute as to the claims in this case, we will accept the judgment of the court and take appropriate action.\u2019 The court acknowledged the irregularity of a summary judgment ruling under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">\u201cCounsel for the defendant interjected that \u2018an oral motion for summaiy judgment\u2019 might be an appropriate way to resolve questions on the application of governmental immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court, after further discussion with counsel for the plaintiff over whether defense counsel had exceeded the scope of the motion in limine in his discussion of applicable law, found governmental immunity applicable to all counts and dismissed the actions. The plaintiff appealed from the judgments.\u201d <em>Krevis </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>64 Conn. App. 176, 177-79, 779 A.2d 838 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">During oral argument in the Appellate Court, members of the court raised a question regarding the propriety of the trial court granting an oral motion for summary judgment. Id., 179. The parties thereafter filed supplemental briefs addressing whether an oral motion for summary judgment was proper. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">The Appellate Court reversed the judgments of the trial court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> concluding that the trial court was without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>authority to render summary judgment because the motion was not in writing and was not accompanied by a memorandum and supporting documents, as required by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 11-1,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 11-10,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 17-44<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 17-45.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 183. We thereafter granted the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that it was procedurally improper for the trial court to have rendered summary judgment?\u201d <em>Krevis </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>258 Conn. 939, 786 A.2d 426 (2001). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly ruled that the trial court lacked the authority to decide the question of law submitted by the parties because of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the Practice Book provisions. The defendant further contends that the trial court acted properly because the plaintiff waived the procedural requirements of the rules of practice relating to motions for summary judgment. We agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The certified issue implicates the case management authority of the trial court in that it requires us to determine whether a trial court has the authority, as a trial is about to begin, to decide a dispositive question of law that the parties to the case submit to the court orally, without a written motion or compliance with certain applicable provisions of the Practice Book. We begin by setting forth the standard of review that will govern our analysis of this issue. \u201cWe review case management decisions for abuse of discretion, giving [trial] courts wide latitude. ... A party adversely affected by a [trial] court\u2019s case management decision thus bears a formidable burden in seeking reversal.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Santiago-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number><em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., </em>217 F.3d 46, 58 (1st Cir. 2000). A trial court has the authority to manage cases before it as is necessary. See <em>In re Mongillo, </em>190 Conn. 686, 690-91, 461 A.2d 1387 (1983), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>250 Conn. 147, 155, 735 A.2d 333 (1999). Deference is afforded to the trial court in making case management decisions because it is in a much better position to determine the effect that a particular procedure will have on both parties. <em>Reed v. Philadelphia, Bethlehem &amp; New England R.R. Co., </em>939 F.2d 128, 133 (3d Cir. 1991). The case management authority is an inherent power necessarily vested in trial courts to manage their own affairs in order to achieve the expeditious disposition of cases. <em>In re Mongillo, </em>supra, 690-91. The ability of trial judges to manage cases is essential to judicial economy and justice. Id., 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s decision regarding case management unless after carefully examining the factual circumstances of the case, we determine that there was an abuse of discretion. See <em>Elgabri </em>v. <em>Lekas, </em>964 F.2d 1255, 1260 (1st Cir. 1992). Abuse is not present if discretion \u201cis not exercised arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law, and [it is] directed by the reason and conscience of the judge to a just result. . . . And [sound discretion] requires a knowledge and understanding of the material circumstances surrounding the matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>195 Conn. 1, 8, 485 A.2d 570 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">We must decide, therefore, whether the trial court abused its discretion when it decided, under the circumstances of this case, to resolve the issue of whether governmental immunity barred the plaintiffs claims. The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this question. The defendant\u2019s motion in limine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>asked that the plaintiff be precluded from making any reference to punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees during jury selection and trial. The basis for the motion was that the defendant, as a municipality, could not be held hable for punitive damages or attorney\u2019s fees. During oral argument on the motion, the defendant also argued that the plaintiffs claims were barred by General Statutes \u00a7 7-465, the governmental immunity statute. The plaintiff objected to the motion, in part on the basis that the defendant was attacking his cause of action on the legal ground of governmental immunity, rather than raising an evidentiary issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">After hearing argument from both parties, the trial court granted the motion in limine, and ordered that neither party refer to the claims for punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court confirmed the understanding of the plaintiffs counsel that the court\u2019s ruling was based in part on the governmental immunity statute, but emphasized that it was not ruling at that time as to the substantive validity of the plaintiffs causes of action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court did express a willingness, however, to expand its ruling concerning the governmental immunity statute to the plaintiffs causes of action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiffs counsel then requested and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>granted a recess in order to consult with his client and determine whether to ask the court to rule on the causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">When court reconvened, the plaintiffs counsel requested that the court rule on the issue of law before it, that is, whether the plaintiffs causes of action were barred by \u00a7 7-465. The plaintiffs counsel expressly stated that he wanted a ruling on the governmental immunity issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s counsel then suggested that the oral presentation by the plaintiffs counsel to the court regarding this question of law should be termed an \u201coral motion for summary judgment,\u201d stating that a motion for a directed verdict and a motion for summary judgment were \u201cbasically the same . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs counsel did not object to these statements, but engaged in a colloquy with the court that demonstrated his familiarity with the applicable rules of practice concerning motions to strike and motions for summary judgment. At the end of the colloquy, the plaintiffs counsel, reasserted his request for a ruling on the dispositive issue of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>rendered judgment for the defendant in the actions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>citing \u00a7 7-465 and referring to his decision as \u201cthe invited decision in disposing of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">This court previously has recognized a party\u2019s ability to waive rights authorized by the provisions of the Practice Book. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 390, 645 A.2d 535 (1994) (holding that criminal defendant can waive right to have judge present during voir dire as required by Practice Book \u00a7 848, now \u00a7 42-12), on appeal after remand, 236 Conn. 561, 674 A.2d 416 (1996); <em>State v. Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 125-33, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986) (holding that criminal defendant can waive right to be present in court during jury charge in contravention of Practice Book \u00a7 968, now \u00a7 44-8).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">\u201cTo determine the presence of waiver, there must be evidence of intelligent and intentional action by the petitioner of the right claimed to be waived.\u201d <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 418, 430, 439 A.2d 430 (1981). It must be shown that the party understood its rights and voluntarily relinquished them anyway. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>445 F. Sup. 1383, 1390 (D. Conn. 1978). Each case should be considered upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience and conduct of the party that is waiving its rights. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Duty, </em>447 F.2d 449, 450 (2d Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">In the present case, the colloquy between the plaintiffs counsel and the court reveals that the plaintiffs counsel was well aware of the procedural requirements for a motion for summary judgment. Nevertheless, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>having conferred with his client, the plaintiffs counsel asked the court to rule immediately on the question of law in order to avoid presenting evidence for several days, after which the court might grant a motion for a directed verdict. We are satisfied on this record that the plaintiffs counsel knowingly waived compliance with the procedural provisions of the Practice Book relating to motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">We conclude that, given this waiver by the plaintiffs counsel, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to resolve the question of law submitted to it by the parties. Deciding the question at that time, rather than awaiting the inevitable motion for a directed verdict after the presentation of evidence for several days, preserved scarce judicial resources without infringing on the rights of either party. See <em>In re Mongillo, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 690-93. Although another trial judge reasonably might have refused to decide the governmental immunity issue because of the defendant\u2019s failure to follow the procedures detailed in the rules of practice, we cannot say that this trial judge abused his discretion in proceeding as he did, when all of the concerned parties desired an expeditious ruling in order to avoid the possibly futile presentation of the plaintiffs case. The rules of practice are designed to be liberally construed \u201cto facilitate business and advance justice\u201d; they are not to be strictly construed when strict construction will result in pointless delay. Practice Book \u00a7 1-8. We will not lightly disturb the trial court\u2019s decision for, after all, the trial court was in the best position to know its intentions with regard to the motion for a directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>verdict that was bound to be presented at the close of the plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for a determination of the merits of the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-11\"> The plaintiffs wife, Jean M. Krevis, originally was a plaintiff in this action, but her claims against the defendant were withdrawn before trial. Accordingly, references herein to the plaintiff are to Joseph R.

Now, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person in this courtroom who doesn\u2019t know and in Connecticut if you make a motion to strike, if you don\u2019t bring a motion to strike when you file your answer you\u2019re precluded from doing it after. Then you can bring a motion for summary judgment, and if you do that you\u2019ve got to get the court\u2019s permission after the case has been claimed for trial. That\u2019s the Practice Book.

Now, if your claim is that they have impermissibly filed a motion for summary judgment in the guise of a motion in limine, well, that\u2014what difference does it make\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b846-19\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Judge\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">\u201cThe Court:-\u2014if we get to the same result?</p>\n<p id=\"b846-21\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Yeah, that\u2019s the effect of your ruling.

What I\u2019m saying at this stage if the court is satisfied, which it appears to be, that that portion of the statute or that that statute attaches to this case, then on the record before it, you\u2019ve got the pleadings, I think it\u2019s incredibly unfair for us to go through a three, four day trial, judge, only at the end of the day based upon the pleadings . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\"> At oral argument in this court, the plaintiffs counsel nominally argued for affirmance of the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment, which rested on procedural grounds. When questioned, however, he frankly admitted that he would prefer a ruling on the merits of the issues that were presented to the Appellate Court on appeal, and that he had sought such a ruling on the merits in the Appellate Court also, without contesting the procedural posture of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
