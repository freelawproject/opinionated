The present case, however, requires us to decide that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Thus, the sole issue of this appeal is whether, when the defendant has been convicted of a capital felony for the murder of two persons in the course of a single transaction, in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (8), the state, in order to establish the aggravating factor defined by \u00a7 53a-46 (i) (4), must prove that the defendant murdered both victims in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that proof that the defendant committed at least one of the murders in the specified aggravated manner is sufficient. Accordingly, we reverse the ruling of the trial court to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The state charged the defendant with capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (8) by murdering two persons, namely, Demetris Rodgers and Antonia Rodgers, in the course of a single transaction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>a jury trial on the guilt phase, and elected to be tried by a three judge court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>West, Cofield </em>and <em>D\u2019Addabbo, Js., </em>found the defendant guilty. The defendant then moved to dismiss the aggravating factor and for the court to impose a life sentence without the possibility of release, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to justify holding a penalty hearing. The trial court, <em>D\u2019Addabbo, J., </em>denied the motion to dismiss, concluding that the defendant was not entitled to a prehearing determination by the court on the sufficiency of the evidence. In the course of its decision, however, the court also ruled that, as a matter of law, the state, in order to prove the noticed aggravating factor, would be required to prove at the penalty hearing that, as to the conviction of capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (8), both murders were committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner. This interlocutory appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">For purposes of this appeal only, the following facts may be considered as undisputed. In the late evening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>hours of December 15, 1998, the defendant stabbed Demetris Rodgers to death. At the time she was stabbed, she was pregnant with Antonia Rodgers. Although Demetris Rodgers was dead on arrival at the hospital, the physicians at the hospital performed an emergency cesarean section and delivered Antonia Rodgers, who lived for forty-two days before dying from global anoxic encephalopathy, or deprivation of oxygen to the brain.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The state claims that, when a defendant has been convicted of capital felony for the murder of two persons in the course of a single transaction, the state, in order to prove the aggravating factor that the defendant committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner, need only do so with respect to one of the murder victims. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">This claim presents a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Id.; <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>sioner of Revenue </em>Services, 231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755-56, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992). . . . <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 431-32, 692 A.2d 742 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>258 Conn. 733, 741, 785 A.2d 197 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We have interpreted the aggravating factor involved to mean that \u201cthe defendant engaged in intentional conduct that inflicted extreme physical or psychological pain [suffering] or torture on the victim above and beyond that necessarily accompanying the underlying killing, <em>and </em>that the defendant specifically intended to inflict such extreme pain [suffering or] torture ... or . . . the defendant was callous or indifferent to the extreme physical or psychological pain, suffering or torture that his intentional conduct in fact inflicted on the victim.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>253 Conn. 1, 66-67, 751 A.2d 298 (2002). We conclude that, under our death penalty statutory scheme, if the defendant\u2019s mental state and conduct meet these requirements with respect to one of his victims, the aggravating factor is satisfied. Put another way, it is not necessary under that statutory scheme that the defendant in the present case intentionally, or callously or indifferently, inflicted extreme pain, suffering or torture on both of his victims, so long as he is shown to have done so with respect to one of his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statutes presently at issue, namely, \u00a7\u00a7 53a-46a (f) (2) and (i) (4) and 53a-54b (8). Both parties rely on what each claims to be the plain language of certain of these statutes to support their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The state points to the language of \u00a7 53a-46a (f) (2), namely, that if <em>\u201cone </em>or more of the aggravating factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>set forth in subsection (i) exist\u201d; (emphasis added); the death penalty may be imposed, provided, of course, that the other requirements of the statute are met.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the state contends, \u201cthe torture of one victim of a capital felony satisfies the plain language of \u00a7 53a-46a (f) (2), which demands proof of but one aggravating factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendant contends, to the contrary, that the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) and 53a-54b (8) compels the conclusion that both murders must be committed in the manner proscribed by the aggravating factor in order for the factor to be established. The defendant points to the language of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4): \u201c[T]he defendant committed <em>the offense </em>in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) He then points to the language of \u00a7 53a-54b (8) defining the relevant capital felony as the <em>\u201cmurder of two or more persons </em>at the same time or in the course of a single transaction . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the defendant argues, \u201cthe essential gravamen of the offense set forth at \u00a7 53a-54b (8) that must be \u2018especially heinous\u2019 is the \u2018murder of two or more persons,\u2019 not the murder of one person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We acknowledge that, if we were to apply the applicable language literally, as a purely linguistic matter the defendant\u2019s contention probably carries more weight than that of the state. It would be linguistically appealing to adopt the syllogism embodied in the defendant\u2019s contention, namely, that: (1) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) requires that \u201cthe offense\u201d be committed in the aggravated manner; (2) the likely referent of \u201cthe offense\u201d is the capital felony of which the defendant has been convicted; (3) that capital felony at issue in the present case is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201cmurder of two or more persons,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 53a-54b (8); and (4) therefore, the murder of <em>two </em>persons must be committed in the aggravated manner. Thus, under the defendant\u2019s position, there is a direct linguistic line between the language, \u201cthe offense,\u201d contained in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4), and the definition of the capital felony as the \u201cmurder of two . . . persons,\u201d contained in \u00a7 53a-54b (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The state\u2019s plain language argument is not as linguistically appealing. There is no direct linguistic line between the language, \u201cone or more aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) [of \u00a7 53a-46a],\u201d contained in \u00a7 53a-46a (f) (2), and the definition of the capital felony, contained in \u00a7 53a-54b (8). Subsection (i) of \u00a7 53a-46a lists seven potential aggravating factors, of which the commission of the offense in a cruel manner is only one. The likely reference of \u201cone,\u201d in the language, \u201cone or more of the aggravating factors,\u201d contained in \u00a7 53a-46a (f) (2), is to that set of seven factors, and provides no more than that the state must prove at least one, and may prove more than one, of those factors in order to meet its initial burden in seeking the death penalty following a conviction of an underlying capital felony. Linguistically, however, that reference offers little, if any, help in deciding the question posed by this appeal, namely, the meaning of the language, \u201cthe defendant committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4); as applied to the capital felony of the \u201cmurder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (8), as amended by P.A. 98-126, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The conclusion that would flow from the linguistic analysis suggested by the defendant, however, cannot withstand further scrutiny. Although the language of the statute, viewed literally and in isolation, suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>a conclusion consistent with the interpretation offered by the defendant, when viewed in its context and history leads us to conclude, to the contrary, that when \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) refers to \u201cthe offense,\u201d as applied in the circumstances of the present case, it means the murder of either of the \u201ctwo\u201d persons referred to in \u00a7 53a-54b (8), and does not mean both murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">First, as our case law demonstrates, the \u201cconstituent parts\u201d of the capital felony involved here are two murders that are committed in the course of a single transaction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Solek, </em>242 Conn. 409, 423, 699 A.2d 931 (1997) (\u201cconstituent parts\u201d of capital felony under \u00a7 53a-54b [7] are murder and sexual assault in first degree). Thus, the reference in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) to \u201cthe offense\u201d must be read as referring to those constituent parts. This reading permits the interpretation that the aggravating factor may be satisfied by proof of its existence with respect to at least one of those constituent parts. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 264, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995) (aggravating factor satisfied by proof of existence \u201cbeyond the elements of the [capital felony] charged\u201d). Put another way, it would permit the interpretation that the language, \u201cthe offense,\u201d refers to either of those parts, and does not necessarily refer to <em>both, and only both, </em>of those parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Second, the context and legislative genealogy of \u00a7 53a-54b (8) strongly support the conclusion that the aggravating factor involved here need only attach to one of the murders. When this state\u2019s death penalty legislation was first reenacted in 1973; Public Acts 1973, No. 73-137, \u00a7 3; following the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972), invalidating all states\u2019 death penalty statutes, the list of capital felonies included murder by a kidnapper of a kidnapped person during the course of the kidnapping, but did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>include either \u00a7 53a-54b (7) (\u201cmurder committed in the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree\u201d), or \u00a7 53a-54b (8) (\u201cmurder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction\u201d). See General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54b.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, under that original statutory scheme, the aggravating factor involved in this case was the same as it is today. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Both subdivision (7), namely, murder committed in the course of a sexual assault, and subdivision (8), namely, murder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction, were added to \u00a7 53a-54b in 1980 by Public Acts 1980, No. 80-335 (P.A. 80-335).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Thus, in 1973, the original death penalty legislation contained at least one capital felony that involved a murder in the course of another serious felony, namely, murder in the course of a kidnapping, and contained the same aggravating factor involved in the present case. Under that statutory scheme, there were six forms of capital felony, designated in general terms as follows: (1) murder of certain law enforcement, corrections or firefighting officials; (2) murder for hire; (3) murder by a previously convicted murderer; (4) murder by one under a life sentence; (5) murder by a kidnapper during the course of a kidnapping; and (6) death directly resulting from the illegal sale of cocaine, heroin or methadone by a person who is not drug-dependent. General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54b. Subdivisions (1) through (4) and (6) of \u00a7 53a-54b involved only one underlying offense. For subdivisions (1) through (4), that offense was murder, which was then further defined either by the motive for the murder, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>murder for hire, by the prior criminal status of the defendant, namely, murder by a convicted murderer or by one under a life sentence, or by the status of the victim, namely, murder of a law enforcement, corrections or firefighting official. As to subdivision (6), the underlying offense was death resulting from the specified illegal drug sales. Subdivision (5) of \u00a7 53a-54b, however, involved two underlying offenses, namely, murder and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">It cannot be disputed that, with respect to all of the capital felonies that involved only one underlying offense, the aggravating factor at issue in the present case need only have applied to that sole underlying offense. We can conceive of no rationale for the legislature to have set a higher bar to the imposition of the death penalty when the underlying capital felony involved, not one, but two underlying serious felonies, namely, kidnapping and murder. We are constrained to conclude, therefore, that when our statutory scheme was first enacted in 1973, the aggravating factor, as applied to the capital felony of \u201cmurder by a kidnapper of a kidnapped person during the course of the kidnapping or before such person is able to return or be returned to safety\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54b (5); did not have to apply to both the underlying felonies, namely, kidnapping and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In 1980, the legislature added to the capital felony statute two offenses that were similar in nature; they both involved two underlying felonies, namely, murder in the course of a sexual assault in the first degree, and two or more murders committed either at the same time or in the course of a single transaction. See P.A. 80-335. Therefore, after the enactment of the 1980 legislation, our death penalty statutory scheme contained three capital felonies that involved murder plus another serious felony: (1) murder plus kidnapping; (2) murder plus sexual assault in the first degree; and (3) murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>plus murder. General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 53a-54b. Both before and after the 1980 legislation, the aggravating factor remained the same, namely, that the offense was committed in a heinous, cruel or depraved manner. On the basis of this history, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we conclude that the legislature intended all three of these capital felonies to be treated the same with respect to the unchanged aggravating factor of heinous, cruel or depraved conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">We can conceive of no reason why the legislature, in adding the two additional capital felonies that it did in 1980, would have intended that, with respect to a murder committed in the course of a kidnapping or sexual assault, it would be sufficient, with regard to the imposition of the death penalty, for the state to prove the aggravating factor with respect to just <em>one </em>of the underlying felonies, but with respect to the murder of two persons in the course of a single transaction, the state would be required to prove the aggravating factor with respect to <em>both </em>of the underlying felonies. Indeed, to attribute such an intent to the legislature, or, to put it another, more accurate way, to attribute such a meaning to the legislative language, would be to attribute to that language a perverse result.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>It would mean that when, in the course of a single transaction, a capital felon committed two felonies of unequal seriousness on <em>one </em>victim\u2014unequal because one of those felonies does <em>not </em>involve the death of the victim\u2014the aggravating factor need only apply to <em>one </em>of the underlying felonies; but when, in the course of a single transaction, a capital felon committed <em>the most serious </em>felony on <em>two </em>victims, <em>each </em>resulting in the death of the victim, the aggravating factor must apply to <em>both </em>of the underlying felonies. A capital felon who murdered two persons in the course of a single transaction must be regarded, under any rational system of deterrence and moral hierarchy, as at least equally subject to deterrence and at least equally morally blameworthy to one who murders and either kidnaps or sexually assaults only one victim in the course of a single transaction. We cannot conceive of any legislative rationale pursuant to which the legislature would have intended, when it added multiple murder to the definition of capital felony, to set a higher bar to the imposition of the death penalty on multiple murder in a single transaction than it would have for murder-kidnap or murder-sexual assault in a single transaction. \u201cThe legislature cannot have intended such an interpretation when it enacted P.A. 80-335 . . . because it would lead to bizarre results.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Solek, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Indeed, as part of his plain language argument, the defendant posits that, \u201c[i]f the legislature had intended the essential gravamen [of the offense set forth at \u00a7 53a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>54b (8)] to have been only one of the murders, it would have said that it was a capital felony to commit murder during the commission of another murder,\u201d as the legislature did say with respect to both sexual assault-murder and kidnap-murder.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant implicitly concedes that, with respect to both sexual assault-murder and kidnap-murder, the aggravating factor need not apply to both of the underlying offenses,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, if the statutory formulation were as he posits with respect to a double murder, namely, \u201cmurder committed in the course of the commission of another murder,\u201d the aggravating factor would apply to either murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">This argument poses the wrong question. The question of statutory interpretation is not, as the defendant\u2019s argument suggests, if the legislature meant that, why did it not say so? The question is, what did the legislature mean by what it <em>did </em>say? Furthermore, with regard to the question posed by the present case, we see no substantive difference between the two formulations: (1) what the legislature did say in \u00a7 53a-54b (8), namely, the \u201cmurder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction\u201d; and (2) what the defendant contends the legislature would or should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>have said if it meant something different, namely, \u201cmurder committed in the course of the commission of another murder.\u201d In short, we cannot place on these two differing linguistic formulations the weight that the defendant would attribute to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The defendant also relies on the rules of strict construction and lenity in interpreting criminal statutes, and emphasizes their special pertinence to death penalty statutes. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>238 Conn. 828, 832-33, 681 A.2d 944 (1996) (statutory construction implicating death penalty must be based on conclusion that legislature has clearly and unambiguously made intention known, and rules of strict construction and lenity especially pertinent to death penalty statute); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>198 Conn. 111, 121, 502 A.2d 374 (1985) (fundamental tenet to resolve doubts in enforcement of Penal Code against imposition of harsher punishment). We are unpersuaded, however, that these rules require a different conclusion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">First, those rules apply when \u201ca contrary interpretation would [not] frustrate an evident legislative intent\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 200; and when, after the court has engaged in the full process of statutory interpretation, there is nonetheless a reasonable doubt \u201cabout [the] statute\u2019s intended scope . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>261 Conn. 111, 120, 802 A.2d 754 (2002). Second, the rules of strict construction and lenity, like all such axioms of construction, are \u201cimportant guideline[s] to legislative meaning, but [they] cannot displace the result of careful and thoughtful interpretation.\u201d <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 460. After engaging in the full process of statutory construction, we are not left with a reasonable doubt about the statute\u2019s intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>scope.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, those rules cannot be applied so as to yield a bizarre result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Solek, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 423. In the present case, in our view, the interpretation offered by the defendant: would frustrate the legislature\u2019s intent; would displace the result of careful and thoughtful interpretation; and would yield a bizarre result. We decline, therefore, to apply those rules so as to yield the result that the aggravating factor must apply to both murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The defendant also relies on what he characterizes as the structure of the capital felony statute, namely, that it divides capital felonies into two categories: one, focusing on the culpability of the defendant;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the other, focusing on the status of the victim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He contends that the capital felony in the present case falls into the former category, because \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s contemporaneous behavior in murdering a second person is like the prior conduct specified in sub [division] (3) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>capital felony statute (a prior murder conviction) and that in sub [division] (4) (a conviction resulting in a life sentence). It is also like the contemporaneous behavior of contracting to kill in subdivision] (2).\u201d This, he asserts, supports the conclusion that the legislature intended the aggravating factor to apply to both murders. This argument is unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">First, the defendant\u2019s classification is arbitrary, at least when applied to the offense in the present case. It is difficult to see why a capital felony defined as the murder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction focuses more on the defendant\u2019s conduct than on the status of the victims. In our view, the fact that there are two victims of the defendant\u2019s murderous conduct in the present case, rather than one, is as much a focus on the victims as it is on the defendant\u2019s conduct. Indeed, other capital felonies in the defendant\u2019s proffered classification of capital felonies based on the status of the victim could just as easily be put in the category of culpability based on the defendant\u2019s conduct. See, e.g., General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (7), as amended by P.A. 98-126, \u00a7 1 (\u201cmurder committed in the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree\u201d). Second, we simply fail to see how such a classification, if it were employed, illuminates the meaning of the statutory language at issue in the present case. Moreover, there is nothing in the language or structure of the statute to suggest that the legislature intended any such classifications to yield significantly different results with respect to eligibility for the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The defendant also argues that the \u201clegislature knew how to define a capital offense so that the cruel aggravating factor would apply to only one of [the] two murders,\u201d because when it did so it used the language \u201cin the course of,\u201d such as \u201cmurder committed in the course of\u2019 a sexual assault, or murder of a kidnapped person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u201cduring the course of\u2019 the kidnapping. This argument ignores, however, the fact that this capital felony also uses that language, namely, \u201cmurder of two or more persons at the same time <em>or in the course of a </em>single transaction . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (8), as amended by P.A. 98-126, \u00a7 1. It cannot be, moreover, that the legislature intended the aggravating factor to apply differently, depending on whether the two murders were committed \u201cat the same time\u201d or \u201cin the course of a single transaction,\u201d as the defendant\u2019s argument suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Finally, the defendant draws support for his position from the fact that our statutory scheme uses language that differs from that used in other states, and also differs from that used by certain proposed model statutes, such as the Model Penal Code and a proposed 1973 federal death penalty statute. See S. Rep. No. 93-721 (1974). Certain of those other statutes and statutory proposals use language similar to that suggested previously by the defendant, namely, \u201cmurder in the course of another murder.\u201d According to the defendant, those other statutory formulations do permit the death penalty to be imposed in multiple murder situations without their analogs to our aggravating factor being applied to both murders. Thus, the defendant suggests that we should infer a legislative intent to embrace a different result based on our language, because it differs from the language of those formulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Suffice it to say that, in the absence of some strong indication that, when the legislature added the murder of two persons to the list of capital felonies in 1980, it specifically intended a result different from that yielded by those other statutes or statutory proposals, we are not inclined to draw such an inference. There is no such indication in the legislative history. Simply because our legislature did not use precisely the same language as that used or proposed for use by other legislative bodies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>to address a similar situation, namely, multiple murders as laying the basis for a potential death penalty, does not require a conclusion that it also intended a different result, especially when, as in the present case, we can see no substantive difference between our language and those other statutory formulations. We, therefore, conclude that the state need only prove that the defendant killed one of the victims in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46 (i) (4), in order to seek the death penalty based on that factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">We take this opportunity to clarify the approach of this court<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to the process of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>For at least a century, this corut has relied on sources beyond the specific text of the statute at issue to determine the meaning of the language as intended by the legislature. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>161 Conn. 283, 288-90, 287 A.2d 369 (1971); <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 325, 329, 142 A.2d 524 (1958); <em>Connecticut Rural Roads Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>124 Conn. 20, 25, 197 A. 90 (1938); <em>Corbin </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>92 Conn. 99, 105, 101 A. 834 (1917); <em>Seidel </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>81 Conn. 65, 71-74, 70 A. 58 (1908). For that same period of time, however, this court often has eschewed resort to those sources when the meaning of the text appeared to be plain and unambiguous. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>155 Conn. 502, 504, 234 A.2d 835 (1967); <em>Niedzwicki </em>v. <em>Pequonnock Foundry, </em>133 Conn. 78, 82, 48 A.2d 369 (1946); <em>O'Brien </em>v. <em>Wise &amp; Upson Co., </em>108 Conn. 309, 318-19, 143 A. 155 (1928); <em>Bridgeport Projectile Co. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>92 Conn. 316, 318, 102 A. 644 (1917); <em>Lee Bros. Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Cram, </em>63 Conn. 433, 437-38, 28 A. 540 (1893).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In 1994, however, we noted a dichotomy in our case law regarding whether resort to extratextual sources was appropriate even in those instances where the text\u2019s meaning appeared to be plain and unambiguous. In <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 430-31 n.15, we stated: \u201cIt is true that, in construing statutes, we have often relied upon the canon of statutory construction that we need not, and indeed ought not, look beyond the statutory language to other interpretive aids unless the statute\u2019s language is not absolutely clear and unambiguous. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 744-45, 613 A.2d 804 (1992); <em>Mercado </em>v. <em>Commissioner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>of Income Maintenance, </em>222 Conn. 69, 74, 607 A.2d 1142 (1992); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 225, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 552-53, 400 A.2d 712 (1978). That maxim requires some slight but plausible degree of linguistic ambiguity as a kind of analytical threshold that must be surmounted before a court may resort to aids to the determination of the meaning of the language as applied to the facts of the case. See, e.g., <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). It is also true, however, that we have often eschewed such an analytical threshold, and have stated that, in interpreting statutes, we look at all the available evidence, such as the statutory language, the legislative history, the circumstances surrounding its enactment, the purpose and policy of the statute, and its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles. See, e.g., <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Glastonbury Volunteer Ambulance Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 848, 852-57, 633 A.2d 305 (1993); <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993); <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 589, 522 A.2d 771 (1987). This analytical model posits that the legislative process is purposive, and that the meaning of legislative language (indeed, of any particular use of our language) is best understood by viewing not only the language at issue, but by its context and by the purpose or purposes behind its use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Since then, we have not been consistent in our formulation of the appropriate method of interpreting statutory language. At times, we have adhered to the formulation that requires identification of some degree of ambiguity in that language before consulting any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>sources of its meaning beyond the statutory text. See, e.g., <em>MacDermid, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>257 Conn. 128, 154, 778 A.2d 7 (2001) (\u201cif the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We refer herein to that formulation as the \u201cplain meaning rule,\u201d which we discuss in further detail later in this opinion. At other times, we have, as in the present case; see part I of this opinion; adhered to a more encompassing formulation that does not require passing any threshold of ambiguity as a precondition of consulting extratextual sources of the meaning of legislative language. See, e.g., <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 741.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">We now make explicit that our approach to the process of statutory interpretation is governed by the <em>Bender </em>formulation, as further explicated herein. The first two sentences of that formulation set forth the fundamental task of the court in engaging in the process of statutory interpretation, namely, engaging in a \u201creasoned search for the intention of the legislature,\u201d which we further defined as a reasoned search for \u201cthe mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ing of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The rest of the formulation sets forth the range of sources that we will examine in order to determine that meaning. That formulation admonishes the court to consider all relevant sources of meaning of the language at issue\u2014namely, the words of the statute, its legislative history and the circumstances surrounding its enactment, the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and its relationship to existing legislation and to common-law principles governing the same general subject matter. Id. We also now make explicit that we ordinarily will consider all of those sources beyond the language itself,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> without first having to cross any threshold of ambiguity of the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We emphasize, moreover, that the language of the statute is the most important factor to be considered, for three very fundamental reasons. First, the language of the statute is what the legislature enacted and the governor signed. It is, therefore, the law. Second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>process of interpretation is, in essence, the search for the meaning <em>of that language </em>as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether it does apply to those facts. Third, all language has limits, in the sense that we are not free to attribute to legislative language a meaning that it simply will not bear in the usage of the English language.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Therefore\u2014and we make this explicit as well\u2014we always <em>begin </em>the process of interpretation with a searching examination of that language, attempting to determine the range of plausible meanings that it may have in the context in which it appears and, if possible, narrowing that range down to those that appear most plausible. Thus, the statutory language is always the starting point of the interpretive inquiry. A significant point of the <em>Bender </em>formulation, however, is that we do not end the process with the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The reason for this, as we stated in <em>Frillici, </em>is that \u201cthe legislative process is purposive, and . . . the meaning of legislative language (indeed, of any particular use of our language) is best understood by viewing not only the language at issue, but by its context<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>by the purpose or purposes behind its use.\u201d <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 430-31 n.15; see also <em>Conway v. Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 680 A.2d 242 (1996) (interpreting General Statutes \u00a7 52-557f in light of purpose to encourage private landowners to make land available for recreational use); <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 475, 628 A.2d 946 (1993) (interpreting General Statutes \u00a7 31-51bb in light of purpose to overrule <em>Kolenberg </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>206 Conn. 113, 536 A.2d 577, cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1236, 108 S. Ct. 2903, 101 L. Ed. 2d 935 [1988]).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Thus, the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of that legislative language, which includes the other sources noted in Render, are directly relevant to its meaning as applied to the facts of the case before us. See L. Fuller, \u201cPositivism and Fidelity to Law\u2014A Reply to Professor Hart,\u201d 71 Harv. L. Rev. 630, 664 (1958) (it is not \u201cpossible to interpret a word in a statute without knowing the aim of the statute\u201d); S. Breyer, \u201cOn the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes,\u201d 65 S. Cal. L. Rev. 845, 853 (1992) (\u201c[a] court often needs to know the purpose a particular statutory word or phrase serves within the broader context of a statutory scheme in order to decide properly whether a particular circumstance falls within the scope of that word or phrase\u201d); F. Frankfurter, \u201cSome Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,\u201d 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 538-39 (1947) (\u201cLegislation has an aim; it seeks to obviate some mischief, to supply an inadequacy, to effect a change of policy, to formulate a plan of government. That aim, that policy is not drawn, like nitrogen, out of the air; it is evinced in the language of the statute, as read in the light of other external manifestations of purpose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Indeed, in our view, the concept of the context of statutory language should be broadly understood. That is, the context of statutory language necessarily includes the other language used in the statute or statutoxy scheme at issue, the language used in other relevant statutes, the general subject matter of the legislation at issue, the history or genealogy of the statute, as well as the other, extratextual sources identified by the <em>Bender </em>formulation. All of these sources, textual as well as contextual, are to be considered, along with the purpose or purposes of the legislation, in determining the meaning of the language of the statute as applied to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">This brings us to a discussion of what is commonly known as the \u201cplain meaning rule.\u201d Although we have used many different formulations of the plain meaning rule, all of them have in common the fundamental premise, stated generally, that, where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, the court must stop its interpretive process with that language; there is in such a case no room for interpretation; and, therefore, in such a case, the court must not go beyond that language.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>It is useful to note that both the plain meaning rule and the <em>Bender </em>formulation have, as a general matter, their starting points in common: both begin by acknowledging that the task of the court is to ascertain the intent of the legislature in using the language that it chose to use, so as to determine its meaning in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>context of the case. See, e.g., <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 186 (\u201c[o]ur task is to find the expressed intent of the legislature\u201d). Where these approaches differ, however, is on how to go about that task.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Unlike the <em>Bender </em>formulation, under the plain meaning rule, there are certain cases in which that task must, as a matter of law, end with the statutory language. Thus, it is necessary to state precisely what the plain meaning rule means.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The plain meaning rule means that in a certain category of cases\u2014namely, those in which the court first determines that the language at issue is plain and unambiguous\u2014the court is <em>precluded as a matter of law </em>from going beyond the text of that language to consider any extratextual evidence of the meaning of that language, no matter how persuasive that evidence might be. Indeed, the rule even precludes reference to that evidence where that evidence, if consulted, would <em>support or confirm </em>that plain meaning. Furthermore, inherent in the plain meaning rule is the admonition that the courts are to seek the objective meaning of the language used by the legislature \u201cnot in what [the legislature] meant to say, but in [the meaning of] what it did say.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 187.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Another inherent part of the plain meaning rule is the exception that the plain and unambiguous meaning is <em>not </em>to be applied if it would produce an unworkable or absurd result. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 744 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>(unworkable result); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 437, 668 A.2d 348 (1995) (absurd result).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Thus, the plain meaning rule, at least as most commonly articulated in our jurisprudence, may be restated as follows: If the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, and if the result yielded by that plain and unambiguous meaning is not absurd or unworkable, the court must not <em>interpret </em>the language (i.e., there is no room for construction); instead, the court\u2019s sole task is to apply that language literally to the facts of the case, and it is precluded as a matter of law from consulting any extratextual sources regarding the meaning of the language at issue. Furthermore, in deciding whether the language is plain and unambiguous, the court is confined to what may be regarded as the objective meaning of the language used by the legislature, and may not inquire into what the legislature may have intended the language to mean\u2014that is, it may not inquire into the purpose or purposes for which the legislature used the language. Finally, the plain meaning rule sets forth a set of thresholds of ambiguity or uncertainty, and the court must surmount each of those thresholds in order to consult additional sources of meaning of the language of the statute. Thus, whatever may lie beyond any of those thresholds may in any given case be barred from consideration by the court, irrespective of its ultimate usefulness in ascertaining the meaning of the statutory language at issue.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>We now make explicit what is implicit in what we have already said: in performing the process of statutory interpretation, we do not follow the plain meaning rule in whatever formulation it may appear. We disagree with the plain meaning rule as a useful rubric for the process of statutory interpretation for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">First, the rule is fundamentally inconsistent with the purposive and contextual nature of legislative language. Legislative language <em>is </em>purposive and contextual, and its meaning simply cannot be divorced from the purpose or purposes for which it was used and from its context. Put another way, it <em>does </em>matter, in determining that meaning, what purpose or purposes the legislature had in employing the language; it <em>does </em>matter what meaning the legislature intended the language to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Second, the plain meaning rule is inherently self-contradictory. It is a misnomer to say, as the plain meaning rule says, that, if the language is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for interpretation, because application of the statutory language to the facts of the case <em>is interpretation </em>of that language. In such a case, the task of interpretation may be a simple matter, but that does not mean that no interpretation is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The plain meaning rule is inherently self-contradictory in another way. That part of the rule that excepts from its application cases in which the plain language would yield an absurd or unworkable result is implicitly, but necessarily, premised on the process of going beyond the text of the statute to the legislature\u2019s intent in writing that text. This is because the only plausible reason for that part of the rule is that the legislature could not have intended for its language to have a meaning that yielded such a result. Indeed, we have explicitly acknowledged as much. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>supra, 235 Conn. 437 (\u201c[i]t is also a rule of statutory construction that those who promulgate statutes or rules do not intend to promulgate statutes or rules that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 523, 441 A.2d 158 (1981) (\u201c[t]his is the bizarre result of a literal construction of the statute not contemplated by the legislature\u201d). Thus, application of this aspect of the plain meaning rule requires an implicit inquiry into the legislature\u2019s intent or purpose, beyond the bare text, thus, in effect, permitting the court to <em>rule out </em>the plain meaning of the language because that meaning would produce an absurd or unworkable result. We see no persuasive reason for a rule of law that prohibits a court from similarly going beyond the bare text of the statute to <em>rule in </em>a <em>different </em>meaning that other sources of meaning might suggest in any given case. Yet such a prohibition is precisely what the plain meaning rule accomplishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Third, application of the plain meaning rule necessarily requires the court to engage in a threshold determination of whether the language is ambiguous. This requirement, in turn, has led this court into a number of declarations that are, in our view, intellectually and linguistically dubious, and risk leaving the court open to the criticism of being result-oriented in interpreting statutes.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, for example, we have stated that statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>tory language does not become ambiguous \u201cmerely because the parties contend for different meanings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Glastonbury Co. </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>209 Conn. 175, 180, 550 A.2d 8 (1988). Yet, if parties contend for different meanings, and each meaning is plausible, that is essentially what \u201cambiguity\u201d ordinarily means in such a context in our language. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, and Memam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.), for the various meanings of \u201cambiguity\u201d and \u201cambiguous\u201d in this context. For example, in Memam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, the most apt definition of \u201cambiguous\u201d for this context is: \u201c[CJapable of being understood in two or more possible senses or ways.\u201d We also have stated that, although the statutory language is clear on its face, it contains a \u201clatent ambiguity\u201d that is disclosed by its application to the facts of the case, or by reference to its legislative history and purpose. <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 664-65; see also <em>University of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 322, 328, 585 A.2d 690 (1991) (when application of clear language to facts reveals \u201clatent ambiguity,\u201d court turns for guidance to purpose of statute and legislative history). Statutory language, however, always requires some application to the facts of the case. Therefore, the notion of such a \u201clatent ambiguity\u201d as a predicate to resort to extratextual sources simply does not make sense. Moreover, we have stated that the plain meaning principle does not apply where the statutory language, although clear and unambiguous, is not <em>\u201cabsolutely </em>clear and unambiguous . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>original.) <em>State v. Cain, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 744. The line of demarcation between clear and unambiguous language, on one hand, and <em>absolutely </em>clear and unambiguous language, on the other hand, however, eludes us. We have stated further that the court may go beyond the literal language of the statute when \u201ca common sense interpretation leads to an ambiguous . . . result . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 522. It is similarly difficult, to make sense of the notion of otherwise clear language becoming ambiguous because it leads to an \u201cambiguous . . . result . . . .\u201d Id. Indeed, within the very same case: (1) we have stated that the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and, therefore, \u201cis not subject to construction\u201d; <em>University of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 328; and (2) nonetheless, \u201cwe <em>construe[d]\u201d </em>the statute so as to avoid a particular result that one of the parties had pointed out would otherwise come within that plain language. (Emphasis added.) Id., 329. Thus, in that case, in applying the plain meaning rule, we directly violated it. We see little value in a rule of law that has led this court into such dubious distinctions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Eschewing the plain meaning rule does not mean, however, that we will not in any given case follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Indeed, in most cases, that meaning will, once the extra-textual sources of meaning contained in the <em>Bender </em>formulation <em>are </em>considered, prove to be the legislatively intended meaning of the language. See, e.g., <em>Glastonbury Volunteer Ambulance Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 853-54 (plain language meaning confirmed by legislative history).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">There are cases, however, in which the extratextual sources will indicate a different meaning strongly enough to lead the court to conclude that the legislature intended the language to have that different meaning. See, e.g., <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>258 Conn. 529, 539, 782 A.2d 670 (2001) (statutory reference to \u201csection\u201d intended to mean \u201csubsection\u201d); <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 664\u201465 (statutory reference to \u201cowner\u201d does not include municipality). Importantly, and consistent with our admonition that the statutory language is the most important factor in this analysis, in applying the <em>Bender </em>formulation, we necessarily employ a kind of sliding scale: the more strongly the bare text of the language suggests a particular meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources will have to be in order for us to conclude that the legislature intended a different meaning.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 45, 792 A.2d 835 (2002) (concluding extratextual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>sources provided \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that plain meaning of statute was contrary to legislative intent). Such a sliding scale, however, is easier to state than to apply. In any given case, it necessarily will come down to a judgmental weighing of all of the evidence bearing on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The point of the <em>Bender </em>formulation, however, is that it requires the court, in <em>all </em>cases, to consider <em>all </em>of the relevant evidence bearing on the meaning of the language at issue. Thus, <em>Bender\u2019s </em>underlying premise is that, the more such evidence the court considers, the more likely it is that the court will arrive at a proper conclusion regarding that meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Moreover, despite the fact that, as we noted at the outset of this discussion, no other jurisdiction specifically has adopted the particular formulation for statutory interpretation that we now adopt, there is really nothing startlingly new about its core, namely, the idea that the court may look for the meaning of otherwise clear statutory language beyond its literal meaning, even when that meaning would not yield an absurd or unworkable result. It stretches back to the sixteenth century; see, e.g., <em>Heydon\u2019s Case, </em>3 Co. Rep. 7a, Eng. Rep. (1584); to the early days of the last century; see <em>Bridgeman </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>104 Conn. 1, 8-9, 132 A. 25 (1926) (\u201cAs we seek to interpret this provision of [the] defendant\u2019s charter, it will be well to keep before us some of the fundamental principles of statutory construction. The intent of the lawmakers is the soul of the statute, and the search for this intent we have held to be the guiding star of the court. It must prevail over the literal sense and the precise letter of the language of the statute. <em>Brown\u2019s Appeal, </em>72 Conn. 148,150,44 Atl. 22 [1899]; <em>Stapleberg </em>v. <em>Stapleberg, </em>77 Conn. 31, 35, 58 Atl. 233 [1904]; <em>Welherell v.

In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 741. Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">This does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Before concluding this discussion, we respond to several of the main points of the dissent. The dissent takes issue with both the appropriateness and the reliability of ascertaining the purpose or purposes of the statute under consideration in determining its meaning. This point demonstrates a fundamental difference between our view and the dissent\u2019s view of the nature of legislation. We think that legislation is inherently purposive and that, therefore, it is not only appropriate, but necessary to consider the purpose or purposes of legislation in order to determine its meaning. Furthermore, the experience of this court demonstrates no particular difficulty in reliably ascertaining such purposes, based not on our own personal preferences but on both textual and extratextual sources. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>252 Conn. 795, 804, 750 A.2d 1037 (2000), we ascertained from the text of the statute itself that the purpose of the statutory language was to incorporate a certain common-law doctrine. We stated: \u201c[T]he legislature, in using the phrase \u2018[pjenetration, however slight,\u2019 evinced an intent to incorporate, into our statutory law, the common-law least penetration doctrine.\u201d Id. In <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 664-65, we ascertained, from various extratextual sources, including reports accompanying the model act on which the statute was based, the legislative history of the statute and the surrounding legislation, that the purpose of the statute was to address certain social problems by encouraging private landowners to dedicate their land to recreational uses. In <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>supra, 226 Conn. 481-82, we ascertained from the legislative history that the purposes of the statute involved were to overrule a prior decision of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>court and to adopt the reasoning of certain decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The dissent also suggests that judges, by employing a purposive approach to statutory interpretation rather than the plain meaning rule, will substitute our own notions of wise and intelligent policy for the policy of the legislature. We agree that this may happen; any court <em>may </em>be intellectually dishonest in performing <em>any </em>judicial task, whether it be interpreting a statute or adjudicating a dispute involving only the common law. We suggest, however, that the risk of intellectual dishonesty is just as great, or as minimal, in employing the plain meaning rule as in employing the method of inteipretation that we articulate. If a court is determined to be intellectually dishonest and reach the result that it <em>wants </em>the statute to mandate, rather than the result that an honest and objective appraisal of its meaning would yield, it will find a way to do so under any articulated rubric of statutory interpretation. Furthermore, by insisting that <em>all </em>evidence of meaning be considered and explained before the court arrives at the meaning of a statute, we think that the risk of intellectual dishonesty in performing that task will be minimized. Indeed, resort to and explanation of extratextual sources may provide a certain transparency to the court\u2019s analytical and interpretive process that could be lacking under the employment of the plain meaning rule. In sum, we have confidence in the ability of this court to ascertain, explain and apply the purpose or purposes of a statute in an intellectually honest manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The dissent also contends that the plain meaning rule is based on the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers. Our only response to this assertion is that there is simply no basis for it. In our view, contrary to that of the dissent, there is nothing in either the federal or the Connecticut constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers that compels <em>any </em>particular method or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>rabric of statutory interpretation, that precludes a court from employing a purposive and contextual method of interpreting statutes, or that compels the judiciary to employ the plain meaning rule, in performing its judicial task of interpreting the meaning of legislative language. Simply put, the task of the legislative branch is to draft and enact statutes, and the task of the judicial branch is to interpret and apply them in the context of specific cases. The constitution says nothing about what type of language the legislature must employ in performing its tasks, and nothing about what method or methods the judiciary must employ in ascertaining the meaning of that language.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The dissent also makes the points that legislative history should be considered only if \u201cthe other tools of interpretation fail to produce a single, reasonable meaning,\u201d and that, in any event, it is an unreliable method of ascertaining legislative intent and facilitates \u201c \u2018decisions that are based upon the courts\u2019 policy preferences, rather than neutral principles of law.\u2019 \u201d See A. Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law (A. Gutmann ed., 1997) p. 35. Thus, the dissent regards the use of legislative history as unreliable evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>dence of legislative intent, and as insidious in the sense that it permits the court to interpret a statute to reach a meaning that the court <em>wants </em>it to have, based on the court\u2019s own policy preference, rather than that of the legislature. As a result, in the dissent\u2019s five step formulation of the plain meaning rule, consideration of legislative history is relegated to the fourth, or penultimate, step.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In response, we note first that it is difficult to understand why the dissent would consider the use of legislative history at all in its formulation, given that it regards such use as both unreliable and insidious. More importantly, it appears to us that, under the dissent\u2019s formulation, only the most difficult cases of statutory interpretation would reach the fourth step of its analysis. Thus, the dissent reserves what it regards as an unreliable and insidious source of statutory meaning to act as the tiebreaker in the most difficult cases of interpretation. This strikes us as a curiously important role for what the dissent regards so negatively as a source of the meaning of legislative language.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">On the merits of the use of legislative history, we simply disagree with the dissent\u2019s characterizations of it. The general experience of this court demonstrates to us that legislative history, when reviewed and employed in a responsible, discriminating and intellectually honest manner, can constitute reliable evidence of legislative intent. See, e.g., <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>supra, 226 Conn. 481-82; <em>Wright Bros. Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>247 Conn. 218, 230-31, 720 A.2d 235 (1998) (legislative history of General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 indicated that \u201ctechnically perfect compliance with each subdivision\u201d is not required); <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 512, 508 A.2d 415 (1986) (legislative history of General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 indicated that legislature did not intend appointment of attorney trial referees without consent of parties). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>In addition to legislative hearings and debate, legislative history includes official commentary to various statutory codifications, such as our Penal Code and title 42a of the General Statutes, which is Connecticut\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code. We routinely have cited these commentaries as rehable evidence of legislative intent. See, e.g., <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>238 Conn. 692, 711, 680 A.2d 262 (1996) (official commentary to Penal Code suggested that eavesdropping statutes were not intended to penalize nonconsensual monitoring and recording of communication if at least one party to communication is aware of monitoring and recording); <em>Flagg Energy Development Corp. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>244 Conn. 126, 136-39, 709 A.2d 1075 (1998) (applying official comment 1 to \u00a7 42a-2-503 of the Uniform Commercial Code). Still another aspect of the legislative history of a statute is its genealogy, which is its historical development over time. We often have found consideration of a statute\u2019s genealogy useful in determining its meaning, as applied in the case before us, and have been able to do so without substituting our own view of its policy for that of the legislature. See, e.g., <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>254 Conn. 348, 362-63, 757 A.2d 549 (2000) (genealogy of General Statutes \u00a7 8-26c [c] regarding discretionary authority of municipality to call subdivision performance bond); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>244 Conn. 403, 424-27, 710 A.2d 1297 (1998) (genealogy of use of term \u201cchild of the marriage\u201d in marital dissolution statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">As for the insidious nature of the use of such history, our response is the same as that we made to the same argument of the dissent regarding the general aim of ascertaining the purpose of a statute. If a court is determined to be intellectually dishonest and result-oriented in its decision-making, it does not need any particular stated rubric of interpretation\u2014whether purposive, plain meaning, or some other method\u2014to be so. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>thermore, we have confidence in this court\u2019s ability to employ legislative history in a responsible, discriminating and intellectually honest manner, so as to determine the legislature\u2019s purpose or purposes, and not our own. We think that our history in doing so bears this out, and we are confident that we can continue to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Ultimately, as Justice Cardozo acknowledged, the process of statutory interpretation requires \u201ca choice between uncertainties. We must be content to choose the lesser.\u201d <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>Guggenheim, </em>288 U.S. 280, 288, 53 S. Ct. 369, 77 L. Ed. 748 (1933). Furthermore, as Justice Frankfurter stated, in making those choices we cannot avoid \u201cthe anguish of judgment.\u201d F. Frankfurter, supra, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 544. The <em>Bender </em>formulation recognizes these realities.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The ruling of the trial court requiring the state to prove that both murders were committed in the aggravated manner is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In this opinion NORCOTT, PALMER and VERTEFEU-ILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b, as amended by P.A. 98-126, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cA person is guilty of a capital felony who is convicted of any of the following: (1) Murder of a member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Public Safety or of any local police department, a chief inspector or inspector in the Division of Criminal Justice, a sheriff or deputy sheriff, a constable who performs criminal law enforcement duties, a special policeman appointed under section 29-18, an employee of the Department of Correction or a person providing services on behalf of said department when such employee or person is acting within the scope of his employment or duties in a correctional institution or facility and the actor is confined in such institution or facility, or any fireman, while such victim was acting within the scope of his duties; (2) murder committed by a defendant who is hired to commit the same for pecuniary gain or murder committed by one who is hired by the defendant to commit the same for pecuniary gain; (3) murder committed by one who has previously been convicted of intentional murder or of murder committed in the course of commission of a felony; (4) murder committed by one who was, at the time of commission of the murder, under sentence of life imprisonment; (5) murder by a kidnapper of a kidnapped person during the course of the kidnapping or before such person is able to return or be returned to safety; (6) the illegal sale, for economic gain, of cocaine, heroin or methadone to a person who dies as a direct result of the use by him of such cocaine, heroin or methadone; (7) murder committed in the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree; (8) murder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction; or (9) murder of a person under sixteen years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Unless otherwise indicated, references in this opinion to \u00a7 53a-54b are to the 1997 revision, as amended by P.A. 98-126, \u00a7 1, which was in effect at the time the crimes here were committed.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 449-50, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L.

Under the legislative capital felony scheme as enacted in 1973, the legislature had made the policy choice not to include multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>murders within the definition of capital felony. Therefore, the question of whether that was a rational choice never was presented to this court. The question that <em>has </em>been presented to us in this case is whether, when it did decide to include multiple murders in the capital felony scheme in 1980, the legislature intended for the state to have a heavier burden with respect to the aggravating factor as applied to that crime than every other offense, including kidnap-murder, already included in that scheme. We answer that question in the negative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> Section 53a-54b (5) defines the capital offense of kidnap-murder as <em>\u201cmurder by a kidnapper </em>of a kidnapped person <em>during the course of the kidnapping </em>or before such person is able to return or be returned to safety . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Subsection (7) of \u00a7 53a-54b similarly defines sexual assault-murder as \u201cmurder <em>committed in the course of the commission of </em>sexual assault in the first degree . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\"> The defendant argues, however, that, in any event, the aggravating factor must apply to the murder, and not to the other underlying felony. The state contends that it may apply to either underlying offense. The interpretation offered by the dissent would, in effect, agree with the state. We need not resolve that issue, however, in the present case, because the facts of the case present only the question of whether the claimed aggravating factor applied to <em>both murders. </em>To adopt the inteipretation offered by both the state and the dissent would require an expansion of the definition of \u201cespecially heinous, cruel or depraved manner,\u201d which heretofore has focused solely on the killing, and not on any other conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> Thus, we disagree with the conclusion of the dissent, namely, that there is a reasonable doubt about the intended scope of the statute. The dissent\u2019s conclusion implies that the rule of lenity would apply in every case in which the defendant was able to muster aplausible, albeit erroneous, interpretation of a criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Indeed, that is precisely how the dissent in fact applies the rule of lenity. Although it disagrees with the defendant\u2019s interpretation, namely, \u201cthat the state must prove . . . that both murders were committed in a cruel manner,\u201d the dissent nonetheless \u201cwould uphold the trial court\u2019s application of the rule of lenity and require that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt that both murders were committed in a cruel manner . . . .\u201d This is solely because, in the dissent\u2019s view, the defendant\u2019s interpretation appears to be plausible. This use of the rule of lenity would mean that, as a practical matter, in all but the rarest of cases of statutory interpretation of criminal statutes, the defendant would necessarily prevail. We disagree that the rule of lenity has such a broad scope and overarching function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\"> In this category, the defendant puts murder for hire, murder by a previously convicted murderer, and murder by one under a life sentence.

Thus, resolution of those questions will affect, not only the present case, but other pending and future cases, and will give guidance to the bench and bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\"> We acknowledge at the outset that the particular approach to the judicial process of statutory interpretation, as formulated and explained herein, that we now specifically adopt, has not been adopted in the same specific formulation by any other court in the nation. Alaska, however, specifically has rejected the \u201cplain meaning rule,\u201d which we discuss later in this opinion in further detail, and has, in effect, adopted much the same comprehensive approach to determining the meaning of legislative language that we now adopt. See <em>Wold v. Progressive Preferred Ins. Co., </em>52 P.3d 155 (Alaska 2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alex, </em>646 P.2d 203 (Alaska 1982); <em>State Dept. of Natural Resources </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>627 P.2d 1047 (Alaska 1981); <em>North Slope Borough </em>v. <em>Sohio Petroleum Corp., </em>585 P.2d 534 (Alaska 1978). In addition, by statute, Texas specifically provides that, \u201c[i]n construing a statute, whether or not the statute is considered ambiguous on its face, a court may consider among other matters the: (1) object sought to be attained; (2) circumstances under which the statute was enacted; (3) legislative history; (4) common law or former statutory provisions, including laws on the same or similar subjects; (5) consequences of a particular construction; (6) administrative construction of the statute; and (7) title (caption), preamble, and emergency provision.\u201d Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 311.023 (Vernon 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">It is evident, therefore, that both Alaska and Texas, by judicial decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>and statute, respectively, view the process of statutory interpretation in much the same way as we do. In any event, despite our numerically minority status, we conclude that the approach we outline herein most appropriately accomplishes the judicial task of ascertaining the meaning of legislative language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> For purposes of both clarity and emphasis, we repeat here the <em>Bender </em>formulation: \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>[supra, 231 Conn. 431]. In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . .

Both this court and courts throughout the nation have long employed the language of \u201clegislative intent,\u201d both within and outside the confines of the plain meaning rule, without any apparent confusion about what it means.

Compare <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 187-88, with <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 744-45, 613 A.2d 804 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">In <em>Sanzone, </em>we began with the statement that, if the statutory \u201clanguage is plain and unambiguous, we go no further.\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 187. We then setup a multistep process, as follows. If the statute is ambiguous, defined as either opaque or susceptible to different meanings, we would seek guidance from \u201c \u2018extrinsic aids,\u2019 \u201d such as the legislative history. Id. If that history, and the legislative purpose are ambiguous, we would then resort to \u201c \u2018intrinsic aids,\u2019 \u201d such as the rules of statutory construction. Id. We then stated that, in that case, because both the language and legislative history were ambiguous, we would \u201cseek guidance . . . <em>from the traditional rules of English grammar </em>and of statutory construction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 189. Indeed, one would have thought that resort to the traditional rules of English grammar would have been near, at least, to the starting point of the interpretive process, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>at the end.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In <em>Cain, </em>we employed a different, multistep version of the plain meaning principle. We began with the statement, similar to that articulated in <em>San-zone, </em>that \u201c[i]f a statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for statutory construction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 744. We then qualified this statement with the proviso that this rule, requiring only application of the language to the facts of the case and prohibiting resort to other aids, \u201conly applies . . . where the language is <em>absolutely </em>clear and unambiguous\u201d and where there is no ambiguity disclosed by reference to those facts. (Emphasis in original.) Id. Furthermore, we stated, even if the language was clear on its face, resort to extratextual sources would be appropriate to determine legislative intent \u201cif a literal interpretation . . . would lead to unworkable results . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The dissent proposes a different multistep formulation of the plain meaning rule. Under that formulation, the first step is to look only at the language and, if it is plain and unambiguous, to stop there, unless that analysis produces an absurd result. If that analysis does not produce a plain and unambiguous meaning, or if it produces an absurd result, the court then, and only then, proceeds to the second step. The second step is to \u201celiminate all possible interpretations that render the statutory scheme incoherent or inconsistent.\u201d If that step produces more than one reasonable interpretation, the court then proceeds to the third step. The third step is to consider the statute\u2019s relationship to other legislation and relevant common-law principles, and to eliminate any interpretations incompatible with that legislation and those principles. If, after that step is performed, ambiguity still remains, the court proceeds to the fourth step. The fourth step is to examine the legislative history of the statute and the circumstances surrounding its enactment. If, after that step is performed, an ambiguity remains, the comt proceeds to the fifth step. The fifth step is to \u201capply any applicable presumptions in reaching a final interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">We note, in connection with all of these formulations, that a rigid threshold-passing requirement as a route to determining the meaning of statutory language is simply counter to any ordinary way of determining the meaning of language. We know of no other instance in which the reader of a written text undertakes, or is required to undertake, such a multistep, threshold-passing analysis in order to determine the meaning of the text. We see no persuasive reason why legislative language should be regarded as unique in this respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> There are, however, directly contradictory statements about this method of approach in our jurisprudence. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 57, 392 A.2d 491 (1978), for example, we stated: \u201cLegislative intent is to be found <em>not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In that same case, however, we also stated: \u201cIndeed, [tjhe particular inquiry is <em>not what is the abstract force of the words or what they may comprehend, but in what sense were they intended to be understood </em>or what understanding do they convey as used in the particular act.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> Although we have not confronted it in our jurisprudence, another commonly recognized exception to the plain meaning rule is that the rule will not be applied where resort to the legislative history discloses a drafting error in the statutory language as enacted.

Our point, drawing from Justice Stevens\u2019 remarks, is, rather, twofold: (1) attempting to follow the rule necessarily has led to dubious analytical methods and distinctions, which in turn may give the appearance of such result-oriented decision-making; and (2) the more evidence that a court consults about the meaning of legislative language, the more constrained it will be in arriving at a conclusion about that meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> It is not the intention of the author of this majority opinion to avoid the charge of engaging in dubious distinctions and statements, since it should be noted that, with the exceptions of <em>Glastonbury Co. </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 175, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 517, the author either participated in or authored the opinions referred to in part IIB of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\"> It is important in this connection to define what we mean in this context by the phrase, \u201cwhat may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language.\u201d By that phrase we mean the meaning that is so strongly indicated or suggested by the language as applied to the facts of the case, without consideration, however, of its purpose or the other, extratextual sources of meaning contained in the <em>Bender </em>formulation, that, when the language is read as so applied, it appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and appears to preclude any other likely meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">In the present case, we do not regard the defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation of the language of the capital felony statute as meeting this standard.

See Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9. Nevertheless, I concur in the judgment reached by the majority because I have an obligation, consistent with my oath and responsibilities as a justice of this court, to decide the issue before the court, despite the fact that, by agreeing with the majority on the merits, I thereby enable the state to proceed with a penalty phase hearing, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a, under a diminished burden of proof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I appreciate the tension that exists between my belief regarding the death penalty and my resolution of the issue on appeal.

Although these arguments have superficial appeal, I, like the majority, reject them. I agree with the majority\u2019s determination of the process by which we interpret statutes; see part II of the majority opinion; and likewise conclude that proof that the defendant committed at least one of the murders in the specified aggravated manner satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">At the time of the commission of the crimes here, \u00a7 53a-54b (8) defined a capital felony as the \u201cmurder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction . . . .\u201d See footnote 2 of this concurring and dissenting opinion. The defendant claims that the rules of statutory construction and lenity compel the conclusion that the state must prove the aggravating factor with respect to at least two victims. In support of this position, the defendant relies on the plain language of the \u00a7 53a-54b (8) itself, the overall statutory scheme and the policy behind both.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The defendant first contends that the plain language of \u00a7 53a-54b (8), namely, the phrases \u201ctwo or more persons\u201d and \u201cat the same time or in the course of a single transaction,\u201d supports his interpretation of that provision\u2019s meaning. Specifically, he claims that the \u201cessential gravamen\u201d of the offense set forth in that subdivision, to which the (i) (4) aggravating factor applies, is the \u201cmurder of two or more persons . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (8), as amended by P.A. 98-126. The defendant contends, therefore, that the murders of a minimum of two persons, in a multiple murder scenario, must be \u201caggravated,\u201d or committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner, in order for the death penalty to be imposed. Moreover, he contends that the phrase \u201cat the same time or in the course of a single transaction\u201d in \u00a7 53a-54b (8) supports this construction. In particular, he points out that, if the legislature had intended the essential gravamen to have been only that of a multiple murder, it would have selected different phraseology to convey that meaning, for example, that it is a capital felony to commit a murder <em>during the commission of another murder. </em>Because the legislature did not do so, however, opting instead for the phrase, \u201cat the same time or in the course of a single transaction,\u201d the defendant contends that it is not the murder of an <em>additional </em>person in the same transaction that triggers the offense provided for in \u00a7 53a-54b (8), but, rather, the murder of <em>at least two </em>people. Therefore, in the defendant\u2019s view, the underlying \u201coffense\u201d to which the (i) (4) aggravating factor applies is the murder of at least two people. Accordingly, because the (i) (4) aggravating factor calls for the underlying \u201coffense\u201d to have been committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner, the defendant concludes that at least two people must have been murdered in such a manner to support a finding that the aggravating factor exists in the commission of an offense pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54b (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The defendant further contends that his construction is consistent with the overall scheme of \u00a7 53a-54b. In particular, the defendant notes that each of the offenses enumerated in the nine subdivisions of that statute that was in effect at the time of the commission of the crimes here is comprised of a murder and an additional substantive element that the legislature deemed worthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>of separating out from the general murder scheme as a death eligible murder. According to the defendant, the (i) (4) aggravating factor applies to both the murder and the additional substantive element. To illustrate his contention, the defendant directs us to the eight subdivisions of the statute that are not applicable in the present case, which subdivisions establish that murder is a capital offense when: the victim is a police officer; the murder is for hire; the person who commits the murder already has been convicted either of an intentional murder or a murder in the coruse of committing a felony; the person who commits the murder is serving a life sentence; the murder is committed in the course of a kidnapping; the person who commits the murder sells to the victim illegal narcotics that are the direct cause of the death; the murder occurs in the course of a sexual assault; General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (1) through (7), as amended by P.A. 98-126; or the victim is under sixteen years of age. General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (9), as amended by P.A. 98-126. According to the defendant, in each of those instances, the two elements constitute the offense, and the (i) (4) aggravating factor applies to each element. Therefore, the defendant posits as an example of his interpretation that, when a person kidnaps and murders a victim, the murder <em>and </em>the kidnapping must be committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner in order to support a finding of the presence of the (i) (4) aggravating factor. The defendant contends, therefore, that, consistent with this scheme, in the present case, the murder plus the additional substantive element that the legislature deemed death eligible under \u00a7 53a-54b (8) is the murder of at least two persons. In other words, the defendant claims that, in order for the (i) (4) aggravating factor to apply to the entire offense under \u00a7 53a-54b (8), which is the murder of \u201ctwo or more persons,\u201d the minders of at least two people must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>have been committed in a heinous, cruel or depraved manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that his interpretation is consistent with the legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 53a-54b, in general, and subdivision (8), in particular. The defendant points out that the legislature enacted a very narrow capital punishment scheme by setting aside a discrete and specific number of death eligible murders, and by further narrowing the number of those murders for which a defendant actually can receive the death penalty to require that certain aggravating factors must outweigh any present mitigating factors. The defendant additionally notes that discussion surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 53a-54b (8) centered on the legislature\u2019s reaction to recent multiple murders and the role of the capital punishment scheme as a deterrent to certain kinds of murders. Reading \u00a7 53a-54b (8) such that the (i) (4) aggravating factor must apply to at least two murders, the defendant claims, furthers both of these legislative purposes: it confines the class of multiple murders that are death eligible, yet its potential as a death eligible offense dissuades individuals from committing multiple murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">It is well established that this court eschews statutory interpretations that yield bizarre or irrational results. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Municipal Employees Assn., </em>259 Conn. 251, 274, 788 A.2d 60 (2002). While the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the plain language of \u00a7 53a-54b (8) are, at first blush, intuitively seductive, his interpretation, in practice, would lead to bizarre results. First, with respect to his contention regarding the capital punishment scheme, the defendant\u2019s argument that each offense to which the (i) (4) aggravating factor applies is composed of two substantive elements and that the (i) (4) aggravating factor applies to both of the two elements misreads our prior case law and is inconsistent with the legislative purpose behind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>creation of, and the amendments to, the capital punishment scheme. The defendant is correct that our case law <em>implicitly </em>has applied the (i) (4) aggravating factor to both substantive elements of an offense pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54b, but only in that we never have applied it, explicitly, solely to one of the two elements. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 264, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995) (defendant could not prevail on sufficiency claim because \u201cstate presented ample evidence . . . [that] there were aggravating circumstances beyond the elements of the crimes charged\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>212 Conn. 258, 265, 270, 562 A.2d 1060 (1989) (aggravating factor envisions \u201cintentional infliction of extreme pain or torture above and beyond that necessarily accompanying the underlying killing\u201d). It does not follow, however, that because we never <em>eocpressly </em>have applied the (i) (4) aggravating factor to only one of the two substantive elements, we, therefore, <em>necessarily </em>have construed the (i) (4) aggravating factor as applying to both substantive elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Indeed, the language of \u00a7 53a-54b itself contradicts such an application. In subdivisions (1) through (4) and (9) of \u00a7 53a-54b, which, together, constitute more than one half of the statute, the (i) (4) aggravating factor <em>cannot, </em>in practice, be applied to both substantive elements of the offense enumerated. For example, while the murder of a police officer pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54b (1) certainly can be committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner, it defies logic to construe the statute to mean that <em>both </em>substantive elements of that offense, namely, the murder <em>and the police officer, </em>were \u201ccommitted ... in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4). Likewise, both elements of a murder (element one) for hire (element two) pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54b (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>cannot be committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The defendant cites subdivisions (5) and (7) to support his contention that the statutory scheme calls for the application of the (i) (4) aggravating factor to each element of the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 53a-54b. His construction admittedly works, in theory, with respect to those subdivisions. The elements of kidnapping (element one) and murder (element two) under \u00a7 53a-54b (5) both <em>can </em>be committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner, as can the elements of sexual assault (element one) and murder (element two) under \u00a7 53a-54b (7). It does not follow, however, from the fact that, because two of the eight other subdivisions of \u00a7 53a-54b have two elements that <em>can </em>be committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner, the statutory scheme thereby should be interpreted such that the two elements in each subdivision <em>must </em>be committed in such a manner to satisfy the (i) (4) aggravating factor. Indeed, because the defendant\u2019s theory is impossible to apply with regard to six of the eight other death eligible offenses enumerated in the statute, the logical conclusion must be that the defendant\u2019s argument in this regard does not advance his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s interpretation contradicts the apparent intent of the legislature in enacting the capital punishment scheme. The legislative history illustrates that the purpose of the legislature in enacting the capital sentencing scheme, in general, and the multiple murder amendment, in particular, was deterrence. See 23 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 1980 Sess., pp. 2312-13, remarks of Senator Salvatore C. DePiano (questioning whether life imprisonment has same deterrent value as death penalty); id., pp. 2326-27, remarks of Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr. (stating purpose of multiple murder amendment is \u201cdeterrent effect\u201d); 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1980 Sess., pp. 5695, 5697, remarks of Representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Eugene A. Migliaro, Jr. (explaining, in opposition to amendment to capital punishment scheme that proposed changing sentence for capital felony from death penalty to life imprisonment, that death penalty was deterrent).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">It also is rational to assume from the capital punishment scheme that the legislature considered murder to be the ultimate crime. Indeed, as the defendant points out, each offense delineated in \u00a7 53a-54b is, at base, a murder, singled out by the legislature as death eligible by virtue of the fact that an additional characteristic accompanies it, for example, kidnapping, sexual assault, a victim who is a police officer, or, as in the present case, another murder. With respect to all but subdivision (8) of \u00a7 53a-54b, therefore, the state has to prove that the (i) (4) aggravating factor applies only to one murder before a defendant can receive a death sentence. Nonetheless, according to the defendant, with respect to \u00a7 53a-54b (8), the state has to prove that the (i) (4) aggravating factor applies to at least two murders before a defendant will receive a death sentence. If the legislature viewed murder as the ultimate crime, however, and if its purpose in enacting \u00a7 53a-54b was to deter certain kinds of murders by making them death eligible, then it would have been irrational for the legislature to have intended that two aggravated murders are required before the offense is death eligible under subdivision (8), given that, under every other subdivision of \u00a7 53a-54b, one aggravated murder suffices to establish eligibility for the death penalty. Moreover, this is especially so, given that the legislature\u2019s express intent in enacting \u00a7 53a-54b (8) was to deter multiple murders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It would have been irrational, in attempting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>to deter multiple murders, to make it more difficult for the state to establish that the offense of multiple murder is death eligible than it is for the state to establish that one murder is death eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In support of his interpretation of \u00a7 53a-54b (8), the defendant also argues that this court should look to states with similar capital punishment schemes, that is, those that define multiple murder as a capital offense, not an aggravating factor, and also have a similar aggravating factor that is applied to that offense before the death penalty can be imposed. There are only two states that have such schemes: Virginia and Alabama.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Review of those states\u2019 application of their death penalty schemes, however, does not support the defendant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Virginia\u2019s capital punishment scheme defines capital murder as the murder of \u201cmore than one person as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>part of the same act or transaction\u201d; Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-31 (7) (Michie Cum. Sup. 2002); and instructs that the death penalty \u201cshall not be imposed unless . . . [the defendant\u2019s] conduct in committing the offense for which he stands charged was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim . . . .\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 19.2-264.2 (Michie 2000). In <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 131-33, 360 S.E.2d 196 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1036, 108 S. Ct. 763, 98 L. Ed. 2d 779 (1988), the defendant appealed his conviction of capital murder under \u00a7 18.2-31 (7) in connection with an attempted robbery during which he shot and killed a store owner and his employee. He claimed at oral argument before the Virginia Supreme Court that, because the capital murder charge was premised on multiple murders, <em>both </em>murders had to meet the vileness predicate of \u00a7 19.2-264.2 before the death penalty could be imposed. Id., 138. That court expressly concluded: \u201cWhere the \u2018vileness\u2019 predicate is under consideration, the manifest legislative puipose is to punish and deter any conduct which meets that standard. We conclude that if the killing <em>of any victim </em>in a multiple homicide meets the test of ... \u00a7 19.2-264.2, the death penalty may be imposed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.; see, e.g., <em>Goins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 470 S.E.2d 114, 132, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 887, 117 S. Ct. 222, 136 L. Ed. 2d 154 (1996) (implicitly affirming application of vileness factor to only one murder in conviction under multiple murder statute during review of sufficiency of evidence claim); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 1, 24-25, 419 S.E.2d 606 (1992) (same). Accordingly, Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme does not lend support to the defendant\u2019s claim in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Likewise, Alabama\u2019s statutory scheme does little to support the defendant\u2019s claim. Alabama\u2019s capital punishment scheme defines capital murder as \u201c[m]urder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>wherein two or more persons are murdered by the defendant by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct\u201d; Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-5-40 (a) (10) (1994); and allows the imposition of the death penalty when \u201c[t]he capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel compared to other capital offenses.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-5-49 (8) (1994). The Alabama courts have not addressed explicitly the issue of whether, in a multiple murder conviction under \u00a7 13A-5-40 (a) (10), the heinous factor must be found to apply to two or more murders before the death penalty can be imposed. Review of the case law in which the Alabama courts have applied the heinous factor to a capital conviction pursuant to Alabama\u2019s multiple murder provisions, however, reveals that such cases have involved the application of the heinous factor to at least two murders. See, <em>e.g.,Acklin v. State, </em>790 So. 2d 975,1001 (Ala. Crim. App. 2000), cert. denied, 533 U.S. 936, 121 S. Ct. 2565, 150 L. Ed. 2d 729 (2001) (evidence that defendant beat, humiliated and tortured, then shot three victims sufficient to support finding that murders were heinous); <em>Norris </em>v. <em>State, </em>793 So. 2d 847, 861 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999) (evidence insufficient to elevate offense to especially heinous when three victims shot in rapid, uninterrupted succession); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>777 So. 2d 856, 882 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999) (evidence that \u201cdefendant was unnecessarily torturous in his commission of the crimes\u201d sufficient to support finding that four murders were heinous); <em>Peoples </em>v. <em>State, </em>510 So. 2d 554, 573 (Ala. Crim. App. 1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 933, 108 S. Ct. 307, 98 L. Ed. 2d 266 (1987) (evidence that kidnapping and murder of husband, wife and child by blunt trauma to head sufficient, to support finding that three murders were heinous); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>State, </em>494 So. 2d 726, 744 (Ala. Crim. App. 1985), aff'd sub nom. <em>Ex parte Wright, </em>494 So. 2d 745 (Ala.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1101, 107 S. Ct. 1331, 94 L. Ed. 2d 183 (1987) (evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>dence that two victims were shot in head and slowly died in pools of blood sufficient to support trial court\u2019s finding that murders were heinous). Accordingly, in the absence of any evidence indicating that the Alabama legislature\u2019s intention in enacting its particular capital sentencing scheme was to make only multiple murders in which at least two of the murders were heinous eligible for the imposition of the death penalty, the similarity of that scheme to Connecticut\u2019s carries little persuasive force in the effort to interpret our scheme in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Finally, the defendant constructs an elaborate argument based upon the differences between the language our legislature chose in enacting \u00a7 53a-54b (8), the language of the Model Penal Code and a proposed 1973 federal death penalty statute. According to the defendant, those differences reflect an intention by the legislature that the (i) (4) aggravating factor apply to at least two murders, unlike the statutory formulations called for by those sources, permitting application of the aggravant to only one of the murders. In light of the fact, however, that there is no mention of these sources in our legislative history tending to indicate that the legislature took into consideration the language used in these sources, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In conclusion, consistent with the principles of statutory construction set forth in the majority opinion, I agree with the majority that the state\u2019s interpretation is more rational and, accordingly, is the correct one. While the interpretation proffered by the defendant and endorsed by the trial court is plausible, namely, that the (i) (4) aggravating factor applies to the underlying \u201coffense,\u201d which consists of at least two murders, and that at least two murders must, therefore, be aggravated, a careful review of the statutory language and scheme, the legislative intent, and the practical outcome of such an application reveals that such an interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tion is not rational and, as such, could not have been the legislature\u2019s intention. The defendant\u2019s strongest arguments involve the plain language of the statute and are indeed, at first blush, persuasive. But plain language is only the beginning of our statutory interpretation jurisprudence. See part II of the majority opinion. Indeed, further examination using our remaining available tools of statutory construction reveals that his arguments are hollow. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s reliance on the statutes of other states does not counter this conclusion and, in fact, Virginia\u2019s interpretation of its statutory scheme supports it. The defendant\u2019s claim is, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> I recognize, however, that because four other members of this court also agree with the state\u2019s interpretation of the revision of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (8) in effect at the time of the commission of the crimes here; see footnote 2 of this concurring and dissenting opinion; the majority\u2019s ability to persuade me to concur in the judgment in the present case provides a hollow victory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b, as amended by P.A. 98-126, provides: \u201cA person is guilty of a capital felony who is convicted of any of the following: (1) Murder of a member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Public Safety or of any local police department, a chief inspector or inspector in the Division of Criminal Justice, a sheriff or deputy sheriff, a constable who performs criminal law enforcement duties, a special policeman appointed under section 29-18, an employee of the Department of Correction or a person providing services on behalf of said department when such employee or person is acting within the scope of his employment or duties in a correctional institution or facility and the actor is confined in such institution or facility, or any fireman, while such victim was acting within the scope of his duties; (2) murder committed by a defendant who is hired to commit the same for pecuniary gain or murder committed by one who is hired by the defendant to commit the same for pecuniary gain; (3) murder committed by one who has previously been convicted of intentional murder or of murder committed in the course of commission of a felony; (4) murder committed by one who was, at the time of commission of the murder, under sentence of life imprisonment; (5) murder by a kidnapper of a kidnapped person during the course of the kidnapping or before such person is able to return or be returned to safety; (6) the illegal sale, for economic gain, of cocaine, heroin or methadone to a person who dies as a direct result of the use by him of such cocaine, heroin or methadone; (7) murder committed in the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree; <em>(8) murder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction-, </em>or (9) murder of a person under sixteen years of age.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Section 53a-54b subsequently has been amended, resulting in the elimination of then subdivision (6) relating to the death of a person as a result of the illegal sale of drugs.

In particular, it was noted that the multiple murder provision was included in direct response to the public outrage created following the 1979 murders that had occurred in Waterbury, during which three Purolator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Armored Car guards were ambushed in a garage and shot to death. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>218 Conn. 309, 589 A.2d 343 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>209 Conn. 564, 552 A.2d 805 (1989). The murders were not punishable by death under the capital punishment scheme in effect at that time. Thus, the legislature enacted \u00a7 53a-54b (8) in an effort to deter multiple murders by making such offenses death eligible. See 23 S. Proc., supra, pp. 2326-27, remarks of Senator Owens. This express purpose is better served by a construction of \u00a7 53a-54b (8) under which only one aggravated murder is required for the imposition of the death penalty than under one in which two aggravated murders would be required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b617-12\"> The state argues that Texas and Kansas also have such death penalty schemes.

Rather, Texas requires the sentencing authority to answer questions relating to the defendant\u2019s conduct and the likelihood of similar future conduct. See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 19.03 (a) (7) (A) and (B) (Vernon 1994); Tex. Grim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.071 (Vernon 2002).

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATN\">joins, dissenting. The majority\u2019s opinion is nothing short of breathtaking. The majority expressly abandons the plain meaning rule and fails to apply the rule of lenity in a death penalty case in which the majority states that the text of the statutory provision at issue favors the defendant\u2019s interpretation. Moreover, application of the tools of interpretation that the majority employs in reaching its conclusion leads to a flawed assessment of the rationality of the legislature\u2019s choices in drafting this state\u2019s death penalty statute. I believe, for reasons distinct from those offered by the majority, that the text of the statute at issue suggests that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute should be rejected. I am not convinced, however, that the statute is clear and unambiguous, which, under well established law, is constitutionally required if this court is to reject the defendant\u2019s interpretation. Finally, in my view, the majority\u2019s abandonment of the plain meaning rule in favor of an alternative and novel method of statutory interpretation represents an incorrect deviation from our traditional mode of statutory interpretation and an impermissible usurpation of the legislative function. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>First, as I describe in part I of this opinion, the majority\u2019s statutory interpretation is, in reality, a series of assertions about the purported irrationality of that which the majority perceives as the probable textual meaning of the statute, i.e., that the existence of the aggravating factor enumerated in General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) cannot be established under the circumstances of this case unless <em>both </em>murders are proven to be committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the majority holds that the statute\u2019s \u201ccontext and history\u201d reveal that the existence of the aggravating factor enumerated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) can be established upon proof that <em>one </em>of the murders was committed in a cruel manner. In my view, however, the majority\u2019s assertions regarding the statute\u2019s \u201ccontext and history\u201d are wholly unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Even more striking is the majority\u2019s failure to apply the rule of lenity. The rule of lenity, which embodies the fundamental constitutional principles of due process and the separation of powers; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 348, 92 S. Ct. 515, 30 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1971); provides that our death penalty statute should not be applied unless the legislature <em>\u201cexpressly </em>so intend[s].\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>238 Conn. 828, 832, 681 A.2d 944 (1996), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>212 Conn. 258, 268-69, 562 A.2d 1060 (1989). I cannot fathom how the majority can conclude that a statute, the plain meaning of which, according to the majority, <em>favors </em>the defendant\u2019s interpretation, nevertheless reveals an <em>express </em>legislative intent to impose the death penalty under the circumstances of this case. The majority\u2019s failure to adhere to the clear command of the rule of lenity under such circumstances is not only unprece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>dented, but startling, in view of the fact that this court expressly has concluded that the rule is \u201cespecially pertinent to a death penalty statute . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>supra, 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In contrast, as I describe in part II of this opinion, I would conclude that the text of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) strongly suggests that the state must prove that, under the totality of the circumstances, the offense, i.e., capital felony, as a <em>whole, </em>was committed in a cruel manner. In my view, an inquiry into whether the constituent parts of the capital felony\u2014in the present case, each of the two murders\u2014were committed in a cruel manner simply is unnecessary under our death penalty scheme. I also would conclude, however, that a reasonable doubt persists about the statute\u2019s meaning. Specifically, although I believe that, under \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4), the state need not prove that each murder was committed in a cruel manner in order to establish the existence of that aggravating factor, my belief is not the product of statutory language that is manifest. Therefore, I would uphold the trial court\u2019s application of the rule of lenity and hold that \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) requires the state to prove that each murder was committed in a cruel manner in order to establish the existence of that aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Finally, as I describe in part III of this opinion, I strongly disagree with the majority\u2019s unique approach to statutory interpretation. In particular, I believe that this court should continue to adhere to the plain meaning rule as it has, along with nearly every other court in this country, for the past 100 years. In my view, the problems inherent in the majority\u2019s alternative method of statutory interpretation could not be illustrated better than by the majority opinion itself. I conclude by offering an approach to statutory interpretation that I believe is more consistent with the fundamental role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>that the text of a statutory provision should play in statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">As the majority notes, the defendant argues that the aggravating factor at issue requires proof that \u201cthe defendant committed <em>the offense </em>in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4). Moreover, the majority states that \u201cthe likely referent of \u2018the offense\u2019 is the capital felony of which the defendant has been convicted . . . .\u2019\u2019In the present case, that offense is defined as the \u201cmurder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (8). Thus, the defendant argues that, because the offense enumerated in \u00a7 53a-54b (8) is the murder of two persons, \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) requires proof that both murders were committed in a cruel manner. The majority concludes that this is the most persuasive textual reading of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">1 would further note that the defendant\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the notion expressed in this state\u2019s appellate case law that the term \u201coffense\u201d refers to all, and not part, of the elements of the offense. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>69 Conn. App. 597, 795 A.2d 611, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 939, 802 A.2d 91 (2002), the Appellate Court recently noted that, \u201c[t]o sustain a conviction for conspiracy to commit a particular <em>offense, </em>the prosecution must show not only that the conspirators intended to agree but also [that] they intended to commit the <em>elements of the </em>offense.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Id., 607. Thus, the Appellate Court in <em>Miller </em>refers to the term \u201coffense\u201d and the phrase \u201celements of the offense\u201d as identical concepts. See id. That is, one cannot be convicted of conspiracy to commit an \u201coffense\u201d unless one conspires to commit the \u201celements of the offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Likewise, the text of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) reasonably can be construed to require the state to prove that \u201cthe defendant committed [all of the elements of] <em>the offense </em>in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Although the majority acknowledges that the text of the statute favors the defendant\u2019s interpretation over the state\u2019s contrary textual interpretation, the majority nevertheless concludes that the statute\u2019s \u201ccontext and history\u201d support the state\u2019s inteipretation. Unlike the defendant, who relies upon the similarity between the meaning of the word \u201coffense\u201d and the meaning of the phrase \u201celements of the offense\u201d in offering his construction of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4), the majority relies on the statute\u2019s context and history in construing that statutory provision to require proof only that \u201cthe defendant committed <em>[at least part of] </em>the offense in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4). Obviously, an interpretation of a statute that is based on the insertion of words that do not appear in its text should be rejected. This is all the more true in the present case in light of the unpersuasiveness of the reasons offered by the majority in support of its implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>judicial insertion. In my view, the \u201cfirst part of [its] analysis is nothing more than a truism. The second part merely sets up the proverbial straw man.\u201d <em>Sheff </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>238 Conn. 1, 94, 678 A.2d 1267 (1996) (Borden, <em>J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">First, the majority states that there are two \u201cconstituent parts\u201d to the capital offense at issue, namely, two murders. The majority then goes on to conclude that this fact \u201cpermits the interpretation that the aggravating factor [enumerated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4)] may be satisfied by proof of its existence with respect to at least <em>one </em>of those constituent parts.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In my view, this circular logic does nothing more than merely assume the majority\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The second rationale that the majority provides is more elaborate but, I believe, no more persuasive. The majority\u2019s construction of the statute at issue rests upon its analysis of the application of the aggravating factor enumerated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) to another capital offense, namely, murder in the course of a kidnapping. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (5). The majority concludes that when the legislature adopted the death penalty statute in 1973, it did <em>not </em>require the state to prove, in the context of a kidnap-murder, that both the kidnapping and the murder were committed in a cruel manner in order to establish the existence of the \u201ccruel\u201d aggravating factor. The majority reaches this important conclusion, which forms the entire underpinning of its theory, first, by explaining that when a capital felony involves only one underlying offense, e.g., murder for hire pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54b (2), the state need only prove that the <em>one </em>murder was committed in a cruel manner. The majority further states that if the defendant\u2019s interpretation were accepted, when a capital felony involves two underlying offenses, e.g., kidnapping and murder, the state would be required to prove that <em>both </em>offenses were committed in a cruel manner. In contemplating this result, the majority states that it \u201ccan conceive of no rationale for the legislature to have set a higher bar to the imposition of the death penalty when the underlying capital felony involve [s], not one, but two underlying serious felonies, namely, kidnapping and murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">I see nothing irrational about a reading of the statute that would require proof of the existence of an aggravating factor as to all of the potentially applicable constituent parts of the offense. When a defendant is charged with two crimes and one crime has one element and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the second crime has two elements, all things being equal, it will be harder for the state to prove the crime having two elements than the crime having one. This does not mean that the classification lacks a rationale, however. It simply means that the legislature intended to require proof of both elements of the crime before the defendant can be found guilty. Likewise, in determining the application of the aggravating factor enumerated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) to each of the capital offenses enumerated in \u00a7 53a-54b, it would not be irrational to conclude that the legislature required that, for each potential constituent part, the fact finder determine whether the defendant carried out the proscribed act in a cruel manner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Moreover, neither the text of the statute nor any a priori reasoning can reveal the degree of comparative moral abhorrence that the legislature attributed to a kidnap-murder as opposed to a murder for hire. The mere fact that a particular capital offense consists of two underlying felonies does not, in my view, necessarily suggest that the legislature believed that it should be just as easy to impose the death penalty for that capital offense as it is for another capital offense that the legislature had deemed abhorrent on the basis of the nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct or the status of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Having suggested this purported irrationality, the majority continues its analysis by stating that it makes little sense to think that, in 1980, when the legislature added multiple murders in the course of a single transaction to the list of capital felonies, it intended to change the manner in which the aggravating factor of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) operates. The majority states that it can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>conceive of no reason why the <em>legislature </em>would have intended to require proof of the existence of an aggravating factor only as to one of the constituent parts of the capital felony of kidnap-murder, but require proof of the existence of an aggravating factor as to both of the constituent parts of the capital felony of multiple murders committed in the course of a single transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Although I acknowledge that it might be unusual for the aggravating factor enumerated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) to operate in this fashion, one obvious rationale for such an interpretation of the two statutes would be that the legislature did not deem multiple murders to be as morally abhorrent as a murder in the course of a kidnapping. In my view, not only is there nothing irrational about such amoral determination, but the legislative genealogy upon which the majority relies strongly suggests that the legislature did make such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">As the majority acknowledges, the legislature designated kidnap-murder as a capital offense in 1973 but \u201cmade the policy choice not to include multiple murders within the definition of capital felony [at that time].\u201d Footnote 12 of the majority opinion. The legislature did not make multiple murder a capital felony until 1980. Moreover, in 1980, notwithstanding the existing designation of kidnap-murder as a capital felony, several legislators expressed doubts about whether the moral abhorrence of multiple murders justified its classification as a capital felony. See, e.g., 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1980 Sess., p. 5678, remarks of Representative Naomi W. Ottemess (\u201cI feel that when you are talking about one murder, two murders ad infinitum, what\u2019s the difference? Why is it now, that we have to say, when you have a murder of more than one person that it becomes a capital felony?\u201d); id., p. 5679, remarks of Representative Paul Gionfriddo (\u201cI don\u2019t believe that there is any qualitative difference between the murder of one person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>and the murder of two people\u201d); id., pp. 5680-81, remarks of Representative Rosalind Berman (questioning need to distinguish between status of multiple murders and \u201croutine\u201d or single murders). Thus, the majority need not look any farther than the legislative history of \u00a7 53a-54b to find evidence of a possible rationale for why the legislature might have chosen to require, in the context of a multiple murder capital felony, proof that each murder had been committed in a cruel manner, even if it is assumed that, in 1973, the legislature intended to require proof only that the murder was committed in a cruel manner in order to establish the existence of the \u201ccruel\u201d aggravating factor in the context of kidnap-murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">There is, however, an even more fundamental problem with the majority\u2019s reasoning, namely, that the majority\u2019s hypothetical rests entirely upon the <em>majority\u2019s </em>previous conclusion that, with regard to kidnap-murder, the state can establish the existence of the aggravating factor merely by proving that the murder was committed in a cruel manner. Obviously, the <em>legislature </em>did not have the benefit of the majority opinion in 1980 when it designated multiple murders as a capital felony. Thus, it makes no sense to rely upon what the majority labels a \u201cperverse result\u201d that derives from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>alternate interpretation of the statute when that result is premised entirely on an interpretation of the statute that the majority, itself, not the legislature, presents for the first time in its opinion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Moreover, as I noted previously, the legislative genealogy of \u00a7 53a-54b reveals that the majority\u2019s conclusions about the rationality of various schemes of deterrence are unsupported. The majority concludes that \u201c[a] capital felon who murder[s] two persons in the course of a single transaction must be regarded, <em>under any rational system of deterrence and moral hierarchy, as </em>... <em>at least equally morally blameworthy </em>to one who murders and either kidnaps or sexually assaults only one victim in the course of a single transaction. We cannot conceive of any legislative rationale pursuant to which the legislature would have intended, when it added multiple murder to the definition of capital felony, to set a higher bar to the imposition of the death penalty on multiple murder in a single transaction than it would have for murder-kidnap or murder-sexual assault in a single transaction. \u201d (Emphasis added.) Prior to 1980, however, the bar not only was higher for the former, but the legislature apparently did <em>not </em>regard a defendant who murdered two persons in the course of a single transaction as morally blameworthy as a defendant who murdered and kidnapped only one person in the course of a single transaction. Prior to 1980, a double murder, in the absence of other circumstances, could <em>not </em>result in the imposition of the death penalty whereas a kidnap-murder could. See, e.g., General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 53a-54b. Thus, the majority\u2019s logic is inexplicable, for the system of deterrence that the legislature adopted in 1973 is exactly the system that the majority now suggests is irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">This incongruity reveals the unsoundness of the majority\u2019s reliance upon its own notions as to the legislature\u2019s rationale behind the death penalty statute. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>majority contends that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) must be incorrect inasmuch as there is no basis for finding that the legislature would have enacted a statute that is consistent with the interpretation advanced by the defendant. Yet, the death penalty statutory scheme that the legislature established in 1973, which designated Mdnap-murder as a capital felony but not multiple murders in the course of a single transaction; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-54b; is the very system of deterrence that the majority\u2019s analysis suggests is <em>irrational. </em>Thus, it is implicit in the majority\u2019s analysis both that: (1) the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) must be rejected because <em>it would have been irrational </em>for the legislature to have enacted such a statute; and (2) in 1973, the legislature enacted a death penalty statutory scheme that <em>is irrational. </em>This makes no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The majority\u2019s response to this critique only further proves this point. The majority chides the dissent for \u201cmisconstru[ing] [its] reasoning,\u201d noting that any question regarding the rationality of the 1973 statute is not before this court. Footnote 12 of the majority opinion. I never have suggested that it is. On the contrary, what I have maintained as inexplicable is that, in one part of its analysis, the majority states that the defendant\u2019s interpretation must be rejected because, if it were applied to the death penalty statute, as enacted in 1973, it would lead to a purportedly irrational result. Specifically, the purportedly irrational result with which the majority is concerned is that it would be harder to establish the existence of the \u201ccruel\u201d aggravating factor in connection with kidnap-murder than in connection with murder for hire. Yet, the very next part of the majority\u2019s analysis assumes that the death penalty statute, as enacted in 1973, was irrational because it designated kidnap-murder, but not multiple murders, as a capital felony. I do not see how the defendant\u2019s interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tation can be rejected on the ground that it supposedly suggests that the legislature enacted an irrational statute in light of the fact that the majority\u2019s own reasoning leads to the same conclusion. The majority never explains this paradoxical logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">I also would note that, in responding to the dissent\u2019s critique, the majority simply elucidates its straw man technique further by stating that the question before the court is \u201cwhether, when [the legislature] did decide to include multiple murders in the capital felony scheme in 1980, [it] intended for the state to have a heavier burden with respect to the aggravating factor as applied to that crime than every other offense, including kidnap-murder, already included in that scheme.\u201d Footnote 12 of the majority opinion. Of course, as I previously noted, that is the question before this court <em>only </em>if it is assumed that the legislature intended, in the context of a kidnap-murder, to make proof of the existence of the aggravating factor enumerated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) dependent on whether the defendant committed the murder but not the kidnapping in a cruel manner. It is the <em>majority, </em>not the <em>legislature, </em>that has reached such a conclusion. The transparency of the majority\u2019s analysis is all too apparent owing to the fact that the majority provides <em>no </em>response to the dissent\u2019s criticism of the majority\u2019s critical misapplication of the aggravating factor of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) to the capital felony of kidnap-murder, upon which the majority\u2019s opinion rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Even more distressing is the majority\u2019s rejection of the rule of lenity under the circumstances of the present case. The majority\u2019s rejection of this important rule is indefensible, especially in light of the fact that the majority\u2019s statutory interpretation rests on little more than its thrice stated confidence in its ability to discern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the irrationality of various possible death penalty schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">As the majority acknowledges, the rule of lenity applies whenever there is a reasonable doubt as to the scope of a statute. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>261 Conn. 111, 120, 802 A.2d 754 (2002). Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion that the rule of lenity is to be applied \u201clike all . . . axioms of construction,\u201d however, the United States Supreme Court repeatedly has held that the rule is <em>\u201cnot </em>merely a convenient maxim of statutoiy construction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>442 U.S. 100, 112, 99 S. Ct. 2190, 60 L. Ed. 2d 743 (1979). As the United States Supreme Court consistently has reaffirmed, the rule of lenity is rooted in principles of due process and the separation of powers. E.g., id. (rule is rooted in fundamental principles of due process); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>supra, 404 U.S. 348 (twin rationales of rule of lenity are \u201c \u2018fair warning\u2019 \u201d and that \u201clegislatures and not courts should define criminal activity\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, </em>18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (\u201cThe rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly ... is perhaps not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals . . . and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In view of the majority\u2019s willingness to dispense with even the most bedrock principles of statutory interpretation; see part II of the majority opinion; its disregard of \u201cthe constitutional undeipinnings of lenity\u201d is of even greater consequence. Note, \u201cThe Mercy of Scalia: Statutory Construction and the Rule of Lenity,\u201d 29 Harv. C.R.C.L. L. Rev. 197, 202 (1994); cf. <em>Lurie </em>v. <em>Wittner, </em>228 F.3d 113, 123 n.4 (2d Cir. 2000) (rejecting government\u2019s claim that \u201crule of lenity is a statutory presumption lacking a constitutional dimension\u201d inasmuch as rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>protects defendant\u2019s constitutional right to fair warning).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In the present case, the majority\u2019s acknowledgment that the defendant has the better textual argument dictates the conclusion that there is, at the very least, a reasonable doubt as to the interpretation of the statute. Indeed, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 828, this court emphasized that a criminal statute should not be applied so as to impose criminal liability unless the legislature has <em>\u201cexpressly </em>so intended.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 832; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 268-69. I do not see how the majority possibly could reach such a conclusion in light of its determination that the <em>defendant </em>has the better textual argument. Apparently, neither does the majority; rather than attempting to distinguish this language in <em>Harrell, </em>the majority simply ignores <em>Harrell\u2019s </em>requirement of an <em>express </em>legislative intent. Furthermore, for the first time, this court, unlike any other court of which I am aware, holds that, although a review of the plain text of the statute <em>favors </em>the defendant\u2019s interpretation, other tools of statutory interpretation remove all reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s interpretation is erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In my view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>such a holding relegates the constitutionality mandated rule of lenity to a judicial nicety.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The majority\u2019s unprecedented conclusion is even more startling in view of the fact that this court has stated that \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that any statutory construction implicating the death penalty must be based on a conclusion that the legislature has clearly and unambiguously made its intention known. . . . The rules of strict construction and lenity applicable to penal statutes generally are especially pertinent to a death penalty statute such as \u00a7 53a-54b.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 833. In my view, it is manifestly unjust for the majority to interpret the death penalty statute so as to subject the defendant to the death penalty upon proof that one of the murders in the present case was committed in a cruel manner, while also stating that the text of the statute suggests that proof that both murders were committed in a cruel manner is required. This is particularly so when the majority fails to provide any persuasive reason justifying such an interpretation, much less offer an interpretation that establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislature <em>expressly </em>intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Finally, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, I do not conclude that the rule of lenity applies \u201cin every case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>in which the defendant [is] able to muster a plausible, albeit erroneous, interpretation of a criminal statute.\u201d Footnote 15 of the majority opinion. Likewise, I reject the majority\u2019s characterization of my dissent as suggesting that the rule of lenity applies whenever a \u201cdefendant\u2019s interpretation appears to be plausible.\u201d Id. Rather, I am simply unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt, as our law requires; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 120; that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute is, in fact, erroneous. Had the majority properly applied the rule of lenity, it would have reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Instead of reaching this conclusion, however, the majority employs its familiar straw man technique and suggests that my application of the rule of lenity would dictate that defendants in criminal cases with statutory interpretation claims almost always prevail. On the contrary, this court long has employed the reasonable doubt formulation, as I do in this opinion, and only rarely has it concluded that the rule applied. That is because, contrary to the majority\u2019s belief that nearly all cases of statutory interpretation give rise to arguments that raise a reasonable doubt as to a statute\u2019s application, a view engendered by its relativistic method of statutory interpretation; see part III of this opinion; this court and other courts routinely reject arguments that fail to raise such a doubt. When, however, as in the present case, a defendant has a strong textual argument\u2014indeed, in the majority\u2019s view, the <em>strongest </em>textual argument\u2014it is clear that the rule of lenity applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In contrast to the majority\u2019s determination that the defendant has a strong textual argument, I believe that the text of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) does not require the state to prove the existence of the aggravating factor as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>each individual constituent part, in the present case, each individual murder. I also would conclude, however, that, after inteipreting the statute, a reasonable doubt persists about whether the legislature expressly intended that the death penalty be imposed under the circumstances of the present case. Therefore, I would uphold the trial court\u2019s application of the rule of lenity and require that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt that both murders were committed in a cruel manner in order to satisfy its burden of establishing the existence of the aggravating factor enumerated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">As I noted previously, the state satisfies its burden of establishing the existence of the aggravating factor enumerated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) when it proves that \u201cthe defendant committed <em>the offense </em>in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4). I conclude that the italicized term, \u201cthe offense,\u201d refers to the capital offense or, in other words, the crime of capital felony. See generally General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b. In the present case, the particular capital felony with which the defendant was charged is the \u201cmurder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In my view, the text of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) does not suggest that the state must prove, in the context of multiple murders, that both murders were committed in a cruel manner in order to satisfy its burden of establishing the existence of the aggravating factor, as the defendant argues. I also reject the majority\u2019s conclusion that the sentencer should determine if either of the two murders was committed in a cruel manner and return a verdict in favor of the death penalty if it determines that one was committed in a cruel manner. Rather, I believe that the statute requires the state to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the offense, as a whole, was committed in a cruel manner. In other words, I believe that the statute requires the sentencer to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense. I do not believe that the statute requires the sentencer to focus its analysis on a determination of whether each constituent part of the offense was committed in a cruel manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Our death penalty case law is consistent with my interpretation of the statute. I begin by acknowledging that this court expressly reserved the issue presented in the present case in <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>235 Conn. 206, 220 n.15, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995). This court never has tied aggravating factors to the particular constituent parts of a capital felony in any of this court\u2019s many previous death penalty cases. See generally, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>253 Conn. 1, 751 A.2d 298 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">On the contrary, this court\u2019s analysis has focused on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the offense in determining whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the aggravating factor of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) had been adequately established. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 285, this court noted that \u201c[t]he evidence supports the determination that the victim experienced extreme psychological and physical pain and suffering <em>throughout this entire </em>episode.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 449. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 389, this court noted that, \u201c[p]rior to her death, [the victim] <em>experienced a prolonged abduction </em>during which she was held at gunpoint while the defendant drove, for approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>twelve minutes, to a park nearly four miles away from the point of abduction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 486. In neither case did the court ask whether the \u201ccruel\u201d aggravating factor was applicable to each constituent part of the capital felony at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Likewise, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 183, this court stated that \u201cthe jury received evidence about the effect of the kidnapping as an aggravating factor for the capital felony count predicated on a sexual assault, and evidence about the effect of the sexual assault as an aggravating factor for the capital felony count predicated on a continuing kidnapping.\u201d Id., 264. In <em>Ross, </em>this court did <em>not </em>indicate whether the kidnapping aggravated the sexual assault or the murder component of the sexual assault-murder capital felony. Similarly, the court did <em>not </em>indicate whether the sexual assault aggravated the kidnapping or the murder component of the Mdnap-murder capital felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Finally, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 1, the court expressly acknowledged that, \u201c[although there are cases in which a near instantaneous death by gunfire could satisfy the . . . aggravating factor [enumerated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4)], typically such cases have involved extreme fear, emotional strain and terror <em>during the events leading up to the murder.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 74r-75. In other words, in such a case, the act of murdering the victim, itself, is <em>not </em>committed in a cruel manner.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nevertheless, what this court was suggesting in <em>Johnson </em>is that, in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense in such a hypothetical case, we <em>would </em>conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>defendant committed such an offense in a cruel manner. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Such analysis makes perfect sense to me. If a defendant kidnaps and brutally tortures someone and then kills that person, is that a cruel <em>kidnapping </em>or a cruel murder? More importantly, does the statutory scheme require that the sentencer make such a determination? In my view, there is nothing in the text of the statute that suggests that such an inquiry is necessary. On the contrary, I believe that the statutory scheme simply requires that, when a person kidnaps and brutally tortures the victim and then kills the victim, the question for the sentencer is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the offense, considered as a whole, was committed in a cruel manner. Likewise, when two murders are involved, as in the present case, the question is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the offense, considered as a whole, was committed in a cruel manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">I also note that this court repeatedly has held that the legislature is presumed to know how to draft a statute to reach a particular result. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 684, 735 A.2d 267 (1999) (\u201cif the legislature had sought to distinguish between the different degrees of kidnapping for purposes of \u00a7 53a-54b [5], it knew how to do so\u201d). Indeed, the legislature expressly could have required the state to prove that a capital felon committed <em>all of the constituent parts </em>of the offense in a cruel manner, as the defendant would have us construe the statute. Conversely, the legislature expressly could have required that the state merely prove that the defendant committed <em>at least part of </em>the offense in a cruel manner, as the majority concludes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The legislature chose neither option. Instead, it required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the state to prove that the defendant committed <em>\u201cthe offense\u201d </em>in a cruel manner. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4). Consequently, the text of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) should not be interpreted as either the defendant or the majority suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Although I would conclude that the text of the statute strongly supports my conclusion,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> I am unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt, as our law requires; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 120; that the defendant misconstrues the scope of the statute. Indeed, the fact that neither the majority nor the state, the trial court, or the defendant has construed the statute in the way that I believe the text warrants, strengthens my ultimate conclusion that the rule of lenity should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Therefore, I would conclude, as this court did in <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 828, that \u201c[w]hen, as in th[e] [present] case, the imposition of the death penalty is the possible consequence of our decision, we must not toy with competing, plausible interpretations of a statutory penal scheme.\u201d Id., 838. Accordingly, I would uphold the trial court\u2019s application of the rule of lenity under the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">I also strongly disagree with the majority\u2019s approach to statutory interpretation and its abandonment of the plain meaning rule. In my view, the majority\u2019s opinion is an exemplar of the problems engendered by such an approach. I propose an alternative approach that builds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>upon the plain meaning rule and describes the manner in which I apply the various tools of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The majority\u2019s method of statutory interpretation is radical, its central premise is misguided, and its application is likely to lead to an unpredictable and unconstrained statutory interpretation jurisprudence. I discuss each of these conclusions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">As the majority acknowledges, its approach to statutory interpretation \u201chas not been adopted in the same specific formulation by <em>any </em>other court in the nation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Footnote 19 of the majority opinion. I think for good reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">My most fundamental disagreement with the majority\u2019s approach to statutory interpretation is its heavy reliance upon unexpressed statutory purposes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such reliance is particularly inappropriate when a statute\u2019s text is plain and unambiguous. Indeed, even proponents of the purposive approach to statutory interpretation that the majority embraces acknowledge that nontextual sources should be resorted to only when a statute is <em>unclear. </em>See, e.g., S. Breyer, \u201cOn the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes,\u201d 65 S. Cal. L. Rev. 845, 848 (1992) (legislative history is useful in interpreting <em>unclear </em>statutes). Thus, the majority\u2019s contention that a statute\u2019s unenumerated purpose can trump statutory language that is plain and unambiguous is truly beyond the pale. I am particularly troubled by such an approach because I agree with John M. Walker, Jr., the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, who recently assessed the lack of usefulness of the purposive method of statutory interpretation: \u201c[A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>legislative] purpose, whether derived from legislative history, the entirety of the statute, the mischief at which the statute is aimed, or the judge\u2019s imagination, is normally of such generality as to be useless as an interpretative tool, unless, of course, it is being used as a cover for the judge to \u2018do justice\u2019 as he sees fit.\u201d J. Walker, Jr., \u201cJudicial Tendencies in Statutory Construction: Differing Views on the Role of the Judge,\u201d 58 N.Y.U. Ann. Surv. Am. L. 203, 236 (2001).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Indeed, I think that it is highly questionable whether it is epistemologically possible for legislation to reflect any single underlying purpose. In my view, notions of extratextual legislative intent or purpose are devoid of meaning because a \u201cgroup may act (for example, by enacting a statute), but it is a mistake to attribute a collective intention to its action.\u201d B. Karkkainen, \u201c \u2018Plain Meaning\u2019: Justice Scalia\u2019s Jurisprudence of Strict Statutory Construction,\u201d 17 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Policy 401, 415-16 (1994). In other words, \u201c[ijndividuals may have mental states, but groups do not.\u201d Id., 415; see also M. Radin, \u201cStatutory Interpretation,\u201d 43 Harv. L. Rev. 863, 870 (1930) (it is \u201ctransparent and absurd fiction\u201d to attribute collective intent to entire legislative body).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Moreover, as defenders of the purposive method of statutory interpretation have acknowledged, even if it were theoretically possible to uncover a statute\u2019s purpose with sufficient specificity to guide the interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>tive process of the particular issue before the court, public choice theory presents a \u201csubstantial\u201d critique of such a method. S. Breyer, supra, 65 S. Cal. L. Rev. 866. Such a theory teaches that legislation is the product of bargaining between various interest groups rather than an underlying common will or purpose among legislators. Id. Thus, the theoiy suggests, as an empirical matter, that statutes will rarely have a single purpose that can guide interpretation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Finally, beyond properly stating that \u201cthe language of the statute is the most important factor to be considered,\u201d the majority, in introducing its new approach to statutory interpretation, fails to provide any guidance as to the significance that should be attached to the other interpretative tools that its approach encompasses. Instead, the majority\u2019s approach envisions the interpretation of statutes on a case-by-case basis, whereby the judicial authority can pick and choose from among various tools of interpretation to construct a meaning that might reflect a reasoned judgment. In contrast, I believe that an explanation of the relative usefulness of the various tools of statutory interpretation is of vital importance in providing litigants, judges, legislators and the public with clear guidance and notice as to how the statutes of this state will be interpreted in future cases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">As problematic as the majority\u2019s approach to statutory interpretation is in a case in which a statute is ambiguous, the majority\u2019s representation that it will apply such an approach even when a statute\u2019s text is clear is even more problematic. In other words, I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>in sharp philosophical disagreement with the majority\u2019s express abandonment of the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">As a preliminary matter, it is important to note that, in stating that when the plain meaning rule is applied, a court is <em>\u201cprecluded as a matter of law\u201d </em>from inquiring beyond the text of a statute; (emphasis in original); the majority suggests that the plain meaning rule is a rule of law. It is well established, however, that \u201cthe plain-meaning rule is rather an axiom of experience than a rule of law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Public Citizen </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice, </em>491 U.S. 440, 455, 109 S. Ct. 2558, 105 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1989). Thus, the rule, as well as the majority\u2019s rejection of the rule, is one of judicial <em>philosophy, </em>not one of <em>substantive law. </em>Accordingly, it follows that part II of the majority opinion, in which the majority expresses the judicial philosophy of five members of this court, does not describe the manner in which I will interpret statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The majority essentially outlines the plain meaning rule in a manner that is consistent with the way in which I view the rule. There is, however, one important statement that the majority makes in describing the rule with which I take issue. The majority maintains that, under the plain meaning rule, as well as the majority\u2019s own approach to statutory interpretation, \u201cthe task of the court is to ascertain <em>the intent of the legislature </em>in using the language that it chose to use, so as to determine [the] meaning [of that language] in the context of the case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plain meaning rule, however, is premised on the idea that we are governed by what the legislature actually said as opposed to that which it intended to say. Thus, while the majority\u2019s approach strives to uncover <em>subjective legislative intent, </em>the plain meaning rule searches for a statute\u2019s <em>objective textual meaning.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>With that clarification, I agree with the majority that the plain meaning rule dictates that, if the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, and if a construction based on the plain and unambiguous language of the statute does not yield an absurd result, then the court should end its inquiry there. In my view, the majority\u2019s disavowal of this rule is unwarranted and problematic for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">First, it bears emphasizing that the majority essentially declares that a method of statutory construction used by this court in literally hundreds of cases over the past century, including very recent cases, was incorrect. See, e.g., <em>MacDermid, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>257 Conn. 128, 154, 778 A.2d 7 (2001); <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>240 Conn. 58, 74, 689 A.2d 1097 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Springer, </em>149 Conn. 244, 248, 178 A.2d 525 (1962); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>135 Conn. 120, 124, 61 A.2d 684 (1948); <em>Lee Bros. Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Cram, </em>63 Conn. 433, 438, 28 A. 541 (1893).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We were not alone. As the author of a leading treatise on statutory interpretation has explained, the plain meaning rule is \u201c[a] basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>insight about the process of communication . . . given classic expression by the Supreme Court of the United States . . . .\u201d 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (6th Ed. Singer 2000) \u00a7 46.01, p. 113.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Similarly, afederal circuit court of appeals recently referred to this principle of statutory interpretation as \u201ctoo elementary to require a citation . . . .\u201d <em>Cline </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 466, 467 (6th Cir. 2002). The rule\u2019s doctrinal pedigree is, indeed, impressive. The principle upon which the rule is premised can be traced at least as far back as Blackstone. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765) pp. 59-62. One commentator has noted that the United States Supreme Court first articulated the rule as early as 1928 in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co., </em>278 U.S. 269, 278, 49 S. Ct. 133, 73 L. Ed. 322 (1929). B. Karkkainen, supra, 17 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Policy 433. The United States Supreme Court continues to rely on the rule in construing federal statutes. E.g., <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Sigmon Coal Co., </em>534 U.S. 438, 450, 122 S. Ct. 941, 151 L. Ed. 2d 908 (2002). Indeed, an <em>overwhelming </em>majority of federal and state courts adhere to the plain meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>rule. 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 46.01, pp. 113-15 n.l (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Moreover, as an empirical matter, it is not unusual for a court to find that the text of a statute is plain and unambiguous. See, e.g., W. Eskeridge, Jr., \u201cThe New Textuaiism,\u201d 37 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 621, 656 (1990) (\u201cthe [United States] Supreme Court has decided almost half of its statutory interpretation cases by reference to a statute\u2019s plain meaning in each of the last three [t]erms\u201d). Thus, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s suggestion that there is \u201creally nothing startlingly new about\u201d its approach to statutory interpretation, the majority\u2019s rejection of the plain meaning rule renders this court an outlier among nearly all other federal and state courts in this country and, indeed, with respect to this court\u2019s jurisprudence for the last 100 years, on an issue of great importance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This <em>is </em>a startling, and in my view, unjustified, course for the majority to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Furthermore, not only has the plain meaning rule long been a bedrock principle of statutory interpretation in both this state and throughout the country, but the majority has failed to provide any evidence that the plain meaning rule has impeded this court\u2019s interpretative process. Indeed, no party in this case, nor in any other case of which I am aware, has ever even asked this court to abandon the plain meaning rule. Instead, the majority\u2019s departure from the legal mainstream comes solely as a result of its philosophical bent, one that I am confident will some day prove to be as unsound as it is rare.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The majority\u2019s abandonment of the plain meaning rule is unjustified for three related reasons. Most importantly, the plain meaning rule is premised on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>fact that only the text of a statute formally has been approved by the legislature and signed into law by the executive. The aspirations of legislators as expressed in the legislative history or this court\u2019s notions concerning the rationality of various legislative schemes have not. Thus, through its application of plain and unambiguous language, the rule gives effect to \u201cthe essence of the famous American ideal ... [a] government of laws, not of men.\u201d A. Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law (A. Gutmann ed., 1997) p. 17. Accordingly, it is the objective meaning of a statute\u2019s text that should govern rather than the legislature\u2019s subjective intent in choosing that text. See, e.g., O. Holmes, \u201cThe Theory of Legal Inteipretation,\u201d 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 419 (1899) (\u201c[w]e do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In light of the majority\u2019s new approach to statutory construction, individuals no longer can rely on the plain meaning of the laws of this state in conducting their affairs. Instead, they will be forced to rely on this court\u2019s ex post facto use of extratextual sources to discern the scope of a statute. I agree with United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s eloquent expression regarding the essential unfairness of such a system: \u201cI think . . . that it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawgiver promulgated. That seems to me one step worse than the trick the emperor Nero was said to engage in: posting edicts high up on the pillars, so that they could not easily be read. Government by unexpressed intent is similarly tyrannical.\u201d A. Scalia, supra, p. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The present case aptly illustrates Justice Scalia\u2019s concerns. In essence, the majority rejects the defendant\u2019s interpretation because it concludes that the legislature meant something different than what is conveyed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the text the legislature used in the statute. My concerns are heightened more so in <em>the present case </em>in light of the fact that, until today, this court, for more than 100 years, consistently has followed the plain meaning rule. That is to say nothing of the fact that the use of extratextual sources that the majority refers to in its opinion justifying deviation from this supposed plain meaning is, as I describe in part I of this opinion, unpersuasive and, by definition, insufficient to demonstrate an <em>express </em>legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The plain meaning rule encourages both judicial restraint and predictability in interpretation. See J. Walker, Jr., supra, 58 N.Y.U. Ann. Surv. Am. L. 238. Indeed, a court\u2019s disregard of the plain meaning of a legislature\u2019s enactments amounts to little more than judicial lawmaking. Such judicial lawmaking constitutes an arrogation of the legislature\u2019s constitutional responsibility to enact laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s abandonment of the plain meaning rule and its adoption of the alternative purposive approach to statutory interpretation pays little heed to this fundamental principle of the separation of powers. In applying the majority\u2019s approach, a judge will ask himself for what purpose was the statute enacted. In answering this question, a judge likely will ask what purpose a wise and intelligent lawmaker would have attached to the statute. The judge then will ask himself what he, who, after all, also is wise and intelligent, believes the law\u2019s purpose is. Id., 223. In so doing, the judge will assume the role of law giver and substitute judicially ascribed notions of the statute\u2019s purpose for the plain meaning of the text that the legislature has chosen. See id. This is precisely what the majority transparently has done in the present case. Indeed, each step in the majority\u2019s analysis begins with a statement such as, \u201c[w]e can conceive of no rationale for the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ture\u201d to have enacted a statute that differs in interpretation from that proposed by the majority.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Conversely, the incentive for legislators to write clear statutes and for interest groups to prevail in getting their views enacted into law takes on a diminished importance if it is made known to them that this court will not limit itself to the plain meaning of the law but, rather, will decide cases on the basis of the unenacted purposes behind a law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By contrast, the plain meaning rule encourages legislators to \u201cfulfill their constitutional responsibility to legislate by disabusing them of the expectation that the courts will do it for them.\u201d J. Walker, Jr., supra, 58 N.Y.U. Ann. Surv. Am. L. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The majority offers three criticisms of the plain meaning rule, which, according to the majority, provide justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>fication for its rejection of the rule. I find the majority\u2019s criticisms unpersuasive. First, the majority states that \u201cthe rule is fundamentally inconsistent with the purposive and contextual nature of legislative language.\u201d Therefore, the majority states, \u201cit <em>does </em>matter what meaning the legislature intended [statutory] language to have.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Yet, the mere fact that the legislature <em>may </em>have had a purpose in enacting a statute does not mean that we should give <em>effect </em>to such an unenumerated purpose. In construing statutes, I believe that a court should not be governed by such <em>unstated purposes </em>but, rather, by what the legislature actually enacted into <em>law. </em>Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s proposition that, simply because legislation may have a purpose, that purpose is relevant to a court\u2019s construction of that legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Second, the majority asserts that \u201cthe plain meaning rule is inherently self-contradictory.\u201d In support of its assertion, the majority questions the validity of the frequently heard refrain that, \u201cif the language is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for interpretation . . . .\u201d The majority states that, in such a case, there is interpretation and that, even though interpretation may be a \u201csimple matter\u201d under such circumstances, interpretation still exists. Without disagreeing with the majority, I do not see what difference this makes. Whether we label it \u201cinterpretation,\u201d \u201capplication of the plain meaning rule,\u201d or \u201ca merry dance,\u201d I simply do not see this as a reason to reject the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The majority\u2019s other contention in this regard, namely, that the \u201cabsurdity\u201d exception to the plain meaning rule somehow suggests that the rule\u2019s true goal is to reveal legislative intent, also is misguided. An absurd statute, like an ambiguous statute, causes an objective interpreter to inquire further into its meaning. Thus, the determination of a provision\u2019s plain meaning should not end a court\u2019s inquiry under such circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>stances, not because the rule is concerned with uncovering what the legislature intended, but because a reasonable person would not believe that the law is what it appears to be on its face.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Third, the majority contends that the rule has spawned a body of inconsistent law regarding whether a plain meaning can be found and that such inconsistencies leave this court vulnerable to criticism for what may be perceived as a result oriented work product. Yet, it seems entirely unfair to cite to misguided <em>deviations </em>from the plain meaning rule as a reason not to <em>follow </em>the rule. In my view, many of the \u201cintellectually and linguistically dubious\u201d decisions to which the majority cites are examples of why this court should follow the plain meaning rule more closely, not why this court should abandon the rule. See, e.g., <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 664-65, 680 A.2d 242 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 744-45, 613 A.2d 804 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In fact, the dissenting justice in <em>Cain </em>made just this point: \u201cThe application of Connecticut\u2019s rules of construction has become exceedingly complex and unpredictable. This is due, in part, to the fact that the rule prohibiting a court from looking behind the plain and unambiguous language of an act has become blurred to the point where the court will often look beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>that language without first deciding the threshold issue of whether an ambiguity exists. . . . Thus, one can never be certain, no matter how clear and unambiguous the language of an act may be, that the court will not look beyond that language and interpret it in a manner contrary to its literal meaning. . . . Where these rules are employed with respect to an unambiguous statute, the likelihood of an erroneous interpretation is significantly increased.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 756 n.3 <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting), quoting R. Williams, \u201cStatutory Construction in Connecticut: An Overview and Analysis,\u201d 62 Conn. B.J. 307, 343 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Moreover, even if one accepts the premise that it is difficult to craft a plain meaning rule that fosters consistency in statutory interpretation, the debate the rule engenders with respect to the validity of textual arguments is one of the most important reasons justifying adherence to the rule. In other words, I believe that the plain meaning rule\u2019s ubiquity in our legal landscape is due in no small measure to the fact that it emphasizes the primacy of the text by advising litigants, legislators and judges that the best textual argument is likely to be the argument that prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">I also strongly disagree with the majority\u2019s proposition that adherence to the plain meaning rule leaves this court vulnerable to criticism of being \u201cresult-oriented.\u201d On the contrary, it is the majority\u2019s case-by-case approach to statutory interpretation that is subject to such criticism inasmuch as it encourages as a virtue unfettered discretion in utilizing the various tools of statutory construction. Such an approach expands the judiciary\u2019s power to the detriment of the legislature by allowing courts to depart from the plain meaning of the law under the guise of interpretation. Indeed, the majority\u2019s nebulous relativistic approach, under which all factors are considered, and under which no factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>aside from the text is taken as a priori more informative than any other, virtually guarantees that there will be <em>some </em>evidence for nearly <em>any </em>interpretation that a court may wish to advance. As Justice Scalia has noted in paraphrasing Judge Harold Leventhal\u2019s statements about the expanded use of just one of the many tools that the majority embraces today: \u201c[T]he trick is to look over the heads of the crowd and pick out your friends. The variety and specificity of result that [the majority\u2019s approach] can achieve is unparalleled.\u201d A. Scalia, supra, p. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Thus, it is the majority\u2019s approach that will \u201cgive the appearance of . . . result-oriented decision-making . . . .\u201d Footnote 28 of the majority opinion. Indeed, in my view, litigants are unlikely to trust a court that feels free to disregard the plain meaning of the law. Those litigants are more likely to view such a court as one that simply does justice as it sees fit rather than one that applies the law evenhandedly. This appearance presents a grave danger to an institution that depends upon such trust as an essential source of its legitimacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Finally, I respond briefly to the majority\u2019s major criticisms of this opinion. First, the majority contends that the dissent\u2019s embrace of the plain meaning rule causes it to ignore statutory purpose. Yet, the plain meaning rule simply embodies the commonsense notion that when the text of a statute is plain and unambiguous, the statute\u2019s purpose will be reflected in the text. That is why even proponents of the purposive approach to statutory interpretation, unlike the majority, believe that, when the language is plain and unambiguous, it should be given effect. Indeed, no court, with the exception of those in Alaska, has stated that it may disregard the legislature\u2019s use of plain and unambiguous language in favor of a judicially determined statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Second, with regard to the issue of whether judges employing the majority\u2019s approach to statutory interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tation will be more likely to substitute their own notions of wise and intelligent policy for those of the legislature, I think one need look no further than the majority\u2019s own words in the present case. As I noted previously, the majority, itself, expressly states that its approach to statutory interpretation rests upon its assessment of the rationality of various possible death penalty schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Third, with regard to the majority\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere is simply no basis for\u201d the dissent\u2019s contention \u201cthat the plain meaning rule is based on the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers,\u201d my only response is that there simply is no basis for the majority\u2019s assertion. In surveying the plain meaning rule, the author of the leading treatise on statutory interpretation could not have stated it any clearer: \u201cThe preference for literalism in determining the effect of a statute is based on the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.\u201d See 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 46.03, p. 135. Although I acknowledge that the majority may disagree with such a rationale, its assertion as to the lack of support for my contention is demonstrably incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">As I noted previously, I believe that the majority\u2019s approach to statutory interpretation is misguided inasmuch as it disavows the plain meaning rule, is premised on a search for the subjective intent of the legislature and because the majority fails to provide adequate guidance as to the manner in which statutes will be interpreted in future cases. I offer, instead, the following alternative method of interpreting statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned and ordered search for the meaning of the legislation at issue. In other words, we seek to determine the meaning of statutory language as would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>understood by a reasonable person reading the text of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In determining this objective meaning, we look first and foremost to the words of the statute itself. If the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves, unless such an interpretation produces an absurd result. In seeking the plain meaning of a statute, we generally construe words and phrases \u201caccording to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); in the context of the entire statute and employ ordinary rules of grammar. In addition, we may apply the ordinary canons of judicial construction in seeking the plain meaning, recognizing that such canons are not infallible in aiding the search for plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">When, and only when, the meaning of a statute cannot be ascertained in this fashion, we next eliminate all possible interpretations that render the statutory scheme incoherent or inconsistent. If more than one reasonable interpretation of the statute remains, we next consider the statute\u2019s relationship to other existing legislation and to common-law principles governing the same general subject matter and eliminate any interpretations incompatible with this legal landscape.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">If ambiguity still remains, we seek to uncover the meaning of the statute by way of review of the statute\u2019s legislative history and the circumstances surrounding its enactment. Finally, if we are still left with an ambiguous statute after resort to all the foregoing tools of statutory interpretation, we apply any applicable presumptions in reaching a final interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">This approach is premised on the notion that statutory text should be the polestar of a court\u2019s search for the meaning of a statute. This approach reflects the foregoing philosophy by attributing primary importance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>to statutory text and reaffirming this court\u2019s continued adherence to the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Moreover, inherent in the framework of this approach is the acknowledgment that there are statutes containing language that is ambiguous or, if interpreted according to its plain meaning, susceptible to producing an absurd result. Under such circumstances, the framework envisions a court\u2019s consideration of related statutes in an attempt to discern the statute\u2019s meaning. Consideration of related statutes as a potential second step is premised upon the notion that courts should endeavor to uncover the meaning a reasonable person reading the text of the law likely would attribute to the statute. Thus, such a tool is likely to be useful in eliminating possible interpretations that, although plausible given the language of a statute, become implausible when considering, first, the relevant statutory scheme and, if necessary, the broader legal landscape.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In addition, my approach to statutory interpretation permits the statutory interpreter to consider legislative history only when the utilization of other enumerated tools of construction has not produced a single, reasonable interpretation. Among the principal reasons for the diminished role that this framework ascribes to legislative history are the following. Most fundamentally, legislative history is generally used to attempt to gain insight into subjective legislative intent, which I believe should not be the endeavor of the interpretative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Moreover, even if it is assumed that the uncovering of subjective legislative intent were a worthy enterprise, legislative history is an unreliable source for the discovery of such intent. For example, it is unrealistic to think that such history sufficiently can reveal the mental states of a majority of the legislators as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>executive who signs the particular legislation into law. Yet, it is only this intent, and not that of a committee or of an individual legislator, that is arguably even relevant to the construction of a statute. In addition, other commentators properly have questioned the reliability of legislative history because of concerns over the manipulation by legislators or interest groups seeking to influence judicial inteipretation after having failed to have their views adopted in the text of the legislation. See, e.g., A. Scalia, supra, p. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">A final critique of legislative history is that \u201cit has facilitated rather than deterred decisions that are based upon the courts\u2019 policy preferences, rather than neutral principles of law.\u201d Id., p. 35. It is for these reasons that many scholars and jurists are increasingly coming to share the view of John M. Walker, Jr., the chief judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, that, \u201c[b]ecause of problems associated with legislative history, including its unreliability, manipulability, and lack of authority as law, I have come to attach very little, or no, weight to it . . . .\u201d J. Walker, Jr., supra, 58 N.Y.U. Ann. Surv. Am. L. 233. This court should do the same.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Finally, substantive presumptions should generally be applied only after utilization of all of the other tools of construction has failed to produce a reasonable interpretation.

General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The term \u2018offense\u2019 means any crime or violation which constitutes a breach of any law of this state or of any other state, federal law or local law or ordinance of a political subdivision of this state . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\"> The majority cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995), in support of its conclusion. Specifically, the majority relies on this court\u2019s suggestion in <em>Ross </em>that an aggravating factor can be established by proof \u201cbeyond the elements of the [capital felony] charged.\u201d Id., 264. The court in <em>Ross, </em>however, merely was rejecting the claim of the defendant that, inasmuch as certain elements of the crime with which he was charged overlapped with the evidence of the existence of an aggravating factor, that the aggravating factor could not be established. See id., 263-64. The majority does not explain the relevance of this quote from <em>Ross </em>beyond the out-of-context parenthetical that it provides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-9\"> The entirety of the majority\u2019s contention on this score, its first one in support of its conclusion, is the following: \u201cFirst, as our case law demonstrates, the constituent parts of the capital felony involved here are two murders that are committed in the course of a single transaction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Solek, </em>242 Conn. 409, 423, 699 A.2d 931 (1997) (constituent parts of capital felony under \u00a7 53a-54b [7] are murder and sexual assault in first degree). Thus, the reference in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4) to the offense must be read as referring to those constituent parts. This reading permits the interpretation that the aggravating factor may be satisfied by proof of its existence with respect to at least one of those constituent parts. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 264, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995) (aggravating factor satisfied by proof of existence beyond the elements of the [capital felony] charged). Put another way, it would permit the interpretation that the language, the offense, refers to either of those parts, and does not necessarily refer to <em>both, and only both, </em>of those parts.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">I find this reasoning incomprehensible as the majority begins by stating that \u201cthe offense must be read as referring <em>to those constituent parts,\" </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>concludes, without any logical explanation, by stating that \u201cthe offense, refers to <em>either </em>of those parts . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\"> Although I do not believe that this would be an irrational statute for a legislature to enact, as the majority concludes, I do not think, as I describe in part II of this opinion, that this is the best reading of the death penalty statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> Ironically, in part II of its opinion, the majority emphasizes the importance of legislative history in construing statutes, yet, in part I of its opinion, the majority proclaims the purported irrationality of the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4), as it applies to \u00a7 53a-54b, without considering the views of those legislators who enacted \u00a7 53a-54b. Although I view the use of legislative history <em>to interpret a statute </em>with great skepticism; see part III of this opinion\u2014indeed, in the case of the 1980 legislation that added multiple murders to the list of capital offenses, there were legislators who disagreed with the doubt expressed by other legislators regarding the need to add multiple murders to that list; see, e.g., 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1980 Sess., p. 5682, remarks of Representative Gerard B. Patton\u2014I believe that it is certainly appropriate to consult that history to determine whether there is <em>any possible rationale </em>for why a statute was enacted notwithstanding the majority\u2019s assertion to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\"> Several members of the United States Supreme Court even have expressed their view that the rationale for the rule of lenity precludes consideration of extratextual sources to clarify an ambiguous statute. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>R. L. </em>C., 503 U.S. 291, 307, 112 S. Ct. 1329, 117 L. Ed. 2d 559 (1992) (Scalia, X, with whom Kennedy and Thomas, Js., join, concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cit is not consistent with the rule of lenity to construe a textually ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant on the basis of legislative history\u201d); cf. <em>Hughey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U.S. 411, 422, 110 S. Ct. 1979, 109 L. Ed. 2d 408 (1990) (\u201c[e]ven [when] the statutory language . . . [is] ambiguous, longstanding principles of lenity . . . preclude our resolution of the ambiguity against [the criminal defendant] on the basis of general declarations of policy in the statute and legislative history\u201d [citation omitted]). But cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>R. L. </em>C., supra, 306 n.6 (plurality opinion) (\u201c[wjhether lenity should be given the more immediate and dispositive role Justice Scalia espouses is an issue that is not raised and need not be reached\u201d). I acknowledge that there are contrary indications in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. See, e.g., <em>Moskal </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S. Ct. 461, 112 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1990) (rale of lenity applies, if at all, only after consideration of \u201cthe language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies\u201d of statute [internal quotation marks omitted]). This court previously has relied on the <em>Moskal </em>formulation, as the majority does in the present case, without considering whether it is consistent with, for example, the fair warning rationale behind the rule. See generally, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>248 Conn. 543, 555, 729 A.2d 760, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S. Ct. 406, 145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">In any event, although acceptance of the Scalia-Kennedy-Thomas understanding of the rule of lenity would require that the defendant prevail in the present case, I need not pursue this issue any farther inasmuch as I conclude that the other tools of interpretation upon which the majority relies do not come close to removing reasonable doubt as to the statute\u2019s meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> Indeed, it is apparent from this court\u2019s inclusion of <em>psychological </em>cruelty as a category of conduct that may qualify under \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4); see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 67; that the state may establish the existence of that factor without proof that the defendant had inflicted extreme <em>physical </em>pain, suffering or torture on the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\"> See part I of this opinion for a discussion about why the latter interpretation is a particularly poor interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> None of the other tools of statutory interpretation informs my interpretation of the issue in the present case. There are no other related statutes or common-law principles that are helpful in guiding the interpretation. Moreover, as I previously discussed, the legislative genealogy upon which the majority relies is unpersuasive. Likewise, for reasons that I discuss later in this opinion, I believe that the evidence of the statute\u2019s purpose upon which Justice Katz relies in her separate opinion also is uninformative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b643-10\"> In so stating, I do not intend to de-emphasize my fundamental disagreement with the majority\u2019s rejection of the plain meaning rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"> For example, in her separate opinion, Justice Katz notes that the defendant claims that the legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 53a-54b and, in particular, subdivision (8) of that section, which contains the multiple murder provision, was to adopt a narrow capital felony scheme under which only extreme murders qualify a person for the death penalty. In contrast, Justice Katz concludes that the legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 53a-54b (8) was the deterrence of multiple murders. In my view, irrespective of who is correct, however, the generality of these supposed purposes render them useless in interpreting the specific statutory provisions at issue in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\"> See footnote 13 of this opinion for a description of two plausible views as to the purposes behind the statutory provisions at issue in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> In part III C of this opinion, I present an alternative approach to statutory interpretation that provides such an explanation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> On a more technical note, the majority also states \u201cthat [this court has] not been consistent in [its] formulation of the plain meaning rule.\u201d Footnote 24 of the majority opinion (comparing <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>sioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187-88, 592 A.2d 912 [1991] with <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 744-45, 613 A.2d 804 [1992]). The multistep process that the court referred to in <em>Sanzone </em>was <em>not </em>the plain meaning rule, however. Rather it was a process that we stated we would follow in the <em>absence </em>of a plain and unambiguous statute. See <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 187. In contrast, the multistep process that this court described in <em>Cain </em>simply consisted of <em>qualifications </em>of the plain meaning rule. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra, 744. Thus, I do not see any conflict between <em>Sanzone </em>and <em>Cain.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\"> Indeed, the genesis of the <em>majority\u2019s </em>approach can be traced to <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 522 A.2d 771 (1987), a case in which the court cites to cases that expressly state the <em>plain meaning rule. </em>Id., 589, citing <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 572, 522 A.2d 763 (1987), <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987), and <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> In contrast, the majority asserts that this \u201crigid threshold-passing requirement as a route to determining the meaning of statutory language is simply counter to any ordinary way of determining the meaning of [statutory] language.\u201d Footnote 24 of the majority opinion. On the contrary, I agree with the Sutherland treatise and the United States Supreme Court that the plain meaning rule is the <em>primary </em>way by which we communicate. The interpreter reads or listens to a statement and accords that statement its ordinary and plain meaning, inquiring further only when there is some ambiguity inherent in the statement. Moreover, such an approach is hardly foreign to our law. One need only look to the parol evidence rule to find another manifestation of this basic method of human communication. See, e.g., <em>Heyman Associates No. 1 </em>v. <em>Ins. Co. of Pennsylvania, </em>231 Conn. 756, 780-81, 653 A.2d 122 (1995) (\u201cParol evidence offered solely to vary or contradict the written terms of an integrated contract is . . . legally irrelevant. When offered for that purpose, it is inadmissible not because it is parol evidence, but because it is irrelevant.\u201d); see also <em>Canaan National Bank </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>217 Conn. 330, 337, 586 A.2d 562 (1991) (\u201c[a] court may not stray beyond the four comers of the will where the terms of the will are clear and unambiguous\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\"> Elsewhere in its opinion, the majority acknowledges that its approach to statutory interpretation is unprecedented. See footnote 19 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\"> The illogicality of such reasoning is demonstrated by a simple hypothetical. Consider the following hypothetical statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">(a) In the context of the capital offense of kidnapping committed in the course of a murder, the state need only prove that the murder was committed in a cruel manner in order to establish the existence of the aggravating factor for offenses committed in a cruel manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), in the context of the capital offense of two murders committed in the course of the same transaction, the state must prove that both murders were committed in a cruel manner in order to establish the aggravating factor for offenses committed in a cruel manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Inasmuch as the basis for the majority\u2019s opinion in the present case is the purported irrationality of such a statute, one is left to wonder whether, notwithstanding the legislature\u2019s use of plain and unambiguous language in this hypothetical statute, the majority would conclude, under the statute, that the state need only prove that <em>one </em>murder in a multiple murder case was committed in a cruel manner in order to prove the existence of the aggravating factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b652-12\"> Although the majority suggests, without citation, that it is inappropriate to consider such an incentive when interpreting statutes; see footnote 32 of the majority opinion; I note that the United States Supreme Court has suggested that courts should consider just this in interpreting criminal statutes. See <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 442 U.S. 112-13 (\u201cto ensure that a legislature speaks with special clarity when marking the boundaries of criminal conduct, courts must decline to impose punishment for actions that are not plainly and unmistakably proscribed\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> The majority also claims that the fact that some courts, not including this court, have recognized an exception to the plain meaning rule when the legislative history reveals a scrivener\u2019s error in the drafting of the statute demonstrates a \u201cfundamental flaw\u201d in the rule. Footnote 26 of the majority opinion. It is hard to understand how this exception possibly could demonstrate a \u201cfundamental flaw\u201d in the plain meaning rule in light of the fact that, as the majority acknowledges, this court <em>never </em>has had occasion to consider this exception notwithstanding the century old application of the rule in Connecticut courts. Thus, regardless of whether this court would choose to use legislative history to override the plain meaning of a statute in such an instance, the extreme rarity of this example makes it obvious that this exception carries with it no license for the wholesale abandonment of the plain meaning rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\"> The majority rhetorically asks why, if I believe that there are so many problems with legislative history, should legislative history have <em>any </em>place in my approach to statutory construction. My answer is simple. I believe that this court should attach the most weight to the most reliable indicators of a statute\u2019s meaning and the least weight to the least reliable indicators. Legislative history, in my view, is less reliable than other tools, but may have some usefulness under circumstances in which the other tools of interpretation fail to produce a single, reasonable meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b661-14\"> As I noted previously, I would leave for another day the question of whether, because of the constitutional underpinnings embodied in its fair warning rationale, the rule of lenity should be employed immediately upon determining that the text of a criminal statute is ambiguous, or whether it should, along with other substantive presumptions, be employed only as a last resort after all of the relevant tools of construction have been employed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
