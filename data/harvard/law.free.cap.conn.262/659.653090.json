Mandell, did not owe a conveyance tax for transferring certain real property to his limited liability company, Mandell Properties, LLC (company). The plaintiff had appealed to the trial court from the decision of the defendant, who imposed the conveyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>tax on the transfer following a hearing in which the plaintiff contested the tax assessment. The trial court concluded, based upon the reasoning that the plaintiff and the company were one entity for tax purposes, that the transfer was not subject to the real estate conveyance tax because the plaintiff did not receive any \u201cconsideration\u201d in exchange for the real property, which is a requirement for the imposition of the tax under \u00a7 12-494 (a). On appeal, the defendant claims that the increase in fair market value of the company after receiving the real property constitutes \u201cconsideration\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-494 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment in favor of the plaintiff, albeit on reasoning different from that employed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The parties presented the following undisputed facts to the trial court on cross motions for summary judgment. For several years prior to 1997, the plaintiff owned and operated commercial real property in Newington in his individual capacity. At that time, chapter 613 of our General Statutes required a minimum of two members to form a limited liability company. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 34-101 (a). The legislature amended chapter 613 in 1997 in order to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the formation of limited liability companies with only one member. See Public Acts 1997, No. 97-70. The plaintiff formed his company soon after the effective date of this legislation, naming himself the sole member. The plaintiff then transferred the real property to his company by quitclaim deed. In the deed, the plaintiff recited that the transfer was \u201cfor NO CONSIDERATION</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The defendant determined that the plaintiffs real estate transfer was subject to the real estate conveyance tax of \u00a7 12-494 (a), and billed the plaintiff in the amount of $56,200 for tax, plus interest and penalties. In arriving at this figure, the defendant had applied a taxation rate of 1 percent, from \u00a7 12-494 (b); see footnote 2 of this opinion; to the <em>fair market value </em>of the property at the time of the transfer, which was $5,620,000. Section 12-494 (b) (1) imposes a taxation rate of \u201cone per cent of the <em>consideration for </em>the interest in real property conveyed\u201d for \u201creal property which at the time of such conveyance is used for any purpose other than residential use, except unimproved land . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff applied to the defendant for a hearing to dispute the tax pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-502a and 12-553.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>In his hearing before the defendant, the plaintiff argued that the transfer of real property from himself to the company was not a taxable event under \u00a7 12-494 (a). Specifically, he argued that, under General Statutes \u00a7 34-113,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he and his single-member limited liability company should be considered a single entity for taxation purposes, and that any transfer of property between them would fail to satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 12-494 (a) that transfers be for \u201cconsideration\u201d to be taxable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff contended that \u201cthere can be no . . . consideration\u201d for the transfer in question because he, as an \u201cindividual, owns the real estate both before and after the purported transfer . . . .\u201d The plaintiff relied on a decision of the Superior Court for the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>principle that \u201cthe exchange of consideration is the touchstone for determining which transactions are subject to Connecticut\u2019s real estate conveyance tax . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bjurback </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>44 Conn. Sup. 354, 358, 690 A.2d 902 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The defendant rejected the plaintiffs interpretation, determining that the \u201cassessment is proper and legal.\u201d The defendant acknowledged that \u00a7 12-494 (a) imposes a tax only for real estate transfers made in exchange for \u201cconsideration,\u201d but reasoned that the plaintiff \u201creceived consideration in the form of an interest in [the company].\u201d On the basis of an assessment by the defendant\u2019s auditor that the plaintiffs 100 percent interest in the company had increased by the fair market value of the property transferred, which was $5,620,000, the defendant imposed the tax of $56,200 and $25,290 in interest and penalties. The plaintiff appealed from the defendant\u2019s decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-502a and 12-554.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Before the trial court, the parties submitted cross motions for summary judgment. The court granted the plaintiffs motion and denied the defendant\u2019s motion, determining that the plaintiff was not subject to the real estate conveyance tax because the plaintiff did not receive any \u201cconsideration\u201d in exchange for the real property, which is required for the imposition of that tax under \u00a7 12-494 (a). Specifically, the court determined that the company must be \u201cdisregarded\u201d as an entity separate from the plaintiff, its sole owner, for tax purposes and, therefore, any transfer between the plaintiff and the company could not have been for consideration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiff was not subject to the real estate conveyance tax. Specifically, the defendant argues that the increase in the fair market value of the company as a result of the real estate transfer constituted \u201cconsideration\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-494 (a) and that, therefore, the trial court improperly determined that the consideration requirement for the imposition of the tax had not been satisfied. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim on appeal involves statutory interpretation, namely, the construction of \u00a7 12-494 (a). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. . . . In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>stances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextua! sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextua! sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">We begin with the language at issue in \u00a7 12-494 (a). Section 12-494 (a) imposes a real estate conveyance tax \u201con each deed . . . whereby any lands, tenements or other realty is . . . transferred ... to ... [a] purchaser, or any other person by his direction, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>the consideration for tine </em>interest or property conveyed equals or exceeds two thousand dollars . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that this language requires that there be \u201cconsideration for\u201d the transfer of real property before imposing the real estate conveyance tax. We turn, therefore, to the significance of the term \u201cconsideration,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 12-494 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The term \u201cconsideration\u201d has been used in a specific, legal sense for centuries. See, e.g., <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>7 Conn. 57, 61-62 (1828); see generally 3 S. Williston, Contracts (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 7:1, pp. 7-8 (\u201c[t]he history of the requirement of consideration is bound up with the history of the common-law action of assumpsit\u201d). \u201c[L]egal terms . . . absent any legislative intent shown to the contrary, are to be presumed to be used in their legal sense. . . . [T]he law uses familiar legal expressions in their familiar legal sense. . . . <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 70-71, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985) (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 169-70, 635 A.2d 783 (1993); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201ctechnical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly\u201d). Section 71 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts relates the familiar legal sense of the term \u201cconsideration\u201d: \u201c(1) To constitute consideration, a performance or a return promise must be bargained for. (2) A performance or return promise is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 71, p. 172 (1981); see also <em>Calamita </em>v. <em>Tradesmens National Bank, </em>135 Conn. 326, 332, 64 A.2d 46 (1949) (\u201c \u2018[consideration must actually be bargained for as the exchange for the promise\u2019 \u201d); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>261 Conn. 111, 123, 802 A.2d 754 (2002) (\u201c \u2018[t]o constitute consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ation, a performance or a return promise must be bargained for\u2019 \u201d). The Restatement (Second) of Contracts further defines the term \u201c \u2018[b]argained for\u2019 \u201d as follows: \u201cIn the typical bargain, the consideration and the promise bear a reciprocal relation of motive or inducement: the consideration induces the making of the promise and the promise induces the furnishing of the consideration. Here, as in the matter of mutual assent, the law is concerned with the external manifestation rather than the undisclosed mental state .... [I]t is not enough that the promise induces the conduct of the promisee or that the conduct of the promisee induces the making of the promise; both elements must be present, or there is no bargain.\u201d (Citation omitted.) 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 71, p. 173, comment (b). Nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 12-494 (a), or any other extratextual source, indicates that another sense of the term \u201cconsideration\u201d was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In the present case, there was no consideration for the plaintiffs transfer of real property to the company because there was no bargained for exchange. The plaintiff simply transferred the real property at issue to his company. The plaintiff did not promise to transfer the real property to his company in exchange for any performance or retrun promise by the company. In fact, neither the plaintiff nor the company made any promises or exchanges regarding the transfer whatsoever. In other words, the plaintiff acted unilaterally, not in a bargained for exchange, when he transferred the real property to his company. Therefore, \u00a7 12-494 (a) did not impose a conveyance tax on the transfer, because there was no \u201cconsideration for\u201d the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The defendant argues that the increase in the fair market value of the company resulting from the transfer of real property to it constituted consideration. As discussed previously, the change in fair market value of the company was not the result of a bargained for exchange. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>The change in fair market value was the automatic effect of the transfer; the company served as a passive recipient of the property. Thus, the plaintiff did not induce any conduct on the part of the company, and that element must be present, or there is no bargain. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Furthermore, the legislative genealogy and history of \u00a7 12-494 (a) indicates that the legislature intended to avoid the meaning proposed by the defendant, namely, that \u201cconsideration\u201d be measured by the fair market value of the real property conveyed, irrespective of whether there is any bargained for exchange in the transaction. Prior to 1971, General Statutes (Sup. 1969) \u00a7 12-494,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the predecessor statute of \u00a7 12-494 (a), imposed the real estate conveyance tax even in the absence of consideration if the <em>\u201cvalue of the interest or-property conveyed </em>exceed[ed] [the statutory amount] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In 1971, the legislature amended \u00a7 12-494 to impose the tax only where there is \u201cconsideration for\u201d the transfer of real estate, thus eliminating the alternative of taxing the value of the property conveyed in the absence of consideration. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1971) \u00a7 12-494. An examination of the floor debate in 1971 reveals that the legislators considered a system of taxation for transfers in the absence of consideration, based on the fair market value of the property conveyed, to be fundamentally unfair. In those proceedings, Senator Edward S. Rimer stated: \u201c[T]his amendment . . . changes the system of taxation on the Real Estate conveyance tax so that it would be based now on actual consideration or sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>price of the property involved. Rather than the existing situation where the tax is based upon a fair market value. . . . The Connfecticut] Real Estate conveyance tax was adopted simultaneously with the phase out of the federal document[a]ry tax on conveyance of real estate. The federal tax was based upon consideration rather than fair market value and the history was that [it] was a very workable tax program. In my judgment this amendment would make the Connecticut conveyance tax a fairer tax. And a more workable tax and would obviate certain hardship situations that are now in exist[e]nce.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 3,1971 Sess., pp. 1037-38. Thus, Senator Rimer indicated that deeds granting real estate to a \u201cland conservation trust or ... to a charitable institution\u201d would no longer be subject to the real estate conveyance tax due to the absence of consideration. Id., p. 1037. Senator Thomas E. Dupont reaffirmed this objective: \u201cI rise in favor of this amendment. I think it goes a step further than the bill as originally in the file. That expanded the exemptions. ... I think that it makes some sense to limit the tax to those [conveyances] where there is considerations.\u201d Id., p. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The defendant contends that this legislative history indicates that \u00a7 12-494 (a) was intended to replace the federal real estate conveyance tax that had been phased out. The defendant argues that transactions such as that at issue in this appeal were considered taxable under federal regulations under the federal conveyance tax and, therefore, that we should adopt the same position with respect to the Connecticut real estate conveyance tax. We are not persuaded. There is nothing in either the language or the legislative history of \u00a7 12-494 (a) to indicate that the legislature intended to adopt any such federal regulatory gloss. Indeed, the statutory language and extratextual sources discussed previously run counter to such an interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>In this opinion NORCOTT and MULCAHY, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-13\"> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-494 provides: \u201c(a) There is imposed a tax on each deed, instrument or writing, whereby any lands, tenements or other realty is granted, assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed to, or vested in, the purchaser, or any other person by his direction, when the consideration for the interest or property conveyed equals or exceeds two thousand dollars, (1) subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, at the rate of five-tenths of one per cent of the consideration for the interest in real property conveyed by such deed, instrument or writing, the revenue from which shall be remitted by the town clerk of the municipality in which such tax is paid, not later than ten days following receipt thereof, to the Commissioner of Revenue Services for deposit to the credit of the state General Fund and (2) at the rate of eleven one-hundredths of one per cent of the consideration for the interest in real property conveyed by such deed, instrument or writing, which amount shall become part of the general revenue of the municipality in accordance with section 12-499.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">\u201c(b) The rate of tax imposed under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section shall, in lieu of the rate under said subdivision (1), be imposed on certain conveyances as follows: (1) In the case of any conveyance of real property which at the time of such conveyance is used for any purpose other than residential use, except unimproved land, the tax under said subdivision (1) shall be imposed at the rate of one per cent of the consideration for the interest in real property conveyed; and (2) in the case of any conveyance in which the real property conveyed is a residential estate, including a primary dwelling and any auxiliary housing or structures, for which the consideration in such conveyance is eight hundred thousand dollars or more, the tax under said subdivision (1) shall be imposed (A) at the rate of one-half of one per cent on that portion of such consideration up to and including the amount of eight hundred thousand dollars and (B) at the rate of one per cent on that portion of such consideration in excess of eight hundred thousand dollars; and (3) in the case of any conveyance in which real property on which mortgage payments have been delinquent for not less than six months is conveyed to a financial institution or its subsidiary which holds such a delinquent mortgage on such property, the tax under said subdivision (1) shall be imposed at the rate of one-half of one per cent of the consideration for the interest in real property conveyed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\"> The plaintiffs primary argument on appeal was that, under General Statutes \u00a7 34-113, his single-member limited liability company was not a separate entity from himself for tax purposes and that, therefore, a transfer of real property from himself to his company was not a taxable event. Because we conclude that the transfer was not taxable under \u00a7 12-494 (a) due to the absence of consideration, we need not address this argument. We also note that, subsequent to oral argument before this court, we requested the parties to file supplemental briefs on the following questions: \u201cWhat is the meaning of the term \u2018consideration\u2019 as used in [Public Acts 1967, No. 693, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 5], now codified as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-494 (a) and 12-498 (a), and of the term \u2018consideration for\u2019 as used in [Public Acts 1971, No. 158, \u00a7 2], now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 12-494 (a)?

In the trial court, the plaintiff submitted his personal federal tax return from 1997, which demonstrated that he had elected to report the income from the real property as his personal income after he transferred it to the company. Thus, he argued that he had elected to disregard his single-member limited liability company as an entity separate from himself under both federal and Connecticut law. Under the analysis set forth in this opinion, we need not address the merits of this specific argument because, even if the company were treated as a separate entity from the plaintiff, the transfer of real property at issue was not made for \u201cconsideration\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-494 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> Section 12-502a incorporates the appellate procedures described in \u201csections 12-548 to 12-554,\u201d making them applicable to appeals from real estate conveyance taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-554 provides: \u201cAny taxpayer aggrieved because of any order, decision, determination or disallowance of the Commissioner of Revenue Services under the provisions of this chapter may, within one month after service upon the taxpayer of notice of such order, decision, determination or disallowance, take an appeal therefrom to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain, which shall be accompanied by a citation to the Commissioner of Revenue Services to appear before said court.

If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the appeal has been taken without probable cause, the court may tax double or triple costs, as the case demands; and, upon all such appeals which may be denied, costs may be taxed against the appellant at the discretion of the court, but no costs shall be taxed against the state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> General Statutes (Sup. 1969) \u00a7 12-494 provided: \u201cThere is imposed a tax on each deed, instrument or writing whereby any lands, tenements or other realty is granted, assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed to, or vested in, the purchaser, or any other person by his direction, when the consideration or value of the interest or property conveyed exceeds one hundred dollars and does not exceed five hundred dollars, in the amount of fifty-five cents; and at the rate of fifty-five cents for each additional five hundred dollars or fractional part thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b696-6\">SULLIVAN, C. J., with whom ZARELLA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbS\">joins, concurring. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the transfer of real estate at issue in this case was not subject to the real estate conveyance tax imposed by General Statutes \u00a7 12-494 (a). I write separately, however, to express my continued disagreement with the method of statutory interpretation adopted by the majority of this court in <em>State </em>v. Courchesne, 262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). In <em>Courchesne, </em>the majority abandoned the plain meaning rule that this court has employed for more than a century in favor of a purposive and extratextual approach. See id., 597, 599 <em>(Zarella J., </em>dissenting). As I did when I joined Justice Zarella in his dissenting opinion in <em>Courchesne, </em>I continue to oppose that radical change in our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">I also take this opportunity to express my view that the principle of stare decisis does not apply to the approach to statutory interpretation adopted by the majority in <em>Courchesne. </em>As Justice Zarella stated in his dissenting opinion in that case, the plain meaning rule is not a rule of substantive law, but one of judicial philosophy. See id., 622. The plain meaning rule embodies the principle that \u201cit is the objective meaning of a statute\u2019s text that should govern, rather than the legislature\u2019s subjective intent in choosing that text.\u201d Id., 626. Undergirding this principle is the judicial philosophy that \u201c \u2018it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawgiver promulgated.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting A. Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law (A. Gutmann ed., 1997) p. 17. In my view, judicial philosophy is a matter of individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>conscience and is not subject to majority rule by the members of this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">I recognize that I have, on occasion, relied on extra-textual sources to bolster a statutory interpretation grounded in the plain meaning of the statute under review. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>261 Conn. 111, 802 A.2d 754 (2002). It is now clear to me that that practice is both unnecessary and unwarranted, in that it may suggest that, in cases where the plain meaning of the statute and the meaning suggested by the extratextual sources are inconsistent, the extratextual sources could override the text of the statute. This is something that I never have believed. Accordingly, I cannot in good conscience, and will not, employ the extratextual approach adopted by the majority in <em>Courchesne </em>when the meaning of a statute is plain on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Even if it is assumed, however, that the principle of star e decisis does apply to the majority\u2019s abandonment of the plain meaning rule, a willingness to depart from that principle would be, in my view, particularly appropriate with respect to this issue. See <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 661, 680 A.2d 242 (1996) (\u201cstare decisis . . . does not have the same kind of force in each kind of case so that adherence to or deviation from that general policy may depend upon the kind of case involved\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); id., 685 n.3 <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>dissenting) (\u201cconsiderations of stare decisis have special force in the area of statutory interpretations, for here . . . [the legislature] remains free to alter what we have done\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). It is my hope that the majority ultimately will rethink its ill-considered departure from the long<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>standing, democratically grounded jurisprudential principles that hitherto have guided this court\u2019s interpretation of statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Turning to the issue before us in this case, I believe that the plain meaning of \u00a7 12-494 (a) precludes the interpretation urged by the defendant, the commissioner of revenue services. As the majority points out, the term \u201cconsideration\u201d has a familiar legal meaning that simply does not encompass an increase in the monetary value of a thing if that increase was not the result of bargain or exchange. Accordingly, I see no need to consult the legislative genealogy and history of \u00a7 12-494 (a), as the majority has done. Although I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretive methodology, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\"> I do recognize, however, that the substantive legal holdings resulting from the novel judicial philosophy adopted by the majority in <em>Courchesne </em>are subject to the principle of stare decisis. Accordingly, I would only reluctantly overrule a substantive legal conclusion based on that judicial philosophy even though I do not feel bound by the philosophy itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
