The defendant fund appeals from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirming the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the seventh district (commissioner), which required the fund to reimburse the defendant Lufthansa German Airlines (Lufthansa), the employer of the plaintiff,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Walter Hasselt, for both retroactive COLAs Lufthansa had paid to the plaintiff, as well as prospective COLAs accrued. The fund claims that the board improperly construed \u00a7 31-307a (c) to require it to reimburse Lufthansa for all prospective COLAs accruing after October 1, 1997. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The record reveals the following undisputed facts. On July 6, 1994, the plaintiff suffered a compensable back injury during the course of his employment with Lufthansa. The plaintiff has received temporary total disability benefits pursuant to a voluntary agreement with Lufthansa since December 7, 1994. Sometime between July, 1999, and July, 2000,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff filed with the commissioner a request, pursuant to \u00a7 31-307a (c), for a lump sum COLA payment retroactive to the date of his injury and for any prospective COLAs accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">At a hearing on the plaintiffs request, the parties presented to the trial commissioner the issue of whether, under \u00a7 31-307a (c), the insurance carrier or the fund is responsible for COLAs payable to an injured employee who had been temporarily totally disabled for five years or more. Lufthansa contended that, once a claimant had met the prescribed five year disability period; see footnote 2 of this opinion; the fund was required to reimburse Lufthansa for any COLAs it had paid for that five year period, <em>and </em>for any future COLAs accrued after that period. Conversely, the fund contended that the statute limited its liability to retroactive COLAs paid by an employer for the specific time period set forth in the statute, namely, July 1, 1993, through October 1,1997. The commissioner determined that the language of the statute imposed no such time limitation on the fund\u2019s reimbursement obligations. Accordingly, the commissioner ordered that the fund reimburse Lufthansa for all COLAs already paid or payable in the future to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Thereafter, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301, the fund filed an appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision with the board,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. Specifically, the board rejected the fund\u2019s contention that, in light of the legislature\u2019s intention to limit the fund\u2019s liability, as expressed in certain amendments to the workers\u2019 compensation scheme; see Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7\u00a715 through 20; Public Acts 1995, No. 95-277, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 9 and 18; \u00a7 31-307a (c) should be construed to limit the fund\u2019s liability to COLAs accrued for the fifty-one months delineated in the statute. The board determined that this intention did not outweigh the plain language of \u00a7 31-307a (c) and the \u201cdate of injury\u201d rule generally applied under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, both of which supported Lufthansa\u2019s position that the fund must reimburse it for all COLAs arising from qualifying injuries sustained between the dates of July 1, 1993, and October 1, 1997. Finally, the board noted that the fund\u2019s interpretation would run counter to the rule precluding the legislature from imposing retroactive substantive obligations on persons or corporations. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">On appeal, the fund contends that the statute imposes on it an obligation to reimburse employers only for COLAs that accrue for the period set forth in the statute, \u201con or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-307a (c). It further contends that, to the extent that the statute is ambiguous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>its legislative history and the reforms that preceded the passage of the act imposing this obligation indicate a legislative intent to limit the fund\u2019s obligation in this manner. Finally, the fund contends that we should give deference to a September 10, 1997 memorandum written by Jesse M. Frankl (Frankl memorandum), then chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission, in which, according to the fund, Frankl interpreted \u00a7 31-307a (c) as imposing the obligation to pay COLAs accrued after October 1, 1997, on the employer or its insurer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">As a preliminary matter, we state what is <em>not </em>at issue in the present appeal. It is undisputed that, under \u00a7 31-307a (c), injured employees, such as the plaintiff, who are totally disabled for a period of five or more years as a result of a work-related injrny occurring on or after July 1, 1993, are entitled to COLAs. It further is undisputed that the fund is required to reimburse employers or insurance carriers for COLAs they have paid to those qualifying employees that had accrued for the period of July 1, 1993, through October 1, 1997. Where the parties diverge is on the issue of whether \u00a7 31-307a (c) requires the fund to reimburse the insurance carrier based on COLAs payable for a specified <em>time </em>period\u2014July 1, 1993, through October 1, 1997\u2014 or whether the statute requires reimbursement for all COLAs accruing based solely on the <em>date of the </em>injury, thereby imposing an indeterminate liability on the fund beyond October 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The issue in this appeal, therefore, is one of statutory construction. We first set forth the well established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>principles guiding our review of such an issue. \u201c[A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . We have determined, [however], that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s [determination] . . . is unwarranted when the construction of a statute [is at issue and that construction] has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 33-34, 792 A.2d 835 (2002); accord <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). Prior to its decision in the present case, the board had not addressed the extent of the fund\u2019s liability under \u00a7 31-307a (c) for COLA reimbursements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the issue is one of first impression for Connecticut courts. Accordingly, we do not accord any particular deference to the conclusion of the board and exercise plenary review. <em>Laliberte </em>v. <em>United Security, Inc., </em>261 Conn. 181, 185, 801 A.2d 783 (2002); <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>supra, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Briefly, by way of background, we note that until 1993, qualifying employees were entitled to COLAs for injuries sustained on or after October 1,1969. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-307a. Effective July 1, 1993, the legislature amended the statute to eliminate COLAs for totally incapacitated employees injured on or after that date. Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 17. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Thereafter, the legislature reversed course, effective October 1, 1997, adding subsection (c) to \u00a7 31-307a, which reincorporated COLAs for totally incapacitated employees sustaining injuries on or after July 1, 1993. See Public Acts 1997, No. 97-205, \u00a7 4; see also Substitute Senate Bill No. 976, 1997 Sess., \u00a7 4 (entitled \u201cAn Act Restoring Workers\u2019 Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustments for Widows, Widowers, Orphans and Totally Disabled Workers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">With this background in mind, we begin our analysis with the language of the statute. <em>Hartford Courant Co. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>261 Conn. 86, 92, 801 A.2d 759 (2002); <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 531, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). The main portion of \u00a7 31-307a (c) addresses the method of calculating COLAs, sets forth the date or dates on which the employee is entitled to receive COLAs and imposes primary liability for COLAs on the employer or his insurer. The last sentence of the subsection then provides: \u201cThe employer or his insurer shall be reimbursed by the Second Injury Fund, as provided in section 31-354, for adjustments, including lump-sum payments, payable under this subsection for compensable injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1,1997, upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-307a (c). The fund contends that this sentence must be construed as limiting its liability to only those COLAs accrued on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We first note that the sentence at issue, read in the light of the ordinary rules of English grammar and sentence structure, compels a construction contrary to that suggested by the fund. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 24, 670 A.2d 851 (1996); <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>232 Conn. 17, 22, 653 A.2d 156 (1995). The dates set forth in the sentence modify the term \u201ccompensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>injuries,\u201d not \u201cadjustments.\u201d There is no basis in the plain language of the sentence to construe it as if it provided \u201cadjustments payable on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1,1997.\u201d Moreover, such a construction would render superfluous the phrase \u201cfor compensable injuries occurring on or after\u201d in \u00a7 31-307a (c). We generally reject a construction that achieves such a result. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>254 Conn. 578, 602, 758 A.2d 327 (2000) (\u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [Statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Moreover, as the board noted, construing the statute to impose liability on the fund based on the date the injury is sustained, rather than a specific time period, is the construction most consistent with the \u201cdate of injury rule.\u201d \u201cThe date of injury rule is a rule of statutory construction that establishes a presumption that \u2018new workers\u2019 compensation legislation affecting rights and obligations as between the parties . . . appliefs] only to those persons who <em>received injuries </em>after the legislation became effective, and not to those injured previously.\u2019 Gil <em>v. Courthouse One, </em>239 Conn. 676, 685, 687 A.2d 146 (1997).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Badolato </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>250 Conn. 753, 756 n.5, 738 A.2d 618 (1999). \u201cThe legislature, [however], may \u2018override\u2019 the date of injury rule as long as it makes its intention clear. <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>supra, 686.\u201d <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 305, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997). In the present case, however, there is no clear expression by the legislature of its intention to override this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Finally, we note that this last sentence imposes liability on the fund to reimburse employers for \u201cadjustments, <em>including luw/p-sum payments . . . </em>.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-307a (c). Reference to other sentences in this subsection indicate that this distinction imposes liability on the fund for both retroactive and prospective COLAs. Section 31-307a (c) prescribes that, after the five year qualification period is satisfied, an employee is entitled to receive COLAs retroactive to the commencement of that period in a \u201clump-sum payment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is clear under this compensation scheme that those lump sum payments are equivalent to retroactive COLA payments, a point which the fund seems to concede. Construing the word \u201cincluding\u201d according to its ordinary usage, however, must mean that the fund is required as well to reimburse employers for <em>something </em>other than those retroactive COLAs paid in a lump sum. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (\u201cwords . . . shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d); Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993) (defining \u201cinclude\u201d as \u201cto . . . comprise as a part of a whole\u201d). In our view, by necessary implication, that <em>something </em>must be prospective COLAs. In other words, \u201cadjustments\u201d other than those owed retroactively and paid in a lump sum must be adjustments accruing prospectively. Indeed, we can infer no other rational explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>tion for what else the legislature could have intended, and the fund has not provided a rational alternative construction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The fund, however, draws our attention to the two sentences immediately preceding the sentence at issue here, wherein \u00a7 31-307a (c) refers to \u201crecalculation\u201d or \u201crecalculated\u201d benefits. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Those sentences refer to the fact that, upon an employee\u2019s qualification for receiving COLAs, the employee\u2019s benefits must be recalculated to include COLAs in order to pay the employee any retroactive COLAs accrued. The fund contends that, because the statute prescribes a recalculation of retroactive benefits only, the legislature similarly intended for the last sentence to be construed only to prescribe retroactive liability. In essence, the fund contends that we should construe the phrase \u201cadjustments, including lump-sum payments\u201d included in \u00a7 31-307a (c) as if it read \u201crecalculated benefits.\u201d This interpretation, however, runs counter to a fundamental tenet of statutory construction that \u201c[t]he use of the different terms . . . within the same statute suggests that the legislature acted with complete awareness of their different, meanings . . . and that it intended the terms to have different meanings . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bruttomesso </em>v. <em>Northeastern Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services, Inc., </em>242 Conn. 1, 13, 698 A.2d 795 (1997); accord <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 416, 540 A.2d 1054 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>(1988); <em>Hinchcliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 613, 440 A.2d 810 (1981), on appeal after remand, 192 Conn. 252, 470 A.2d 1216 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The fund conceded at oral argument in this court that, under COLAs enacted prior to the 1993-1997 workers\u2019 compensation reforms, it is obligated to pay COLAs for the entire period of a claimant\u2019s benefits. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-307a (b). Therefore, it is not irrational to construe \u00a7 31-307a (c) as the plain language suggests, thereby imposing similarly prospective liability. See <em>Hartford Courant Co. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 101 (\u201cwell established canon of statutoiy construction \u2018that those who promulgate statutes or rules do not intend to promulgate statutes or rules that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results\u2019 \u201d); <em>Vibert </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>260 Conn. 167, 177, 793 A.2d 1076 (2002) (\u201c[w]e will not interpret [a statute] to reach ... a bizarre or absurd result\u201d). The fund contends, however, that the legislative history of the statute and the 1993-1997 reforms indicate a different legislative intent\u2014 that is, to limit the fund\u2019s liability, rather than expose it to an indeterminate liability. Accordingly, we next turn to the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The bill reinstating COLAs effective October 1, 1997, as initially raised in the labor and public employees committee, differed in several respects from the bill ultimately enacted. See Raised Bill No. 6627,1997 Sess., \u00a7 2. The raised bill contained no requirement that the employee receive a retroactive lump sum payment for COLAs accrued prior to October 1, 1997. See id. It did provide, however, that \u201c[t]he cost of the adjustments shall be paid by the employer or his insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed therefor from the [fund] . . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 2 (b). At the committee hearings, Robert Kehmna, president of the Insurance Association of Connecticut, testified as to concerns that the bill as drafted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>would impose a liability on insurance carriers for which they had not contracted. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 1, 1997 Sess., pp. 58-65. Kehmna explained that the insurance carriers had negotiated and collected premiums based on their statutory obligations as of the year of injury, and that they could not renegotiate contracts for pre1997 injuries to account for COLAs payable perhaps ten or twenty years into the future, which were not mandated during the 1993-1997 period.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., pp. 61-62. In response to Kehmna\u2019s testimony, several committee members indicated that they would take the insurance carriers\u2019 concerns into account.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See id., pp. 62, 65, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>remarks of Senator Edith G. Prague and Representative Christopher G. Donovan.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The bill, as subsequently amended and introduced to the legislature, required employers to pay employees a retroactive \u201clump-sum payment\u201d upon qualification for COLAs and required the fund to reimburse employers or insurers for \u201cadjustments, including lump-sum payments . . . .\u201d See Substitute Senate Bill No. 976, 1997 Sess., \u00a7 4. The analysis of the amended bill by the office of legislative research explained in relevant part that Senate Amendment \u201cA\u201d, which became part of the bill \u201crequires lump sum payments for retroactive COLAs for . . . totally and permanently disabled workers injured between July 1, 1993 and September 30, 1997; [and] . . . requires the [fund] to reimburse employers and insurers for the retroactive adjustments <em>as well as for future COLAs for eligible claimants injured between those dates </em>(Emphasis added.) Office of Legislative Research Amended Bill Analysis, p. 199; see also id., p. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In debates on the amended bill in the Llouse of Representatives, legislators stated that the fiscal impact of the bill primarily would affect the fund, not the insurance carriers. See 40 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14, 1997 Sess., p. 5180, remarks of Representative Donovan; id., pp. 5196-97, remarks of Representative James A. O\u2019 Rourke III.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Representative Dominic Mazzoccoli asked for clarifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>tion on the bill, stating that he was under the impression that the legislature was \u201cin the process of phasing out the . . . fund.\u201d Id., p. 5187. Representative Donovan explained: \u201cI guess by law we are phasing it out by not taking new cases. There are still a number of individuals who are on the . . . fund and we continue the liability of those individuals.\u201d Id., pp. 5187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Representative O\u2019Rourke subsequently addressed the concern about the fiscal impact on the fund, stating: \u201c[A]s far as the impact which has been raised on the . . . fund, it is extremely important that we take this step today. Because every year that we wait to restor[e] cost of living adjustments, that means more and more workers will ultimately have their COLAs paid by the . . . fund. And two years ago we took the step in this chamber to close [the] fund to future liabilities.\u201d Id., p. 5197. We conclude that the legislative history, in its entirety, supports the interpretation suggested by the text of the statute that the fund is hable for all past and future COLAs accrued for compensable injuries sustained on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The fund, however, points to Representative O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments as support for its contention that the legislature intended to limit its liability to those COLAs accrued for the 1993-1997 time period.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In our view, however, these comments equally support our conclusion. In particular, we note that Representative O\u2019Rourke defined the fund\u2019s liability in terms of the <em>workers </em>it would be required to cover when he stated, \u201cmore and more workers will ultimately have their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>COLAs paid by the . . . fund\u201d; id.; and not in terms of the <em>years </em>it would be required to cover. His comments reasonably indicate that, for every year the legislature waited to enact the COLAs, the fund would incur liability for more workers to the full extent of the COLAs payable to those workers. Moreover, although we agree with the fund that we must be cognizant of the legislature\u2019s intention to reduce the fund\u2019s liability in the 1991-1995 workers\u2019 compensation reforms, many of these reforms were directed at similarly reducing costs for the employer and insurance carrier. See, e.g., <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 40 (Reforms made in 1993 were \u201can effort to reduce the cost of the workers\u2019 compensation system after businesses complained that excessive costs were driving businesses out of the state and to ensure that the system worked as effectively as possible. See 36 H.R. Proc., [Pt. 18, 1993 Sess.], pp. 6142-46, remarks of Representative [Michael P.] Lawlor.\u201d). Therefore, Representative O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments do not undermine our interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Finally, the fund directs our attention to the Frankl memorandum. It claims that then chairman Frankl interpreted \u00a7 31-307a (c) therein as imposing liability on employers and insurers for COLAs accruing after October 1, 1997, and that we should give effect to that interpretation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, the fund notes that Frankl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>was \u201cclosely involved with all [the] debate over new workers\u2019 compensation laws in the development stage.\u201d Therefore, the fund contends that Frankl \u201cwas sharing what he knew to be true about the new law based upon personal knowledge gathered in the legislative process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We previously have not determined whether a commissioner\u2019s policy directive, which contains an interpretation not adopted pursuant to formal rule-making or adjudicatory procedures, is entitled to deference. Cf. <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 586, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2000) (federal Department of Labor\u2019s interpretation contained in opinion letter rejected because it is \u201cnot one arrived at after, for example, a formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking. Interpretations such as those in opinion letters\u2014like interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law\u2014do not warrant . . . deference\u201d as prescribed under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.

Nonetheless, in light of our failure to accord such deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that has been neither time-tested nor subject to judicial review; <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>261 Conn. 1, 13, 803 A.2d 879 (2002); <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 34; we cannot conceive of a rationale for according substantial deference to the Frankl memorandum under these circumstances. Moreover, in light of the persuasive evidence gleaned from the text of the statute and the legislative history that the legislature intended a contrary interpretation, we reject the interpretation set forth in the Frankl memorandum. We conclude, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>fore, that the board properly concluded that \u00a7 31-307a (c) imposes on the fund reimbursement obligations for all COLAs payable to qualified employees sustaining compensable injuries on or after July 1,1993, and before October 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> The defendant second injury fund appealed from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b.

If the maximum weekly compensation rate, as determined under the provisions of said section 31-309, to be effective as of any October first following the date of the injury, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate prevailing as of the date of injury, the weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive as of the date of injury shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum weekly compensation rate required by the provisions of said section 31-309 from the date of the injury to such October first. The cost-of-living adjustments provided under this subdivision shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the commissioner. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next succeeding twelve-month period commencing with October 1,1997, or the October first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>next succeeding the date of injury, whichever is later. With respect to any employee receiving benefits on October 1, 1997, with respect to any such injury occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, or with respect to any employee who was adjudicated to be totally incapacitated permanently subsequent to the date of his injury or is totally incapacitated permanently due to the fact that the employee has been totally incapacitated by such an injury for a period of five years or more, such benefit shall be recalculated to October 1, 1997, to the date of such adjudication or to the end of such five-year period, as the case may be, as if such benefits had been subject to recalculation annually under the provisions of this subsection. The difference between the amount of any benefits which would have been paid to such employee if such benefits had been subject to such recalculation and the actual amount of benefits paid during the period between such injury and such recalculation shall be paid to the dependent not later than December 1, 1997, or thirty days after such adjudication or the end of such period, as the case may be, in a lump-sum payment. The employer or his insurer shall be reimbursed by the Second Injury Fund, as provided in section 31-354, for adjustments, including lump-sum payments, payable under this subsection for compensable injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\"> The plaintiff is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\"> The record does not reflect clearly when the plaintiff filed his request for the COLAs. We infer, however, based on the date the plaintiff sustained his injury, the live year qualification period prescribed by \u00a7 31-307a (c); see footnote 2 of this opinion; and the date of the hearing on this request, that the plaintiff filed the request sometime after July 6, 1999, five years after the date of his iqjury, and before July 13, 2000, the date of the hearing before the commissioner on this request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\"> The fund filed with the board, concurrently with its appeal, a motion for articulation of the commissioner\u2019s decision. Specifically, in its motion for articulation, the fund requested that the commissioner clarify why he had failed to consider certain evidence the fund had presented, namely, the legislative debate on the act ultimately enacted as \u00a7 31-307a (c) and a September 10,1997 memorandum written by Jesse M. Frahkl, then chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission, in which Frankl had interpreted \u00a7 31-307a (c). On June 27, 2001, the commissioner filed with the board an articulation, stating, without further explanation, that he had reviewed the evidence and had not found it persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\"> The fund also claims that the commissioner improperly failed to consider and apply material facts in his findings, namely, the legislative history and the Frankl memorandum. The commissioner, however, stated in his articulation that he had considered that evidence, but ultimately found it unpersuasive. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Because we conclude herein that this evidence does not support the fund\u2019s interpretation of the statute, we do not address this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\"> Technically, the board had interpreted \u00a7 31-307a (c) prior to the present case. In a case decided just prior to, but issued contemporaneously with, the present case; <em>see Fiorillo </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>No. 4337 CRB-4-01-1 (November 19, 2001); the board construed \u00a7 31-307a (c) in the same manner as it had done in the present case. The fund also had appealed from that decision, but this court subsequently dismissed the appeal after the parties agreed that a critical factual premise on which the commissioner\u2019s decision was based was in error. For obvious reasons, Lufthansa has not asserted in the present case that the board\u2019s decision in <em>Fiorillo </em>constitutes a time-tested interpretation warranting deference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b449-4\"> The relevant portion of General Statutes \u00a7 31-307a (c) provides: \u201cWith respect to any employee receiving benefits on October 1,1997, with respect to any such injury occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, or with respect to any employee who was adjudicated to be totally incapacitated permanently subsequent to the date of his injury or is totally incapacitated permanently due to the fact that the employee has been totally incapacitated by such an injury for a period of five years or more, such benefit shall be recalculated to October 1, 1997, to the date of such adjudication or to the end of such five-year period, as the case may be, as if such benefits had been subject to recalculation annually under the provisions of this subsection. The difference between the amount of any benefits which would have been paid to such employee if such benefits had been subject to such recalculation and the actual amount of benefits paid during the period between such injury and such recalculation shall be paid to the dependent not later than December 1, 1997, or thirty days after such adjudication or the end of such period, as the case may be, in a lump-sum payment. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\"> At oral argument in this court, the question was posed to the fund as to what other adjustment, beside the lump sum payment to which \u00a7 31-307a (c) refers, the fund could be hable for reimbursement under its interpretation of the statute. The only scenario suggested by the fund was a situation in which an employee was entitled to a single adjustment payment, such as when the employee was injured one week prior to October 1, 1997, and, therefore, would be entitled, as of October 1, 1997, to one adjustment payment. In our view, it stretches the imagination to presume the legislature envisioned this isolated incident as the basis for the distinction in \u00a7 31-307a (c) providing \u201cadjustments, including lump-sum payments . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\"> Kehmna stated, when addressing the change from the insurance carriers\u2019 pre-1997 legal obligations, in which they had no liability for 1993-1997 COLAs: \u201cWe cannot collect a premium for a COLA that does not exist, but the basis of how we calculate premiums and how the Insurance Department approves what we charge, this is aprior approval line of business. We cannot reach back and correct a mistake that we made. If we make a bad guess as to what our exposure is in 1997, in 1998 we can\u2019t reach back and say, \u2018hey, we want to make up for our mess up there.\u2019 No. Sorry. It\u2019s done. You collect the premiums in 1997 for the accidents that occur in that year regardless of when they are actually paid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u201cSo for example, if you have a benefit that\u2019s paid out over a ten year period or a twenty year period, for an accident that occurred in 1997, you collected [a] premium in that year to cover those costs. I cannot, my members cannot, if you pass a COLA bill that applies to \u201993 to \u201997, cannot go back in 1998 and say, T need to collect more dollars for the \u201993 to \u201997-98 period.\u2019 That\u2019s not how the rating mechanism works.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u201cI would refer you to, I believe, [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 31-306 and 31-307a which show in 1977 and 1969, when this type of similar benefit was created, there was a way, the state came up with a way to reimburse the insurer or employer for that new COLA because they had reached back and created something retroactively.\u201d Conn.

The Legislature in its wisdom as a matter of social policy has created a benefit and given it retroactive application. The Legislature did not ask the insurance community or the employer community to pay for something that was not [in existence] when they reached back. It\u2019s a simple matter of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201c[Representative Donovan]: I\u2019m sure we can work out a plan to deal with that.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">\u201c[Senator Prague]: Fairness.

The memorandum provides in relevant part: \u201c[I]n all cases where the compensable injury occurred between July 1,1993 and October 1,1997, the injured employee or dependent will be entitled to receive a retroactive COLA payment to make up for the COLAs that were not paid. This lump-sum payment will be equivalent to the COLAs that the employee or dependent would have received if they had been entitled to COLAs all along from the date of the compensable injury. Employers and insurers are initially responsible for the retroactive COLA payment, which must be made by December 1, 1997, or within thirty days of 1he date it becomes due. Such employers and/or insurers will subsequently be reimbursed by the Second Iqjury Fund. <em>However, the regular COLA </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>paymentsfrom October 1, 1997 onward are the sole responsibility of the employer or insurer.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
