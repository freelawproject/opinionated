The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>rendered judgment dismissing the town\u2019s appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the department\u2019s declaratory ruling that the land is subject to the department\u2019s jurisdiction as \u201c \u2018water company land\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 25-32. The town appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from, and we affirm, the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The town is a municipality that operates its own water division as a governmental department under the town charter. The town\u2019s board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>of public utilities commission, whose commissioners are appointed by the town mayor and confirmed by the town council, supervises and sets policy for the water division.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Water division personnel are town employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-240,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the water division is a self-sustaining entity, the funds of which are held separately from the town\u2019s general fund; all moneys received by the water division are used for the provision of water service. The water division\u2019s operation is paid for by the businesses and residents that it serves; not all residents or businesses are connected to the water division\u2019s water supply system. The water division\u2019s budget, however, is controlled and approved by the town council. Moreover, the public utilities commission has no authority to develop a budget or operate the water division without town council approval, and the water division does not pay taxes to the town. The town purchases insurance for the water division; that cost, however, is recouped annually through the division\u2019s rates. Under the town charter, any land purchased by the water division must be acquired in the name of the town. When the water division discontinues the use of any such property, the use of the property reverts to the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">In January, 1999, the town purchased the parcel at issue in this case, the Cooke property, for open space or other necessary purposes. No water division funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>were used to make the purchase. The property is located within the watershed of the south central regional water authority, which supplies the New Haven region with drinking water. Although the property is part of the watershed, potentially impacting New Haven\u2019s drinking water, it has no effect on the town\u2019s drinking water supply. In May, 1999, the mayor, on behalf of the town, notified the department that the property had been purchased and that the town was considering constructing a golf course on the Cooke property. In June and July, 1999, the department notified the town that a permit was required to change the property\u2019s use, such as by constructing a golf course, despite the fact that the property is not part of the watershed impacting the <em>town\u2019s </em>water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">In March, 2000, the town filed this petition with the department seeking a declaratory ruling to determine whether the Cooke property was, pursuant to \u00a7 25-32, subject to the department\u2019s jurisdiction as \u201cwater company land.\u201d The town claimed that the statute was not applicable because the town could not be considered a water company; therefore, the town contended that the land at issue was not water company property. The department ruled that the statute applied to all land owned by the town, and that the property was, therefore, subject to department jurisdiction as \u201cwater company land located on a public drinking water supply watershed.\u201d In issuing its ruling, the department noted the town\u2019s \u201cspecial duties and responsibilities to the public\u201d because of its role as a governmental entity that is also a water company.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The town appealed from the department\u2019s ruling to the trial court. While that appeal was pending in the trial court, the General Assembly enacted Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-4, \u00a7 13 (Spec. Sess. P.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>01-4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This act resolved the specific controversy over the Cooke property that led to the town\u2019s request for the department\u2019s declaratory ruling. It permits \u201cany municipality owning land purchased in January, 1999, that was formerly used for agricultural purposes and that is watershed land or is located adjacent to watershed land [to] use such municipally-owned land for the construction and operation of a golf course,\u201d subject to certain environmental protection conditions on land ownership and management. Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 13; see footnote 5 of this opinion. The trial court ruled as a threshold matter that the legislation did not render the case moot because it did not resolve the issue of the department\u2019s jurisdiction over the remainder of the town\u2019s nonwater utility land. Both parties agreed with the trial court\u2019s mootness determination because the town owned other land not used for water utility purposes that might also be subject to the department\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Turning to the merits of the case, the trial court then applied the standard of review set forth by this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>in <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; </em>Opportunities, 232 Conn. 91, 109, 653 A.2d 782 (1995),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and noted that the department\u2019s factual findings were uncontested. The trial court then proceeded to construe the language and legislative history of \u00a7 25-32. It concluded that the town was a water company explicitly subject to regulation by the department, and that requiring it to comply with the department\u2019s water supply planning requirements would not harm the town, while at the same time it would effectuate the legislative policy of protecting Connecticut\u2019s drinking water. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the town\u2019s appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">As a threshold matter, we first address whether the trial court properly concluded that the passage of Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 13, did not render the matter moot because of the effect of the department\u2019s ruling on the other town owned, nonwater utility lands.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ment claims that the matter is not moot because Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4 does not change the ruling that the town government is a water company subject to its jurisdiction, or negate the regulatory scheme, except for the limited authorization to use the property in question as a golf course. The town contends that the matter is not moot because its position is that the Cooke property is not subject to department jurisdiction in any way, whatever its intended use. The town also claims that this case falls into the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine. See <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 385, 660 A.2d 323 (1995). We agree with the parties and the trial court that this matter is not moot. We base our conclusion, however, on the collateral consequences doctrine, as recently stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>261 Conn. 198, 802 A.2d 74 (2002), and <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>261 Conn. 219, 802 A.2d 778 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Mootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because it \u201cimplicates [this] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction . . . .\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>257 Conn. 409, 412, 778 A.2d 862 (2001). Indeed, we are required to address this question of justiciability, even in the \u201cunusual situation\u201d where all of the parties agree that the matter is not moot. Id. We begin with \u201cthe four part test for justiciability established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 445 A.2d 304 (1982). . . . \u2018Because courts are established to resolve actual controversies, before a claimed controversy is entitled to a resolution on the merits it must be justiciable. Justiciability requires (1) that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute ... (2) that the interests of the parties be adverse ... (3) that the matter in controversy be capable of being adjudicated by judicial power . . . and (4) that the determination of the controversy will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>result in practical relief to the complainant.\u2019 . . . Id., 111-12.\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The mootness doctrine is rooted in the first factor of the <em>Nardini </em>test. <em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 204-205. It is founded on \u201cthe same policy interests as the doctrine of standing, namely, to assure the vigorous presentation of arguments concerning the matter at issue. . . . This court recently reiterated that the standing doctrine is designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 204. Indeed, we note that \u201ccourts are called upon to determine existing controversies, and thus may not be used as a vehicle to obtain advisory judicial opinions on points of law.\u201d Id., 204-205.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">\u201c[A]n actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pendency of the appeal. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 205. However, under \u201cthis court\u2019s long-standing mootness jurisprudence . . . despite developments during the pendency of an appeal that would otherwise render a claim moot, the court may retain jurisdiction when a litigant shows that \u2018there is a reasonable possibility that prejudicial collateral consequences will occur.\u2019 Id., 208 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">\u201c [T]o invoke successfully the collateral consequences doctrine, the litigant must show that there is a reasonable possibility that prejudicial collateral consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>will occur. Accordingly, the litigant must establish these consequences by more than mere conjecture, but need not demonstrate that these consequences are more probable than not. This standard provides the necessary limitations on justiciability underlying the mootness doctrine itself. Where there is no direct practical relief available from the reversal of the judgment, as in this case, the collateral consequences doctrine acts as a surrogate, calling for a determination whether a decision in the case can afford the litigant some practical relief in the future.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 221-23, is particularly instructive on the showing necessary, in the context of administrative appeals, to establish a reasonable possibility of collateral consequences.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Williams, </em>the commissioner of children and families issued a decision revoking the plaintiffs special study foster care license as a consequence for violating certain department foster care regulations. Id. The commissioner then initiated proceedings to remove the foster children, who were the subjects of the original foster care license, from the plaintiffs home. Id., 223. The plaintiff responded by filing a habeas coipus petition seeking legal custody of the children, along with a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>temporaneous administrative appeal. Id. While the administrative appeal was pending, the plaintiff was granted legal custody of the two children as a result of the habeas corpus petition. Id., 224. As legal guardian, the plaintiff no longer needed the special foster care license and the trial court dismissed her administrative appeal as moot. Id. We, however, concluded that the dismissal on mootness grounds was improper. Id., 224; see id., 228-29. We noted that the commissioner could use the plaintiffs license revocation against her in future department proceedings; id., 227; a consequence that was not unduly speculative because of \u201cthe reasonable possibility that a person, such as the plaintiff, who has agreed selflessly to become a foster parent to children not her own, will again in the future become a foster parent and have occasion to interact with the department.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 229. We concluded that, under the totality of circumstances, the matter was not moot and the trial court could retain jurisdiction because the plaintiff had sufficiently established the reasonable possibility of prejudicial collateral consequences from the commissioner\u2019s decision. Id., 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In the present case, we are satisfied that, under the totality of the circumstances, there is a reasonable possibility of prejudicial collateral consequences for the town from the department\u2019s ruling. The department\u2019s ruling declaring the town a water company potentially subjects the town to statutory responsibilities that exceed the boundaries of the Cooke property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 25-32 et seq. Moreover, the planning for the golf course is still in an embryonic stage; regardless of whether a golf course is ever built on the subject land,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the town\u2019s land remains subject to the department\u2019s jurisdiction as a result of the original agency ruling. We, therefore, conclude that Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 13, did not render this case moot because of the prejudicial collateral consequences for the town from the department\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The first substantive issue in this appeal is whether the trial court applied the proper standard of review in its analysis of the department\u2019s declaratory ruling by applying the standard set forth in <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 109. See footnote 6 of this opinion. The town claims that the trial court misapplied <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>by omitting the portion of that opinion declining to give deference to agency decisions involving questions of law not previously subject to judicial scrutiny; <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 110; thereby resulting in an improperly deferential review of the department\u2019s statutory interpretation. The department contends that the trial court properly deferred to the department\u2019s factual findings while correctly engaging in a broader review of its legal conclusions and statutory interpretation. We agree with the department and conclude that the trial court applied the correct standard of review in this administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The standard of review applied by the trial court is an accurate statement of the well established law governing judicial review of statutory interpretations by administrative agencies. In <em>Cadlerock Properties Joint Venture, L.P. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>253 Conn. 661, 669, 757 A.2d 1 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1148, 121 S. Ct. 1089, 148 L. Ed. 2d 963 (2001), we stated: \u201cAlthough the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law ... it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts. . . . We also have held that an exception is made when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Accord <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 109 (\u201c[a]s we have stated many times, the factual and discretionary determinations of administrative agencies are to be given considerable weight by the courts . . . [however] it is for the courts, and not for administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]). Our review of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, with its thorough analysis of the language and legislative history of \u00a7 25-32, indicates that the trial court applied the proper standard of review and did not give improper deference to the department\u2019s statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">CONSTRUCTION OF GENERAL STATUTES (REV. TO 1999) \u00a7 25-32</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">We next consider the principal issue in this case, which is whether the trial court properly construed \u00a7 25-32 when it concluded that the department has jurisdiction over town owned land not used for water utility purposes. The town claims that the trial court\u2019s interpretation was improper because both the statutory framework and the legislative history evince the legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>intent to confine the statute\u2019s application to only those town owned properties used for water utility purposes. The department contends that the statutory language and legislative purpose support a broad construction of the statute and its application to all town owned land. We agree with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\u201cStatutory interpretation is a matter of law over which this court\u2019s review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 259 Conn. 855, 861, 792 A.2d 774 (2002). We follow the method of statutory interpretation recently articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">\u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>language, broadly understood, axe directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 577-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The present case is this court\u2019s first opportunity to construe \u00a7 25-32. We start our analysis with the relevant statutory language, and note the broad phrasing of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 25-32 (a), which provides that the department \u201cshall have jurisdiction over <em>all </em>matters concerning the purity and adequacy of any <em>source of water </em>or ice supply used by <em>any </em>municipality, public institution or water or ice company for obtaining water or ice, the safety of any distributing plant and system for public health purposes, the adequacy of methods used to assure water purity, <em>and such other matters relating to the construction and operation of such distributing plant and system as may affect public health. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) See footnote 1 of this opinion. Subsection (b) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 25-32 then provides: \u201cNo <em>water company </em>shall sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of or <em>change the use of any watershed lands, </em>except as provided in section 25-43c, without a written permit from the Commissioner of Public Health. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) See footnote 1 of this opinion. The remainder of subsection (b) and subsections (c) through (e) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 25-32 describe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>permitting process and the factors that the department commissioner should consider in granting permits for two of the three classes<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of water company land.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See footnote 1 of this opinion. Finally, subsections (f) through <em>(j) </em>of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 25-32 provide additional definitions, directives and authority for the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The applicability of \u00a7 25-32 is controlled by the definition of the term of \u201cwater company.\u201d A statutory definition for \u201cwater company\u201d is provided by General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 25-32a,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and it includes \u201cany . . . <em>municipality . </em>. . which owns, maintains, operates, manages, controls or employs any pond, lake, reservoir, well, stream or distributing plant or system that supplies water to two or more consumers or to twenty-five or more persons on a regular basis . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) See footnote 15 of this opinion. Thus, the precise question presented in this case is whether the trial court properly construed the term \u201cmunicipality\u201d under \u00a7 25-32a to encompass the town, rather than limiting it to the town\u2019s water division as a separate entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the town is a \u201cwater company\u201d within the \u00a7 25-32a definition, thus subjecting it to the department\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 25-32. It is undisputed that the town is a municipality controlling the water division. The language of the statute is the most important guide to determining the legislature\u2019s intent; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 578; this statutory definition, therefore, strongly suggests the conclusion that the town is included within the definition of \u201cwater company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Moreover, this strong linguistic suggestion is supported by our review of the pertinent legislative history. The legislature enacted Public Acts 1977, No. 77-606, \u00a7 4, subsequently codified as \u00a7 25-32, as a result of rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>ommendations by the council on water company lands, an agency created in 1975 \u201cto recommend to the Legislature a comprehensive policy on disposition of the lands held by water utilities.\u201d 20 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14,1977 Sess., p. 5855, remarks of Representative Dorothy S. McCluskey. Public Act 77-606 implemented the land classification and department review scheme of \u00a7 25-32; it expressly stated in the section codified as General Statutes \u00a7 25-37a<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that the statutes were intended to protect the state\u2019s water supply and noted that watershed \u201clands constitute a significant portion of the remaining undeveloped and open space lands in close proximity to the urbanized areas of the state, and that it is in the public interest that there be established criteria for the orderly disposition of such lands. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 25-32 et seq. are \u201cstatutes whose object is the protection and preservation of the public health\u201d that</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>we deem remedial in purpose; accordingly, we construe them liberally. <em>State </em>v. <em>Racskowski, </em>86 Conn. 677, 680, 86 A. 606 (1913); accord <em>BEC Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>256 Conn. 602, 621-22, 775 A.2d 928 (2001) (\u201c[o]ur conclusion that the individual [corporate officers] personally are hable under [General Statutes] \u00a7 22a-432 is supported by the broad remedial purpose of the act, which is to protect the waters of the state from pollution\u201d). Our reading of the broad language of \u00a7 25-32a serves to effectuate the legislative policy of protecting the adequacy and purity of Connecticut\u2019s drinking water. We, therefore, reject the town\u2019s narrower interpretation of these statutes\u2019 applicability<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> because it thwarts the legislature\u2019s goal of providing maximum protection for Connecticut\u2019s drinking water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The town cites to General Statutes \u00a7 7-234<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> et seq., the statutes providing for the establishment of munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>pal waterworks systems, as support for the proposition that the legislature intended the water division to be an entity legally distinct from the town government itself; thereby drawing a distinction between land owned or utilized by the water division and land owned by a municipality\u2019s general government. The department responds by arguing that the town and the water division constitute a single economic enterprise for regulatory purposes. We agree with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The town specifically cites to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-235<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and 7-240<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> as support for its contention that the town and the water division are separate legal entities. Section 7-235 allows municipalities to issue revenue bonds for the construction, enlargement or maintenance of waterworks systems and provides that the municipalities are only obligated to pay the bonds from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>water utility net revenue; the bonds do \u201cnot constitute a general indebtedness of such municipality within any statutory limitation.\u201d See footnote 20 of this opinion. Section 7-240 requires municipalities to keep water utility funds separate from other municipal accounts, with no commingling, and provides that those moneys \u201cshall be used for such waterworks system and for no other purpose.\u201d See footnote 4 of this opinion. The town\u2019s reliance on these statutes is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The town\u2019s argument is supported by neither the statutory language nor the legislative history of \u00a7 7-234 et seq. The legislature contemplated no legal distinction between the municipality and its water division; both the language and the legislative discussion focus on the responsibilities of \u201cmunicipalities,\u201d not their water divisions or water departments. See 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1967 Sess., p. 3345, remarks of Representative A. Lucille Matarese; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1967 Sess., p. 435, remarks of attorney Isaac Russell (statement supporting enactment). Moreover, the statutory language and the available legislative history indicate that these statutes solely govern municipal water utility financing, and, therefore, cannot be construed as diminishing municipalities\u2019 public health or environmental protection responsibilities. Representative David H. Neiditz, sponsor of the bill that was enacted as 1967 Public Acts, No. 780, and codified as General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1967) \u00a7 7-234, stated that \u201cgenerally modemiz[ing] the statutes in an area of water and sewer bonding ... is such an important area today when <em>we are concerned with water pollu</em>tion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, pp. 394-95. We, therefore, do not read these statutes as evincing any legislative desire to deem municipalities and their water divisions to be separate legal entities, especially where such a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>struction would frustrate the goal of protecting the drinking water supply.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We also agree with the department\u2019s contention that treating the town and its water division as separate entities would create an invitation for the town to frustrate the legislature\u2019s intent and avoid the department\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction by transferring the classified land to otherwise \u201cexempt\u201d divisions. The courts of this state have never countenanced the tactic of avoiding regulation via organizational \u201c \u2018Balkanization.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care </em>v. <em>Lakoff </em>214 Conn. 321, 332, 572 A.2d 316 (1990) (rejecting restrictive interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-145, now \u00a7 19a-630, defining \u201c \u2018health care facility or institution\u2019 \u201d where that \u201creading . . . would enable providers of health care services to avoid regulation by the commission by the mere juggling of corporate entities or careful allocation of services to different operations. Such \u2018Balkanization\u2019 of inherently unitary health services can only chip away at the commission\u2019s authority in this vitally important area of service to Connecticut\u2019s citizens.\u201d); see also <em>General Telephone Co. of the Southwest </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 F.2d 846, 855 (5th Cir. 1971) (\u201c[w]here the statutory purpose could thus be easily frustrated through the use of separate corporate entities, the Commission is entitled to look through corporate form and treat the separate entities as one and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>the same for purposes of regulation\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We, therefore, conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the town government is a municipal \u201cwater company\u201d whose land is subject to the department\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 25-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">In this opinion BORDEN and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-14\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 25-32 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The Department of Public Health shall have jurisdiction over all matters concerning the purity and adequacy of any source of water or ice supply used by any municipality, public institution or water or ice company for obtaining water or ice, the safety of any distributing plant and system for public health purposes, the adequacy of methods used to assure water purity, and such other matters relating to the construction and operation of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>distributing plant and system as may affect public health.

We, therefore, will not address what would potentially constitute compliance, by the town, with each discrete statutory requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\"> Indeed, the town\u2019s counsel noted at oral argument before this court that the golf course may well never be built.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\"> The town claims that this case is not moot because of the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine. We take the opportunity to clarify the difference between the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d mootness exception, and the collateral consequences doctrine. Both doctrines are exceptions to the mootness doctrine because they arise when no consequences can flow directly from adjudication of the case before us, and therefore, the case would be presumptively moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The key analytical distinction lies in the type of injury; the collateral consequences doctrine applies when the collateral consequences of the contested court action, such as the continuing stigma of a criminal conviction, constitute a continuing injury to the specific litigant, justifying the court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction over the dispute, despite the lack of any consequences flowing from the adjudication directly at issue in the appeal. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 226. Thus, a live controversy continues to exist between the parties because of that continuing injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">By contrast, the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d rule reflects the \u201cfunctionally insurmountable time constraints\u201d present in certain types of disputes. <em>Conetta </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>246 Conn. 281, 297, 715 A.2d 756 (1998). Paradigmatic examples are abortion cases and other medical treatment disputes. See <em>Stamford Hospital </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>236 Conn. 646, 654-55, 674 A.2d 821 (1996) (validity of injunctions permitting nonconsensual blood transfusions); <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 385 (providing examples). \u201c[F]or an otherwise moot question to qualify for review under the \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 exception, it must meet three requirements. First, the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>to act as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance. Unless all three requirements are met, the appeal must be dismissed as moot.\u201d <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 382-83. Thus, this exception to the mootness doctrine is rooted in a determination that, when its requirements are met, public policy requires that we decide the question, despite the fact that our decision will have no direct consequences in the case before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 25-37c provides: \u201cThe Department of Public Health shall adopt, in accordance with chapter 54, regulations establishing criteria and performance standards for three classes of water-company-owned land.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">\u201c(a) Class I land includes all land owned by a water company or acquired from a water company through foreclosure or other involuntary transfer of ownership or control which is either: (1) Within two hundred and fifty feet of high water of a reservoir or one hundred feet of all watercourses as defined in agency regulations adopted pursuant to this section; (2) within the areas along watercourses which are covered by any of the critical components of a stream belt; (3) land with slopes fifteen per cent or greater without significant interception by wetlands, sw;ales and natural depressions between the slopes and the watercourses; (4) within two hundred feet of groundwater wells; (5) an identified direct recharge area or outcrop of aquifer now in use or available for future use, or (6) an area with shallow depth to bedrock, twenty inches or less, or poorly drained or very poorly drained soils as defined by the United States Soil Conservation Service that are contiguous to land described in subdivision (3) or (4) of this subsection and that extend to the top of the slope above the receiving watercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">\u201c(b) Class II land includes all land owned by a water company or acquired from a water company through foreclosure or other involuntary transfer of ownership or control which is either (1) on a public drinking supply watershed which is not included in class I or (2) completely off a public drinking supply watershed and which is within one hundred and fifty feet of a distribution reservoir or a first-order stream tributary to a distribution reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">\u201c(c) Class III land includes all land owned by a water company or acquired from a water company through foreclosure or other involuntary transfer of ownership or control which is unimproved land off public drinking supply watersheds and beyond one hundred and fifty 1'eet from a distribution reservoir or first-order stream tributary to a distribution reservoir.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\"> Unlike class I or class II land, water company land in the class III category is not subject to restrictions on alienation or change of use.

J., with whom ZARELLA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AtS\">joins, concurring. I concur in the majority\u2019s judgment that the defendant, the department of public health, has regulatory jurisdiction over all of the property belonging to the plaintiff, the town of Wallingford, that is \u201cwatershed land\u201d pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 25-32 (b), subject to the plaintiffs right to build a golf course on the Cooke property pursuant to Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-4, \u00a7 13 (Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4). I write separately to express my disagreement from the majority with regard to three components of its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">First, I agree with the majority that this appeal is not moot. In my view, however, this is because Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 13, does not prevent us from providing the practical relief requested by the plaintiffs petition for a declaratory ruling and its administrative appeal. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>261 Conn. 198, 208, 802 A.2d 74 (2002). Accordingly, I see no need to employ the collateral consequences doctrine as does the majority. See id. My conclusion rests upon an analysis of the precise nature of the plaintiffs claims and the resolution of those claims by the defendant and the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The plaintiff broadly sought a declaratory ruling from the defendant as \u201cto the applicability of ... \u00a7 25-32 et seq. to Town-owned, non-utility land.\u201d The impetus for this request was that the plaintiff was \u201cconsidering changing the use of the Cooke property.\u201d The defendant issued a declaratory ruling in which it found that the plaintiff had purchased the property for \u201copen space purposes or such other purposes as the [plaintiff] may decide are necessary\u201d and that \u201cthe [plaintiff] was investigating the feasibility of creating a golf course on the property.\u201d The defendant ultimately concluded that the Cooke property was subject to its jurisdiction. The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, claiming that \u201cthe Cooke property is not subject to ... \u00a7 25-32 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">While the plaintiffs appeal was pending, Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 13, was enacted and took effect. That act provided, in effect, that the plaintiff may use the Cooke property for \u201cthe construction and operation of a golf course,\u201d subject to certain conditions including that: (1) the plaintiff own the course; (2) the course be designed, constructed and operated in accordance with practices as specified by the department of environmental protection; and (3) the plaintiff file certain reports related to the environmental management of the course. Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Subsequently, the trial court concluded that, despite the intervening passage of the public act, the appeal was not moot because the \u201cissue of the department\u2019s jurisdiction over what the plaintiff has termed \u2018town-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>owned, non-utility land\u2019 \u201d was still in dispute. Ultimately, the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">From this procedural history, I conclude the following. First, the plaintiffs petition for a declaratory ruling and its administrative appeal were both wholly silent as to the intended use of the Cooke property as a golf course. Second, the plaintiffs petition for a declaratory ruling and its administrative appeal were not limited to a request for a determination of the applicability of \u00a7 25-32 (b), but rather requested a ruling as to the applicability of all of the defendant\u2019s regulatory powers pursuant to \u00a7 25-32 et seq. Third, Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 13, mooted only the question of whether the plaintiff would need to receive a \u00a7 25-32 (b) permit were it to build a golf course. Fourth, the trial court\u2019s holding applied beyond the Cooke property and extended to all \u201ctown-owned, non-utility land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Thus, in my view, there is no need to resort to the collateral consequences doctrine, because, were we to reverse the judgment, the plaintiff would then be free to: (1) change the use of the Cooke property to something other than a golf course without seeking a \u00a7 25-32 (b) permit; (2) refuse to list the Cooke property as well as other property that it owns on its water supply plans pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 25-32d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) change the use of other watershed property without being subject to the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 25-32 (b) regulatory jurisdiction. None of this relief is provided by Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 13, and, thus, the case is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Second, although the majority does not reach the question of whether the plaintiff is required to list the Cooke property on its water supply plan pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>\u00a7 25-32d; see footnote 10 of the majority opinion; I would reach this issue and conclude that the plaintiff is not so required. Although, I acknowledge that this was not the plaintiffs primary issue on appeal, the issue is fairly encompassed within the plaintiffs petition for a declaratory ruling and was raised in both the trial court and in this court. Accordingly, I would reach the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 25-32d provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) Any water supply plan submitted pursuant to this section shall evaluate <em>the water supply needs in the service area of the water company </em>submitting the plan and propose a strategy to meet such needs. The plan shall include ... (6) a forecast of any future land sales, an identification which includes the acreage and location of any land proposed to be sold, sources of public water supply to be abandoned and any land owned by the company which it has designated, or plans to designate, as class III land . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Thus, I would interpret the application of \u00a7 25-32d listings to be restricted to those lands that might potentially affect the \u201cwater supply needs in the service area of the water company . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 25-32d (b). The defendant\u2019s own regulations implementing this statutory provision support this interpretation. The defendant requires that a water supply plan contain: \u201cA <em>description of the existing water supply system, including </em>... a list and description of: water company owned lands . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 25-32d-3 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">It is undisputed that the Cooke property has no effect on the <em>plaintiffs </em>water supply. Thus, the plaintiff is not required to list the Cooke property on its water supply plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is, however, subject to the defendant\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>\u00a7 25-32 (b) powers to the extent that those powers have not been limited by Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 13. This is because the \u00a7 25-32 (b) permitting process applies to \u201cany watershed lands,\u201d whether or not such lands have an impact upon the plaintiffs water supply or some other water company\u2019s water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Finally, I write to express my disagreement with the majority\u2019s unpersuasive use of legislative history to bolster its conclusion. In my view, that history simply fails to illuminate, in the slightest, the question at bar in this case. Therefore, I believe that the majority opinion provides yet another example of the misuse of such history, like those that Justice Zarella persuasively criticized in his dissent, in which I joined, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 597, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">As noted previously, the primary question in this appeal is whether all of the watershed lands owned by the plaintiff are subject to the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 25-32 (b) permitting powers. The majority states that the legislative history supports its conclusion that the plaintiffs lands are so subject. The only legislative history cited in support of its conclusion, however, at best, simply supports the express broad <em>statutory </em>purpose to provide for the orderly disposition of watershed lands as an important natural resource. In my view, as the majority itself seems to acknowledge, the legislative history that it cites adds nothing to its statutory argument. Hence, I do not see how this legislative history supports its conclusion. Consequently, I would rely solely on the statutory text in interpreting the relevant statutory provisions in this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\"> The trial court\u2019s decision is ambiguous as to whether it concluded that the plaintiff is required to list the Cooke property in its \u00a7 25-32d water supply plan. As discussed subsequently, the majority opinion does not determine whether the plaintiff is required to list the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\"> The defendant may, however, have regulatory jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 25-32d (b) over certain other lands of the plaintiff, as long as those lands are related to the \u201cwater supply needs in the service area of the water company . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
