Warden, FCI-Miami, </em>No. 13-14931, 757 F.3d 1283, 2014 WL 3673382 (11th Cir. July 15, 2014), and substitute this revised opinion in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-15\">Nicolas Jeanty, Jr., a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s decision denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He contends that the district court erred in ruling that he could not rely on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), to attack his sentence on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-19\">A federal grand jury indicted Jeanty in May 2005. He fled the country and was not arrested until November 2008. Before the trial, the government filed a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 notice that it would seek a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years based on Jeanty\u2019s 1997 conviction for importing cocaine. Jeanty was tried and convicted in 2009 for (1) conspiring to possess with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, and (2) attempting to possess with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. At the sentence hearing, the district court determined that Jeanty\u2019s 1997 conviction qualified as \u201ca prior conviction for a felony drug offense\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) and sentenced him to the statutory minimum of 120 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-20\">Jeanty mounted several challenges to his convictions and sentence. He began by filing a direct appeal with this Court. We affirmed his convictions in December 2009. <em>See United States v. Jeanty, </em>358 Fed.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>Appx. 55 (11th Cir.2009). He then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in June 2010. The district court denied the motion in July 2010. The district court refused to grant Jeanty a certificate of appealability (COA), and we dismissed his appeal in October 2010 for lack of prosecution. About two years later, in November 2012, Jeanty filed a motion for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4). The district court denied his motion that same month, and in July 2018 we denied his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">Jeanty filed the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition at issue in this appeal on October 1, 2013. He argued that, under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>138 S.Ct. at 2163, the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by failing to submit to the jury the question of whether he had a prior conviction that qualified him for the ten-year mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The district court dismissed his petition after determining that Jeanty was challenging the validity of his sentence and that his challenge did not qualify for review under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). To challenge his sentence, Jeanty has to establish that he meets all of \u201cthe five specific requirements a \u00a7 2241 petitioner must satisfy to proceed under \u00a7 2255(e).\u201d <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2013). Those five requirements are: (1) throughout the petitioner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, this Court\u2019s precedent had specifically and squarely foreclosed the claim raised in the \u00a7 2241 petition; (2) after the petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the Supreme Court overturned that binding precedent; (3) that Supreme Court decision applies retroactively on collateral review; (4) as a result of that Supreme Court decision applying retroactively, the petitioner\u2019s current sentence exceeds the statutory maximum; and (5) the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) reaches his claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1274. We do not address all five requirements because doing so is not necessary to decide this case. Jeanty fails to satisfy the third requirement, which is that the new rule announced in <em>Alleyne </em>applies retroactively on collateral review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-9\">Jeanty does not meet <em>Bryant\u2019s </em>third requirement because <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>See id. </em>First, neither <em>Alleyne </em>itself nor any later Supreme Court decision holds that <em>Alleyne </em>is retroactive. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1250 n. 3 (11th Cir.2014). Second, the <em>Alleyne </em>Court explained that its holding was an application of the rule established in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, see Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2163 (applying <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (2000)), and we have repeatedly held that Apprendi\u2019s rule does not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>See, e.g., Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1281-82 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not retroactively apply to \u00a7 2241 petitions); <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not retroactively apply to \u00a7 2255 motions). If Apprendi\u2019s rule is not retroactive on collateral review, then neither is a decision applying its rule. <em>See In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that decisions \u201cbased on an extension of <em>Apprendi </em>\u201d are not retro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>active); <em>see also Simpson v. United States, </em>721 F.3d 875, 876 (7th Cir.2013) (concluding that <em>Alleyne </em>is not retroactive because <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactive). Finally, every one of our sister circuits to consider the issue in a published decision has concluded that <em>Alleyne </em>is not retroactively applicable on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Winkelman, </em>746 F.3d 134, 136 (3d Cir.2014); <em>In re Kemper, </em>735 F.3d 211, 212 (5th Cir.2013); <em>Simpson, </em>721 F.3d at 876. We therefore conclude that Jeanty has not met Bryant\u2019s third requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Jeanty also fails to satisfy Bryant\u2019s fourth requirement, which is that a retroactive application of <em>Alleyne </em>would mean that his current sentence exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by Congress for his crime. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. He was sentenced to ten years (120 months) in prison, but 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(ii) provides that the maximum sentence for Jeanty, who was convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine, is forty years. Ten is less than forty. Thus even if <em>Alleyne </em>applied retroactively, Jeanty\u2019s current sentence would not exceed the statutory maximum authorized by Congress in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">Finally, even assuming that Jeanty could satisfy all five of Bryant\u2019s requirements, his petition is without merit. He argues that he could not receive the mandatory minimum unless the jury \u2014 not the judge \u2014 found that his 1997 conviction qualified as \u201ca prior conviction for a felony drug offense\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). But the <em>Alleyne </em>Court took pains to point out that its holding did not upset its previous ruling in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>which held that the fact of a prior conviction is not an \u201celement\u201d that must be found by a <em>jury. See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1 (citing <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)). So <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>forecloses Jeanty\u2019s claim. <em>See United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
