Hilton, Jr., Trust Services, Inc., James A. Huguenard, and Randall D. Grooms, Jr. (collectively, the \"Defendants\" or \"Trustees\") to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (the \"Defendant's Motion\") [Adv. Docket No. 81]. Richard Smith, Mark Little, and Larry Garrett (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\") oppose the Motion [Adv. Docket No. 88]. The Plaintiffs have also filed their own Motion to Dismiss [Adv. Docket No. 92], which the Trustees oppose [Adv. Docket No. 114].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court will GRANT the Trustees' Motion in part and DENY the Plaintiffs' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Swan Transportation Company (the \"Debtor\") filed a Chapter 11 petition on December 20, 2001. For many years preceding the petition, Tyler Pipe and Foundry, one of Debtor's subsidiaries, used asbestos and silica in the manufacture of a variety of its products. Many of the employees who worked with those materials suffered injuries and brought tort claims against the Debtor, eventually forcing it to seek Chapter 11 protection. As is common in bankruptcy cases of this stripe, the prepackaged plan (the \"Plan\") [Docket No. 47] created an asbestos/silica litigation trust (the \"Trust\") which was designed to provide for the claims of future claimants once their asbestos or silica related injuries were diagnosed. This Court entered an Order confirming the Plan on July 21, 2003 (the \"Confirmation Order\") [Docket No. 455]. The record further reflects that the Trust was funded with cash and securities to provide for recovery on claims against the Debtor relating to asbestos or silica exposure. Defendants Randall Grooms, W.D. Hilton, and James Huguenard were appointed in 2003 to serve as Trustees under the Trust, and each has continued in that capacity to this day. Defendant Trust Services, Inc. is a Texas corporation and was hired by the Trust to perform administrative functions for the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May of 2015, each of the Plaintiffs filed claims with the Trust seeking payment on account of alleged injuries arising from exposure to asbestos while in the Debtor's employ. Plaintiff Mark Little's\n   claim was deemed allowed and he was recognized as a beneficiary of the Trust. Consequently, the record reflects that the Trust paid him at the current percentage established under the Trust's claims resolution procedures. The record reflects that the personal injury claims of Messrs. Smith and Garrett have been rejected or disallowed by the Trust, which determined that they did not suffer from qualifying injuries. Messrs. Smith and Garrett assert that their claims were wrongfully denied, but as of the date of briefing the reconsideration and appeal process provided under the Trust has not been concluded as to their claims. Each of the Plaintiffs allege that the Trustees have breached statutory and fiduciary duties in their administration of the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The procedural history and posture of this matter is more than a little complicated. On May 20, 2016, all three Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Trustees in the County Court of Law in Smith County, Texas (the \"Texas State Court\"). The Plaintiffs alleged a breach of fiduciary duty by the Trustees administering the Trust and requested several forms of relief, including disgorgement of Trustee fees and expenses, removal of the Trustees, appointment of a receiver for the Trust, and other equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Trustees filed a motion to remove that proceeding from the Texas State Court to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the \"Texas District Court\"). After removal, the Trustees filed a motion to transfer venue of the proceeding to this Court. The Plaintiffs objected to the venue transfer request and filed a motion to remand the dispute back to the Texas State Court. Through comprehensive rulings by the United States Magistrate Judge, which were adopted by the Texas District Court, the Plaintiffs' motion to remand the matter was denied and the Trustees' motion to transfer venue was granted. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and subsequently referred to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   There are a number of motions before this Court. The Trustees filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint [Docket No. 81] along with a Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Exhibits [Docket No. 96]. In their Motion to Dismiss, the Trustees request that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, with prejudice, and without leave to amend. The Plaintiffs have filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, and Alternatively, to Abstain [Docket No. 92]. By their Motion, the Plaintiffs request that this Court remand the case back to the Texas State Court either by abstaining in favor of that court, or by dismissing this adversary proceeding for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(b)(1).

Plaintiffs have alleged this Court does not have jurisdiction, citing to numerous facts including that the bankruptcy case has been closed for nearly a decade, that the litigants herein are unrelated to the reorganized Debtor, and the outcome of this adversary proceeding will have no effect on the Debtors' reorganization Plan. This Court and the courts in Texas disagree. Bankruptcy courts \"plainly [have] jurisdiction to interpret and enforce [their] own prior orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Travelers Indent. Co. v.

As noted by the Texas District Court and further discussed below, this matter relates to the interpretation and enforcement of this Court's Confirmation Order and thus constitutes a core matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    In re FormTech Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780479\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/439/352/#p357\">\n    439 B.R. 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 (Bankr. D. Del. 2010) (\"Enforcement and interpretation of orders issued in core proceedings are also considered core proceedings within the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     THE PARTIES' POSITIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Trustees argue that the case should be dismissed with prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6) for a variety of reasons. First, the Trustees argue that the Complaint should be dismissed because it was filed in violation of the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine (discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ). Next, the Trustees assert that, since only Mr. Little has an injury claim recognized by the Trust, the other two Plaintiffs lack standing to sue. Finally, the Trustees contend that the Plaintiffs' suit is barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   : the Trustees contend that the time to challenge their appointment and the structure of the Trust was at confirmation in 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Plaintiffs respond that the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine is inapplicable here, contending that the trustee of an asbestos trust is not the type of \"trustee\" protected by the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine. Plaintiffs further argue that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   cannot preclude their claims arising from the alleged conduct of the Trustees in the years following their appointment. In their Motion to Dismiss, the Plaintiffs assert that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and that the case should be remanded to the Texas State Court. Alternatively, the Plaintiffs argue that this Court must refrain from hearing this dispute under the principles of mandatory abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Bankruptcy Court has Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Venue is Proper in This Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    (i) Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court turns first to Plaintiffs' request to dismiss this adversary proceeding for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. It is a fundamental proposition that a court possesses jurisdiction and authority to assess whether it has subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255029\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/622/#p628\">\n    536 U.S. 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 628,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255029\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/622/#p628\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255029\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/622/#p628\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Bankruptcy courts possess jurisdiction over matters \"arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The parties have briefed the issue of the Court's jurisdiction over matters \"related to\" these chapter 11 proceedings, and the Plaintiffs correctly note that the test for \"related to\" jurisdiction becomes more stringent in an action fried after the confirmation date.\n   <em>\n    In re Resorts Int'l Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199658,9230675\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/154/\">\n    372 F.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 161 (3d. Cir. 2004). Under that heightened standard, a bankruptcy court lacks jurisdiction where the proceeding could not have \"any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6560377,607691\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/743/984/\">\n    743 F.2d 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 994 (3d Cir. 1984). Courts have applied a variety of standards for determining post-confirmation jurisdiction, but \"the essential inquiry appears to be whether there is a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding sufficient to uphold bankruptcy court jurisdiction over the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199658,9230675\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/154/\">\n    372 F.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court will address this issue in summary fashion, as the Texas District Court has already thoroughly analyzed and answered the question. The Texas District Court found in a series of rulings that the relief sought by Plaintiffs would directly implicate the terms of the Plan and the Confirmation Order. If successful, the Plaintiffs' requested relief would fundamentally alter the administration of the Trust. The Texas District Court observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims not only call into question the actions of the trustees negotiated for and confirmed as part of the trust\n   agreement during reorganization, but also call for the removal of these trustees confirmed by the bankruptcy court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [I]f Plaintiffs' claims are meritorious and the state court were to replace the trustees with a single receiver - as Plaintiffs request in their complaint - that action would contradict \u00a7 5.01 of the agreement confirmed by the bankruptcy court that states [t]here shall be three Trustees at all times ...\n   <em>\n    [B]ecause Plaintiff's claims call into question the reorganization under chapter 11 through the creation of the trust, and specifically the appointment of the trustees, the claims are sufficiently related to the bankruptcy proceeding\n   </em>\n   and this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)...\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' claims ultimately confer jurisdiction because they not only relate to, but call into question, specific orders and provisions of the trust\n   </em>\n   created out of the bankruptcy case were an integral component of the execution of the estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Order Adopting Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge, Adversary D.I. 44, p. 2 (citing Order and Recommendation of U.S. Magistrate, Judge Adversary D.I. 37; Trust Agreement, Adversary D.I. 31-1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Significantly, the Texas District Court noted the close relationship between this dispute and the \"interpretation and implementation of the plan\" and noted the outcome of this issue could \"effectively require the re-writing of that plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court agrees with the reasoning and conclusions of the Texas District Court. The Confirmation Order effected the creation of the Trust and provided that it \"shall be established in accordance with the Trust Documents.\" The Plaintiffs herein seek to materially revise the Trust Document [Docket No. 94], most tangibly by removing the Trustees and appointing a single receiver. Doing so would alter the terms of the Confirmation Order and Trust Document, which operate to define how trustees are selected and appointed. This adversary proceeding therefore bears a direct relationship on the enforcement of this Court's Confirmation Order.\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657978\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/137/#p151\">\n    557 U.S. at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657978,4089223\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/129/2195/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the alternative, this Court also has jurisdiction over this matter because the Trust is inextricably linked to the success of Debtor's Plan. As noted, the applicable standard that this Court must apply in determining if it has post-confirmation jurisdiction is whether disputes arising in connection to the Trust are matters with a \"close nexus to a bankruptcy plan or proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199658,9230675\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/154/\">\n    372 F.3d at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Consistent with the sound conclusions of the Texas District Court, this Court finds that the pending disputes form a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan and this bankruptcy proceeding. The Trust was created to deal with foreseeable asbestos and silica litigation that would occur on a post-confirmation basis. The success or failure of the Plan depended on the existence of the Trust and the diversion of future claimants to the Trust for claims resolution. If the Trust did not exist, or if it lacked the ability to properly deal with the claims, then the Debtor's Plan would have been untenable and possibly unconfirmable. Due to the necessity of the Trust for a successful Plan, the Court finds that the dispute arising in this matter bears a \"close nexus to a bankruptcy plan or proceeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Plaintiffs argue the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   mandates a finding that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. However, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable from the facts at issue here. In\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   , the trustee of a litigation trust brought an action against the accountant to the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court-approved trust agreement did not appoint the accountant, but instead compelled the trustee to \"retain an independent public accounting firm\" to perform auditing services.\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199658,9230675\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/154/\">\n    372 F.3d at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the trustee discovered the accountant had made several errors, he filed an action in the bankruptcy court for damages on behalf of the trust. On those facts, the Third Circuit found the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy because it did not require the court \"to interpret or construe the plan or the incorporated litigation trust agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199658,9230675\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/154/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199658,9230675\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/154/\">\n    at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   where the trustee independently retained the accountant, this Court's Confirmation Order established the Trust and appointed the Trustees. Also, the remedy sought in\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   had no direct link to the bankruptcy proceeding-it involved a routine state law claim for money damages asserted against a third party. Plaintiffs herein seek removal of the Trustees and appointment of a receiver. If successful, the relief sought by the Plaintiffs would contravene the original terms of the Trust as this Court established them. The remedy sought by the Plaintiffs therefore directly relates to the Confirmation Order and implicates this Court's authority to supervise its own appointed officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Seven Fields Development Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5859101,5860469\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/237/\">\n    505 F.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259 (2007),\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Southmark Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11785392,11775052\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/925/\">\n    163 F.3d 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1999) (\"\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   is unlike the situation here, where [appellants'] claims are claims against a court appointed professional for work performed during the bankruptcy case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The relief sought by the Plaintiffs therefore cuts to the very heart of the Confirmation Order and Plan because it relates to the officers appointed by this Court and to the procedures for appointing new trustees.

Thus, requiring a party with claims against the receiver to obtain permission from the appointing court before filing suit in another jurisdiction would prevent the \"usurpation of the powers and duties which belonged exclusively to [the appointing] court\" and protect \"the duty of that court to distribute the trust assets to creditors equitably and according to their respective priorities.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    In re VistaCare Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731322,3873963\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/218/\">\n    678 F.3d at 224-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3494472\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/104/126/\">\n    104 U.S. at 128-29, 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

There is no binding precedent in this Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Upon due consideration, the Court determines that the proper course of action is to dismiss the Plaintiffs' complaint without prejudice, because the Plaintiffs failed to seek leave of this Court before filing the instant lawsuit.

It would be illogical for this Court, as the court with familiarity regarding the Trustees' role and duties under the Plan, to be foreclosed from hearing matters relevant to the Trustees' conduct and performance simply because those matters were brought by Plaintiffs in state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re VistaCare Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731322,3873963\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/218/\">\n    678 F.3d at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the appointing bankruptcy court as \"uniquely situated to determine whether a claim against the trustee has merit...
