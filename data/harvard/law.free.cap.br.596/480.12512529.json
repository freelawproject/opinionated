Does the Court which presided over Debtors'\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chapter 11 bankruptcy case and entered the Order which confirmed the plan of liquidation have jurisdiction to decide a post-confirmation dispute in an adversary proceeding? Jurisdiction is the seminal question in every case and sometimes the final question. Here, the Court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, and it will not abstain from hearing the adversary proceeding for reasons which follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Debtors filed their bankruptcy petitions on April 17, 2017 (the \"Petition Date\"). The Court entered its Order confirming Debtors' Plan of Liquidation (the \"Plan\") on May 23, 2018, and the Plan became effective on October 1, 2018. Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23. On October 16, 2018, the day after the Plan became effective, the Liquidating Trustee (the \"Trustee\") on behalf of the Liquidating Trust (the \"Trust\"), filed Plaintiff's Original Complaint for Inverse Condemnation (the \"Complaint\") as an adversary proceeding. The Trustee named as defendants the State of California (the \"State\") and California State Lands Commission (the \"Commission,\" and collectively with the State, the \"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Debtor Venoco LLC (\"Venoco\") was a party to leases with the Defendants for drilling rights in the South Ellwood Field (\"SEF\") off the coast of California. Venoco\n   owned Platform Holly, an offshore oil platform which it used to conduct drilling operations in the SEF.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2. An onshore facility known as the Ellwood Onshore Facility (\"EOF\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , was used to process oil and gas from Platform Holly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibit E, Attachment 1. The EOF is located on land approximately 2.8 miles north of Platform Holly. Platform Holly and the EOF are integrated components of the oil production in the SEF.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 24-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Now, the integrated components are needed to plug and abandon the Platform Holly wells.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibit A, page 2. On April 17, 2017, Debtors quitclaimed the SEF Leases back to the Commission and thereby relinquished all of their right, title and interest in the SEF. The relinquishment included Platform Holly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2. Afterwards, Debtors no longer had an interest in the SEF Leases, the wells or the real property underlying the SEF Leases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Commission then became responsible for decommissioning Platform Holly and the SEF.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Commission could seek to recover the costs from Debtors' estate, or perhaps from predecessors who had operated the SEF such as ExxonMobil Corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Three days before the quitclaims, Venoco and the Commission entered into a Reimbursement for Temporary Services Agreement (\"RTSA\") which provided that the Commission would reimburse Venoco for the cost to operate the SEF Leases on an interim basis and the Commission received access and use rights to the EOF.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3. The RTSA terminated on September 15, 2017, and Debtors transitioned the operations of the SEF to the Commission's third-party contractor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the RTSA terminated, Venoco and the Commission entered into an agreement (the \"Gap Agreement\") giving the Commission the temporary use of the EOF to continue to decommission Platform Holly and the SEF.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4. The Commission agreed to pay Venoco for its use of the EOF. Later, by its terms, Debtors terminated the Gap Agreement, as amended, effective October 15, 2018, and initiated the adversary proceeding the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Defendants have not fully paid Debtors for Defendants' use and occupancy of the EOF, which in part led to Debtors filing the instant adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibit D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It appears that any interruption in the maintenance and operation of the EOF is a threat to the public health, safety and the environment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. The substantive issue in the adversary proceeding is whether the Commission has the right to continue occupying and using the EOF without buying it from or paying rent to Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On their face, the Defendants' motions to dismiss misleadingly appear to be straightforward and uncomplicated. The plaintiff is the post-confirmation Trustee who is asserting the Trust's state law claims of inverse condemnation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the defendants are the State of California, which appears to be clothed in sovereign immunity, and one of its agencies. The\n   Court would readily dismiss the adversary proceeding were it not for the facts that the adversary proceeding is an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   matter and that the Commission, on behalf of the State, has filed a proof of claim with the Court seeking approximately $ 130 million. The Trustee is seeking \"just compensation\" for the taking of the EOF and, by necessity, the proof will require a fair market valuation. Further, the adversary proceeding is an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. 6.45 Acres of Land\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953179\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/139/#p145\">\n    409 F.3d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145-46 (3d Cir. 2005) (condemnation proceedings are\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   ). Therefore, a closer look is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Defendants make several arguments in support of their position that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Debtors' adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. The Court does not have jurisdiction over the State because of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (the \"Constitution\") and sovereign immunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. The Court lacks \"arising\" in or \"related to\" jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. Jurisdiction is lacking for \"just compensation\" under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and Section105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4. The Trustee failed to complete his state law remedies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   5. The Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, if they do not prevail on the jurisdiction defenses, Defendants argue that the Complaint fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court is satisfied that it has subject matter jurisdiction, sovereign immunity does not apply or Defendants have waived sovereign immunity, the other defenses are unremitting and Debtors have stated a claim in the Complaint. The Court will discuss those issues and others within. First, the Court will address Defendants' Eleventh Amendment arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    The Eleventh Amendment - Sovereign Immunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   U.S. Const. amend. XI. The principal modern case which addresses the Eleventh Amendment and sovereign immunity held that a statute which permitted Indian tribes to sue states in federal court was unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/\">\n    517 U.S. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/\">\n    134 L.Ed.2d 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). The Supreme Court held that \"[e]ven when the Constitution vests in Congress complete law-making authority over a particular area, the Eleventh Amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against unconsenting states.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/\">\n    at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Should Congress wish to enact a statute to end sovereign immunity that a state enjoys, it must do so by an unequivocal expression that it intended to overturn immunity, and must be acting pursuant to a valid grant of power in the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Seminole Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/\">\n    517 U.S. at 72-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 106 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that \"sovereign immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit\" with respect to many sections of the Bankruptcy Code. While it would appear that Section 106 defeats many claims of sovereign immunity, the Third Circuit disagrees. In a carefully written opinion, the Third Circuit ruled that Section 106 is unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sacred Heart Hospital v. Dep't of Public\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welfare\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Sacred Heart Hospital\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11888224,22301\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/237/\">\n    133 F.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243 (3d Cir. 1998). Accordingly, Section 106 is unavailable to support Debtors' case against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Earlier this year, Chief Judge Christopher S. Sontchi of the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, issued a \"scholarly opinion\" with \"intricate dissection\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the law in which he clarified the intersection of bankruptcy law and sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re La Paloma Generating Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512039\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/588/695/\">\n    588 B.R. 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Del. 2018). The Court reads\n   <em>\n    La Paloma\n   </em>\n   and Chief Judge Sontchi's careful analysis of Supreme Court and Third Circuit precedents to stand for the proposition that the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court defeats a claim of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512039\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/588/695/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512039\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/588/695/\">\n    588 B.R. at 727-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The condemnation case is an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceeding to which the Court's jurisdiction attaches.\n   <em>\n    Peduto\n   </em>\n   , 878 F.2d at 728.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There are several other reasons which cause the Court at the motion to dismiss stage to deny dismissal on account of sovereign immunity. First, the Commission and the State are both at risk for liability because the Commission was acting on behalf of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this early stage before there has been any discovery, the Court views the State and the Commission as one and the actions of the Commission are attributable to the State. Second, the Commission filed a $ 130 million proof of claim in the bankruptcy case for matters related to the Defendants' abandonment of Platform Holly and the EOF. It is impossible to make sense of proceeding with the Defendants' claim in Delaware and the inverse condemnation case proceeding across the country in California. Third, this is an inverse condemnation case. Governmental bodies (and often states) are natural parties in such suits given the very nature of the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Palazzolo v. Rhode Island\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313494\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/606/\">\n    533 U.S. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313494\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/606/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313494\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/606/\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). For these reasons, sovereign immunity does not command the Defendants' dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The State and the Commission have raised several jurisdiction related defenses which the Court will now address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Core \"Arising In\" Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Case law has greatly clarified the principles of core - \"arising in\" and non-core - \"related to\" jurisdiction. The State and the Commission argue that neither principle applies to them. The Court disagrees. There are many decisions which address the issues. One of the leading decisions on the history of confirmation, releases and jurisdiction can be found in this district from the learned and thorough decisions in\n   <em>\n    In re Millennium Lab Holdings II, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268894\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/575/252/\">\n    575 B.R. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

Del. 2018). In\n   <em>\n    Millenium\n   </em>\n   , the bankruptcy court and the district court on appeal discussed at length bankruptcy jurisdiction and core and non-core jurisdiction and the effectiveness of non-consensual third-party releases. The bankruptcy court and the district court agreed that the\n   bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to grant third-party releases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Core versus noncore and \"arising in\" and \"related to\" principles were fully addressed by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Resorts Int'l, Inc. v.

For this proposition, the Trustee alleges that: (1) Defendants' actions gave Debtors no option except to protect their estate and (2) Defendants actively participated\n   in and availed themselves of the Court and its processes. The Trustee asserts that the adversary proceeding addresses the administration of the estate and is therefore one of the \"core\" categories under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A). Next, the Trustee claims that Defendants continuing occupation and use of the EOF frustrates the liquidation of the estate's assets which qualifies as \"core\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A). Finally, the Trustee's Complaint constitutes a counterclaim which qualifies it for core treatment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Defendants answer the Trustee's arguments by arguing themselves that the inverse condemnation action (1) belongs in state court, (2) is not a proceeding seeking to enforce or interpret a Plan provision, and (3) is not a counterclaim or in the nature of a counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court turns to decisional law and concludes that the adversary proceeding is core. The\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   decision backs the Court's conclusion. Surely the adversary proceeding is not collateral to the bankruptcy case, it is directly relevant to the Defendants' proof of claim.\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   decided that the proceeding in question was not core because it would have only an incidental effect on the reorganized debtor.\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199658,9230675\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/154/\">\n    372 F.3d at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the quoted language refers to non-core \"related to\" jurisdiction, the point to be made also applies to \"arising in\" jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The adversary proceeding will not simply increase the Trust's assets if successful. Instead, the Trustee seeks either to compel a resolution of the ownership of the EOF or as a counter to Defendants' proof of claim.

Therefore, the adversary proceeding is core and will almost certainly be resolved, or is resolvable, in the claim proceeding, i.e., Defendants' $ 130 million claim arising from Platform Holly and the EOF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is for these reasons that the Court deems the adversary proceeding to \"arise in\" the bankruptcy case and that the Court has jurisdiction. The adversary proceeding draws on rights which in the context of the case could arise only in bankruptcy, has a significant affect on the administration of the estate and, finally, is a counterclaim to Defendants' proof of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Non-Core \"Related To\" Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   If the Court is mistaken and it does not have core \"arising in\" jurisdiction, it assuredly has \"related to\" jurisdiction. The concept of a matter sustaining \"related to\" jurisdiction is very important in the instant case. If the Trustee is successful in his suit and obtains a judgment, it would assuredly impact the outcome of the Defendants' proof of claim proceeding and any distribution to creditors, thus establishing that the adversary proceeding bears a close nexus to the Plan and to the administration of the estate. The test for \"related to\" jurisdiction is that a close nexus exists between the adversary proceeding and the bankruptcy plan.\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199658,9230675\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/154/\">\n    372 F.3d at 166-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In fact, there is a stark difference between\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   in which the Third Circuit found there was no \"related to\" jurisdiction and the present adversary proceeding. The litigation trustee filed the malpractice action in\n   <em>\n    Resorts\n   </em>\n   almost seven years after the debtor's plan went effective. In the adversary proceeding, the Trustee filed the case within one month of the Plan going effective, which leads the Court to believe that a close nexus exists between the adversary proceeding and the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition, helpful in the Court's thinking is the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v.

There, a bankruptcy trustee sued under a fraudulent transfer theory to recover commissions paid to a noncreditor. The issue the Supreme Court addressed was how courts should proceed when they encounter a non-core claim. In discussing the differences between core and non-core claims, the Supreme Court ruled that with respect to noncore claims, a bankruptcy court can adjudicate such claims provided it issues proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law which a district court then reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   In other words, even a bankruptcy court's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a non-core proceeding can be rectified by the district court's review and treatment of a decision as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%2025\">\n    573 U.S. at 39-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073100\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2165/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Other Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants make other arguments why the Trustee's adversary proceeding is futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Failure to State a Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In short, Defendants argue that the Trustee has failed to state a claim because the State and the Commission are separate entities and he has not pleaded a taking or\n   damaging of the EOF.

The factors are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (1) the effect or lack thereof on the efficient administration of the estate if the Court abstains;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (2) extent to which state law issues predominate over bankruptcy issues;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (3) difficult or unsettled nature of applicable law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (4) presence of related proceeding commenced in state court or other nonbankruptcy proceeding;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (5) jurisdictional basis, if any, other than \u00a7 1334 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (6) degree of relatedness or remoteness of proceeding to main bankruptcy case;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (7) the substance rather than the form of an asserted core proceeding;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (8) the feasibility of severing state law claims from core bankruptcy matters to allow judgments to be entered in state court with enforcement left to the bankruptcy court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (9) the burden of the bankruptcy court's docket;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (10) the likelihood that the commencement of the proceeding in bankruptcy court involves forum shopping by one of the parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (11) the existence of a right to a jury trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (12) the presence in the proceeding of nondebtor parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    DHP Holdings II Corp. v.

D. Del. 2010). Evaluating the factors is not \"merely a mathematical exercise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771538\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/435/220/#p223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771538\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/435/220/#p223\">\n    at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.

D. Del. 1996). Of the twelve factors, most important are (1) the effect on the administration of the estate, (2) whether the claim involves only state law issues, and (7) whether the proceeding is core or non-core.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fruit of the Loom, Inc. v.

D. Del. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In evaluating the factors, it is clear to the Court that some of the factors favor the Trustee while others favor Defendants. The Court will not just mathematically add the factors to determine the party which has the most factors in their column. Instead, the Court will take into consideration and discuss what it considers to be the more important factors in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Effect on Administration of the Estate if the Court Abstains\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This factor clearly weighs in the Trust's favor and against abstention. The Defendants have a claim pending and the Trustee has the adversary proceeding which, if successful, will negate some or all of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Extent to Which State Law Issues Predominate Over Bankruptcy Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Clearly, state law issues predominate, which favors the Defendants. The Court is, however, very accustomed to deciding state law issues which somewhat reduces the significance of this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Core v. Non-Core Status\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court has found that the adversary proceeding is core which therefore gives the advantage to Debtors. However, even if the adversary proceeding is non-core, the relationship to the Chapter 11 case is such strength that the advantage remains with Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   4. Degree of Relatedness or Remoteness of the\n   <em>\n    Adversary Proceeding to the Main Bankruptcy Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   There is a close relationship between the adversary proceeding and the main bankruptcy case, which favors not abstaining.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Commencement in Bankruptcy Court Involves Forum Shopping\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court is of the view that many, if not most, filings involve forum shopping. Parties file cases where they think they will do best. Here, however, the Court is satisfied that the Trustee filed the adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court because there was a case and a proof of claim already present here. The Court finds that the Trustee did not forum shop when he filed here. This factor favors the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    The Existence of a Right to Jury Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   It is not clear that the right to a jury trial of the adversary proceeding exists because it is a core proceeding. If, however, the District Court should withdraw the reference, it is beyond a mere possibility that the District Court would direct the Court to oversee pretrial matters. This factor is a draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court will not abstain. After analyzing all of the twelve factors and especially the factors it considers most important, the Court concludes that it would be inappropriate to abstain. The Penson court stated the Court's conclusion very aptly when it wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Fundamentally, this adversary proceeding involves an objection to a proof of claim. That it involves resolution of state law issues is thus unremarkable. The state law issues are not complex, and judicial economy suggests that the objection to the proof of claim and Plaintiff's counter-claims - which are inextricably interlinked with Defendant's proof of claim - be resolved by one court. That court should be the bankruptcy court as the claim allowance process is a quintessential bankruptcy court function.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   None of the factors that favor abstention convince me that, in this particular case, the interests of justice merits a different outcome. As a result, I decline to abstain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Penson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511954\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/6/#p12\">\n    587 B.R. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court could not state its conclusion any better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court finds that it has jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding. The Court will also not abstain.
