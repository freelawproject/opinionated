While the amounts in controversy in this contest are modest, the legal issue is a knotty one, dividing the courts that have considered it, and requiring this lengthy decision. After reflection, the Court's solution to this venue contest is by no means a novel one: the Court will apply what it perceives to be the plain meaning of the venue statute as enacted by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and Procedural Status\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   J &amp; J Chemical, Inc.

He alleges that this action is a proceeding to recover a money judgment or property worth more than $ 1,300, and it is not a proceeding to \"recover a debt,\" so the $ 12,850 threshold in the venue statute for such proceedings does not apply to Plaintiff's claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues that even if the Court decides that the $ 12,850 threshold for actions to recover a debt does apply to his claims against Defendant, venue is still proper in this District because the Defendant is a \"resident\" of Idaho under the definition found in another federal venue statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In reply, Defendant addressed each of Plaintiff's objections to dismissal.

As to Plaintiff's second point, Defendant contends this avoidance action seeks to \"recover a debt,\" and thus Plaintiff's claim of $ 11,100 claim does not satisfy the $ 12,850 threshold in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) to allow for venue here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While Plaintiff is unable to identify any cases in which courts have found the $ 1,300 threshold for an action to recover money or property is appropriate in cases under \u00a7\u00a7 544(b) and 548, Plaintiff urges the Court to consider relevant statutory text. Indeed, \u00a7\u00a7 544(b) and 548, by their very terms, refer to the trustee's powers to avoid a \"transfer of an\n   interest of the debtor in property[,]\" but fail to mention \"debts.\" Furthermore, \u00a7 550(a) explicitly refers to \u00a7 544 and \u00a7 548 actions, clarifying \"the trustee may recover, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred, or if the court so orders, the value of such property....\" Again, \u00a7 550(a) does not mention recovery of \"debts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There is limited case law discussing how to apply\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)'s treatment of claims to recover \"money or property,\" as opposed to claims to recover \"debts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant correctly notes that the courts in\n   <em>\n    Nukote\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dynamerica\n   </em>\n   applied the higher threshold, $ 12,850, in preference actions.

Plaintiff seeks a recovery of property that was transferred by Debtor to Defendant during the four years leading up to the petition filing. In this case, the nature of the transferred property was cash. Plaintiff invokes \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 548 of the Code, both of which allow avoidance of a \"transfer of an interest of the debtor in property.\" Under \u00a7 550(a), Plaintiff seeks to recover \"the property transferred\" or \"the value of such property.\" A practical reading of these Code sections indicates that Plaintiff's claims to avoid the transfers to Defendant are, in real effect, actions to recover money judgments or property for the purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Accordingly, the $ 1,300 threshold for actions \"to recover money judgments or property\" applies in this case and is satisfied by the amount pled in Plaintiff's complaint. The $ 12,850 monetary threshold for actions against a non-insider to recover a \"debt\" does not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even if\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) applies in this case, venue for the Plaintiff's claim would still be proper in the District of Idaho since the $ 1,300 monetary threshold is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In addition, the complaint alleges that it was the Debtor's funds that Peirsol used to make bets using Defendant's website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As to the first prong of the Ninth Circuit test, Defendant operated an active website capable of consummating transactions with Idaho citizens. Indeed, it is alleged that on fifty-nine occasions, such transactions were consummated between Defendant and Peirsol via the website, using funds of the Debtor, an Idaho corporation, to place those bets. Furthermore, Defendant did \"something more\" when it registered as a limited partnership with Idaho's Secretary of State in 2011, enabling it to lawfully conduct business in Idaho.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2030-24-111\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 30-24-111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (formerly\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2053-2-105\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 53-2-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) provides: \"A limited partnership has the capacity to sue and be sued in its own name and the power to do all things necessary or convenient to carry on its activities and affairs.\" By registering under this Idaho Code provision, Defendant must have contemplated it would conduct business in the State of Idaho through its website. Inherent in registration is the notion that Defendant could \"sue or be sued\" in Idaho. Put another way, its registration under the Idaho Uniform Limited Partnership Act demonstrates it did \"something more\" such that it purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Idaho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, but for Defendant's website, the claims in this case would not exist. The claims arose from Defendant's Idaho-related activity of maintaining an active website capable of funding accounts to place horse-racing bets from Idaho residents. Debtor's funds were transferred to Defendant from an Idaho bank account and used to place bets, and Plaintiff now seeks to avoid the transfers that funded Peirsol's wagering activities. And, third, an exercise of personal jurisdiction over Defendant is reasonable because Ninth Circuit courts presume the reasonableness of an otherwise valid exercise of jurisdiction, and here, Defendant failed to make a compelling case that exercise of jurisdiction was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Since all three prongs of the Ninth Circuit's test are met, Defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction in Idaho.
