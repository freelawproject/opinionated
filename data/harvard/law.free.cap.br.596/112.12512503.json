Schwartz (together, \"Schwartz\") from a Bankruptcy Court Order dated May 17, 2018 (B.D.I. 241)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Order\"), which denied Schwartz's motion for sanctions (B.D.I. 237) (\"Sanctions Motion\") against Rent-A-Wreck of America, Inc. (\"RAWA\") and Bundy American, LLC (\"Bundy,\" and, together with RAWA, \"Debtors\") and their counsel, Quarles &amp; Brady, LLP (\"Q &amp; B\"). Following discovery and a two-day evidentiary hearing, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the Debtors' Chapter 11 cases for failure to satisfy the good faith filing doctrine,\n   <em>\n    In re Rent-A-Wreck of America, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411004\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/364/\">\n    580 B.R. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Del. 2018) (\"Dismissal Opinion\"). Based on the dismissal, Schwartz filed the Sanctions Motion seeking an order imposing sanctions against Debtors and Q &amp; B pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9011 (\"Bankruptcy Rule 9011\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following another evidentiary\n   hearing, the Bankruptcy Court issued a bench ruling exercising its discretion to deny the Sanctions Motion, finding that the Debtors' Chapter 11 filing was not patently unmeritorious or frivolous or made for improper purposes of delay, harassment, or to increase costs. (B.D.I. 243, 5/17/18 Hr'g Tr. at 36:2-43:7). For the reasons set forth below, the Order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Pre-Petition Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Schwartz concedes that the Dismissal Opinion accurately recites the extensive history between Schwartz, RAWA, and Q &amp; B throughout roughly ten years of litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. (D.I. 12 at 4). A brief summary of the relevant background follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bundy sells and administers franchises for the \"Rent-A-Wreck\" vehicle rental businesses inside and outside of the U.S. and is the operating subsidiary of RAWA. RAWA is a holding company that also runs the reservation system for Bundy and other non-debtor affiliated entities. RAWA and Bundy are part of a larger group of private companies owned by J.J.F. Management Services, Inc. (\"JJFMS\"), whose primary principal is John J. Fitzgerald, Jr. Fitzgerald is an owner, president, CEO and chairman of JJFMS's board and also director and chairman of RAWA's board. RAWA's officers and directors are associated with JJFMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Schwartz began the business under the name \"Bundy Rent-A-Wreck\" in 1973 in connection with his auto sales business in Los Angeles. In 1977, Schwartz and another investor created the predecessor to Bundy for the purpose of offering Rent-A-Wreck franchises. The Rent-A-Wreck mark was assigned to Bundy, and the Los Angeles County territory was excepted from the assignment. Years later, Bundy, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of then-publicly owned RAWA, ran the Rent-A-Wreck franchise system and managed the mark in all locations except Los Angeles. The relationship between Rent-A-Wreck and Schwartz was unorthodox as there was never a formal, executed franchise agreement, and, while RAWA imposed certain requirements upon its franchisees, Schwartz did not abide by those requirements at his Los Angeles location. In 2006, JJFMS completed the purchase of all outstanding RAWA stock and took RAWA private. Before the sale closed, Schwartz filed two lawsuits against RAWA challenging the sale. In October 2006, RAWA (now owned by JJFMS) wrote Schwartz demanding that he either provide evidence of a franchise agreement or that he stop holding himself out as a RAWA franchisee. RAWA removed the Los Angeles location from its website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 25, 2007, Schwartz sued RAWA, Bundy, and JJFMS, commencing the Maryland District Court litigation presided over by the Honorable Peter J. Messitte. After two jury trials and two Fourth Circuit decisions, it has been determined that Schwartz has an implied-in-fact royalty-and fee-free franchise agreement to run\n   a Rent-A-Wreck used car rental business in West Los Angeles for his lifetime. The exact terms of the implied franchise agreement are undetermined. Schwartz does not have to comply with RAWA's fleet requirements, and RAWA must keep the Los Angeles location on its website. A 2011 order provides: \"[RAWA's] Call Center shall in no way attempt to dissuade prospective customers from connecting with [Schwartz's] business or in any way attempt to divert business from Plaintiffs' exclusive business territory to other franchises.\" (D.I. 16 at 520-21). Otherwise, the obligations of the parties remained unsettled, and further litigation followed. On June 29, 2017, Judge Messitte found that RAWA \"deliberately directed or permitted their call center operators to advise prospective customers that Rent-A-Wreck had no franchise\" in West Los Angeles, and this conduct served as the basis for finding RAWA in contempt of a 2011 Order (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   578-81) (\"Contempt Order\"). The Contempt Order provided injunctive relief \"in light of RAWA's consistent efforts to undermine Schwartz's business\" and awarded Schwartz $ 83,620.80 in fees, costs, and damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 581).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Dismiss Chapter 11 Petitions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A month after the Contempt Order was issued, on July 24, 2017, Debtors filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions. Debtors were granted postpetition financing on interim and final bases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 15 at 164, 386). On September 1, 2017, Debtors filed a motion to reject seven franchise agreements, including Schwartz's agreement. (B.D.I. 91). Schwartz opposed the rejection motion and filed separately the Dismissal Motion, seeking to dismiss the Chapter 11 cases on the basis that the petitions were filed for the improper purpose of rejecting his franchise agreement and were not filed in \"good faith\" within the meaning of case law interpreting \u00a7 1112(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. (B.D.I. 116). The Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting the rejection motion as to six franchise agreements and deferred a ruling on the motion as it related to Schwartz's franchise agreement so that it could be heard together with the Dismissal Motion. (B.D.I. 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A Chapter 11 case may be dismissed for cause.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Third Circuit has held that \u00a7 1112(b) imposes a good faith standard.\n   <em>\n    In re SGL Carbon Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232126,11492862\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/154/\">\n    200 F.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160-62 (3d Cir. 1999). However, it is a non-statutory, judge-made doctrine, and the term \"good faith\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Though it suggests that the debtor's subjective intent is determinative, this is not the case. Instead, the \"good faith\" filing requirement encompasses several distinct, equitable limitations that courts have placed on Chapter 11 filings. Courts have implied such limitations to deter filings that seek to achieve objectives outside the legitimate scope of the bankruptcy laws. Pursuant to \u00a7 1112(b), courts have dismissed cases filed for a variety of tactical reasons unrelated to reorganization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    SGL Carbon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232126,11492862\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/154/\">\n    200 F.3d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Marsch\n   </em>\n   , 36 F.3d at 825, 828 (9th Cir. 1994) ). When a motion to dismiss a bankruptcy case is filed, the burden is on the petitioner to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that good faith exists.\n   <em>\n    In re Tamecki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11187939,11184157\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/229/205/\">\n    229 F.3d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207 (3d Cir. 2000). \"Whether petitioner has met the burden is a 'fact intensive inquiry' in which a court must examine 'the totality of facts and circumstances' and determine where 'a petition falls along the spectrum ranging from the clearly acceptable to the patently abusive.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Integrated Telecom Express, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181552,9187542\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/108/\">\n    384 F.3d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting\n   <em>\n    SGL Carbon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232126,11492862\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/154/\">\n    200 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   162 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While there is no definitive list of factors, the Third Circuit focuses on two inquiries \"particularly relevant to the question of good faith: (1) whether the petition serves a valid bankruptcy purpose,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , by preserving a going concern or maximizing the value of the debtor's estate, and (2) whether the petition is filed merely to obtain a tactical advantage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119-21. The Third Circuit has also instructed that to be filed in good faith, a petition must do more than merely invoke some distributional mechanism in the Bankruptcy Code: \"[i]t must seek to create or preserve some value that would otherwise be lost - not merely distributed to a different stakeholder - outside of bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In opposing the Dismissal Motion, the Debtors bore the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitions had been filed in good faith. Relying primarily on\n   <em>\n    In re PPI Enterprises (U.S.), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11765709\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/228/339/\">\n    228 B.R. 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

(B.D.I. 161). Schwartz challenged the Debtors' good faith on the basis that the Debtors were not in financial distress and filed their Chapter 11 petitions for the improper purposes of harassment and delay. (B.D.I. 116). An evidentiary hearing was held, at which three witnesses testified. (B.D.I. 187, 188). The parties made post-trial submissions. (B.D.I. 196, 197).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 13, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued the Dismissal Opinion. Reviewing controlling Third Circuit law, the Bankruptcy Court noted that while a desire to invoke the powers conferred by the Bankruptcy Code does not establish a good faith, nor does it constitute a valid bankruptcy purpose.\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Wreck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411004\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/364/\">\n    580 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   374 (citing\n   <em>\n    Integrated Telecom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181552,9187542\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/108/\">\n    384 F.3d at 127-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Just as a desire to take advantage of the protections of the Code cannot establish\n   <em>\n    bad\n   </em>\n   faith as a matter of law, that desire cannot establish\n   <em>\n    good\n   </em>\n   faith as a matter of law. Given the truism that every bankruptcy petition seeks some advantage under the Code, any other rule would eviscerate any limitation that the good faith requirement places on Chapter 11 filings\") (emphasis in original) ). Otherwise, \"any entity willing to bear the cost of a bankruptcy filing could use the Bankruptcy Code's redistributive mechanisms to its advantage, a concept 'antithetical to the structure and purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 375 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Integrated Telecom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181552,9187542\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/108/\">\n    384 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   129 ). The Bankruptcy Court further stated, \"The ability to use the redistributive provisions of the Bankruptcy Code assumes the existence of a valid bankruptcy, 'which, in turn, assumes a debtor in financial distress.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181552,9187542\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/108/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Integrated Telecom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181552,9187542\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/108/\">\n    384 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   128 ). \"Thus, good faith is a predicate to a debtor's ability to use provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and financial distress is a part of - if not itself a predicate to - a a good faith analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181552,9187542\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/108/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following a detailed and thorough analysis of the evidence offered by Debtors, the Bankruptcy Court made several findings with respect to the Debtors' financial condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the record, the Bankruptcy\n   Court \"[could] not conclude that Debtors were in financial distress when they filed their petitions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 382. The Bankruptcy Court found that the Debtors \"were solvent, they were not facing pressure from unaffiliated creditors nor material litigation. It is unclear whether Debtors were cash flow positive or not. The cursory testimony offered by Debtors' witnesses on this point only leaves questions, particularly after reviewing the documentary information in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 382. The Bankruptcy Court concluded, \"The lack of credible facts demonstrating financial distress supports a finding that these cases were not filed in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court reviewed the validity of the reorganizational purposes asserted by the Debtors and determined that the non-financial evidence also did not support a finding of good faith. The Bankruptcy Court found that the \"primary purpose\" of the bankruptcy filing was to reject Schwartz's franchise agreement and \"open the Los Angeles territory to multiple royalty-paying franchisees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Bankruptcy Court found that the Debtors did not have to file the cases to relieve their balance sheet of secured debt, which matured six years earlier and was owed entirely to JJFMS, nor to relieve unsecured debt, the vast majority of which was owed to affiliates. The Bankruptcy Court also found that the filing would not eliminate further litigation with Schwartz; rather, the filing \"has accelerated it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 386. \"Debtors are simply continuing their prepetition litigation in another forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Bankruptcy Court found that the filing was \"nothing more than a straightforward attempt to take value that belongs to Schwartz and give it to Bundy,\" and thus the filing did not create or preserve value for creditors that would otherwise be lost outside of bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 383. The Bankruptcy Court described the case as \"a prime example of the situation the Third Circuit warned against: the use of the Bankruptcy Code - and, in particular, its redistributive provisions - when a party is willing to pay the freight of a bankruptcy case,\" and concluded that the \"bankruptcy petitions fall on the dark side of the spectrum ranging from the clearly acceptable to the patently abusive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 386-88. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that Debtors had not carried the burden of proving that the cases were filed in good faith, including that the Debtors were in financial distress, and entered the Dismissal Order. (B.D.I. 222).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sanctions Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 17, 2018, Schwartz filed the Sanctions Motion against Debtors and Q &amp; B pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9011. Appellants acknowledged that the Sanctions Motion was based on the findings set forth in the Dismissal Opinion and offered no new evidence in support of the Sanctions Motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 12 at 4; 5/17/18 Hr'g Tr.). Following oral argument, the Bankruptcy Court exercised its discretion not to impose sanctions. (5/17/18 Hr'g Tr. at 36:2-43:7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After identifying the relevant legal standards for evaluating the petitions under Bankruptcy Rule 9011, the Bankruptcy Court could not conclude that \"no attorney or client would have found the bankruptcy filing justifiable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:9-22). Because Appellants did not establish that the petitions were \"patently unmeritorious or frivolous,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dura Sys., Inc. v. Rothbury Inc., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531713\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/551/#p558\">\n    886 F.2d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558 (3d Cir. 1989), the Bankruptcy Court declined to find that the petitions had been filed for an improper purpose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:15-19). The Bankruptcy Court noted that the stringent standard governing the imposition of sanctions under Rule 11 contrasts sharply with the wide discretion afforded to bankruptcy courts to weigh the \"totality of the circumstances\" in determining whether to dismiss a case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:10-15). On May 25, 2018, Schwartz filed a timely notice of appeal. The appeal is fully briefed. (D.I. 12, 19, 20). On November 20, 2018, the Court held oral argument on the appeal. (D.I. 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The question before the Bankruptcy Court was whether Schwartz proved by clear and convincing evidence that the bankruptcy filing was patently unmeritorious or frivolous given the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code or filed for improper purpose of harassment and delay. The Bankruptcy Court concluded that the filings were neither patently unmeritorious or frivolous. Schwartz's main argument on appeal is that the Bankruptcy Court must have abused its discretion in denying sanctions because the findings in the Dismissal Opinion support a finding that Rule 11 has been violated. The Court disagrees and finds no abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

(D.I. 12 at 12-14). Under Rule 9011, Appellees certified that the petitions were not presented for any improper purpose, including harassment, unnecessary delay, or needless increase in the costs of litigation. FED. R. BANKR. P. 9011(b). On appeal, Schwartz incorrectly asserts that \"the Bankruptcy Court\n   <em>\n    found\n   </em>\n   that RAWA's sole purpose in filing the Bankruptcy Case was to ... circumvent all of the orders and rulings from the Maryland litigation while continuing to drive up costs for Schwartz\" (D.I. 12 at 5 (emphasis added) ) and that \"the Bankruptcy Court\n   <em>\n    ruled\n   </em>\n   that RAWA's Chapter 11 Petitions were filed for all of those improper purposes specifically identified in Rule 9011 (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   to harass Schwartz, to delay his collection of sanctions, and to increase his litigation costs)\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (emphasis added) ). However, the Dismissal Opinion does not mention Rule 11 or sanctions and contains no finding that Debtors filed the petitions for an improper purpose or that such filing was unauthorized, constituted bad faith, or was intended to delay or harass Schwartz. Contrary to Schwartz's contention, nowhere in the Dismissal Opinion does the Bankruptcy Court find that filing the Chapter 11 cases \"violat[ed] ... judgments, verdicts, and orders\" of the Maryland District Court or the Fourth Circuit. (D.I. 12 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Schwartz argues that the Bankruptcy Court found that the petitions were filed for the improper purpose of rejecting Schwartz's franchise agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). While the Dismissal Opinion clearly found that Debtors had filed the petitions for the \"primary purpose\" of rejecting Schwartz's franchise agreement, so as to \"open the Los Angeles territory to multiple royalty-paying franchisees,\"\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Wreck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411004\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/364/\">\n    580 B.R. at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Bankruptcy Court did not rule that rejection was an \"improper purpose.\" To the contrary, the Bankruptcy Court considered the totality of the circumstances, including factors identified by the Third Circuit: \"(1) whether the petition serves a valid bankruptcy purpose,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , by preserving a going concern or maximizing the value of the debtor's estate, and (2) whether the petition is filed merely to obtain a tactical litigation advantage.\"\n   <em>\n    Integrated Telecom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181552,9187542\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/108/\">\n    384 F.3d at 120-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Debtors asserted that the petitions were filed for reorganizational purposes that specifically included rejection of Schwartz's franchise agreement and other burdensome agreements. While the Dismissal Opinion was ultimately critical of Debtors' stated reorganizational purposes, rejection of an uneconomical contract is not an \"improper purpose\" under the Bankruptcy Code. As the Bankruptcy Court itself observed at an earlier hearing, \"an uneconomic agreement, no matter how long it's been in place, is the exact reason why many debtors reject agreements.\" (B.D.I. 149, 10/16/2017 Hr'g Tr. at 14:4-6). Indeed, had the Bankruptcy Court determined that the totality of the circumstances warranted Debtors' ability to cross the Chapter 11 threshold, rejection of Schwartz's franchise agreement would not have been an improper purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

On appeal, Schwartz argues that the Bankruptcy Court's denial of sanctions was an abuse of discretion, as Debtors had \"no legal basis\" to seek Chapter 11 protection where they \"did not claim to be financially distressed, let alone insolvent.\" (D.I. 12 at 16-17). In support, Schwartz cites Debtors' statement that they were \"not asking [the Court] to find that we are in financial distress as a basis for not dismissing the case.\" (B.D.I. 187, 12/5/2017 Hr'g Tr. at 123-25).

Financial distress is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code and has no settled common law meaning. What \"degree of financial distress\" might satisfy the doctrine is not patently clear. Because the Bankruptcy Court determined that Debtors had established neither financial distress nor another basis for good faith, the Bankruptcy Court was not required to decide whether financial distress, when challenged, is a necessary element of good faith or whether it is simply one part of the totality of the circumstances analysis.\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Wreck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411004\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/364/\">\n    580 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   375 n.81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Debtors argue that the record contains evidence supporting their ongoing financial difficulties, including in connection with the Bankruptcy Court's award of postpetition financing.

Ultimately, the financial evidence offered did not carry the Debtors' burden. In the Sanctions Motion ruling, which was based on the same record as the Dismissal Motion, the Bankruptcy Court noted, with respect to Debtors' financial distress, \"that certain evidence was not offered\" and \"largely found that the evidence was conflicting or left [the court] with questions.\" (5/17/18 Hr'g Tr. at 40:23-41:3).

The Court finds no improper application of cases requiring some degree of financial distress in the context of the good faith inquiry. Debtors did not fail to put forth any evidence in support of their financial difficulties. Although\n   <em>\n    PPI\n   </em>\n   has been limited to its facts, it was not patently unmeritorious for Debtors to rely on\n   <em>\n    PPI\n   </em>\n   to file the petitions to take advantage of the Bankruptcy Code's rejection provision where Debtors reasonably believed their schedules demonstrated some degree of financial distress and that they could demonstrate valid reorganizational purposes under Third Circuit law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Appellants' Remaining Arguments Are Unavailing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court ruled that it \"cannot base [a] sanction award on actions before another Court or on parties\n   not in front of me. In particular, I cannot impose sanctions because of what happened in the Maryland litigation.\" (5/17/18 Hr'g Tr. at 41:19-22). On appeal, Schwartz argues that \"the Bankruptcy Court improperly, and without legal basis, ignored RAWA's prepetition conduct during the Maryland Litigation.\" (D.I. 12 at 14). According to Schwartz, the Bankruptcy Court's failure to consider the Debtors' \"prepetition abuses\" and its examination of RAWA's conduct solely during the Chapter 11 cases is \"an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). However, Schwartz does not cite a single case wherein a court relied on conduct in prior litigation in a separate jurisdiction in imposing Rule 11 sanctions. Schwartz merely argues that the Bankruptcy Court's decision to ignore RAWA's egregious prepetition conduct was \"illogical and unsupported by the law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court must reject Schwartz's argument that the Bankruptcy Court should have considered the \"totality of the circumstances,\" including the prepetition Maryland litigation, in denying sanctions as application of such a standard is unsupported by law. The Court finds no abuse of discretion in the Bankruptcy Court's failure to consider Debtors' prepetition conduct in the Maryland litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the Sanctions Hearing ruling, the Bankruptcy Court referenced JJF, stating: \"Neither JJF[ ] nor Mr. Fitzgerald appeared before me in any substantial way. If JJF[ ] or Mr. Fitzgerald were in front of me, as they were in [\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    15375 Memorial\n   </em>\n   , I might have looked to my inherent authority to determine if sanctions were appropriate, but they are not in front of me.\" (5/17/18 Hr'g Tr. at 39:19-23). Schwartz argues on appeal that JJF \"drove the bad faith of RAWA, as its sole shareholder and controlling corporate officer.\" (D.I. 12 at 23). Schwartz argues that JJF appeared through counsel at several hearings, the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction over JJF, and yet \"inexplicably failed to sanction JJF.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23). However, the Sanctions Motion did not seek sanctions against JJF or Fitzgerald. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   B.D.I. 237). Accordingly the Court does not consider Schwartz's argument that the Bankruptcy Court's failure to sanction them was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Sanctions Motion sought sanctions against Q &amp; B \"because of Q &amp; B's intimate relationship with RAWA and the Maryland Litigation.\" (D.I. 12 at 23). Schwartz argues that Q &amp; B was warned regarding troublesome litigation efforts against Schwartz, citing a transcript excerpt from a hearing in connection with Schwartz's motion for contempt. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). Schwartz argues that Q &amp; B's attorneys, as officers of the court, \"owe[ ] higher duties\" to the Bankruptcy Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). As Appellees correctly point out, the Maryland District Court did not sanction Q &amp; B, and the dispute discussed in that excerpt - changing Schwartz's business address on the Debtors' website - was not the basis for the Contempt Order against the Debtors, which concerned the Debtors' call center. (D.I. 16 at 580). The Court agrees with Appellees that the request for sanctions against Q &amp; B is based solely on Q &amp; B's representation of the Debtors in the Maryland litigation, and Schwartz has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that sanctions are warranted in connection with the filing of the Chapter 11 petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, Schwartz argues that in not awarding sanctions, the Bankruptcy Court gave Debtors a \"free pass.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 12 at 9, 20 (denial of sanctions \"absolved RAWA of responsibility\" for failing to establish good faith; denial of sanctions \"rewards\" Debtors). Schwartz also argues that the Bankruptcy Court's decision\n   \"fails to hold RAWA accountable for its inability to prove that its [b]ankruptcy [c]ase was filed in good faith.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Thus, Schwartz appears to argue that sanctions are necessary to punish the Debtors. This is not the law. The purpose of Rule 11 is to deter, not to punish. FED. R. BANKR. P. 901 1(c)(2). Rule 11 is not intended to be used to punish parties for failure to carry their evidentiary burden at trial. To the extent that deterrence was needed, the Bankruptcy Court viewed the dismissal itself as sufficient deterrent to the Debtors seeking to use the bankruptcy process again. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5/17/18 Hr'g Tr. at 42:17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As Appellees correctly point out, in explaining the basis for its denial of sanctions, the Bankruptcy Court \"did more than what Rule 11 requires.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 19 at 31 n.10). \" Rule 11(c)(6) [which corresponds to Rule 9011(c)(3) ], requires only that a [trial] court explain the basis of its order when the court imposes sanctions, not when it denies sanctions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Moeck v.

Financial distress is not a term defined by statute or case law but rather determined by the facts and circumstances of each individual case. As the Bankruptcy Court observed, \"[t]his type of standard gives the Court discretion to consider any and all factors the Court deems appropriate,\" and \"it is difficult, therefore, for the parties and counsel to [gauge] how a court will weigh those factors when they are contemplating filing a bankruptcy petition.\" (5/17/18 Hr'g Tr. at 40:10-16). Here, it was not patently clear that Debtors had \"absolutely no chance of success\" in meeting the good faith filing requirement. Although Debtors did not prevail, failure to carry the burden of establishing good faith is neither the equivalent of \"bad faith\" nor is it \"clear and convincing evidence\" of an improper purpose under Bankruptcy Rule 9011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Order is therefore affirmed.
