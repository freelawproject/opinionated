The Trustee seeks this order to facilitate the sale of the practice, which is an asset of Wojtkun's Chapter 7 estate. Relying on Wojtkun's duty to cooperate with the Trustee, the bankruptcy court issued an order requiring him to provide information about the practice to the Trustee to assist with the sale and barring him\n   from actively soliciting the practice's patients, but it declined to issue the requested noncompetition order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     AFFIRMS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   the bankruptcy court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wojtkun filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts on May 7, 2013. Joseph Butler was appointed as trustee the following day. The court granted Wojtkun a discharge on August 13, 2013. At the time he filed his petition, Wojtkun was a practicing dentist and the sole shareholder of Peter Wojtkun DMD P.C., a Massachusetts professional corporation. By filing his petition, his shares in the professional corporation transferred to the Trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Wojtkun\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-10843,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20888307\">\n    2017 WL 888307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Mass. Mar. 6, 2017) (affirming the bankruptcy court's order permitting the Trustee \"to take certain actions as the sole shareholder and director of the corporation\"). The professional corporation ceased operating in November 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Since filing for bankruptcy, Wojtkun has practiced dentistry at the same location where his professional corporation operated, using the same equipment and treating the same patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Wojtkun and the Trustee have repeatedly clashed over the administration of the bankruptcy estate. The Trustee seeks to sell the professional corporation. He contends that he cannot do so, however, because Wojtkun refuses to provide information about the practice to allow for a proper valuation and is operating a new dental practice in the same location, which depresses the value of the professional corporation. On April 25, 2017, the Trustee initiated an adversary proceeding against Wojtkun in the bankruptcy court seeking an injunction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) to bar him from hindering or interfering with the Trustee's sale of the dental practice, require him to cooperate with the Trustee in the sale, and restrict him from practicing dentistry within fifteen miles of the practice for five years to avoid competition with the purchaser of the professional corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After Wojtkun moved for summary judgment, the bankruptcy court (Hoffman, J.) issued its decision on August 23, 2018. Because neither\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) nor\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) creates a private right of action, the court treated the adversary proceeding complaint as a motion for an order compelling Wojtkun to comply with his duties under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court determined that Wojtkun's duty to cooperate with the Trustee in the sale of the professional corporation required him to provide his business and patients records and answer questions about the practice for prospective buyers. It also decided that Wojtkun could not actively solicit patients of the practice, though he could treat patients who sought him out on their own. Wojtkun does not challenge either of these aspects of the bankruptcy court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court then addressed the Trustee's request for a noncompetition order. The court acknowledged that Massachusetts law imposes on certain voluntary sellers of a business an implied covenant not to compete with the buyers but determined that this implied covenant did not attach to involuntary sales in bankruptcy. The court recognized that the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Uniservices, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1127890\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/517/492/#p497\">\n    517 F.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497 (7th Cir. 1975), affirmed a declaration prohibiting a former president and shareholder of the debtor company from competing with the company. The court found\n   <em>\n    Uniservices\n   </em>\n   inapposite, however, because it was a reorganization\n   case and unique equitable factors, namely that the individual forced his employees to enter into covenants not to compete, justified the noncompetition order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court instead found this dispute comparable to\n   <em>\n    In re Glazer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142618\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/317/488/#p490\">\n    317 B.R. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 490 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2004), where a bankruptcy court declined to impose a noncompetition order on a debtor as part of the sale of his chiropractic practice. The court in\n   <em>\n    Glazer\n   </em>\n   declined to do so because the Bankruptcy Code's fresh start policies trumped the competing goal of maximizing creditor recovery and because a noncompetition order would effectively bring the debtor's right to work in a certain area into the estate (in violation of the Code's exemption for post-petition earnings). The bankruptcy court recognized that\n   <em>\n    Glazer\n   </em>\n   did not address a debtor's obligation to cooperate with a trustee under \u00a7 521(a)(3) but nevertheless declined to order Wojtkun not to practice dentistry within fifteen miles of the practice for five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Trustee filed a notice of appeal with this Court on September 24, 2018. He challenges the bankruptcy court's decision not to impose the noncompetition order on Wojtkun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court reviews \"the bankruptcy court's findings of fact for clear error, and its conclusions of law de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Irving Tanning Co. v.

A bankruptcy court abuses its discretion when it \"relies upon an improper factor, neglects a factor entitled to substantial weight, or considers the correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in weighing them.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Mercado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338266\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/523/755/#p761\">\n    523 B.R. 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (1st Cir. BAP 2015) (internal quotation omitted). The bankruptcy court treated the Trustee's complaint as a motion for an order to enforce Wojtkun's duty to cooperate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which grants the court discretionary powers to issue orders to enforce the Bankruptcy Code. Because the bankruptcy court did not decide that it could never impose a noncompetition order on a debtor but instead exercised its discretion not to grant the requested relief in this case, this Court reviews the bankruptcy court's decision for abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Standing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before reaching the merits of the appeal, Wojtkun challenges the Trustee's standing to bring the underlying adversary proceeding as a shareholder of the professional corporation. The bankruptcy court treated the adversary proceeding as a motion for an order compelling Wojtkun to comply with his duty to cooperate with the Trustee. Neither party challenges this decision. Accordingly, the Trustee was suing not as the shareholder of the professional corporation but as the trustee of the Chapter 7 estate. Wojtkun makes no argument that the Trustee does not have standing to seek this order in his capacity as trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Noncompetition Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Trustee contends that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in declining to issue an order barring Wojtkun from practicing dentistry within fifteen miles of the location of his old practice for five years. The Trustee argues that the bankruptcy court should have entered this order to enforce Wojtkun's duty to cooperate in liquidating the assets of the estate. He also points out that the noncompetition order is authorized under Massachusetts\n   law, which recognizes an implied covenant not to compete in certain sales of a business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tobin v.

In some circumstances, a noncompetition order to maintain the value of the professional corporation's goodwill may be appropriate to enforce a debtor's duty to cooperate. Here, the record is troubling in that Wojtkun does seem to be undermining the Trustee's sale of the professional corporation by taking advantage of Chapter Seven. Getting him to cooperate with the Trustee was apparently like pulling teeth. Immediately after declaring bankruptcy, Wojtkun began providing dental services as a sole proprietor in the same office with the same equipment he used when he operating as a professional corporation before the bankruptcy. Because operating in the same location allows Wojtkun to easily poach patients from the professional corporation, it would have been within the bankruptcy court's discretion to order Wojtkun not to practice dentistry in that location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, other factors weigh against the issuance of the noncompetition order. The noncompetition agreement had a broad geographic scope over a long time period. Moreover, Wojtkun had already been practicing for four years when the Trustee sought the order.
