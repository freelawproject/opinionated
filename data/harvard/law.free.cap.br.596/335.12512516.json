The remaining issues before the Court are (i) whether NF Clean is entitled to attorney's fees and if so, (ii) whether those fees are also non-dischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523. Kakal argues that NF Clean has no basis to support an award of attorney's fees. NF Clean counters that its attorney's fees are non-dischargeable pursuant to (i) Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 38.001, and (ii) the Texas Theft Liability Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, NF Clean is entitled to attorney's fees under the Texas Theft Liability Act, and the fees are excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sometime in 2013, NF Clean Prestacao de Servicos and Salim Kakal entered into an oral agreement for the purchase of a 2013 Ford F150 Raptor Crew Cab (the \"Truck\"). (ECF No. 14 at 3). Under the agreement, Salim Kakal or his company, Mondex International, Inc., would purchase the Truck from Ray Skillman Ford, Inc. in Indiana on NF Clean's behalf. (ECF No. 14 at 3). After purchasing the Truck, Kakal would then ship the Truck from Indiana to Houston, and thereafter to Angola where it would reach NF Clean. (ECF No. 14 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to the agreement, Kakal purchased the Truck from Ray Skillman Ford on September 13, 2013 for $68,9292.75. (ECF No. 14 at 4). For the purchase of the Truck plus shipping charges, NF Clean paid Kakal a total of $84,851.87. While in transit to Houston, however, the Truck was stolen. (ECF No. 14 at 4). Sometime in September 2014, Salim Kakal recovered the stolen Truck. (July 9, 2018 Hearing at 10:29 a.m.). Although Kakal acknowledged that the stolen Truck was NF Clean's property when he regained possession, Kakal admitted to selling the Truck to a third party, and failed to remit any of the sale proceeds to NF Clean. (July 9, 2018 Hearing at 10:23 a.m.). NF Clean never received the Truck or its proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 30, 2016, NF Clean filed a lawsuit in the 61st Judicial District of Harris County against both Kakal, individually, and Mondex, asserting claims for breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, alter ego, and sham to perpetrate a fraud. (ECF No 1 at 3; ECF No. 14-1 at 4). On August 18, 2017, Kakal filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy, staying the state court lawsuit. (Case No. 17-35014, ECF No. 1). Kakal's chapter 7 case was subsequently converted to a chapter 13 bankruptcy on October 26, 2017. (Case 17-35014, ECF No. 27). On January 1, 2018, NF Clean initiated this adversary proceeding against Kakal, alleging that Kakal's debt to NF Clean was nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (4), and (6). (ECF No. 1 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court held an evidentiary hearing on July 9, 2018, during which Kakal provided testimony. (July 9, 2018 Hearing at 10:20 a.m.). At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court held that Kakal's debt to NF Clean was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (6), and that Kakal was liable for damages in the amount of $54,255.73. (July 9, 2018 Hearing at 11:31 a.m.). Specifically, the Court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (i) None of the elements of \u00a7 523(a)(2) were proven;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (ii) No fiduciary relationship existed between NF Clean and Salim Kakal\n   sufficient to find fraud or defalcation under \u00a7 523(a)(4) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (iii) Salim Kakal committed larceny and embezzlement under \u00a7 523(a)(4) when he received the stolen Truck, subsequently sold it to a third-party, and failed to remit any of the proceeds of sale to NF Clean;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (iv) The act of selling the recovered Truck, which belonged to NF Clean at the time, was willful and malicious under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (July 9, 2018 Hearing at 11:31 a.m.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties were unable to reach an agreement regarding appropriate attorney's fees. On September 24, 2018, Kakal filed a brief opposing an award of attorney's fees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17). Kakal argued that NF Clean was not entitled to recover attorney's fees, because (i) prepetition fees cannot be awarded without a state court judgment, and (ii) post-petition fees \"can only be awarded where there is a contract between the parties that entitles the creditor to legal fees.\" (ECF No. 17 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 25, 2018, NF Clean filed its response, arguing that it is entitled to reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and that such fees are nondischargeable. (ECF No. 19 at 2). NF Clean conceded that there was no state court judgment in this case, but argued that under Texas law, \"creditors ... can recover attorney's fees if there is a contractual or statutory right to fees under state law.\" (ECF No. 19 at 4). Specifically, NF Clean argues that it is entitled to attorney's fees on the basis of (i) Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 38.001 for breach of contract, and (ii) the Texas Theft Liability Act (\"TTLA\") for theft. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 25, 2018, the Court held a hearing on NF Clean's entitlement to attorney's fees. The Court agreed that a state court judgment was not a prerequisite for an award of attorney's fees. However, the Court pointed out that Kakal's debt to NF Clean is a mixed claim in that it consists of both dischargeable and non-dischargeable debt. The Court noted that under Texas law, parties are entitled to attorney's fees if the claim is based on a breach of contract but are not when the claim is for willful and malicious conduct. (September 25, 2018 Hearing at 1:38 p.m.). The Court requested further briefing on the effect of a mixed claim on the dischargeability of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   NF Clean submitted further briefing on October 8, 2018. The Court took this matter under advisement on October 10, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The District Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Thus, under Texas law, a party is entitled to attorney's fees when either a contract provides for such fees, or when a statute indicates it may recover such fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Bankruptcy courts analyzing the dischargeability of attorney's fees under \u00a7 523, have ordinarily viewed and analyzed those fees in two separate categories-those awarded as part of a judgment and those incurred in the prosecution of the dischargeability action. When a bankruptcy\n   court concludes that a particular judgment debt is non-dischargeable, attorney's fees awarded by the state court under an enforceable contract or state statute in connection with that non-dischargeable debt will also be deemed non-dischargeable.\n   <em>\n    In re Gober\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11943275,6463055\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/100/1195/\">\n    100 F.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1208 (5th Cir.

Here, there is no state court judgment on which NF Clean may rely for the recovery of attorney's fees; therefore, the remaining issues are: (i) whether there is a basis for an award of attorney's fees incurred in connection with the prosecution of the dischargeability of Kakal's debt to NF Clean, and, if there is a basis for those fees, (ii) whether such are excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code does not independently provide attorney's fees to a party seeking an exception to discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Koukhtiev\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268736\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/576/107/#p135\">\n    576 B.R. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135 (Bankr.

The non-dischargeable damages were awarded due to his subsequent theft of the proceeds of the sale of the truck. Accordingly, there are no non-dischargeable fees awardable under the contract. NF Clean nonetheless argues that it is entitled to an award of attorney's fees on the basis of (i) the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code and (ii) the Texas Theft Liability Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(ECF No. 19 at 4). Under \u00a7 38.001(8), \"[a] person may recover reasonable attorney's fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to the amount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for ... an oral or written contract.\" TEX.

Both parties agree that NF Clean and Kakal entered into an oral agreement which required Kakal to purchase and deliver the Truck to NF Clean\n   in Angola. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14). Both parties also agree that the Truck was stolen on its way to Houston, and that after recovering the stolen Truck, Kakal sold the Truck to a third party. (July 9, 2018 Hearing at 10:32 a.m.). Thus, NF Clean never received the Truck Kakal was contractually obligated to provide. Nevertheless, the Court found that the act of selling the Truck to a third party after Kakal regained possession of the stolen Truck, was larceny and embezzlement under \u00a7 523(a)(4), and willful and malicious under \u00a7 523(a)(6). On the basis of that finding, NF Clean now seeks a determination that its attorney's fees are also nondischargeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even in cases where a statute or contract provides for attorney's fees, bankruptcy courts have refused to rule that the fees are nondischargeable where the statute or contract was not the basis for denying discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Kirk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347089\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/525/325/#p330\">\n    525 B.R. at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (first citing\n   <em>\n    Neo Ventures, LLC v.

(ECF No. 1 at 3). On July 9, 2018, the Court agreed in part and found that Salim Kakal's debt to NF Clean was nondischargeable based on the events that followed Kakal's recovery of the stolen Truck-the act of selling the Truck to a third party, (knowing it belonged to NF Clean) and failing to remit any of the proceeds of sale to NF Clean.

(September 25, 2018 Hearing at 11:31).
