INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Susan Boltz-Rubinstein (\"the Debtor\") filed this chapter 13 bankruptcy case on August 3, 2010. She obtained confirmation of her chapter 13 plan and then performed her obligations under her confirmed chapter 13 plan. She also received a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Debtor commenced this adversary proceeding in 2016.. She seeks damages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) for an asserted willful violation of the automatic stay that occurred in 2016, after she completed her plan, but before the entry of her discharge. She alleges that Defendant Bank of America (\"BOA\") violated the stay when it attempted to collect a pre-petition debt by sending notices in furtherance of the applicable state law procedural requirements for foreclosure against her residential real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BOA asserts there was no stay violation because it was acting as servicer for the actual holder of the mortgage, National Residential Assets Corporation (\"NRAC\"), which obtained relief from the automatic stay before BOA sent the notices to the Debtor. BOA points to a 2005 servicing agreement between its predecessor, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (\"BAC\") and Bank of New York Mellon (\"BNYM\"), the parent company of NRAC as proof of that agency relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Debtor counters that, notwithstanding the existence of a servicing agreement between BNYM (NRAC's parent) and BAC (BOA's predecessor), BOA lacked authority\n   to act on NRAC's behalf and therefore is liable for its collection efforts in violation of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BOA filed a motion for summary judgment on April 27, 2018 (\"the Motion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, I conclude that a material issue of fact remains whether there was an agency relationship between BOA and NRAC when BOA sent the notices to the Debtor in 2016. Therefore, I will deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Much of the history of this adversary proceeding was stated in the court's opinion published on September 18, 2017, which granted in part and denied in part the Defendants' motions to dismiss this adversary proceeding (and related adversary proceeding, Adv. No. 16-362).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Boltz-Rubinstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269220\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/574/542/\">\n    574 B.R. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2017) (the \"Prior Opinion\"). Only a portion of that history will be repeated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Debtor initiated this adversary proceeding against BOA on August 17, 2016. She filed an Amended Complaint on August 29, 2016. In the Order accompanying the Prior Opinion, I dismissed three (3) of the four (4) counts of the Amended Complaint; only Count IV, stating a cause of action for violation of the automatic stay, survived. The Defendant answered the Amended Complaint on October 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following multiple, extended discovery disputes, involving motions to compel discovery and for protective orders, the Defendant filed the Motion on April 27, 2018. The Debtor responded on June 3, 2018. BOA filed a reply on June 4, 2018 (\"the Reply\"), which BOA answered on June 11, 2018. The Debtor filed a sur-reply on June 18, 2018 (\"the Sur-Reply\"). With leave of the court, the Debtor filed a second reply to the Motion on June 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Further, in partial response to the Motion, the Debtor filed two (2) Motions to Strike Affidavits filed by the Defendant (Doc. #'s 109, 110). The Motions to Strike sought to exclude the affidavits of Heather D. Nolan and Leticia Pasillas. By Orders dated June 4, 2018, I denied both Motions to Strike without prejudice and provided that the requests that the affidavits be disregarded would be considered as part of the Debtor's response to the Motion. (Doc. #'s 111, 112).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. the servicing agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 15, 2005, the Debtor borrowed $ 593,334.00 from BOA. The loan was secured by a mortgage on her primary residence located at 3444 Wiltshire Rd. in Furlong, Pennsylvania (\"the Property\"). On December 10, 2010, the Mortgage was assigned from BOA to NRAC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 1, 2005, prior to the issuance of the Debtor's mortgage, BAC and BNYM\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   entered into a \"Flow Mortgage Loan Sale and Servicing Agreement\" (the \"Servicing Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Affid. of Leticia Pasillas (\"Pasillas Affid.\"), Ex. C) (Doc. # 98). Pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreement, BOA was to continue servicing various loans that BOA transferred to BNYM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   More pertinent to the current dispute, the Servicing Agreement permits BOA to \"effectuate foreclosure or other conversion of the ownership of the Mortgaged Property securing any Mortgage Loan it services.\" (Pasillas Affid., Ex. C \u00a7 10.01, at 37).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 8, 2010, the Servicing Agreement was amended by letter (\"the Servicing Amendment\") (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. H). The Servicing Amendment provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   if title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of 'National Residential Assets Corp.' unless [BOA] is directed otherwise by [BNYM].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. the events during the bankruptcy case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Debtor commenced her chapter 13 case on August 10, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 21, 2011, BAC, purportedly as servicer for NRAC, filed a proof of claim in the amount of $ 587,118.56 (Claim No. 17-1) (\"the Claim\"). The Claim states that the debt is secured by the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Debtor's chapter 13 plan was confirmed on January 10, 2012. The plan does not provide for a cure of the delinquent mortgage on the Property. Rather, the plan states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The pre-petition mortgage arrears owed to Bank of America Home Loans Servicing, LP, and the pre-petition real estate tax arrears owed to Bucks County Tax Claims Bureau will not be paid through the plan.... The aforesaid arrears ... will be cured through the mortgage loan modification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Third Amended Plan \u00a7 7(f) and (g) ) (Bky. No. 10-16541, Doc. # 167).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 4, 2016, NRAC filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay in order to prosecute a foreclosure proceeding against the Property, asserting that the Debtor had no equity in the Property and that NRAC was not adequately protected (\"the Motion for Relief\") (Doc. # 283). Following a hearing on June 23, 2016, the Motion for Relief was granted. (Bky. No. 10-16541, Doc. # 293) (the \"Stay Relief Order\"). The Stay Relief Order granted NRAC relief but noted that \"[n]othing in this Order constitutes a determination that [NRAC] is the holder of the Note or Mortgage referenced in the Motion and all such issues may be determined by another court of competent jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Shortly following the issuance of the Stay Relief Order, BOA sent the Debtor the following four (4) communications relating to her mortgage on the Property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 an Act 91 notice, dated July 18, 2016, informing the Debtor of a default on her mortgage and stating that the Debtor must either cure the default or risk foreclosure;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 three (3) loan assistance offer letters, dated July 19, 2016, July 20, 2016,\n   and August 5, 2016, that referenced the possibility of loan modification, refinancing, forbearance, delinquency repayment plan, short sale and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint, Exhibits B, C, D, F) (collectively, the \"Notices\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Debtor contends that BOA violated the automatic stay by sending the Notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Defendant argues that it did not violate the automatic stay because it was acting as an agent of NRAC when it sent the Notices to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The logic goes like this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 NRAC, which received relief from the automatic stay, is the assignee and owner of the Debtor's mortgage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 BOA was servicing NRAC's loan and acting as NRAC's agent when it sent the notices to the Debtor in 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 The agency relationship was established by the Servicing Agreement\n   between BNYM and BAC and the Servicing Amendment thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022 A separate agreement between NRAC and BOA was not needed to make the Servicing Agreement effective as between BOA and NRAC because NRAC is BNYM's wholly-owned subsidiary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, BOA argues that \"[b]ecause BNYM and NRAC are functionally one entity with respect to the foreclosure of properties covered by the Servicing Agreement, then,\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   , [BOA] is agent of both entities.\" (Reply at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   BOA further asserts both that the Debtor has failed to produce either any evidence of actual damages or any documents to substantiate alleged monetary loss. Attorney's fees, according to BOA, are not actual damages for purposes of a stay violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Debtor attacks BOA's logic in two (2) ways. First, the Debtor claims that there is insufficient evidence that NRAC is a wholly owned subsidiary of BNYM. Second, and relatedly, she asserts the there is a lack of evidence that an agency relationship exists between BOA and NRAC. Therefore, the Plaintiff concludes that the record fails to show any agency relationship between BOA and NRAC and without such a relationship, BOA is not insulated from liability by the order granting NRAC relief from the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Plaintiff further asserts, contrary to the BOA's contention, that she has actual damages caused by the violation of the automatic stay. The Debtor submitted an affidavit that describes the emotional distress she claims to have suffered as a result of the Notices. The Debtor also contends that she is entitled to attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    V. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    A. BOA Is Not Entitled to Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    1. overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   BOA's primary defense is that it was acting as an agent of NRAC when it sent the Notices in compliance with the Servicing Agreement and Amendment. According to BOA, this agency relationship means that it is entitled to take advantage of the Stay Relief Order, which was entered in the name of NRAC. I conclude, however, that the evidentiary record at summary judgment fails to support BOA's factual contention regarding the existence of the asserted BOA-NRAC agency relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As discussed below, BOA has not offered any evidence of a direct contractual arrangement between NRAC and BAC (BOA's predecessor) in which NRAC authorized BAC (later BOA) to act as NRAC's agent in connection with the Notices it sent to the Debtor. Further, notwithstanding BOA's argument to the contrary, nothing in the Servicing Agreement (between BAC and BNYM) creates contractual privity between BOA and BNYM's subsidiary, NRAC. NRAC is not a party to the Servicing Agreement. Nor is there any language in the Servicing Agreement t establishing an agency relationship between BAC and NRAC. While the Servicing Agreement specifically permits BOA to foreclose on relevant mortgage loans,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the face of the document, those rights flow from BNYM to BAC, not NRAC to BAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In the absence of any contract between NRAC and BAC, BOA's argument for agency rests on the legal theory that a subsidiary (NRAC) is bound by the contract of its parent (BNYM). As explained below, case law is to the contrary generally, see Part V.B., supra, and BOA has not put forth sufficient evidence to establish the elements of any exception to this general rule. Accordingly, BOA has not met its burden. The BNYM-BOA relationship does not create an agency relationship between NRAC and BOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    2. the limited scope of\n   </strong>\n   Copperweld\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The principle of \"separateness\" between a parent and subsidiary means the entities\n   enjoy separate legal status and that a subsidiary (here, NRAC) is not a party to a contract between the parent (here, BNYM) and a third party (here, BAC/BOA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   To defeat this general principle, BOA argues there is a \"unity of interest\" between BNYM and NRAC, relying on oft-cited Supreme Court case,\n   <em>\n    Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207619\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/752/#p771\">\n    467 U.S. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 771-2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207619\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/752/#p771\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207619\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/752/#p771\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Copperweld\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   A parent and its wholly owned subsidiary have a complete unity of interest. Their objectives are common, not disparate; their general corporate actions are guided or determined not by two separate corporate consciousness, but one.... They share a common purpose whether or not the parent keeps a tight rein over the subsidiary; the parent may assert full control at any moment if the subsidiary fails to act in the parent's best interests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   BOA argues that BNYM and NRAC have a \"unity of interest\" with respect to the Property (because NRAC holds the mortgage and BNYM owns NRAC) and that \"[t]here need not be any separate agreement between BNYM and NRAC because BNYM will effectively own anything NRAC may acquire.\" (BOA Reply Memorandum at 3) (Doc. # 116).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I respectfully disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Copperweld was an antitrust case in which the Court held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary were not legally capable of conspiring with each other under section 1 of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   At its core, Copperweld was a case construing the Sherman Act. BOA reads far too much into Copperweld if it suggests that a Supreme Court decision interpreting the Sherman Act was intended to nullify long-held, cardinal state law principles regarding the separate corporate existence of parent and subsidiary corporations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Courts have considered the passage in Copperweld quoted above, the \"unity of interest\" concept, and the potential for blurring the distinction between a parent and subsidiary corporation in other legal contexts, such as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \u2022 under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \u2022 under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.\u00a7\u00a7 151\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \u2022 in the application of claim or issue preclusion;\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   \u2022 in determining the reach of \"long-arm\" jurisdiction;\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   \u2022 in determining the reach of \"related to\" jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The concept of \"unity of interest\" arises perhaps most frequently in the traditional context of plaintiffs attempting to pierce the corporate veil of a defendant.

To obliterate the separate corporate status in the parent/subsidiary context, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the parent exercised sufficient domination and control over the subsidiary corporation such that the subsidiary was a mere alter ego of the parent, with no separate existence; and (2) injustice will result if the corporate fiction is maintained. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Allegheny Energy Supply Co., LLC v. Wolf Run Min.

In evaluating the issue, courts consider whether the subsidiary was undercapitalized, any failure to adhere to corporate formalities, whether there was a substantial intermingling of affairs, and whether the corporate form was used to perpetuate a fraud.

The Debtor requests that I disregard them because they do not provide competent, admissible evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   I agree with the Debtor. All four affidavits fail to provide any competent evidence;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   particularly on the requisite agency relationship between NRAC and BAC/BOA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For example, the Pasillas Affidavit states that \"BOA was acting as NRAC's agent when it sent the Act 91 Notices to Debtor which form the basis of Debtor's Complaint.\" (Pasillas Affid. at 4). Similarly, the Golio Affidavit that NRAC authorized BOA to act \"on its behalf and subject to NRAC's control...with respect to certain foreclosure related activity.\" (Golio Affid. \u00b6 4). These material factual averments in each affidavit are no more than conclusory statements, lacking a proper foundation. BOA cannot simply offer such pre-packaged legal conclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   None the Affidavits offer competent evidence sufficient to warrant a disregard of the corporate distinction between the entities under any legal theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    4. summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In sum, BOA's evidence does not allow me to conclude that BOA acted as NRAC's agent when it sent the Notices under any legal theory. Neither the Servicing Agreement nor the Affidavits and Amendment establish this as an undisputed fact. Consequently, BOA has not met its summary judgment burden on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    B. There is a Material Factual Dispute over Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In order to recover damages under \u00a7 362(k)(1), a debtor must establish that a stay violation occurred which was willful\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and that the willful violation caused injury to the debtor\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(1). BOA contends that this essential element is lacking from the Debtor's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Debtor has submitted an affidavit alleging a host of emotional harms she claims to have suffered as a result of receiving the Notices from BOA which, if true, may support an award of actual damages for emotional distress. BOA disputes the credibility of the Debtor's Affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Drawing all reasonable inferences in the Debtor's favor, I am satisfied that the issue of damages cannot be decided absent an appropriate factual determination that cannot be made at the summary judgment stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   BOA has not mustered sufficient evidence to establish definitively that an agency relationship existed between BOA and NRAC when BOA engaged in debt collection efforts against the Debtor. A\n   factual dispute also exists whether the Debtor suffered damages as a proximate result of the alleged violation of the automatic stay. Consequently, BOA's motion for summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , upon consideration of the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"the Motion\") and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Thus, the Plaintiff's pleadings now amount to an objection to consideration of the submissions pursuant to F.R.C.P. 56(c)(4) (\"An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    As will be seen below, in some respects I have accepted the content of the affidavits; in other respects, I have not.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    The summary judgment record includes the written mortgage assignment between BOA and NRAC.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Amended Complaint \u00b6 3; Reply to Motion at 2). However, the Debtor offers no evidence to support her contention that the assignment is not valid.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The Debtor also argues, generally, that because BOA denies or ignores the fact that her loan was securitized, all of the documents it offers as evidence are not trustworthy and therefore, NRAC is not the holder of the loan. (\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    , Reply to Motion at 5; Sur-Reply at 10).
