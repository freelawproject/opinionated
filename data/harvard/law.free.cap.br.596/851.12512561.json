(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. R. 372, ECF No. 2-5.) The appellees are: (1) the debtor, Alliance Consulting Group, LLC; (2) the purchaser of the property at issue, Drying Facility Assets Holding, LLC (\"DFAH\"); and (3) the former Chapter 11 Trustee and current Plan Agent, Richard W. Cryar. This Court has jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a bankruptcy court order pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Having considered the parties' briefs, the record of the Bankruptcy Court, and relevant law, the Court finds that the Bankruptcy Court's March 19, 2018 Order should be affirmed, and this appeal dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Alliance was engaged in the production of frac sand, a material that is used in the fracking process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using a loan that it obtained from Spectrum Origination, LLC, Alliance had built and operated a drying facility on land that it leased from another entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Elle Investments LLC and Stonehill Institutional Partners LP subsequently acquired the loan. After Alliance began to suffer financial difficulties, a separate entity, Shale Support Services LLC (\"S3\") took over the management of the drying facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 3, 2013, some of Alliance's creditors filed an involuntary Chapter 11 petition for relief against Alliance, and the Bankruptcy Court appointed Richard W. Cryar to serve as Trustee. In May 2014,\n   S3 and Cryar, in his capacity as Trustee, entered into an agreement that permitted S3 to continue to operate the drying facility and install a second sand screen to increase production. S3 agreed to pay all expenses incurred for installation of the screen. It also agreed to pay Cryar a per-ton fee for frac sand produced at the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   S3 hired the appellant, Plant Materials, to install the screen. The Bankruptcy Court provided the following description of the project:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   S3 owned the Screen and contracted with Plant Materials to install it and to make ... other modifications. S3 agreed to pay Plant Materials an estimated $ 162,535.00 per week for this work, which was projected to take approximately three weeks to complete. In fact, Plant Materials worked at the Drying Facility for three months, beginning in June 2014, and billed S3 for an amount that far exceeded the initial estimate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. R. 374, ECF No. 2-5.) PM claims that S3 did not pay PM for all of the work it performed at the drying facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 14, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court entered a Confirmation Order approving the free-and-clear sale of the drying facility to the administrative agent of the lenders, Elle and Stonehill. The administrative agent then assigned its right to purchase the drying facility to the appellee DFAH. The screen installed by Plant Materials was not included in the sale of the drying facility but was acquired by DFAH later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 13, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court closed the case and discharged the Trustee. Plant Materials filed a Motion to Reopen the case because it claims that the free and clear sale of the drying facility prevented it from filing a lien on the facility for its unpaid invoices. The Bankruptcy Court denied the Motion due to lack of standing. In the alternative, the Bankruptcy Court determined that Plant Materials failed to carry its burden to show cause to reopen the bankruptcy case. Plant Materials filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

R. Bankr. P. 5010. It is undisputed that Plant Materials is not a debtor; thus, the question presented in this appeal is whether Plant Materials is a party in interest. The Bankruptcy Code provides that the term \"party in interest\" includes \"the debtor, the trustee, a creditors' committee, an equity security holders' committee, a creditor, an equity security holder, or any indenture trustee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Plant Materials argues that its right to a lien on the drying facility was extinguished by the Bankruptcy Court's Order approving the free and clear sale of the facility and thus it has standing to reopen the bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court held that Plant Materials does not have standing because it is not a debtor, creditor, or trustee; rather, it is merely a creditor of a creditor. In support, the Bankruptcy Court cited\n   <em>\n    Nintendo Co. v.

However, in the context of standing to file a motion to reopen, the court held that the term \"party in interest\" is \"implicitly confined to debtors, creditors, or trustees, each with a particular and direct stake in reopening cognizable under the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515017,6528948\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/5/750/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plant Materials argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred in relying on\n   <em>\n    Nintendo\n   </em>\n   because the holding in\n   <em>\n    Nintendo\n   </em>\n   conflicts with the Fifth Circuit's definition of \"party in interest\" expressed in\n   <em>\n    Khan\n   </em>\n   - \"anyone who has a legally protected interest that could be affected by the bankruptcy case.\"\n   <em>\n    Khan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269626,12402470\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/698/793/\">\n    698 F.

As the Second Circuit has affirmed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [I]t is important that a bankruptcy court is not too facile in granting applications for standing. Overly lenient standards may potentially over-burden the reorganization\n   process by allowing numerous parties to interject themselves into the case on every issue, thereby thwarting the goal of a speedy and efficient reorganization.... Granting peripheral parties status as parties in interest thwarts the traditional purpose of bankruptcy laws which is to provide reasonably expeditious rehabilitation of financially distressed debtors with a consequent distribution to creditors who have acted diligently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    In re Refco Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5857657,5856886\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/109/\">\n    505 F.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting with approval\n   <em>\n    In re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6500655\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/101/844/#p851\">\n    101 B.R. 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1989) ). This is particularly true in the context of a motion to reopen a bankruptcy case in which the bankruptcy plan was long ago confirmed. Permitting a creditor of a creditor to reopen the case and potentially disrupt the plan would thwart the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nevertheless, even if this Court adopted the broader meaning of \"party in interest\" that Plant Materials advocates, Plant Materials does not have standing because it does not have \"a legally protected interest that could be affected by the bankruptcy case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Khan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269626,12402470\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/698/793/\">\n    698 F. App'x at 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time the Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the drying facility, Plant Materials had no \"legally protected interest,\" because, as Plant Materials admits, it was not yet permitted to file a lien on the drying facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2085-7-405\">\n    Miss.

Whether the Bankruptcy Court Abused Its Discretion in Holding No Cause Existed to Reopen the Bankruptcy Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court held that, even if Plant Materials has standing to file a Motion to Reopen, cause does not exist to reopen. First, the court reasoned that it would be futile to reopen the bankruptcy case because the trustee testified that there were no more funds to distribute. Second, the court noted that Plant Materials could file a lawsuit to litigate its claim for nonpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, the Bankruptcy Court stated, \"But even if no other forum were available, a contract dispute between non-debtors that has nothing to do with the plan cannot be adjudicated post[-] confirmation by the bankruptcy court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Alliance Consulting Grp.

Miss. 2018). In support of this finding, the Court cited\n   <em>\n    Bank of Louisiana v. Craig's Stores of Texas, Inc. (In re Craig's Stores of Texas, Inc.)\n   </em>\n   , which held, \"After a debtor's reorganization plan has been confirmed, the debtor's estate, and thus bankruptcy jurisdiction, cease to exist, other than for matters pertaining to the implementation or execution of the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476618,9498703\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/388/\">\n    266 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390 (5th Cir. 2001). Since Plant Materials' nonpayment claim against S3 was not a matter \"pertaining to the implementation or execution of the plan,\" the Bankruptcy Court held that it would not have jurisdiction \"whether\n   explicitly or under any of the guises Plant Materials would assert it.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Alliance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511986\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/588/169/#p175\">\n    588 B.R. at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the Bankruptcy Court noted that the Bankruptcy Code favors finality and that DFAH would be prejudiced if the case were reopened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Regarding futility, Plant Materials argues that the bankruptcy court erred by failing to address whether it could grant Plant Materials relief from the sale order pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Plant Materials also argues that the bankruptcy's Order approving the free-and-clear sale of the drying facility violated its due process rights because it received no notice prior to entry of the Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A bankruptcy case may be reopened to administer assets, to provide relief to the debtor, \"or for other cause.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20350\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). \"In this context, the phrase 'other cause\" gives the bankruptcy court 'discretion to reopen a closed estate or proceeding when cause for such reopening has been shown.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Bell Family Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232514,4178715\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/575/229/\">\n    575 F.

Other courts are available to adjudicate this claim; in fact, Plant Materials has filed a lawsuit against S3 and others in the District Court, 150th Judicial District, Bexar County, Texas, concerning the issues underlying its Motion to Reopen.

R. Civ. P. 60(b). Despite a thorough review of the record, the Court has not located any reference to the subsection of Rule 60(b) under which Plant Materials intends to proceed. However, in a supplemental brief filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Plant Materials explained that it intends to seek \"relief from the Confirmation Order's 'free and clear' effects on [Plant Material's] lien rights, due to the lack of notice and due process afforded to [Plant Materials].\" (R. Item 2 Part 3, 179, ECF No. 2-5). This statement indicates that Plant Materials intends to file a Rule 60(b)(4) Motion, alleging that the Bankruptcy Court's order is void due to lack of due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brumfield v.

As a result, the Court finds that Plant Materials was an unknown claimant that was only entitled to notice by publication.
