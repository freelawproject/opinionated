Plaintiff argues this Court does have jurisdiction because of an exception. After careful review of the pleadings and consideration of arguments of counsel in open Court, the Court grants Defendants' Motion to Dismiss because it lacks jurisdiction to consider this case, at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Josephine C. Bello, M.D., PLC (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Debtor\"), is a family medicine practice in Michigan. Dr. Josephine Bello is its owner and director. Under the Medicare Supplier Agreement, Debtor agreed to accept assignment of Medicare Part B payments. This means Debtor agreed to request direct Part B payments from the Medicare program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 14, 2015, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), the agency within the U.S. Department of\n   Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") that administers the Medicare program, through a contractor, sent a letter to Debtor requesting information for an audit to ensure that Medicare claims had been billed and paid in an appropriate manner. On August 12, 2016, CMS notified Debtor of the results of a post-payment program integrity review, resulting in several claims being reopened based on data analysis showing that it was aberrant in billing and reimbursement as compared to its peers. The reopening led to further reviews and data analysis, and in a letter dated September 9, 2016, WPS, a Medicare contractor, notified Debtor of an overpayment in the amount of $1,000,844.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In that letter, WPS informed Plaintiff about payment withholding or recoupment, interest assessment, and appeals procedures, all consistent with the supplier agreement. On September 20, 2016, Plaintiff filed a request for redetermination with WPS. WPS issued an unfavorable redetermination decision to Plaintiff on November 7, 2016. WPS found that Plaintiff's records did not support the medical necessity for billed services, did not support the level of billed services, did not substantiate the medical need for home visits, and did not substantiate the medical need for diagnostic tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 1, 2017, Plaintiff filed a request for reconsideration with a different Medicare contractor known as a qualified independent contractor (\"QIC\"). On October 3, 2017, the QIC issued a partially favorable decision and the principal amount of the overpayment was reduced from $1,000,844.00 to $732,456.00 with interest (at that time) of $73,532.53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff then filed a third level of appeal on November 10, 2017, by making a request for an ALJ hearing with the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals. The appeal is pending and not yet completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 5, 2018, Plaintiff filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and, on May 21, 2018, filed this Adversary Complaint. In its Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that, on an annual basis, its Medicare Receivables represent approximately 35% of Plaintiff's revenues, averaging about $250,000.00 to $350,000.00 per year. Complaint, para. 12. Plaintiff asks for, among other things, the United States to be compelled to turn over the recouped Medicare Receivables and to \"end the suspension of payments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss (the \"Motion\") on September 14, 2018, arguing the Complaint should be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) as the Court lacks jurisdiction to decide an unexhausted Medicare dispute. Alternatively, Defendants argue that the complaint should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, as there is an absolute right to offset overpayments notwithstanding the bankruptcy, and where Plaintiff has failed to establish the necessary elements to support issuance of an injunction. Plaintiff filed an objection to the Motion on November 2, 2018, in which Plaintiff argues there is no jurisdictional bar that would preclude a bankruptcy court from hearing a Medicare dispute. Moreover, Debtor argues that it should not be required to exhaust remedies as it has already waited for over a year for a hearing date in front of an administrative law judge, and it will be forced out of business if Defendants can continue to offset future payments to recoup the past alleged overpayments. On November 30, 2018, Plaintiff filed a reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Statutory and Regulatory Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Medicare Part B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Congress created the Medicare program, under Title XVIII of the Social Security\n   Act, to pay for the medical care of the aged and disabled.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Title XVIII establishes, among other things, hospital insurance programs (Part A), and supplementary medical insurance (Part B). Many tasks of the government's administration of Part B is conducted through Medicare administrative contractors. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.370\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This matter involves Part B payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Medicare Part B is a voluntary program of supplementary medical insurance covering physician services and some other medical and health services such as outpatient hospital services, x-rays, and durable medical equipment. When a Part B beneficiary receives covered services or goods from a provider, the beneficiary is responsible for paying the service provider and Part B payment can be made to the beneficiary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(b)(6) ; 1395u(h). However, the service provider may also execute a Medicare Participating Physician or Supplier Agreement (\"Supplier Agreement\"). This agreement sets forth many rights and corresponding responsibilities for the supplier. \"Supplier\" refers to a physician or other practitioner, a facility, or other entity (other than a provider of services) that furnishes items or services under Part B. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, the supplier receives the right to directly bill Medicare for Part B payments and, in return, receive direct and timely reimbursement from Medicare rather than having to seek payment directly from the beneficiary/patient. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(B)(ii), (b)(6) ; 1395u(h). The supplier agrees to accept the Medicare payment as payment in full and may not charge the beneficiary any additional amounts apart from applicable deductibles and copayments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplier Agreement;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(B)(ii). However, the participating supplier agrees that, \"payment of a claim by Medicare is conditioned upon the claim and the underlying transaction complying with such laws\" and on the supplier's compliance with all applicable conditions of Medicare. The supplier explicitly agrees that Medicare may recoup past overpayments from future payments. The Medicare enrollment application requires the supplier to certify that \"I agree that any existing or future overpayment made to the supplier by the Medicare program may be recouped by Medicare through the withholding of future payments.\" The Supplier Agreement renews automatically each year unless either the supplier or CMS terminates it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Payment of Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Medicare covers only services and items that are medically \"reasonable and necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a), \u00a7 1395u. There are numerous exclusions to coverage and a supplier such as Debtor must furnish to the Medicare contractor sufficient information to determine whether payment is due and in, if so, in what amount.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.5\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) ;\n   <em>\n    see also generally\n   </em>\n   42 C.F.R.

Upfront payment through Part B does not necessarily mean the matter is concluded because a Medicare claim remains potentially subject to post-payment review and recoupment of Medicare payments, in whole or in part. Further, contractors can conduct reviews and audits for the purposes of ensuring the integrity of the Medicare program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ddd ; 42 C.F.R. Subchapter B, Part 420.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Claims can also be reopened.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b)(1)(G) (statutory authorization for reopening Medicare claims);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.980\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Administrative Appeals Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   If a supplier believes a claim determination is incorrect, it can avail itself of the administrative appeals process. 42 C.F.R. Part 405, Subparts H and I;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff. The process has several steps. First, a supplier may seek a redetermination through the appeals department of the Medicare contractor.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.940\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the\n   <em>\n    Nurses' Registry\n   </em>\n   Court, the drafting error analysis fails because the power of courts to correct apparent drafting errors is sharply limited, and because, despite a congressional statement to the contrary, the amendment that in part removed specific reference to bankruptcy jurisdiction statute also contained substantive amendments to Social Security and Medicare.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In contrast, the majority view is that the amendments removing the statute that specifically referenced a bankruptcy\n   court's jurisdiction was the result of a drafting error.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bayou Shores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336801,4342799\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/1297/\">\n    828 F.3d at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held the same in accordance with the Third, Seventh, and Eighth Circuit Courts of Appeal.

In assessing the applicability of the\n   <em>\n    Michigan Academy\n   </em>\n   exception, the relevant question is whether a hardship turns the agency channeling requirement into a complete preclusion of judicial review, and the fact that the claims have taken a long time to be resolved or that the delay involves another hardship does not necessarily mean that there is no review at all.
