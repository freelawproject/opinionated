ELIZABETH S. STONG, UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Introduction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the Court is the motion to dismiss of defendants Navient Solutions, LLC, Navient Credit Finance Corporation, and Sallie Mae, Inc. (the \"Defendants\"). The Defendants seek an order dismissing the claims set forth in Hilal Khalil Homaidan's Complaint, and argue in this motion that Mr. Homaidan's loans are student loans that come within a category of debt that is excluded from discharge under the applicable subsections of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8) - specifically, Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii), which excludes from discharge \"an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship or stipend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To set the stage for the Court's decision, it is worth noting that Mr. Homaidan does not identify or seek relief specifically with respect to this subsection of the Bankruptcy Code in his Complaint. Rather, he alleges, in substance, that his \"Tuition Answer Loans\" are not \"qualified education loan[s]\" under Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(B), and for that reason, they were discharged in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this motion, the Defendants urge that the Court does not need to reach Mr. Homaidan's dischargeability claim, and by implication, his claim that they have violated the discharge order entered in his case, because - they argue - Mr. Homaidan's Tuition Answer Loans are excluded from the scope of his bankruptcy discharge on these separate grounds. And they request the opportunity to address the adequacy of Mr. Homaidan's claims under Section 523(a)(8) at a later time, if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Homaidan responds that he has alleged adequately that his Tuition Answer Loans do not come within a category of debt that is excluded from discharge under\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   subsection of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8), including Section 523(a)(8)(a)(ii), and as specifically alleged in the Complaint, Section 523(a)(8)(B). He argues that he has alleged adequately his request for a declaratory judgment that his loans were discharged pursuant to the Court's discharge order in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, and also his request for damages, attorneys' fees, and costs, arising from the Defendants' violations of the discharge\n   order entered in his case. For these reasons, he argues, the Court should not dismiss the Complaint, and the Defendants' motion should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding pursuant to Judiciary Code Sections 157(b)(1) and 1334(b), and the Standing Order of Reference dated August 28, 1986, as amended by the Order dated December 5, 2012, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In addition, this Court may adjudicate these claims to final judgment to the extent that they are core proceedings pursuant to Judiciary Code Section 157(b), and to the extent that they are not core proceedings, pursuant to Judiciary Code Section 157(c) because the parties have stated their consent to this Court entering a final judgment.

On December 19, 2008, Mr. Homaidan filed his schedules and statements, and on March 9, 2009, he filed certain amended schedules. ECF Nos. 11, 19. In his Schedule F, \"Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims,\" he listed \"Tuition Answer\" loans owed to Sallie Mae in the amounts of $ 7,983.19 and $ 8,190.11. On January 15, 2009, the Chapter 7 Trustee filed a \"no-asset\" report stating that \"[t]he estate has no non-exempt property to distribute.\" Case No. 08-48275, Doc. entry dated January 15, 2009. On April 9, 2009, the Court entered an order discharging Mr. Homaidan (the \"Discharge Order\"), and on that same day, his bankruptcy case was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 14, 2017, Mr. Homaidan moved to reopen his bankruptcy case to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of certain of his student loans, and on May 26, 2017, the Court entered an order reopening the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     This Adversary Proceeding\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 23, 2017, Mr. Homaidan commenced this adversary proceeding as a putative class action, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, by filing a complaint against SLM Corporation, Sallie Mae, Inc., Navient Solutions, LLC (\"Navient Solutions\"), and Navient Credit Finance Corporation (\"Navient Credit\"). As to himself, Mr. Homaidan seeks a determination that certain debts that he incurred as a student are not nondischargeable student loan debts under Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(B), and an award of damages, including attorneys' fees and costs, for the Defendants' willful violations of the bankruptcy discharge order entered in his case.

He claims that the \"Defendants ... originat[ed] and service[ed] dischargeable consumer loans [while] disguising them as nondischargeable student loans.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511934\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/428/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Homaidan advances these allegations on behalf of an alleged class of \"similarly situated individuals who have declared bankruptcy since 2005 [across the United States,] with loans originated and/or serviced by Defendants.\" Compl. \u00b6 4.

Compl. \u00b6 6. He alleges that defendant Navient Solutions is a business entity that services consumer debts, with a principal place of business in Pennsylvania. Compl. \u00b6 7. And he alleges that defendant Navient Credit is a business entity that originates, services, and collects consumer debt, with a principal place of business in Virginia. Compl. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Homaidan alleges that Congress enacted Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8) in order to \"prohibit discharge of federal student loans ... [and] to address a growing concern that students were taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Code by incurring extensive student loan debt and then declaring bankruptcy soon after graduation.\" Compl. \u00b6 13. He claims that as initially adopted in the 1978 Bankruptcy Act, Section 523(a)(8) excluded from discharge government-issued student loans that became due within the five years prior to the bankruptcy petition. Compl. \u00b6 14. Mr. Homaidan claims that the purpose of this legislation was to insulate \"government issued student loans from bankruptcy discharge,\" and states that \"[s]ubsequent amendments, which lengthened and eventually eliminated the five-year non-dischargeability time frame for loans by the federal government, have made it ... increasingly difficult for debtors to ever attain discharges of those student loans.\" Compl. \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Homaidan also alleges that the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 expanded the definition of nondischargeable student debt to include \" 'any other educational loan that is a qualified education loan, as defined in section 221(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.' \" Compl. \u00b6 17 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(B) ). The Complaint states that Internal Revenue Code Section 221(d)(1)\"defines a qualified education loan as one that is used to pay for 'qualified higher education expenses.' In turn, a 'qualified higher education expense' is one that issued to pay for the cost of attendance at a qualified educational institution.\" Compl. \u00b6 18 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20221\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) ). Mr. Homaidan alleges that \"[o]riginally, the private lending mirrored the federal loans in that the loans were paid directly to the qualified educational institution, which would then ensure that the funds were used only for qualified expenses.\" Compl. \u00b6 20. And he claims that \"lenders initiated new programs that bypassed the qualified schools completely and instead lent money directly to student borrowers.\" Compl. \u00b6 21. In doing so, he alleges that lenders \"circumvent[ed] the schools['] private lenders ... significantly increas[ing] the total amount of loans that they originated by lending money that exceeded the scope of [\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Bankruptcy Code Section] 523(a)(8)(B).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20221\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These loans, Mr. Homaidan alleges, \"were simply unsecured consumer debts.\" Compl. \u00b6 22. Mr. Homaidan alleges that only private loans that are made for qualified education expenses at a qualified educational institution are nondischargeable, and \"any other private loan is unsecured and is discharged in bankruptcy in the same manner as any other unsecured debt.\" Compl. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Complaint states that Mr. Homaidan attended Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts during the four academic years from 2003 to 2007. He withdrew from Emerson College in the Fall of 2006, and returned in the Spring of 2007 to complete his degree. During the 2006-07 academic year, Mr. Homaidan received $ 4,800 in scholarship funds from Emerson College, and $ 22,100 in school-certified loans from the Defendants. He alleges that the Defendants lent him \"an additional $ 12,567 in 'direct to consumer' Tuition Answer loans ... that were made outside the financial aid office and were not made for qualified education expenses.\" Compl. \u00b6 40. Mr. Homaidan claims that he \"properly scheduled the Tuition Answer Loans on Schedule F of his petition.\" Compl. \u00b6 44. He claims that the Defendants knew that these \"were not qualified education loans\" exempt from discharge as defined in Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(B), and notes that Internal Revenue Code Section 6050S requires lenders to issue 1098-E tax forms to all customers with qualified education loans, and the Defendants never issued a 1098-E tax form to him. Compl. \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Homaidan alleges that the \"Defendants represented to student debtors that the Bankruptcy Code prohibited discharge of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   loan made to any person for any educational purpose.\" Compl. \u00b6 28. He claims that the Defendants utilized bankruptcy laws \"to defraud vulnerable and unsophisticated student borrowers.\" Compl. \u00b6 29. Mr. Homaidan states that the \"Defendants either misrepresented or failed to disclose facts and information related to the dischargeability of private loans,\" and that the Defendants did not make the same misrepresentations \"to more sophisticated borrowers.\" Compl. \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   He alleges that while the Defendants and other lenders informed consumers that their loans were nondischargeable, these lenders securitized the same obligations for sale on the secondary market. And he asserts that the prospectuses for these asset-backed securities cautioned investors that, pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8), \"only private loans made for qualified expenses were excepted from discharge.\" Compl. \u00b6 34. He alleges that instead of then treating these debts as discharged, Navient Solutions \"engaged the services of various collection firms to attempt to collect on this discharged debt in violation of this Court's Order and the Bankruptcy Code,\" and on December 6, 2008, Navient Solutions \"sent correspondence to Homaidan stating that they received notice of the bankruptcy filing and requested a copy of 'the first meeting of creditors.' \" Compl. \u00b6 48. Prior to the Discharge Order, Mr. Homaidan states that the \"Defendants did not commence an adversary proceeding to contest the dischargeability of the Tuition Answer Loans.\" Compl. \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Homaidan alleges that on December 11, 2008, the Defendants sent correspondence to him requesting payment in the amount of $ 1,524.74, and states that both of his Tuition Answer Loans were listed in that correspondence. Compl. \u00b6 49. He alleges that the Defendants sent further letters demanding payment of the Tuition Answer Loans \"at least on, August 3, 2010, September 6, 2010, September 8, 2010 and\n   July 5, 2011.\" Compl. \u00b6 50. And as a result of these letters, Mr. Homaidan claims, he \"was misled as to the status of the Tuition Answer Loans and believed they were not, in fact, discharged in bankruptcy and therefore he paid back those discharged debts in July 2011 under the mistaken belief that he had a legal obligation to do so.\" Compl. \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Homaidan requests a declaratory judgment pursuant to Judiciary Code Section 2201 and Bankruptcy Rule 7001(9) that these debts were discharged by operation of law on April 9, 2009, the date of entry of the Discharge Order in his bankruptcy case, because they were not student loans excluded from discharge under Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8). Mr. Homaidan also asserts that since the Defendants were notified of the Discharge Order pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 4004(g), and still sought to collect on his debts by use of \"dunning letters, phone calls, negative reports made to credit bureaus, failure to update credit reports, and commencing or continuing legal action to recover [these] debts in violation of [ Bankruptcy Code Section 524 ],\" the Court should cite the Defendants for civil contempt for their willful violations of the Discharge Order, and order them to pay damages in an amount to be determined at trial pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Sections 524 and 105, and also to pay his attorneys' fees and costs.

Mr. Homaidan opposes all of the relief sought by the Defendants, and on January 8, 2018, he filed a memorandum of law in opposition (the \"Plf's Opp.\") to the Motion to Dismiss.

While the Defendants acknowledge that courts have reached different conclusions on this and similar claims, they urge that there is no controlling authority that supports Mr. Homaidan's position and that the better reasoned cases are consistent with their argument that the Complaint should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   And if the case is not dismissed, the Defendants invoke Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), and ask the Court to strike several paragraphs of the Complaint on grounds that they are \"redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). These include allegations that the Defendants engaged in a \" 'massive effort to defraud student debtors.' \" Defs' Mem. at 50 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 2). Alternatively, they ask the Court to strike these allegations on grounds that they amount to allegations of \"nonspecific fraud\" and do not meet the particularity requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Defs' Mem. at 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, the Defendants also argue that Mr. Homaidan waived his right to participate in class action proceedings. Defs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mem. at 44. They cite Mr. Homaidan's promissory note, which states that \"if any party elects to arbitrate a claim, both parties 'waive the right to ... participate in a class action in a court or in arbitration.' \" Defs' Mem. at 44 (quoting Ex. A at 9; Ex. B at 9).

And in this Motion to Dismiss, the Defendants argue that he does not state a plausible claim for relief because, based on the allegations of the Complaint, the debts at issue here - Mr. Homaidan's Tuition Answer Loans - are \"an obligation to repay funds used for an educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend\" within the scope of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    The Parties' Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Defendants ask this Court to \"dismiss Homaidan's Complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim.\" Defs' Mem. at 52.

At the outset, the dispute is substantial. The Complaint states that the Defendants knowingly undertook collection efforts on debts that - he alleges - come within the Discharge Order entered in his bankruptcy case. Mr. Homaidan alleges that he has been damaged, in a tangible way, by those efforts. And he alleges that the Defendants' collection efforts violated this Court's Discharge Order, warranting a finding of civil contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For these same reasons, the allegations of the Complaint show that the parties have \"adverse legal interests,\" in light of these claims. It is in Mr. Homaidan's interests that his Tuition Answer Loans be discharged under the applicable bankruptcy law, and it is in the Defendants' interests that this Court reach the opposite conclusion. It is also in Mr. Homaidan's interests that his allegations of contempt be sustained, and just as much, in the Defendants' interests that they be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, there is nothing speculative about the relief that Mr. Homaidan seeks or, for that matter, the dismissal that the Defendants urge. The debts have been incurred, the Discharge Order has been entered, and the collection efforts have been undertaken. The controversy presented has the necessary \"immediacy and reality to warrant\" consideration of declaratory relief. The circumstances as alleged are immediate and real. For these reasons, the Court concludes that the threshold requirements for a declaratory judgment claim are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Defendants Have Shown that Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) Applies To Exclude the Loans At Issue from Discharge as a Matter of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The starting point for the analysis of exceptions to discharge is the rule, as stated by the Supreme Court, that \"exceptions to discharge 'should be confined to those plainly expressed,' and construed narrowly against the creditor.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141920\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/547/49/\">\n    547 B.R. at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kawaauhau v.

And equally important is, of course, the plain text of the statute. But that does not mean that a court must read the words with blinders on. Rather, as the Supreme Court has observed, it is a \"fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

But Section 523(a)(8) does not define \"student loans.\" Nor does it define \"educational benefit.\" Rather, it describes certain categories of debt that are not dischargeable in bankruptcy unless the debtor establishes that excepting the debt from discharge would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and his or her family, and those descriptions are particular and detailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In this light, the text of Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) merits attention.

That is, the term \"loan\" was part of the drafting process of Section 523(a)(8), and it seems reasonable to assume that if Congress intended this subsection to include loans, it would have said so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii), both by its terms and read in context, does not sweep in all education-related debt, or all loans that support a student's efforts to gain the benefits of an education. If this Section had the breadth for which the Defendants advocate, it is hard to see where it would end - conceivably, it could encompass credit card debt that was incurred to purchase textbooks, personal loans that were used to pay for tuition and school fees, and any other debt that, in one way or another, facilitated a student's efforts to gain the \"benefits\" of an \"education.\" And plainly, this is not what Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) encompasses, or what the Bankruptcy Code permits, or what Congress intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In addition, this Court also agrees with those other courts, including courts within and outside this District, that have concluded that \"an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit\" must mean something other than a loan.

And the debtor agreed in a promissory note - which the parties agreed was to be interpreted as a loan - to repay her father for the Parent PLUS loans. The respondent father obtained a state court judgment against the debtor after she defaulted under the terms of the note. During the pendency of the state court action, the debtor filed for bankruptcy, a discharge was entered, and the case was closed. The debtor successfully moved to reopen her bankruptcy case to determine the dischargeability of the note. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the respondent argued that the note constituted an \"educational benefit\" that was excepted from discharge pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(a)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Nypaver\n   </em>\n   court undertook a close analysis of the text of Section 523(a)(8)(a)(ii), adopted the more narrowly crafted view, and found that the promissory note did not come within the scope of this section, for several reasons. First, the court noted the discrepancy between the subjects of Section 523(a)(8)(a)(i) - \"an educational\n   benefit overpayment or loan\" - and Section 523(a)(8)(a)(ii) - \"an obligation to repay funds.\" It found that \"[a]lthough common usage of the word 'funds' could include the proceeds of a loan, the structure of\n   <em>\n    Section 523(a)(8)\n   </em>\n   suggests a more limited and tailored definition.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Nypaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414942\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/581/431/\">\n    581 B.R. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the court observed that the word \"as\" in the phrase \"an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend\" in Section 523(a)(8)(a)(ii), suggests that the predicate of that subsection - \"educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend\" - informs the \"character\" of the funds owed, rather than the \"purpose\" of those funds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414942\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/581/431/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also stated that the use of the word \"as\" casts doubt upon the \"purpose of the loan\" analysis employed by courts that give a broad meaning to the term \"educational benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    Nypaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414942\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/581/431/\">\n    581 B.R. at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Defendants also argue that Mr. Homaidan can recover damages for discharge injunction violations only through a claim for contempt of court, not the claim that he has brought here. And the Defendants argue that for a contempt claim to lie, the order at issue must be clear and unambiguous, and here, the Discharge Order is not. For these reasons, the Defendants argue that Mr. Homaidan's allegations cannot support a claim for what amount to contempt sanctions against the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Mr. Homaidan responds that the argument that there is no private right of action to address a discharge violation through an adversary proceeding is \"a red herring.\" Plf's Opp. at 29.

He argues that \"[t]here is no question that bankruptcy courts have the power to enforce discharge injunctions regardless of any specified private right of action,\" and \"there is no question that this is a proper action to address the alleged discharge injunction violations.\" Plf's Opp. at 29-30. And he states that the argument that the Court's Discharge Order is too vague to support a contempt finding is simply incorrect and would, in substance, strip the Court's power to enforce its own discharge orders. He also responds that the Defendants knew that his Tuition Answer Loans would be discharged, as indicated by, among other things, their statements to investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   At the outset, the Court considers whether an adversary proceeding is a permissible means to seek redress for a claimed violation of the discharge order entered in a debtor's bankruptcy case. Here, the Court is persuaded that an adversary proceeding is a permissible path to seek this relief, for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   First, a bankruptcy court may \"issue any order, process, or judgment necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions\" of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

E.D.N.Y. 2007), cited by the Defendants, is consistent with this conclusion. There, the plaintiff made claims for violation and contempt of the discharge injunction, and the Court noted that \"[a] plaintiff may bring a claim for a violation of the discharge injunction in the form of an action for a sanction for civil contempt.\"\n   <em>\n    In re McKenzie-Gilyard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3618899\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/388/474/\">\n    388 B.R. at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   But that is not the same as a finding that a claim for a discharge injunction violation may\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   be brought as a motion for contempt. Many courts have considered requests for damages for discharge injunction violations in the form of adversary proceedings, including courts in this District and Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Haynes v.

And whether the claim is styled as one for violation of the Discharge Order - as it is in the Complaint - or as one for contempt for violation of the Discharge Order, Mr. Homaidan will be required first to plead, and then to prove, the grounds for his entitlement to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Next, the Court considers whether the Court's Discharge Order is too vague to support a claim for relief. Here again, the Court is persuaded that the Discharge Order is not too vague to provide a basis for Mr. Homaidan's claim for relief, for several reasons. Such orders, and the Discharge Order here, are plain and unambiguous. To\n   be sure, a proceeding arising from an alleged discharge violation may well raise a host of issues. As one noted commentator observes, \"[a] proceeding to enforce the discharge injunction is a core proceeding ... and courts should readily reopen a closed bankruptcy case to ensure that the essential purposes of the discharge are not undermined.\" 4\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 524.02[2][c] (Alan N. Resnick &amp; Henry J. Sommer eds., 16th ed. 2018). And in such proceedings, \"[o]ften, a major issue ... is whether the debt is one that was discharged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5420530\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/367/478/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But that does not mean that the discharge injunction generally, or the Discharge Order here, is somehow vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   And finally, the Court considers whether the elements of a discharge violation have been adequately set forth in the Complaint. In order adequately to allege a claim for violations of the discharge injunction, the plaintiff must allege that he or she received a discharge, the defendant received notice of the discharge, and the defendant intended the acts that violated the discharge.\n   <em>\n    In re Motichko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3847462\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/395/25/#p31\">\n    395 B.R. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2008). And the debt at issue must be within the scope of the debtor's discharge. As one court noted, \"[s]howing a violation of a discharge order by definition requires showing specifically that the order applies to the debt on which the violation is premised.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Azevedo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824974\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/506/277/#p283\">\n    506 B.R. at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Eppolito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511672\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/583/822/#p826\">\n    583 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   826 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Otten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201881736\">\n    2013 WL 1881736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Here, the record shows that Mr. Homaidan alleges that he received a discharge. In particular, the Complaint states that on December 4, 2008, Mr. Homaidan filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case and \"properly scheduled the Tuition Answer Loans on Schedule F of his petition.\" Compl. \u00b6 44. The Complaint also states that \"[o]n April 9, 2009, this Court ordered discharge of all Plaintiff's properly scheduled pre-petition debt.\" Compl. \u00b6 45. And as the Court has already concluded, Mr. Homaidan has described facts that establish a plausible basis to conclude that his Tuition Answer Loans are not \"an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend\" that would be excluded from discharge by Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The record also shows that Mr. Homaidan alleges that the Defendants received notice of the discharge in his case. Specifically, he alleges that the \"Defendants were duly notified of the discharge of all of Homaidan's pre-petition debts.\" Compl. \u00b6 46. And the Complaint states that \"[o]n December 6, 2008 Defendant sent correspondence to Homaidan stating that they received notice of the bankruptcy filing and requested a copy of the 'the first meeting of creditors.' \" Compl. \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   And finally, the record shows that Mr. Homaidan alleges that the Defendants intended the acts that violated the discharge. In particular, the Complaint states, among other allegations, that the Defendants took steps to collect the Tuition Answer Loans including by correspondence on December 11, 2008, and by correspondence and notices sent \"at least on, August 3, 2010, September 6, 2010, September 8, 2010 and July 5, 2011.\" Compl. \u00b6 50. He alleges that these loans were made \"disproportionately to low-income students who lack the resources and knowledge to understand the differences between loans that are or are not dischargeable or to seek relief in an adversary proceeding, which is an expensive and time consuming undertaking.\" Compl. \u00b6 31. And Mr. Homaidan alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   Defendants represented to student debtors that the Bankruptcy Code prohibited discharge of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   loan made to any person for any educational purpose.... Defendants also failed to disclose facts and information that would inform debtors of the fact that private loans were only non-dischargeable if they met the requirements\n   of [Bankruptcy Code] section 523(a)(8)(B), and in particular, that Class Members' non-qualified loans were, in fact, discharged in bankruptcy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Mr. Homaidan alleges that at the same time that these collection efforts were under way, the Defendants \"also were securitizing these debts for sale on the secondary market,\" and making very different statements to investors. Compl. \u00b6 34. The Complaint states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Defendants were rightly concerned that if they represented to investors that all private student loans were non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, sophisticated investors would discover the misrepresentation (through an examination of the statute), and the issuers would be liable for securities violations. Defendants and other major lenders and underwriters therefore included in student loan asset-backed securities' prospectuses language warning investors that, pursuant to section 523(a)(8), only private loans made for qualified expenses were excepted from discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In sum, and as with Mr. Homaidan's first claim for relief, the question posed by this motion is whether Mr. Homaidan's claims that the Defendants violated the discharge injunction are rendered implausible by the nondischargeability terms of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii). And here again, at this stage in these proceedings, the Court concludes that the Defendants have not established that this claim is implausible. For these reasons, the Motion to Dismiss the Second Claim for Relief is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Whether the Defendants Have Shown that the Court Should Strike Portions of the Complaint Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f)\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Defendants request that the Court strike paragraphs 2 and 13 to 55 of the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). Rule 12(f) permits a party to \"strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).

These paragraphs, the Defendants argue, also amount to allegations of \"nonspecific fraud.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Mr. Homaidan responds that the Court should not strike any portion of the Complaint. Plf's Opp. at 40. He argues that the background to Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8) and the actions of the Defendants are relevant to this action. Mr. Homaidan also states that he \"believes that through discovery he will prove his allegations.\" Plf's Opp. at 40. And he claims that the Court should \"not strike any allegations in a motion to dismiss before discovery has taken place ... [He] will demonstrate a knowing violation of the discharge injunctions and the allegations reflect that intent.\" Reply at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The Complaint contains statements, among others, that the Defendants \"used the presumption of dischargeability to mislead student borrowers,\" and that the loans at issue \"are disproportionately issued to low-income students who lack the\n   resources and knowledge to understand the differences between the loans that are or are not dischargeable.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 31. He also alleges that the Defendants represented to sophisticated investors that the loans may be discharged in bankruptcy, while representing to student borrowers that they were not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Compl. \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   First, the Court must frame these statements in the context of Mr. Homaidan's claims for relief. Here, the Court notes that Mr. Homaidan has alleged that certain of his debts are not nondischargeable loans under any subsection of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8). And he also alleges that the Defendants committed willful violations of the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The Court also must consider whether any material in support of the statements would be admissible. Here, the Court observes that evidence of the Defendants' knowledge of the dischargeability of Mr. Homaidan's loans could potentially be admissible in the determination of his claims for willful violations of the Discharge Order. And here again, at this stage in these proceedings, the Court concludes that the Defendants have not established grounds to strike paragraphs 2 and 13 to 55 of the Complaint for containing redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. For these reasons, the motion to strike portions of Mr. Homaidan's Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Whether the Defendants Have Shown that the Court Should Strike Portions of the Complaint Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In the alternative, the Defendants also ask this Court to strike several paragraphs of Mr. Homaidan's complaint on grounds that these paragraphs contain allegations of \"nonspecific fraud\" and fail to meet the particularity requirement for averments of fraud as set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), made applicable here by Bankruptcy Rule 7009. Defs' Mem. at 50, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   At the outset, it is worth noting that in general, Rule 9(b) establishes a heightened pleading standard for claims that sound in fraud. It is not customarily invoked as a basis to strike language from a pleading. Rule 9(b) provides that in order to allege a claim for fraud, \"a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). To allege with particularity a claim for fraud, the Second Circuit has held that \" 'the complaint must: (1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rombach v.

And they argue these paragraphs do not meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b). Defs' Mem at 51. Mr. Homaidan responds that he \"has not alleged a claim of fraud, and need not meet any heightened pleading standard.\" Plf's Opp. at 3. The Defendants reply that \"while he doesn't explicitly plead the cause of action, the basis of [Mr.] Homaidan's claims is fraud.\" Reply at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Here, a review of the Complaint shows that Mr. Homaidan asserts claims for a declaratory judgment for violations of the Discharge Order, and for related relief. And here too, at this stage in these proceedings, the Court concludes that the Defendants have not shown that Mr. Homaidan states claims that invoke Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard for fraud, or\n   that Rule 9(b) requires the dismissal of these claims, or that Rule 9(b) provides a basis to strike any of the allegations in the Complaint. For these reasons, the motion to strike portions of Mr. Homaidan's Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Based on the entire record and for the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that the Defendants have not shown that the Plaintiff, Hilal Khalil Homaidan, has not stated plausible claims for relief. The Court also finds that the Defendants have not shown that paragraphs 2 and 13 to 55 of the Complaint should be stricken pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(f) or 9(b). For these reasons, the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   An order in accordance with this Memorandum Decision will be entered simultaneously herewith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    As noted above, the Court has denied the Defendants' motion to the extent that it sought to compel arbitration of these claims.\n    <em>\n     Homaidan v.
