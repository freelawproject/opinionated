ELIZABETH S. STONG, UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Introduction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before the Court are the motions to dismiss of defendants Firstmark Services (\"Firstmark\"), Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (\"PHEAA\"), and jointly, defendants National Collegiate Student Loan Trust 2005-3, National Collegiate Student Loan Trust 2006-4, and Goal Structure Solutions Trust 2016-A (the \"Trusts\") (collectively, the \"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In these motions, each of the Defendants argues that the Amended Complaint must be dismissed because it fails to state a plausible claim for relief for a declaratory judgment that any of them violated the discharge order entered in Tashanna Golden's bankruptcy case, or for damages, attorneys' fees, and costs as a result of a discharge violation. They argue, among other things, that they simply cannot discern what loans are at issue here, or what they have done to violate the discharge entered in Ms. Golden's bankruptcy case. And they argue that Ms. Golden has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   alleged a plausible claim that her loans are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   excluded from discharge by Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(B), as \"qualified education loan[s].\" In addition, PHEAA argues that the Amended Complaint must be dismissed because it is blocked by a different obstacle - the nondischargeability provisions of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) - because Ms. Golden's loans are excluded from discharge as \"an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend.\" And the Trusts argue that one of the loans at issue is rendered nondischargeable by\n   Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(i), because it was funded, at least in part, by a nonprofit institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Golden responds that she has alleged adequately that her direct-to-consumer student \"Tuition Answer Loans\" do not come within a category of debt that is excluded from discharge under\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   subsection of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8), including Section 523(a)(8)(B), as specifically alleged in the Amended Complaint, or any other subsection of Section 523. She also argues that she has alleged adequately her request for a declaratory judgment that her loans were discharged pursuant to this Court's discharge order in her Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, and also her request for damages, attorneys' fees, and costs, arising from the Defendants' violations of the discharge order entered in her case. For these reasons, she argues, the Court should not dismiss the Amended Complaint, and the Defendants' motions to dismiss should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding pursuant to Judiciary Code Sections 157(b)(1) and 1334(b), and the Standing Order of Reference dated August 28, 1986, as amended by the Order dated December 5, 2012, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In addition, this Court may adjudicate these claims to final judgment to the extent that they are core proceedings pursuant to Judiciary Code Section 157(b), and to the extent that they are not core proceedings, pursuant to Judiciary Code Section 157(c) because the parties have stated their consent to this Court entering a final judgment.

Pearson, filed a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, together with her bankruptcy schedules and statements. Case No. 16-40809. On April 22, 2016, she filed amended schedules and statements. In her Schedule F, \"Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority claims,\" she listed a \"Student Loan\" owed to \"Aes/Nct\" in the amount of $ 6,758.00 (the \"NCT Loan\"), a \"Student Loan\" owed to \"Fm/Slfv Tru\" in the amount of $ 8,828.00 (the \"Citibank Loan\"), and a \"Student Loan\" owed to \"Aes/Jpmg Ch\" in the amount of $ 5,539.00 (the \"Chase Loan\"). On July 28, 2016, the Chapter 7 Trustee filed a \"no-asset\" report stating that \"there is no property available for distribution from the estate over and above that exempted by law.\" Case No. 16-40809, Doc. entry dated July 28, 2016. On August 3, 2016, the Court entered an order discharging Ms. Golden (the \"Discharge Order\"), and on that same day, her bankruptcy case was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 6, 2016, Ms. Golden filed a motion to reopen her bankruptcy case to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of certain of her student loans, and on January 10, 2017, the Court entered an order reopening the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     This Adversary Proceeding\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 18, 2017, Ms. Golden commenced this adversary proceeding by filing a complaint against JP Morgan Chase Bank, Firstmark Services, GoldenTree Asset, and National Collegiate Trust. She seeks a determination that certain debts that she incurred as a student are not nondischargeable student loan debts under\n   Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(B), and an award of damages, including attorneys' fees and costs, for the Defendants' willful violations of the bankruptcy discharge injunction. Compl., Adv. Pro. No. 17-01005, ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 31, 2017, the Court approved a stipulation between Ms. Golden and National Collegiate Student Loan Trust 2005-3 and 2006-4, permitting them to intervene in this action. And on July 25, 2017, the Court approved a stipulation of dismissal as to defendant JP Morgan Chase Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 17, 2017, Ms. Golden filed an Amended Complaint to add class action allegations and additional defendants.

She claims that the \"Defendants ... originated and serviced dischargeable consumer loans but have disguised them as non-dischargeable student loans.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511933\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/414/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. Golden advances these allegations on behalf of an alleged class of similarly situated \"individuals who have declared bankruptcy since 2005 [across the] United States with loans originated and/or serviced by Defendants.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 7. And she alleges that these loans \"do not meet the definition of a non-dischargeable qualified education loan\" as set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 221(d) and Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(B).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511933\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/414/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Golden alleges that Congress enacted Section 523(a)(8) in order to \"prohibit the discharge of federal student loans ... [and] to address a growing concern that students were taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Code by incurring extensive student loan debt and then declaring bankruptcy soon after graduation.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 12. She claims that as initially adopted in the 1978 Bankruptcy Act, Section 523(a)(8) excluded from discharge government-issued student loans that became due within the five years prior to the bankruptcy petition. Am. Compl. \u00b6 13. Ms. Golden states that \"[l]ater amendments lengthened and then eliminated the five-year non-dischargeability time frame for loans by the federal government, making it increasingly difficult for debtors to ever attain discharges of those student loans.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ms. Golden also alleges that the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (\"BAPCPA\") \"expanded the definition of non-dischargeable student debt to include 'any other educational loan that is a qualified education loan, as defined in section 221(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.' \" Am.

The Amended Complaint states that qualified education loans are defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 221(d)(1)\"as debts incurred by eligible students, at eligible institutions, for eligible expenses. In turn, a 'qualified higher education expense' is one that issued to pay for the cost of attendance at a qualified educational institution.\" Am.

Compl. \u00b6 17. And she claims that \"lenders initiated new 'non-qualified' education loan programs ...

Am.

Compl. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Amended Complaint states that Ms. Golden attended the University of Pennsylvania Law School (the \"University of Pennsylvania\") during the 2006-07 academic year. Am. Compl. \u00b6 27. And she alleges that the University of Pennsylvania's \"cost of attendance\" for that academic year was $ 53,500. Ms. Golden received $ 22,440 in scholarship funds and grants from the University of Pennsylvania, and she borrowed $ 27,500 in loans from the federal government. She alleges that she borrowed an additional $ 7,103 in private loans from National Collegiate Trust - the NCT Loan - and that the NCT Loan was serviced by PHEAA. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. Ms. Golden claims that \"the NCT Loan was originated in excess of the published 'cost of attendance' and was not a qualified education loan under section 523(a)(8)(B).\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 30. And she claims that the NCT Loan \"was not 'made, insured, or guaranteed by a governmental unit' or made under a 'program funded in whole or party by' a non-profit[ ] and thus was not non-dischargeable under section 523(a)(8)(A)(i).\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ms. Golden alleges that she attended the University of Pennsylvania during the 2007-08 academic year as well, and during that term, the school's published \"cost of attendance\" was $ 56,380. Am. Compl. \u00b6 35. For that academic year, Ms. Golden alleges that she received $ 12,850 in scholarship funds and grants, and that she borrowed $ 52,347 from the federal government. Am. Compl. \u00b6 36. At that point, she already received funds in excess of the University of Pennsylvania's \"cost of attendance\" for the 2007-08 academic year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20221\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. Golden borrowed an additional $ 6,557 from JP Morgan Chase - the Chase Loan - and $ 9,348 from Citibank - the Citibank Loan.

Compl. \u00b6 40. She claims that the Defendants \"fraudulently informed [her] that the [d]ebts were not discharged and demanded ... and accepted payment.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 44. She also alleges that she was \"never issued a 1098-E tax form to deduct the interest payments made\" on the Tuition Answer Loans. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ms. Golden alleges that the \"Defendants and other creditors represented to student debtors that the Bankruptcy Code prohibited discharge of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   loan made to any person for any educational purpose.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 22. She claims that the Defendants utilized bankruptcy laws \"to defraud vulnerable and unsophisticated student borrowers.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 24. Ms. Golden states that the \"Defendants failed to disclose facts and information that would inform debtors of the fact that private loans were only non-dischargeable if they met the requirements of section 523(a)(8)(B), and in particular, that debtors' non-qualified loans were, in fact, discharged in bankruptcy.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 23. And she alleges that such loans are \"disproportionately issued to low-income students who lack the resources and knowledge to understand the differences between loans that are or are not dischargeable or to seek relief in an adversary proceeding.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   She alleges that while the Defendants and other lenders informed consumers that their loans were nondischargeable, these lenders securitized the same obligations for sale on the secondary market. Am. Compl. \u00b6 25. And she asserts that the prospectuses for these asset-backed securities cautioned investors that, pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8), \"only private loans made for qualified expenses were excepted from discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She alleges that instead of then treating these debts as discharged, the Defendants, \"by and through themselves and their agents, resumed collection efforts after the discharge [was] entered.\" Am.

Am. Compl. \u00b6 43. Yet, Ms. Golden contends, the Defendants \"fraudulently informed [her] that the Debts were not discharged and demanded payment and accepted payment.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 44. Specifically, she states, the Defendants sought to collect on the allegedly discharged debts \"by use of dunning letters, emails, text messages, and phone calls.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 75. Ms. Golden alleges that the \"Defendants' abusive, deceptive and illegal collection efforts after [the debts at issue] were discharged were made knowingly and willfully in violation of this Court's discharge orders.\" Am.

Am. Compl. \u00b6 71. Ms. Golden also asserts that since the Defendants were notified of the Discharge Order pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 4004(g), and still sought to collect on her debts by \"use of dunning letters, emails, text messages, and [telephone] calls,\" the Court should cite the Defendants for civil contempt, for their\n   willful violations of the Discharge Order, and order them to pay damages in an amount to be determined at trial pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Sections 524 and 105, and also to pay her attorneys' fees and costs.

Two claims are at issue: first, Ms. Golden's claim for a declaratory judgment that her Tuition Answer Loans were discharged by operation of law by the Discharge Order entered by this Court in her bankruptcy case; and second, her claim for a finding of civil contempt, and an award of damages, attorneys' fees, and costs, for the Defendants' violations of that Discharge Order in attempting to collect on those loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   That is, the question to be answered by the Court is neither more nor less than whether these claims and each of their elements has been plausibly alleged in the Amended Complaint. And the Court must do so by applying the standard set forth in Rule 8(a) and 12(b)(6), and the guidance established by the Supreme Court, to determine whether Ms. Golden has alleged \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And in this Motion to Dismiss, the Defendants argue that, for a panoply of reasons, she does not state a plausible claim for this relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In order to address the question of whether Ms. Golden's First Claim for Relief states a plausible claim, the Court first considers the question whether the allegations of the Amended Complaint set forth a plausible basis to conclude that the threshold requirements for a declaratory judgment are met. Next, the Court considers whether the Defendants have shown that Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) excludes Ms. Golden's Tuition Answer Loans from discharge as a matter of law. Then, the Court considers whether the Defendants have shown that Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(i) applies to exclude one of those loans, the NCT Loan, from discharge as a matter of law. And finally, the Court considers whether, under the standards set forth in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a), 12(b)(6), and 9(b), the Amended Complaint states each of the elements of a plausible claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Threshold Requirements for a Declaratory Judgment Are Met\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   First, the Court considers whether, in light of the allegations of the Amended Complaint and the arguments advanced by the Defendants, the threshold requirements for a declaratory judgment claim are met. Judiciary Code Section 2201 states that \"in any case of actual controversy,\" a court may, \"upon the filing of an appropriate pleading ... declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,\" and such declaration \"shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   According to the Second Circuit, \"[a] declaratory judgment action presents an actual controversy if 'the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Dicola v.

At the outset, the dispute is substantial. The Amended Complaint states that the Defendants knowingly undertook collection efforts on debts that - she alleges - come within the Discharge Order entered in her bankruptcy case. Ms. Golden alleges that she has been damaged, in a tangible way, by those efforts. And she alleges that the Defendants' collection efforts violated this Court's Discharge Order, warranting a finding of civil contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For these same reasons, the allegations of the Amended Complaint show that the parties have \"adverse legal interests,\" in light of these claims. It is in Ms. Golden's interests that her Tuition Answer Loans\n   be discharged under the applicable bankruptcy law, and it is in the Defendants' interests that this Court reach the opposite conclusion. It is also in Ms. Golden's interests that her allegations of contempt be sustained, and just as much, in the Defendants' interests that they be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Finally, there is nothing speculative about the relief that Ms. Golden seeks or, for that matter, the dismissal that the Defendants urge. The debts have been incurred, the Discharge Order has been entered, and the collection efforts have been undertaken. The controversy presented has the necessary \"immediacy and reality to warrant\" consideration of declaratory relief. The circumstances as alleged are immediate and real. For these reasons, the Court concludes that the threshold requirements for a declaratory judgment claim are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Defendants Have Shown that Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) Applies To Exclude the Loans at Issue from Discharge as a Matter of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Next, the Court considers whether the Defendants have shown that one of the exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 523(a)(8) applies to exclude Ms. Golden's Tuition Answer Loans from the scope of her bankruptcy discharge as a matter of law. In particular, the Court considers whether the Defendants - specifically, PHEAA - have shown that the loans at issue here are excluded from discharge because they are \"an obligation to repay funds used for an educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend\" within the scope of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The starting point for the analysis of exceptions to discharge is the rule, as stated by the Supreme Court, that \"exceptions to discharge 'should be confined to those plainly expressed,' and construed narrowly against the creditor.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141920\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/547/49/\">\n    547 B.R. at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kawaauhau v.

And equally important is, of course, the plain text of the statute. But that does not mean that a court must read the words with blinders on. Rather, as the Supreme Court has observed, it is a \"fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

But Section 523(a)(8) does not define \"student loans.\" Nor does it define \"educational benefit.\" Rather, it describes certain categories of debt that are not dischargeable in bankruptcy unless the debtor establishes that excepting the debt from discharge would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and his or her family, and those descriptions are particular and detailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In this light, the text of Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) merits attention. It describes \"funds received as an educational benefit.\" This would be an unconventional way to discuss a loan. And the neighboring terms to \"benefit\" are \"scholarship or stipend.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(A)(ii). These, plainly, do not describe a loan. The prior and following subsections refer to \"loan made,\" \"educational loan,\" and \"qualified education loan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(A)(i), 523(a)(8)(B). That is, the term \"loan\" was part of the drafting process of Section 523(a)(8), and it seems reasonable to assume that if Congress intended this subsection to include loans, it would have said so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii), both by its terms and read in context, does not sweep in all education-related debt, or all loans that support a student's efforts to gain the benefits of an education. If this Section had the breadth for which the Defendants advocate, it is hard to see where it would end - conceivably, it could encompass credit card debt that was incurred to purchase textbooks, personal loans that were used to pay for tuition and school fees, and any other debt that, in one way or another, facilitated a student's efforts to gain the \"benefits\" of an \"education.\" And plainly, this is not what Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) encompasses, or what the Bankruptcy Code permits, or what Congress intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In addition, this Court also agrees with those other courts, including courts within and outside this District, that have concluded that \"an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit\" must mean something other than a loan. As one bankruptcy court observed, this conclusion is necessary because another subsection, Section 523(a)(8)(B), excludes from discharge \"qualified education loans.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Decena\n   </em>\n   , 549 B.R. at 19. Interpreting Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) to encompass a loan would result \"in subsection 523(a)(8)(B) being subsumed by subsection 523(a)(8)(A)(ii), and [would] render[ ] subsection 523(a)(8)(B) superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   To similar effect, as the bankruptcy court concluded in\n   <em>\n    In re Campbell\n   </em>\n   , \"funds received as an educational benefit\" refers to certain kinds of education-related conditional grants, and not to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   student loans.\n   <em>\n    In re Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141920\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/547/49/\">\n    547 B.R. at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the court undertook a careful and thorough review of the case law and the legislative history of this exception to discharge, and held that \"in the absence of plain meaning to the contrary, or compelling legislative history, 'educational benefit' must be understood to refer to something other than a loan, especially given that Congress uses the word 'loan' elsewhere in [ Bankruptcy Code Section] 523(a)(8).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141920\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/547/49/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   As the court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   If the term \"educational benefit\" includes any student loan, there would be no need to specifically identify, as Congress did in \u00a7 523(a)(8)(i) and \u00a7 523(a)(8)(B), particular loans, extended by particular lenders, which are excepted from discharge, since \u00a7 523(a)(8)(A)(ii), if interpreted to extend to all education-related loans, would swallow both provisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407533\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/371/#p385\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And the court observed that \"[t]he concept which unites the three separate terms in the list in [ Bankruptcy Code Section] 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) is that they all refer to types of conditional grants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141920\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/547/49/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   More recently, in\n   <em>\n    McDaniel v.

Pa. 2018), the court considered whether a loan from the debtor's father to the debtor to pay for her undergraduate education was excluded from discharge as an \"educational benefit.\" There, the respondent - the debtor's father -- obtained federal \"Parent PLUS\" loans to fund the debtor's undergraduate education. And the debtor agreed in a promissory note - which the parties agreed was to be interpreted as a loan - to repay her father for the Parent PLUS loans. The respondent father obtained a state court judgment against the debtor after she defaulted under the terms of the note. During the pendency of the state court action, the debtor filed for bankruptcy, a discharge was entered, and the case was closed. The debtor successfully moved to reopen her bankruptcy case to determine the dischargeability of the note. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the respondent argued that the note constituted an \"educational benefit\" that was excepted from discharge pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(a)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Nypaver\n   </em>\n   court undertook a close analysis of the text of Section 523(a)(8)(a)(ii), adopted the more narrowly crafted view, and found that the promissory note did not come within the scope of this section, for several reasons. First, the court noted the discrepancy between the subjects of Section 523(a)(8)(a)(i) - \"an educational benefit overpayment or loan\" - and Section 523(a)(8)(a)(ii) - \"an obligation to repay funds.\" It found that \"[a]lthough common usage of the word 'funds' could include the proceeds of a loan, the structure of\n   <em>\n    Section 523(a)(8)\n   </em>\n   suggests a more limited and tailored definition.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Nypaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414942\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/581/431/\">\n    581 B.R. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the court observed that the word \"as\" in the phrase \"an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend\" in Section 523(a)(8)(a)(ii), suggests that the predicate of that subsection - \"educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend\" - informs the \"character\" of the funds owed, rather than the \"purpose\" of those funds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414942\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/581/431/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also stated that the use of the word \"as\" casts doubt upon the \"purpose of the loan\" analysis employed by courts that give a broad meaning to the term \"educational benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    Nypaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414942\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/581/431/\">\n    581 B.R. at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Disputed facts can be addressed in the context of dispositive motion practice, including a motion for summary judgment, but there too, the standard is high, and summary judgment - which is not the question before the Court here - may be granted only where there is no genuine dispute as to a material fact, so that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. As one court observed in response to similar arguments, summary judgment would be denied where the movant did \"not identify the program under which the Loans were extended, address the relationship between [another party] and TERI, or otherwise show that TERI funded the program under which the Loans were made.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Wiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268658\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/579/1/\">\n    579 B.R. at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If that language alone were sufficient, then it is hard to see what role would be left for Congress or the courts in drafting, interpreting, and applying these sections of the Bankruptcy Code. At the most, the Trusts have identified a disputed issue of fact that is not ripe for resolution at this stage of these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   That is, and here again, while it is far from clear whether Ms. Golden can prove her allegations, that question is not before the Court on these Motions to Dismiss. Rather, the Defendants argue that Ms. Golden's claims are rendered implausible by the nondischargeability terms of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(A)(i). And here, at this stage in these proceedings, the Court concludes that the Defendants have not established that these claims are implausible on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Defendants Have Shown that the Amended Complaint Does Not State a Plausible Claim that the Loans at Issue Are Outside the Scope of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)(B)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Finally, the Court considers whether the Defendants have shown that the allegations of the Amended Complaint do not set forth a plausible claim that Ms. Golden's Tuition Answer Loans are outside the scope of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8)'s exclusions from discharge, including in particular, Section 523(a)(8)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Defendants urge that the Amended Complaint falls short of the pleading standards required by the Federal Rules because, in substance, it does not establish a\n   plausible basis to conclude that Ms. Golden's Tuition Answer Loans are outside the scope of the nondischargeability provisions of Section 523(a)(8)(B). They also argue, in substance, that the Amended Complaint falls short of these standards because it does not give each Defendant notice as to what loans are at issue, what each of their individual roles was in connection with the loan, or what activities they each individually undertook to violate the discharge injunction. PHEAA states that the Amended Complaint names multiple defendants, but does not \" 'indicate clearly the defendants against whom relief is sought and the basis upon which the relief is sought against the particular defendants.' \" PHEAA Reply at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203487032\">\n    2013 WL 3487032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 ).

The Amended Complaint states that qualified education loans are defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 221(d)(1)\"as debts incurred by eligible students, at eligible institutions, for eligible expenses. In turn, a 'qualified higher education expense' is one that issued to pay for the cost of attendance at a qualified educational institution.\" Am.

She argues that the Amended Complaint sets forth allegations sufficient to show that her Tuition Answer Loans were for amounts that clearly exceeded the stated \"cost of attendance\" at the University of Pennsylvania, and for those reasons, her loans are not \"qualified education loans.\" And she points to allegations in the Amended Complaint that show that these loans \"lack the traditional characteristics of 'educational loans' \" because they \"were made under Defendants' direct-to-consumer lending programs\" and \"[were] not conducted through the financial aid offices of eligible schools.\" Plf's Opp. at 29.

She identifies the first loan as the NCT Loan, now owned by one or more of the Trust Defendants. And she notes that two of the Trust Defendants, National Collegiate Student Loan Trust 2005-3 and National Collegiate Student Loan Trust 2006-4, were substituted in as defendants in this action by a stipulation that was so-ordered by the Court. She states that the NCT Loan is serviced by PHEAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Ms. Golden identifies the second loan as the Citibank Loan, now owned by Defendant Goal Structured Trust 2016-A. That defendant, too, was brought into this action as a defendant by a stipulation that was so-ordered by the Court. And she states that the Citibank Loan is serviced by Firstmark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   And Ms. Golden states that the Amended Complaint clearly identifies the conduct that is alleged to have violated the Discharge Order entered in her bankruptcy case. She points to allegations that the loans at issue exceeded her cost of attendance at the University of Pennsylvania, and that as a result, these loans are dischargeable\n   debts. And she points to allegations that the Defendants, and the lenders and servicers of the loans at issue, have continued to demand payment and collect on these discharged debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Court first considers whether the Defendants have shown that Amended Complaint does not state plausible claims because the loans at issue are excluded from discharge by Section 523(a)(8) as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   At the outset, it is plain that not every debt that is incurred by a student in pursuit of an education is, without more, a nondischargeable \"student loan.\" This Court also notes that Section 523 must be applied in a way that provides discernable boundaries between a dischargeable and a nondischargeable debt. To be sure, that boundary may require a factual determination - such as whether a debt is obtained by \"false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud,\" as provided by Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(2)(A). But borrowers and lenders, debtors and creditors, and courts and parties should be able to discern whether a loan or debt is within or outside a debtor's discharge by reference to objective criteria. Where statutes - including, as here, the Bankruptcy Code and the Internal Revenue Code - provide definition, those definitions should be the starting point, and likely the concluding point, for the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Here, a review of the Amended Complaint shows that Ms. Golden alleges that she attended the University of Pennsylvania during the 2006-07 and 2007-08 academic years.

Compl. \u00b6 30. And she claims that the NCT Loan \"was not 'made, insured, or guaranteed by a governmental unit' or made under a 'program funded in whole or party by' a non-profit[ ] and thus was not nondischargeable under section 523(a)(8)(A)(i).\" Am.

As a result, she alleges, the Citibank Loan was \"originated in excess of the published 'cost of attendance' and [was] not [a] qualified education loan[ ] as that term is defined in section 523(a)(8)(B).\" Am.

It is likewise fundamental that a defendant is entitled to the dismissal of a claim that is implausible on its face.

The Amended Complaint states that \"[o]n or about August 3, 2016, this Court issued a discharge order in [Ms.] Golden's bankruptcy proceeding,\" and two days later, \"[o]n or about August 5, 2016, all creditors received notice of discharge.\" Am.

And the Defendants argue that for a contempt claim to lie, the order at issue must be clear and unambiguous, and here, the Discharge Order is not. For these reasons, the Defendants argue that Ms. Golden's allegations cannot support a claim for what amount to contempt sanctions against the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Ms. Golden responds that the argument that there is no private right of action to address a discharge violation through an adversary proceeding is \"a red herring.\" Plf's Opp. at 32. Additionally, she states that the Defendants argue that the Court's Discharge Order is \"too vague to support a contempt finding,\" but if the Defendants are correct in this assertion, then \"there could never be a contempt of a discharge order because every discharge order is vague.\" Plf's Opp. at 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Ms. Golden also responds that bankruptcy courts have the power to enforce discharge injunctions through adversary proceedings such as this. She argues that \"[t]here is no question that bankruptcy courts have the power to enforce discharge injunctions regardless of any specified private right of action,\" and \"there is no question that this is a proper action to address the alleged discharge injunction violations.\" Plf's Opp. at 32-33. And she states that the argument that the Court's Discharge Order is too vague to support a contempt finding is simply incorrect and would, in substance, strip the Court's power to enforce its own discharge orders. She also responds that the Defendants knew that her Tuition Answer Loans would be discharged, as indicated by, among other things, their statements to investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   At the outset, the Court considers whether an adversary proceeding is a permissible means to seek redress for a claimed violation of the discharge order entered in a debtor's bankruptcy case. Here, the Court is persuaded that an adversary proceeding is a permissible path to seek this relief, for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   First, a bankruptcy court may \"issue any order, process, or judgment necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions\" of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, a bankruptcy court may issue a judgment, which is \"a form of relief that is the result of an adversary proceeding, not the result of a motion,\" to enforce its statutory contempt powers and effectuate compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <em>\n    In re Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260794\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/550/228/#p240\">\n    550 B.R. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (concluding that \"an adversary proceeding is an appropriate vehicle to enforce a discharge injunction\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Second, and as another bankruptcy court has reasoned, to dismiss this case because the debtor seeks relief through an adversary proceeding rather than by motion would \"elevate form over substance [as] an adversary proceeding provides [the Defendants] with more, not less, procedural protection\" than would a motion for contempt.\n   <em>\n    West v. Home Sav. &amp; Loan (In re West)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203962569\">\n    2015 WL 3962569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio June 29, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Notably, this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re McKenzie-Gilyard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3618899\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/388/474/\">\n    388 B.R. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2007), cited by the Defendants, is consistent with this conclusion. There, the plaintiff made claims for violation and contempt of the discharge injunction, and the Court noted that \"[a] plaintiff may bring a claim for a violation of the discharge injunction in the form of an action for a sanction for civil contempt.\"\n   <em>\n    In re McKenzie-Gilyard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3618899\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/388/474/\">\n    388 B.R. at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   But that is not the same as a finding that a claim for a discharge injunction violation may\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   be brought as a motion for contempt. Many courts have considered requests for damages for discharge injunction violations in the form of adversary proceedings, including courts in this District and Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Haynes v. Chase Bank USA, N.A. (In re Haynes)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203608891\">\n    2014 WL 3608891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2014) (denying to dismiss an adversary proceeding alleging discharge violation on behalf of the plaintiff and alleged nationwide class);\n   <em>\n    Torres v. Chase Bank USA, N.A. (In re Torres)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5420530\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/367/478/#p491\">\n    367 B.R. 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2007) (denying the defendant's motions to dismiss adversary proceedings alleging discharge violations). And whether the claim is styled as one for violation of the Discharge Order - as it is in the Amended Complaint - or as one for contempt for violation of the Discharge Order, Ms. Golden will be required first to plead, and then to prove, the grounds for her entitlement to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Next, the Court considers whether the Court's Discharge Order is too vague to support a claim for relief. Here again, the Court is persuaded that the Discharge Order is not too vague to provide a basis for Ms. Golden's claim for relief, for several reasons. Such orders, and the Discharge Order here, are plain and unambiguous. To be sure, a proceeding arising from an alleged discharge violation may well raise a host of issues. As one noted commentator observes, \"[a] proceeding to enforce the discharge injunction is a core proceeding ... and courts should readily reopen a closed bankruptcy case to ensure that the essential purposes of the discharge are not undermined.\" 4\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 524.02[2][c] (Alan N. Resnick &amp; Henry J. Sommer eds., 16th ed. 2018). And in such proceedings, \"[o]ften, a major issue ... is whether the debt is one that was discharged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5420530\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/367/478/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But that does not mean that the discharge injunction generally, or the Discharge Order here, is somehow vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   And finally, the Court considers whether the elements of a discharge violation have been adequately set forth in the Amended Complaint. In order adequately to allege a claim for violations of the discharge injunction, the plaintiff must allege that he or she received a discharge, the defendant received notice of the discharge, and the defendant intended the acts that violated the discharge.\n   <em>\n    In re Motichko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3847462\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/395/25/#p31\">\n    395 B.R. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2008). And the debt at issue must be within the scope of the debtor's discharge. As one court noted, \"[s]howing a violation of a discharge order by definition requires showing specifically that the order applies to the debt on which the violation is premised.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <em>\n    In re Azevedo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824974\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/506/277/#p283\">\n    506 B.R. at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Eppolito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511672\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/583/822/#p826\">\n    583 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   826 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Otten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201881736\">\n    2013 WL 1881736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Here, the record shows that Ms. Golden alleges that she received a discharge. In particular, the Amended Complaint states that on February 29, 2016, Ms. Golden filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case and \"properly listed on Schedule F certain 'student loans' owed\". Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40. The Amended Complaint also states that \"[o]n or about August 3, 2016, this Court issued a discharge order in Golden's bankruptcy proceeding,\" and that \"[t]he Debts were discharged pursuant to the Discharge Order entered by this Court on August 3, 2016 because they were unsecured consumer loans and not non-dischargeable student loans under section 523(a)(8).\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42, 73. And as the Court has already concluded, Ms. Golden has described facts that establish a plausible basis to conclude that her Tuition Answer Loans are not excluded from discharge by operation of Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The record also shows that Ms. Golden alleges that the Defendants received notice of the discharge in her case. Specifically, she alleges that \"[o]n or about August 5, 2016, all creditors received notice of discharge,\" and \"Defendants were notified of the Discharge Order pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4004(g).\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43, 74. And the Amended Complaint states that \"[n]one of the Defendants filed an adversary proceeding to contest discharge of the Debts, although it was their legal burden to do so.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   And finally, the record shows that Ms. Golden alleges that the Defendants intended the acts that violated the discharge. In particular, Ms. Golden alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   instead of treating the Debts as discharged (because they were unsecured debt that was discharged in bankruptcy and not properly contested), Defendants, by and through themselves and their agents, resumed collection efforts after the discharge entered, and fraudulently informed [Ms. Golden] that the Debts were not discharged and demanded payment and accepted payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 44. And she alleges that \"Defendants nonetheless sought to collect on the Debts by use of dunning letters, emails, text messages, and phone calls [to] recover the discharged debt in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Ms. Golden alleges that \"[d]uring the same time that lenders were telling consumers that their loans were non-dischargeable, Defendants and other lenders were securitizing these debts for sale on the secondary market,\" and making very different statements to investors. Am. Compl. \u00b6 25. The Amended Complaint states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   Lenders were rightfully concerned that if they represented to investors that all private student loans were non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, sophisticated investors would easily enough discover the misrepresentation (based on a plain reading of the statute), and issuers would be liable for securities violations. Defendants and other major lenders and underwriters ... thereafter included in student loan asset-backed securities' prospectuses language expressly warning investors that, pursuant to section 523(a)(8), only private loans made for qualified expenses were excepted from discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   In sum, and as with Ms. Golden's first claim for relief, the question posed by these motions is whether Ms. Golden has stated a plausible claim that the Defendants violated the Discharge Order entered\n   in her case. And here again, at this stage in these proceedings, the Court concludes that the Defendants have not established that this claim is implausible. For these reasons, the Motions to Dismiss the Second Claim for Relief are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Based on the entire record and for the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that the Defendants have not shown that the Plaintiff, Tashanna Golden, has not stated plausible claims for relief. For these reasons, the Defendants' Motions to Dismiss are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   An order in accordance with this Memorandum Decision will be entered simultaneously herewith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    As noted above, this Court has denied Firstmark's motion to the extent that it sought to compel arbitration of these claims.\n    <em>\n     Golden v.
