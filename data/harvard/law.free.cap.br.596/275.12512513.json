Aug. 6, 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Prior Decision\n   </em>\n   \"). The Court refrained from addressing the parties' merit-based contentions because the\n   <em>\n    Prior Decision\n   </em>\n   did not completely resolve the motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12.

Sentry sold shares to foreign investors and invested 95% of the proceeds with BLMIS. Sigma and Lambda were \"funds of funds.\" They also sold shares to investors, but invested the proceeds with Sentry which, in turn, invested those funds with BLMIS. Thus, each of the Funds invested virtually all of their assets with BLMIS directly or indirectly, and the value of their assets\n   derived from the value of their BLMIS investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Funds were governed by their respective Articles of Association (\"Articles,\" and each provision within the Articles, an \"Article\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Directors of each Fund (referred to in the Articles as the \"Company\") were vested with the authority to manage the Fund. (Article 52.) Article 9 described the process for the subscription of shares and Article 10 addressed the redemption of shares. With certain exceptions and conditions that are not relevant, Article 10(1) provided that upon written request specifying the number and class of Shares to be redeemed, \"the Company ... shall redeem or purchase all or any portion of the Shares registered in the Applicant's name.\" The redemption payment was due on the Dealing Day which was generally thirty days after the receipt of the redemption request. (Article 10(1)(c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The redemption price was determined in accordance with Article 11 as of the Dealing Day. (Article 10(2).) The subscription price for investors buying into the Fund was also determined under Article 11. (Article 9(2).) Under Article 11, the Directors determined the NAV per share by dividing the value of the Fund's net assets by the number of outstanding shares. (Article 11(1)(a), (b).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Any certificate as to the Net Asset Value per Share or as to the Subscription Price or the Redemption Price therefor\n   <em>\n    given in good faith by or on behalf of the Directors shall be binding\n   </em>\n   on the parties.\" (Article 11(1)(c) (emphasis added).) The Funds delegated the duty to compute the NAV to Citco Fund Services (Europe) BV (\"Citco\") pursuant to a separate agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fairfield Sentry Ltd.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In Liquidation\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    v. Migani\n   </em>\n   , [2014] UKPC 9 (\"\n   <em>\n    Migani\n   </em>\n   \"), \u00b6 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to December 2008, the Directors certified the NAV for each subscription and redemption in the belief that Sentry's investment with BLMIS had substantial value. In December 2008, however, Madoff admitted to operating the investment advisory business of BLMIS as a Ponzi scheme, and BLMIS was placed into a liquidation proceeding pursuant to section 78eee of the Securities Investor Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78aaa,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   In hindsight, the Funds had overpaid the earlier redemptions based on an erroneous view of the value of Sentry's BLMIS investments. Shortly after Madoff's arrest and the collapse of BLMIS, the Funds became the subjects of liquidation proceedings in the BVI. The British Virgin Island Court (\"BVI Court\") appointed the Liquidators, the Liquidators commenced ancillary proceedings in this Court under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code to obtain recognition of the BVI liquidation proceedings as \"foreign main proceedings,\" and the Court granted the Liquidators' applications on July 22, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. BVI Redeemer Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In or about March 2010, the Liquidators commenced proceedings in the BVI (the \"BVI Redeemer Actions\") in the name of Sentry to recover redemption payments made in 2004. (\n   <em>\n    See Statement of Claim\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Fairfield Sentry Ltd.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In Liquidation\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    v. Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. Ltd.,\n   </em>\n   dated Mar. 12, 2010 (\"\n   <em>\n    Statement of Claim\n   </em>\n   \").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sentry's theory was straightforward. It invested 95% of its assets with BLMIS, (\n   <em>\n    Statement of Claim\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4), the BVI defendants (the \"Redeemers\") requested redemptions in March 2004, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6), and Sentry computed the NAV in accordance with the Articles in the aggregate amount of $135,405,694.70. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8.) Because BLMIS operated as a Ponzi scheme and Sentry's investments were worthless, the actual NAV was nil or nominal at the time of the redemptions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10.) Accordingly, the NAV was calculated under a mistake of fact by Sentry (unilateral mistake), and the Redeemers were unjustly enriched and liable to make restitution in the full amount or the difference between the redemption price and the actual, nominal amount of the redeemed shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11.) Alternatively, Sentry was entitled to set aside the redemptions on the ground of mutual mistake. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Preliminary Issues Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In early 2011, certain Redeemers filed applications requesting that the BVI Court hold a trial to determine \"preliminary issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    See Hare Declaration\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C.) A preliminary issues trial is a mechanism for deciding specific issues that are likely to resolve the case. (\n   <em>\n    Hare Declaration\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    Declaration of Phillip Kite in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend and in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , signed Jan. 12, 2017 (\"\n   <em>\n    Kite Declaration\n   </em>\n   \"), at \u00b6 9 (ECF Doc. # 963).) The Redeemers identified two preliminary issues; the first concerned the calculation of the NAV (the \"Certification Issue\"). They argued that if the NAV was calculated in accordance with Article 11(1) and \"certified,\" Sentry could not recalculate the NAV after redemption. (\n   <em>\n    Hare Declaration,\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.) Referring to Article 11(1)(c), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16), the Redeemers further argued that Sentry's good faith was irrelevant on the Certification Issue. Even if the certificates were issue in bad faith, Sentry could not rely on its own bad faith to defeat the binding nature of the certificates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21(1), 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The second, proposed preliminary issue addressed the consideration given by the Redeemers for the redemption payments (the \"Good Consideration Issue\"). They maintained that regardless of the NAV per share, they gave good consideration by surrendering their shares, and this provided a complete defense to Sentry's clawback claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sentry opposed the preliminary issues application. It argued that discovery was necessary on the Certification Issue, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. H, \u00b6\u00b6 8-12), but conceded that the Good Consideration Issue was purely legal though difficult. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14, 17.) Sentry did not contend that a factual issue existed as to whether the NAVs were calculated in bad faith, but did maintain that it could not say if a factual dispute existed on the \"Binding NAV Issues\" without disclosure as it did not yet have Citco's documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 20, 2011, Judge Bannister of the BVI Court issued a decision and separate order granting the Redeemers' motion, and ordered a trial on the two categories of preliminary issues (hereinafter, the \"Preliminary Issues\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. N.) He\n   subdivided the Certification Issue into three separate questions which were thereafter referred to as Preliminary Issues Nos. 1 through 3:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) Whether [a specific document] is a certificate within the meaning of Article 11(1) of the Articles of Association of the Claimant ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) if the answer to (1) is yes, whether any ... of the documents is\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (a) a certificate as to the Net Asset Value per share (\"NAV\") or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (b) a certificate as to Redemption Price within the meaning of the Articles;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (3) if the answer to (2)(a) or (b) is yes, whether the publication or delivery by the Claimant\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (a) as a matter of information only, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (b) in connection with a redemption request of a document containing substantially the same items of information as a document identified as falling within (2)(a) or (b) above to a redeeming or redeemed Member of the Claimant precludes the Claimant from asserting that money paid to that redeeming or redeemed Member on redemption exceeded the true Redemption Price and as such is recoverable as to the excess from such redeeming Member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. N, at ECF pp. 9 of 18.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Judge Bannister framed the Good Consideration Issue, now Preliminary Issue No. 4 (containing two subparts), as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Whether a redeeming Member of the Claimant in surrendering its shares gave good consideration for the payment by the Claimant of the Redemption Price and, if so, whether that precludes the Claimant from asserting that the money paid to that Member on redemption exceeded the true Redemption Price and as such is recoverable as to the excess from such redeeming Member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Acknowledging Sentry's concerns regarding the need for discovery, Judge Bannister included the following proviso that applied to the Certification Issue but not to the Good Consideration Issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Determination against the Claimant of any of the questions falling to be determined in issue (1) above [Preliminary Issues Nos. 1, 2 and 3] shall not debar the Claimant from subsequently asserting on the basis of a fact or facts not actually known to the Liquidators of the Claimant at the time of the hearing of issue (1) that notwithstanding the determination of that question a particular defendant is liable to repay to the Claimant all or some part of any redemption monies paid to that defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. N, at ECF pp. 9-10 of 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Preliminary Issues proceeded to trial. Prior to trial, the Redeemers submitted their\n   <em>\n    Skeleton Argument of the Defendants on the Preliminary Issues\n   </em>\n   , (\n   <em>\n    Kite Declaration\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A), in which they repeated their argument that whether the certificates were issued in good faith was irrelevant for two reasons. First, Sentry could not rely on its own bad faith to defeat the binding nature of a certificate. Second, the requirement of good faith was intended to protect the subscribers and redeemers, but was not intended to protect Sentry \"by enabling Sentry to escape from the consequences of understating the values in relation to subscriptions, or of overstating the values in relation to redemptions, in circumstances where its Directors have acted\n   in bad faith.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A, at ECF pp. 21 of 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Judge Bannister rendered his decision on the Preliminary Issues on September 16, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See Fairfield Sentry Ltd.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In Liquidation\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    v. Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. BVIHC (COM) 30-2010,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    BVI Court PI Decision\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He concluded that the various communications sent to investors by or on behalf of the Directors were not certificates within the meaning of Articles.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20546\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20546\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 30-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, he answered Preliminary Issues Nos. 1 and 2 in the negative, and those answers rendered Preliminary Issue No. 3 moot. (\n   <em>\n    Kite Declaration\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C, at ECF pp. 16-17 of 212.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   However, he further concluded that the Redeemers gave good consideration for the redemptions by surrendering their shares. He reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Left to myself I would have held that the redemption of shares in this case amounted to a bargain and sale for which the consideration received by Sentry was the surrender of the rights of the redeeming shareholder. ... I further fail to understand how Sentry can recover the redemption price in circumstances in which\n   <em>\n    restitutio in integrum\n   </em>\n   is no longer possible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    BVI Court PI Decision\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Judge Bannister concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In my judgment, therefore, it is not open to Sentry now to seek to recover the price which it paid for the purchase of the shares of redeeming investors simply because it calculated the NAV upon information which has subsequently proved unreliable for reasons unconnected with any of the redeemers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20546\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20546\">\n    at \u00b6 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, he answered Preliminary Issue No. 4 in the affirmative. (\n   <em>\n    Kite Declaration\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C, at 17 of 212.) Judge Bannister directed one of the Redeemers to promptly move for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Per the direction, one of the Redeemers filed a motion for summary judgment, (\n   <em>\n    Hare Declaration\n   </em>\n   , Ex. E), and Judge Bannister granted the motion on October 10, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P.) Initially, the Good Consideration Issue was directed at the cause of action based on Sentry's unilateral mistake alleged in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the\n   <em>\n    Statement of Claim\n   </em>\n   , (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P, at \u00b6 4), and the Preliminary Issues trial did not decide the claim based on mutual mistake. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P, at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 10.) Nevertheless, the Redeemers were entitled to summary judgment on the mutual mistake claim. First, equity would not permit a party to rescind a contract binding in law on grounds of common mistake. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P, at \u00b6 18.) Second, rescission was not available where, as in the case before him,\n   <em>\n    restitutio in integrum\n   </em>\n   was impossible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In reaching his decision, Judge Bannister rejected Sentry's request for an adjournment based on pleadings recently provided by the trustee of BLMIS and the need for more time to obtain evidence showing that the Redeemers received the redemptions with knowledge that BLMIS was a fraud. While acknowledging the general rule that it may be unconscionable for a party to retain the benefit of a transaction when it knows that the counterparty is acting under a mistake, Judge Bannister did not see how that principle could be applied where the parties could not be restored to their previous positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P, at \u00b6 20.) Furthermore, Sentry offered\n   nothing specific to indicate the Redeemers' bad faith, and the possibility that \"something may turn up\" did not provide a reason to deny a summary judgment motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P, at \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The ECCA Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Both sides appealed to the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal (\"ECCA\"), the Redeemers on the Certification Issue and Sentry on the Good Consideration Issue and the subsequent dismissal of its claims pursuant to summary judgment.

These interests reflect unfairness to a party on the one hand, and the risk of the administration of public justice being brought into disrepute on the other.... Both or either interest may be engaged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (2) An abuse may occur where it is sought to bring new proceedings in relation to issues that have been decided in prior proceedings. However, there is no prima facie assumption that such proceedings amount to an abuse, ... and the court's power is only used where justice and public policy demand it....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (3) To determine whether proceedings are abusive the Court must engage in a close 'merits based' analysis of the facts.

Sinclair\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The Defendants contend that even if the Liquidators did not know the facts necessary to allege Citco's bad faith, they had already alleged the same recklessness against the Fairfield defendants that they now level against Citco. Hence, the Liquidators could have argued that the certificates at issue in the BVI Redeemer Actions were not binding because of Fairfield's bad faith but chose not to raise the issue. \"It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Gore Wood &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , [2001] B.C.C. at 834. The allegations against the Fairfield defendants were not directed at any specific redemptions, and whether a particular certificate was issued in bad faith is a factual issue that must be determined on a case by case basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Common Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Although the Liquidators are not precluded from raising Citco's bad faith, the persuasive authority of\n   <em>\n    Migani\n   </em>\n   , its progeny and the common law principles that informed those decisions requires the Court to reject the Liquidators' argument that Citco's bad faith, which I assume for the purposes of analysis, allows them to recover the redemption payments. The only exception is where a Defendant knew the NAV was inflated at the time of redemption (hereinafter, a \"Knowledge Defendant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Migani\n   </em>\n   's emphasis on finality, certainty and workability has been successfully raised to prevent liquidators from recovering excess redemption payments even where the NAV was the product of fraud or the redemption payment was illegal. Once the redemption price has been paid based on the certified NAV, \"the tree must lie as it falls.\"\n   <em>\n    Pearson v. Primeo Fund\n   </em>\n   , [2017] UKPC 19, [2017] B.C.C. 552, \u00b6 20. Neither fraud nor illegality nor breach of trust allows either side to revisit the redemption payment in the absence of bad faith by the redeeming shareholder. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Weavering\n   </em>\n   , the defendant (\"SEB\") redeemed its investment in a fund at a price believed at the time to reflect the NAV per share.\n   <em>\n    Weavering\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-11. The value of the fund's investments depended on the value of certain swaps to which it was a party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. The fund's Article 34 provided that \"[a]ny valuations made pursuant to these Articles shall be binding on all persons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The swaps that formed the basis of the NAV were the product of the fraud of the controlling director and were worthless. As a result, the NAV per share used to calculate the redemption payments was inflated. Once the directors discovered the fraud, they suspended further redemption payments, put the company into liquidation, and the liquidator commenced a preference action against SEB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-4, 15. Among other things, the liquidators had to prove that the fund was unable to pay its debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   SEB came up with a novel argument. It submitted that the NAVs were the product of fraud, the fund did not have to pay any redemptions based on the mistaken NAVs, and accordingly, there were no debts that the fund was unable to pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. SEB volunteered that the liquidator\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have been able to recover the redemption payments based on a mistaken NAV, presumably under the common law, but that claim was time-barred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The Liquidators have referred to this unlitigated concession as authority for the proposition that they can recover redemption payments based on mistaken NAVs.

The Privy Council then concluded that the redemption payments were unlawful because they were capital payments made by an insolvent company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. In addition, it was a breach of trust by the directors to authorize the redemption payments if the company was insolvent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   It did not follow, however, that the inflated, illegal redemption payments could be recovered. The redemption itself was lawful and effective, and the resulting debt was incurred in consideration of the surrender of the shares and the cancellation of the debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The redemption payment, although itself unlawful, discharged a lawful debt owed to the redeeming shareholders that arose at the time of the redemption.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.

Carving out an exception where the payee was aware of the directors' breach of trust, the Privy Council summarized its holding in the following manner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   The Board concludes that the company is not entitled to recover the payments at common law on the ground of unjust enrichment. The reality of the present case is that a payment has been received from a company for lawful consideration but it has been authorised by its directors in breach of their duties to the company. This is the proper domain of the law of constructive trusts. Not even in return for good consideration can a person retain assets which he knows to have been paid to him in breach of the statutory duties of the directors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The same principles require the dismissal of the Liquidators' Common Law Claims with the one exception noted by\n   <em>\n    DD Growth\n   </em>\n   . A contract arose at the time that the Defendants served their notices of redemption. At that moment, they were entitled to be paid the NAV per share computed in accordance with Article 11(1) in exchange for their shares. If the certificates were issued in bad faith, the redeemers were free to contest the redemption price and insist on more. But once the Funds discharged their debts by making the redemption payments and the Defendants discharged their obligations by surrendering their shares, neither side could revisit the NAV based on hindsight. To allow otherwise would create the unworkable situation identified by\n   <em>\n    Migani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Weavering\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    DD Growth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The only exception allows the Liquidators to impose a constructive trust as to any Defendant who received a redemption payment and knew that the Fund's BLMIS investments were worthless or nearly worthless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Separately, the Defendants contend that the doctrine\n   <em>\n    ex turpi causa non oritur actio\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    ex turpi\n   </em>\n   \") bars the Liquidators' claims.

(\n   <em>\n    Mortimore I Declaration\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95, 97.) The Liquidators respond that there is nothing illegal or immoral in paying a redemption request or seeking to recover it based on the facts alleged regarding Citco's bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    Moss II Declaration\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95, 96, 99(a).) Furthermore, even if the doctrine\n   <em>\n    ex turpi\n   </em>\n   applied, Citco's bad faith would not be attributable to the Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97(a).) The primary victims of Citco's bad faith were the Funds and the remaining shareholders; the Defendants actually benefitted from Citco's bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99(b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    Ex turpi\n   </em>\n   is a flexible doctrine.

If the plaintiff establishes its\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, the Defendant may then assert the doctrine\n   <em>\n    ex turpi\n   </em>\n   to bar recovery, and the Court must consider several factors in determining whether public interest would be harmed by allowing the claim to proceed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   In assessing whether the public interest would be harmed in that way, it is necessary a) to consider the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim, b) to consider any other relevant public policy on which the denial of the claim may have an impact and c) to consider whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality, bearing in mind that punishment is a matter for the criminal courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107 (\"I would not attempt to lay down a prescriptive or definitive list because of the infinite possible variety of cases. Potentially relevant factors include the seriousness of the conduct, its centrality to the contract, whether it was intentional and whether there was marked disparity in the parties' respective culpability.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    Ex turpi\n   </em>\n   does not bar the Liquidators' claims. The Defendants were not unjustly enriched for the reasons already stated, but even if they had been, the Liquidators do not plead illegal or immoral conduct sufficient to trigger the doctrine. Clearly, the contract to redeem under the Articles was not illegal. Furthermore, although the Directors were prohibited from paying redemptions out of capital or in breach of trust, the redemption payments themselves were lawful and discharged the Funds' valid obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    DD Growth\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 61. That the redemption prices were based on bad faith certificates did not render the payments unlawful any more than did the fraud and illegality described in\n   <em>\n    DD Growth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Furthermore, the Liquidators' assertion of Citco's bad faith as a reason to recover the inflated redemption payments is self-defeating. The Articles state that for purposes of fixing the subscription and redemption prices, the NAV \"\n   <em>\n    shall be determined by the Directors\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Article 11(1)(a) (emphasis added).) The Funds delegated this task to Citco, who served as the Funds' administrator \"under the overall direction of the Directors,\" (\n   <em>\n    Migani\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14 (quoting Sentry's Private Placement Memorandum) ), but the Directors, not Citco, bore the responsibility for calculating the NAV per share. Accordingly, in considering whether the certificates were issued in good faith \"by or on behalf of the\n   Directors,\" and therefore binding, (Article 11(1)(c) ), it is the Directors' good faith, not Citco's, that is relevant. Moreover, Citco's knowledge and conduct will be imputed to its principal,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Funds, and the Funds are bound by its acts even if Citco acted fraudulently or in its own interests.\n   <em>\n    Bilta (UK) Ltd. v.

In that event, the Directors would have been duped by Citco and BLMIS when they authorized the excessive redemption payments. This scenario is merely a variation of the \"mistake\" claims rejected by the\n   <em>\n    Migani\n   </em>\n   courts.\n   <em>\n    See Kingate\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 153-54 (If the Administrator of BLMIS feeder funds rather than the funds mistakenly calculated the NAV, \"the Funds mistake was to believe the information supplied by BLMIS was correct.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    Kingate\n   </em>\n   , on which the Liquidators rely, (\n   <em>\n    see Moss II Declaration\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69), does not support the proposition that Citco's bad faith allows them to recover the redemption payments through the Common Law Claims. In\n   <em>\n    Kingate\n   </em>\n   , the liquidators of two BLMIS feeder funds (the \"Kingate Funds\") sued their manager (KML) and others to recover excessive management fees. The management fees were determined by the Kingate Funds' Administrator, a different entity, based on the NAV computed at the time. As with the Fairfield Funds, the NAV did not reflect the \"true\" value which only became apparent after the revelation of BLMIS' fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The relevant agreements provided that the valuations made pursuant to the articles were binding on all persons in the absence of \"bad faith or manifest error.\"\n   <em>\n    See Kingate\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. The case proceeded on the trial of seven inter-related preliminary issues. In each instance, the defendants\n   <em>\n    conceded\n   </em>\n   that the Liquidators were entitled to recover the excess payments if the NAVs were tainted by bad faith or manifest error.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75 (\"The Defendants submit that ... absent bad faith or manifest error KML was entitled to be paid 1.5% of the NAV as determined at the time by the Administrator.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108 (Mr. Boyle, one of the counsel for other defendants, submitted that bad faith or manifest error were the only circumstances in which valuations would not be binding);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120 (accepting the submission of Mr. Lowe, counsel for other defendants, \"that absent bad faith or manifest error the Court should not look behind the ostensible NAV determination to enquire whether that determination was actual or merely purported.\"). The issue was not litigated and the\n   <em>\n    Kingate\n   </em>\n   Court declared, adopting the parties' positions, that \"the Administrator's determinations of the NAV were binding on the Funds for the purpose of calculating the fees due to KML pursuant to the Manager Agreements in force between the Funds and KML, in the absence of bad faith or manifest error.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Kingate\n   </em>\n   Court did not rule that bad faith or manifestly erroneous valuations allowed the liquidators to recover the management fees; instead, the defendants conceded the point, at least for the purposes of the preliminary issues. Furthermore, the\n   <em>\n    Kingate\n   </em>\n   Court did not consider whether the Administrator's manifest error (the liquidators did not plead bad faith) would be imputed, and if so, what that meant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Each of the Common Law Claims alleging unjust enrichment, money had and received and mistaken payment (First through Sixth Claims) asserts that because the Funds overpaid the redemption prices considering the \"true facts,\" the Defendants did not give \"valuable consideration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Proposed Citigroup Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 96, 103, 109, 118, 129, 138).) This assumption is wrong. The Defendants gave the consideration required by their contracts with the Funds when they surrendered their shares in exchange for the Funds' discharge of their contractual redemption\n   obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, finality and certainty are necessary to make the redemption scheme \"workable,\" and accordingly, if a valuation is \"purportedly made\" in compliance with the redemption scheme and the transaction is consummated, the valuation cannot be attacked at a future date based on the subsequent discovery of additional facts.\n   <em>\n    See Weavering\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29 (\"That is the purpose of article 34, which is to be construed as referring to a valuation purportedly made in compliance with the articles. Otherwise, the problems identified in paragraph (23) of the judgment in\n   <em>\n    Fairfield Sentry\n   </em>\n   will arise.\"). The suggestion that the subsequent disclosure of facts indicating that the valuation was made in bad faith vitiates the contract and requires restitution lacks support. The only exception concerns the Knowledge Defendants that received redemption payments with the knowledge that the NAV was wrong.

Instead, the Liquidators argue that the term must be implied. The Twelfth Claim alleges that at any time prior to the issuance of a good faith certificate, the redemption price is subject to adjustment, and the Articles contained an implied term permitting the Fund to recover any overpayments based,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , on obviousness, business efficiency and the reasonable expectation of the parties. (\n   <em>\n    Proposed Citigroup Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 193.) The Thirteenth Claim, based on breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, alleges that the Defendant denied the Fund the benefit of its bargain by retaining the inflated redemption payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 203.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Attorney General of Belize v.

The most usual inference in such a case is that nothing is to happen. If the parties had intended something to happen, the instrument would have said so. Otherwise, the express provisions of the instrument are to continue to operate undisturbed. If the event has caused loss to one or other of the parties, the loss lies where it falls.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   In some cases, however, the reasonable addressee would understand the instrument to mean something else. He would consider that the only meaning consistent with the other provisions of the instrument, read against the relevant background, is that something is to happen. The event in question is to affect the rights of the parties. The instrument may not have expressly said so, but this is what it must mean. In such a case, it is said that the court implies a term as to what will happen if the event in question occurs. But the implication of the term is not an addition to the instrument. It only spells out what the instrument means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   .....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   It follows that in every case in which it is said that some provision ought to be implied in an instrument, the question for the court is whether such a provision would spell out in express words what the instrument, read against the relevant\n   background, would reasonably be understood to mean....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, 18, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Given the interests identified in\n   <em>\n    Migani\n   </em>\n   , it is neither obvious nor efficient nor consistent with the parties' expectations to imply that subscribers, redeemers or the Funds agreed to open-ended liability based on hindsight for incorrectly stated NAVs. The Funds computed the NAV and paid the redemption price, and the Defendants surrendered their shares. Each party discharged its contractual obligations under the Articles, the transaction was consummated and there is no return to the status quo. The Liquidators seek to imply a term that would, in\n   <em>\n    Migani's\n   </em>\n   words, render the scheme unworkable.\n   <em>\n    See Weavering\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 (\"The argument advanced by SEB was equivalent to an argument rejected in\n   <em>\n    Fairfield Sentry\n   </em>\n   as 'impossible.' Properly construed, the articles required the published NAV to be binding in respect of both acquisition and redemption of shares: they could not be construed as conferring on the Company an ability to adjust the NAV from time to time in the light of new information. Such an approach to the articles would render the rights of shareholders entirely uncertain.\"). Similarly, there is no basis to imply a term that requires a Defendant to return an overpayment where the very principles of unjust enrichment invoked by the Liquidators allow it to keep that payment.

(\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 69-70.) This argument\n   was expressly rejected by the ECCA.\n   <em>\n    ECCA 273 Decision\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Defendants Were Not Creditors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Defendants argue that the Funds could not have preferred them as creditors under section 245 because they were members rather than creditors when the Funds became obligated to pay them. In addition, the BVI liquidation rules subordinated the members to the creditors. (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 62-63 &amp; n. 43.) As discussed earlier, the Defendants became creditors when they requested redemptions. In addition, the Funds were not in liquidation when they paid the redemptions, and the liquidation priorities are irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Defendants Gave Sufficient Consideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   An undervalue transaction requires the plaintiff to plead and ultimately prove,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the transferor received nothing or \"significantly less\" in exchange for the value it transferred. INSOLVENCY ACT \u00a7 246(1)(b). Relying on a market value approach, the Defendants contend that the redemption prices they received reflected the value of the shares they surrendered. (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 64.) The NAV per share, as calculated at the time, reflected the price that a well-informed purchaser of shares or redeemer of shares would accept to purchase or redeem. Thus, the NAV per share as calculated at the time represented the open market value of the shares. The Liquidators respond,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the true value of the Funds' assets and the shares were nil, and the Court can look to subsequent information to determine the true value of the consideration the Funds received in exchange for the redemption payments. (\n   <em>\n    Liquidators Reply\n   </em>\n   at 27-30.) The parties' dispute turns on whether value can be determined based on hindsight in connection with the determination of an avoidance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

For tax reasons, the price was structured in two parts. First, the defendant assumed certain obligations of the debtor. Second, the defendant's parent agreed to rent the debtor's leased computers and pay four annual installments of rent. The rental payments formed most of the purchase price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   At the time of the transaction, the value of the stream of rental payments was uncertain because the master computer leases absolutely prohibited the debtor from subleasing the computer equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. After the transaction closed, the master lessors terminated the computer leases based on the unauthorized transfers, and the defendant's parent refused to make the rental payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The debtor went into liquidation, and the liquidator sued the defendant, challenging the transfer of the debtor's business as an undervalue transaction pursuant to section 238 of the U.K. Insolvency Act. The House of Lords, per Lord Scott, initially concluded that the purchase price for the debtor's assets included the obligations assumed by the defendant and the lease payments the defendant's parent agreed to make.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. One of the questions was what value to place on the parent's covenant to make the lease payments which became worthless when the master lessors repossessed the computers after the sale transaction had closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Lord Scott ruled that under the circumstances of the case, he could consider events that occurred after the closing which shed light on the value of the consideration given at the time of the closing. The survival of the sublease covenant was uncertain at the time it was given because the sublease violated the master lease. Where the contingency that rendered value uncertain actually occurs, it is \"unsatisfactory and unnecessary for the court to wear blinkers and pretend that it does not know what has happened.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Thus, when considering \"the valuation of the consideration for which a company has entered into a transaction, reality should, in my opinion, be given precedence over speculation.

It dealt with a situation where the value of the covenant to lease computer equipment was uncertain at the time it was given, and a post transaction event resolved the uncertainty and rendered the covenant worthless. It did not establish a general rule that a court may value an asset with the benefit of hindsight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joiner v. George\n   </em>\n   , [2003] BCC 298, \u00b6 71.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Liquidators' case does not deal with a post-transaction event that fixed the actual value of consideration that was uncertain at the time it was given. According to the Liquidators, the Defendants' shares were always worthless. Instead, it concerns a pre-existing state of facts that was not discovered until after the redemption transaction was completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Nevertheless,\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   implies that when the value of consideration is uncertain at the time it is given, and a subsequent event eliminates the uncertainty and fixes the actual value, the Court may consider the value of the consideration with the benefit of that hindsight in deciding an undervalue avoidance claim. In addition, the uncertainty must be within the knowledge of the party giving the consideration, although\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   does not make clear whether the knowledge must be objective or subjective. At one point, the Court implied that the obligors were aware of the uncertain value of the future lease payments,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22, but at other points, the Court seemed to suggest that objective uncertainty was sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26. Accordingly, to take advantage\n   of the rule laid down in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   , the Liquidators must plead, at a minimum, that at the time of a redemption, a Defendant had reason to believe that the NAVs were inflated and the Defendant's shares were worthless. The Liquidators contend that the Knowledge Defendants knew or should have known that the NAVs were inflated because of Madoff's fraud, (\n   <em>\n    see Proposed Citigroup Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-81), and if this turns out to be the case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court should not wear \"blinkers\" and attribute a value that these Defendants thought was precarious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Redemptions Did Not Injure the Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Defendants also contend that the redemptions did not injure the Funds. They argue that the value of their BLMIS portfolio and the subscription and redemption prices were inflated to the same degree as a result of Madoff's fraud. Thus, as long as the BLMIS fraud was ongoing, the Funds could raise more money through equally inflated subscription payments. (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 58-61.) Arguably, Sentry could also redeem all or part of its investment in its BLMIS account and use those withdrawals to satisfy its own investors' redemption requests, including redemptions by Lambda and Sigma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The argument is unpersuasive. Although the Funds themselves were not operated as Ponzi schemes, the withdrawal of money based on inflated NAVs had the same effect. Each redemption at an inflated price drove the Funds deeper into insolvency and caused harm to the Funds and the remaining investors that did not redeem their investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Funds Were Not Insolvent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Both BVI Avoidance Claims require the Liquidators to prove that each redemption was made when the Fund was insolvent or was rendered insolvent. Section 244(3) of the INSOLVENCY ACT incorporates the definition of \"insolvent\" contained in INSOLVENCY ACT \u00a7 8(1), excluding paragraph (c)(i) of that section. For present purposes, \"insolvent\" means \"the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due.\" INSOLVENCY ACT \u00a7 8(1)(c)(ii). \"Liabilities\" include future, certain, contingent, fixed or liquidated liabilities, but do not include illegal or unenforceable liabilities. INSOLVENCY ACT \u00a7 10(2), (3). The excluded subparagraph refers to balance sheet insolvency (\"the value company's liabilities exceeds its assets\"). The Defendants argue that the Funds have alleged that they were able to pay their liabilities as they came due, (\n   <em>\n    Proposed Citigroup Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164), and hence, have pled themselves out of their claims. (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 65-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Defendants mischaracterize the Liquidators' pleadings. In fact, the Liquidators allege that the Funds were unable to pay their debts as they fell or would fall due. (\n   <em>\n    Proposed Citigroup Com\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    plaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 39.) The Defendants ignore these allegations, and quote the portion of the Liquidators' pleading alleging that the Funds \"were only able to pay debts falling due\" because they could redeem their investments in the BLMIS Ponzi scheme or use incoming subscriptions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164.) Liabilities include future and contingent debts, including redemption debts (no one invests forever), and once the BLMIS Ponzi scheme collapsed, as it did, the Funds had few if any assets to pay any liabilities. In the end, insolvency is a question of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The Liquidators' Plead Complete Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Ordinary Course of Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   \"[A] complaint can be dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion raising an affirmative defense if the defense appears on the face of the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Color Tile, Inc. v.

A transaction is not an unfair preference if it took place in the ordinary course of business. INSOLVENCY ACT \u00a7 245(2). The Defendants contend that the redemption of shares and the payment of the redemption price is an ordinary business transaction. (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 66-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   While the Funds may have redeemed shares in the ordinary course of the Funds' business, it does not follow that they made the redemptions at issue in the ordinary course of business. In fact, the Liquidators allege that the Funds made the redemptions based on bad faith and erroneous valuations. At bottom, whether each redemption payment was made in the ordinary course of business is a factual question that cannot be resolved in the context of motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Good Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   A company does not enter into an undervalue transaction if enters into the transaction in good faith, and at the time, there were reasonable grounds to believe that the transaction would benefit the company. INSOLVENCY ACT \u00a7 246(2). The Defendants maintain that the Liquidators' pleadings establish this defense. The Liquidators plead that the Funds were victims of the BLMIS fraud, and redeeming shares was part of the Funds' essential business and basic contractual obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 66-69.) Having concluded that Citco's bad faith is imputed to the Funds, the Court cannot conclude that the redemption of shares at inflated NAVs was made in good faith or that it was reasonable to believe at the time of the redemption payments that they would benefit the Funds.

Relying on the \"plain text\" of section 561(d), the Defendants argue that it makes section 546(e) apply extraterritorially to bar the Liquidators' avoidance claims as well as their common law claims. (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 36-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Not surprisingly, the Liquidators disagree. They acknowledge that the safe harbor in section 546(e) bars certain avoidance claims brought by a chapter 7 or chapter 11 trustee, but argue that section 546(e) does not apply extraterritorially, and section 561(d) does no more than make section 546(e) equally applicable (or inapplicable) in a chapter 15. They reason that since section 546(e) does not apply extraterritorially to an action by a chapter 7 or a chapter 11 trustee to avoid a foreign transfer, it does not apply to an action brought by foreign representatives like those brought by the Liquidators in the U.S. Redeemer Actions. (\n   <em>\n    Liquidators Reply\n   </em>\n   at 61-62.) Furthermore, even if the Enforcement Parenthetical extended the enforcement of contractual Close-Out Rights\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   to collateral located abroad, the Defendants are not seeking to exercise Close-Out Rights; the Liquidators are\n   seeking to avoid transfers. The Enforcement Parenthetical simply clarifies that provisions affecting enforcement of Close-Out Rights apply irrespective of whether the assets of the foreign debtor are present in the United States, but property transferred to a third party prior to a bankruptcy case is neither property of the estate\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor property of the debtor when the case is commenced. Therefore, in the Liquidators' claim to avoid a transfer made by the debtor, the property transferred is not an \"asset of the debtor\" within the Enforcement Parenthetical. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-63.) Finally, interpreting section 561(d) to extend the safe harbor to foreign transfers would undermine chapter 15's goal of granting relief to a foreign main proceeding by allowing a Defendant who has received a foreign transfer to assert U.S. bankruptcy law to defeat a BVI avoidance action.

The plain text indicates that it does. Section 561(d) serves two purposes. First, it prevents a foreign representative or a U.S. bankruptcy court from interfering with the enforcement by a non-debtor counterparty of its Close-Out Rights, and \"such enforcement [is] not to be limited based on the presence or absence of assets of the debtor in the United States.\" In other words, the chapter 15 bankruptcy court cannot enjoin a party over which it has personal jurisdiction from exercising its Close-Out Rights to foreclose on collateral regardless of whether the collateral is located within or without the United States. The Liquidators concede as much. (\n   <em>\n    Foreign Representatives' Supplemental Memorandum of Law Addressing Bankruptcy Code Section 561(d) pursuant to February 1, 2018 Order of the Court\n   </em>\n   , dated February 15, 2018 (\"\n   <em>\n    Liquidators Supplemental Memo\n   </em>\n   \") at 9 (\"[T]he purpose of the parenthetical is apparent: to make as plain as possible that the provisions protecting netting agreements are fully applicable in ancillary proceedings,\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   the debtor's assets comprising the collateral subject to netting or off-set are sited abroad.\") (emphasis in original) (ECF Doc. # 1656).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Second, section 561(d) limits the foreign representative's ability to recover property transferred in connection with the earlier exercise of Close-Out Rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   It provides that the safe harbors under the Bankruptcy Code \"shall apply in a case under chapter 15 ... to limit avoidance powers to the same extent as in a proceeding under chapter 7 or 11 of this title.\" A chapter 15 foreign representative cannot exercise the avoidance powers available to a trustee in chapter 7 or chapter 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7). Consequently, section 561(d) is necessarily referring to avoidance powers available under non-U.S. law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants argue that section 561(d) precludes foreign law avoidance claims\n   brought in the United States even when the property transferred in connection with the enforcement of the Close-Out Rights,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the collateral that was foreclosed, was located outside the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 36;\n   <em>\n    Defendants Reply\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Court concludes that the Liquidators' interpretation is unreasonable because it severs the provision that protects Close-Out Rights from the clause that limits foreign avoidance claims. These provisions complement each other and cannot be viewed separately because the same concern - the domino effect of a financial meltdown - animates both clauses. The foreign representative cannot prevent the enforcement of the Close-Out Rights and cannot avoid the transfers that result from the enforcement of Close-Out Rights. Yet under the Liquidators' interpretation, they could not prevent the enforcement of the Close-Out Rights but could nonetheless avoid and recover the corresponding transfers. Their interpretation leads to the absurd result of protecting the transfer at the front end while avoiding it at the back end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Origins of Section 561(d)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   To the extent there is any ambiguity, the history leading to the adoption of section 561(d) confirms the Court's interpretation. Section 561(d) originated with legislation proposed in 1996 by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (\"ISDA\") and the Public Securities Association (\"PSA\") (together, \"ISDA/PSA\"). At that time, ISDA/PSA focused on the concern that \"a failure of one large participant in financial markets or a disruption in one market\n   <em>\n    could lead to widespread difficulties at other institutions or systemic disruptions in other markets or in the financial system as a whole.\n   </em>\n   \" International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. &amp; Public Securities Association,\n   <em>\n    Financial Transactions in Insolvency: Reducing Legal Risk Through Legislative Reform\n   </em>\n   , at 1 (Apr. 2, 1996) (\"\n   <em>\n    Reducing Legal Risk\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Relevant to these adversary proceedings, the ISDA/PSA worried that the bankruptcy of a counterparty to a qualifying transaction could interfere with the non-debtor counterparties' ability to enforce its Close-Out Rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201521\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201521\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The ISDA/PSA explained the purpose of the proposed provision in the following manner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   Section 106(m) clarifies that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code related to securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements and master netting agreements will apply in a Section 304 proceeding ancillary to a foreign insolvency proceeding. This provision is designed so that a bankruptcy court or trustee does not exercise its discretion in a Section 304 proceeding to reach a result that would be at odds with the result that would be required in a non- Section 304 proceeding for a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201521\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201521\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The proposal was prompted by the anxiety over the bankruptcy court's injunctive powers. While the automatic stay did not apply in section 304 ancillary proceedings, bankruptcy courts had broad authority to grant injunctions in favor of foreign representatives and could potentially bar the exercise of the Close-Out Rights, especially the right to foreclose on collateral, leading to a meltdown of the financial system. Fear over injunctive relief came into greater focus with the insolvency of Long-Term Capital Management (\"LTCM\") in 1998.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   LTCM, a Delaware limited partnership, operated a fund (the \"LTCM Fund\") organized as a Cayman Island partnership. Beginning in late July 1998, the LTCM Fund started to sustain substantial losses. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets (\"Working Group\"), which consisted of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Chairman of the SEC and the Chairperson of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, issued a study relating to LTCM's downfall and made certain recommendations to prevent disruptions in the markets. President's Working Group,\n   <em>\n    Hedge Funds, Leverage, and the Lessons of Long-Term Capital Management\n   </em>\n   (Apr. 1999) (\"\n   <em>\n    Working Group Report\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Although the LTCM Fund was ultimately bailed out, the Working Group, among other things, hypothesized the effect of a default on the LTCM Fund's counterparties. It noted that if the LTCM Fund was the subject of a Cayman Islands insolvency proceeding, \"its Cayman receiver could have sought a Section 304 Injunction prohibiting at least temporarily the liquidation\n   of U.S. collateral pledged by LTCM to its counterparties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201521\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201521\">\n    at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See Liquidators Supplemental Memo\n   </em>\n   at 5 n. 2 (collecting bills).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Section 561(d) was ultimately enacted as part of the Bankruptcy Abuse and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (\"BAPCPA\") along with other provisions that clarified and expanded the protections afforded to the exercise of Close-Out Rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. 109-8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Stat.%2023\">\n    119 Stat. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 907 (2005). The House Report explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   New section 561 of the Bankruptcy Code clarifies that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code related to securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward\n   contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements and master netting agreements apply in a proceeding ancillary to a foreign insolvency proceeding\n   <em>\n    under new section 304 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   H.R. REP. NO. 109-31, pt. 1, at 133 (2005) (emphasis added). Of course, there was no \"new\" section 304 enacted as part of BAPCPA; BAPCPA abrogated section 304, and substituted the more comprehensive chapter 15 in its place. The legislative history pertaining to section 561(d) was apparently lifted from prior conference reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Thus, Section 561(d) traces its lineage to the ISDA/PSA proposal, and its adoption along with the expansion of the safe harbor protections reflect Congressional intent to provide broad protection to avoid the spread of financial contagion. While Congress and the Working Group were primarily and understandably concerned with U.S. creditors and U.S. markets, the ISDA/PSA recognized that the financial contagion they feared did not stop at the border, and neither the statute nor the legislative history suggests that the safe harbors are limited to U.S. creditors or U.S. markets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The Liquidators' argument that section 561(d) was simply intended to put ancillary proceedings on the same footing as plenary bankruptcies is correct but misses the point. A chapter 7 or a chapter 11 trustee cannot avoid and recover a transfer that occurred in connection with the enforcement of a Close-Out Right if the exercise of the Close-Out Right could not be prevented under the Bankruptcy Code. The exercise of Close-Out Rights is exempt from the automatic stay under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and except for certain intentional fraudulent transfers, the safe harbor bars the trustee from avoiding transfers that occurred in connection with the pre-petition exercise of Close-Out Rights. Similarly, a chapter 15 foreign representative (and the bankruptcy court) cannot prevent the enforcement of Close-Out Rights, even if the exercise of those rights involves the transfer of collateral located abroad and cannot invoke non-U.S. law to avoid and recover those transfers if they have already occurred. Furthermore, the Liquidators' policy argument that the Defendants' interpretation of section 561(d) will undermine chapter 15 by placing limitations on the ability of foreign representative to avoid Covered Transactions involving foreign assets may be true but ignores the policy rationale underlying the adoption and subsequent expansion of the Bankruptcy Code's safe harbor provisions to prevent a financial meltdown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Liquidators' Foreign Avoidance Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Through the extant complaints and/or proposed amendments, the Liquidators seek to avoid and recover \"unfair preferences\" and \"undervalue transactions\" pursuant to the INSOLVENCY ACT \u00a7\u00a7 245 and 246, respectively. As noted earlier, these claims correspond to claims to avoid preferences under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and constructive fraudulent transfers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (incorporating state avoidance law) and 548(a)(1)(B).

The more difficult question is whether the transferor or the transferee was a covered entity - either a financial institution or a financial participant. Within weeks of the parties' submissions, the Supreme Court issued\n   <em>\n    Merit\n   </em>\n   . It concluded that the transferor or transferee had to be a qualifying entity under section 546(e),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 892-95, 897, and abrogated the Second Circuit's rule in\n   <em>\n    Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Quebecor World (USA) Inc. v.

Because\n   <em>\n    Quebecor\n   </em>\n   was the controlling law in the Second Circuit at the time, neither party had focused on whether the transfer was made by, to or for the benefit of an enumerated financial entity. The\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   argued that the redemptions were sent to \"financial institutions\" because the redemptions were received in \"bank accounts,\" (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 43-44), but after\n   <em>\n    Merit\n   </em>\n   , that may not be enough to protect the transfer under section 546(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Alternatively, the Defendants argued that Sentry was a \"financial participant\" and the redemptions it paid are protected from avoidance by the safe harbor. (\n   <em>\n    Defendants Motion\n   </em>\n   at 43.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   For support, they pointed to the Liquidators' allegations that Sentry held in excess of $6 billion of assets with BLMIS as of October 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the Defendants, this admission placed Sentry within the statutory definition of \"financial participant\" because it held securities contracts with an aggregate value over $1 billion within the fifteen-month time period set forth in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (22A).

Rather than consider the arguments made through the multiple letters, the Court denies the branch of the Defendants' motions seeking dismissal based on sections 546(e) and 561(d) without prejudice to their right to make subsequent motions that the Funds and/or the Defendants were financial participants or financial institutions and without prejudice to the Liquidators' right to oppose those motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   For the reasons stated, the Defendants' motions to dismiss are granted to the extent of dismissing all of the Common Law Claims and the Contract Claims except to the extent that a complaint alleges a constructive trust claim against a Knowledge Defendant. The motions to dismiss the BVI Avoidance Claims are denied without prejudice to a renewed motion based on the applicability of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20546\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) and 561(d). Correspondingly, the Liquidators are granted leave to amend to assert constructive trust claims against Knowledge Defendants and BVI Avoidance Claims against all Defendants.

There, a partner in a law firm stole the firm's client funds and lost most of what he stole gambling at a London club. The firm sued the club to recover the stolen funds.

It stood in the shoes of an innocent donee that received a contribution consisting of stolen property and had to return the stolen funds less the winnings paid to the partner.
