Buchanan, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   Plaintiff Federal Insurance Company (\"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   \") commenced this adversary proceeding seeking a determination that Plaintiff's $224,081.33 insurance payment to Fujitec America, Inc. (\"\n   <em>\n    Fujitec\n   </em>\n   \") is a nondischargeable subrogation debt owed by Defendant-Debtor Darren Lee Courtney (\"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \") pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Sections 523(a)(4) and (6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff made the payment to Fujitec, the Debtor's former employer, to cover insurable damages arising from the Debtor's alleged conversion of funds from Fujitec during his employment as well as the costs of an investigation of the Debtor's activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A trial was held on March 6, 2018. The Plaintiff's expert witness involved in the investigation of the Debtor testified to three alleged schemes orchestrated by the Debtor to convert funds from Fujitec. However, the Plaintiff called no witness to lay the foundation for the admission of the documentary and computer-generated evidence relied upon by the expert witness in making his conclusions. The Plaintiff's only other witness, the president of Fujitec, similarly failed to lay the proper foundation for the documentary and computer-generated evidence. As such, the documentary and computer-generated evidence is deemed inadmissible. In turn, the expert's conclusions based solely upon inadmissible evidence are given no weight by this Court. Similarly, Fujitec's president lacked sufficient personal knowledge of the events to establish an underlying debt. For these reasons, this Court concludes that the Plaintiff has failed to carry its burden of establishing the Debtor's liability for a quantifiable debt. Judgment is therefore rendered in favor of the Defendant-Debtor, Darren Lee Courtney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are derived from the testimony and evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Debtor's Employment With Fujitec\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1997, the Debtor was hired by Fujitec as a human resources manager but, eventually, became the company's Chief Legal Officer, which is the position he held until his termination in February of 2012. The Debtor testified that, from early on, it became apparent to the Debtor that his job would entail guiding Fujitec's top management to remain in compliance with American laws and rules of ethics with which top management was often unfamiliar. Over the years, he became responsible for overseeing Fujitec's legal issues and helping to settle the company's lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As Chief Legal Officer, the Debtor worked with Fujitec's insurance company, Travelers, to settle general liability lawsuits. Settlement of many of the lawsuits was handled by Travelers directly but the expense to Fujitec was high. To save money, Fujitec authorized the Debtor to settle low dollar lawsuits of $50,000 or less instead of referring them to Travelers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both the Debtor and the Plaintiff agree that in 2011, the Debtor began settling fake or fabricated lawsuits purportedly on behalf of Fujitec. However, the parties offered conflicting testimony as to how the\n   Debtor became involved in the scheme. The Debtor testified that he was asked to do so by Fujitec's President, Katsuji Okuda (\"\n   <em>\n    Mr. Okuda\n   </em>\n   \") for budget reasons. The Debtor explained that Fujitec maintained an \"accrual\" for settling claims and lawsuits. To the Debtor's understanding, it was important from a budget standpoint to keep the actual settlements below, but close to, the budgeted accrual number in order to prevent the accrual for settlements from being reduced in the following year's budget. Although he knew it to be wrong, the Debtor testified that he did not want to lose his job so he settled both legitimate and fabricated lawsuits at Mr. Okuda's request. According to the Debtor's testimony, the funds that came in for the settlement of these fabricated lawsuits were used to cover his legitimate business expenses for work performed on behalf of Fujitec so that Fujitec did not suffer a loss as a result of these activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Debtor testified that he did not want to be in a position of taking funds from Fujitec through these fabricated settlements. Consequently, he refused to continue settling the fabricated lawsuits when he no longer had a sufficient number of legitimate business expenses to which the funds could be applied. At that point, he wanted a release from liability so that he would not owe the company money for what he was being requested to do on behalf of Fujitec.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 22, 2011, the Debtor sent Mr. Okuda an email discussing his continued efforts to limit costs by settling certain claims in-house without going through Travelers [Pl. Ex. 8]. The email included an attached letter from Travelers that Travelers wanted signed by the Debtor on behalf of Fujitec specifically waiving Fujitec's insurance coverage for one specific claim. A second document was attached to the email, which the Debtor stated \"confirms my authority going forward to enter into settlements\" and was designed to protect \"both me and third parties, such as Travelers, who rely on my having such authority.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The document, titled an Authority Agreement and General Release (\"\n   <em>\n    Release\n   </em>\n   \") included language setting the general limits of the Debtor's settlement authority and further included a broad \"General Release\" provision stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Company [Fujitec]... hereby irrevocably releases and forever discharges Courtney [Debtor] of and from any and all rights, claims, debts losses, demands, acts, contracts, agreements, liabilities, obligations, damages, costs, fees ... expenses, duties breaches, actions, lawsuits, allegations, causes of action and/or suits of every nature, character and description, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, legal, criminal, or equitable, which they, individually or collectively, had or claimed to have, and/or which the Company may now, or in the future, have or claims to have, against Courtney, or any of them, which in any way allegedly or actually arise from, occurred during, relate to, directly or indirectly, Courtney's employment with the Company, to the date of this General Release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. In the email to Mr. Okuda, the Debtor noted that the Release \"broadly releases me from any of the actions I've taken in the past up to the date of the agreement\" and required \"both your and my signatures.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. No party disputes that Mr. Okuda signed the Release and the Debtor continued working until his termination in February of 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Okuda also testified at the trial through an interpreter. Mr. Okuda stated that he came to the United States in March of 2011 to be President of Fujitec America, Inc. At that time, the Debtor was\n   already employed as Fujitec's Chief Legal Officer. He admitted that the Debtor was given authority to settle smaller lawsuits in house but denied having knowledge of or involvement in the scheme to settle fabricated lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Okuda further admitted to having signed the Release of the Debtor's liability on behalf of Fujitec but stated that he did not read or understand the Release. He testified that he often signs contracts on behalf of Fujitec that he does not read or understand and does not consider himself fluent in English. However, upon cross-examination by the Debtor, Mr. Okuda testified that, prior to being employed by Fujitec America, he was employed by Fujitec Canada for sixteen years. He further conceded that English is the primary language spoken at both Fujitec Canada and Fujitec America and that he does not often use an interpreter at work. Mr. Okuda testified that he has been speaking English at work with employees for a total of twenty-three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With respect to his understanding of the Release, Mr. Okuda testified that he thought it was prepared by Travelers and necessary for the Debtor to take care of business and continue settling smaller lawsuits in house. While Mr. Okuda believed the Release was legitimate when signed, he testified that he no longer believed that to be true because of the Debtor's fabrications. Mr. Okuda testified that the Debtor's \"thefts\" were reimbursed by the Plaintiff in the amount necessary to cover both the losses caused by the Debtor's activities and the fees for the expert's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Debtor was terminated in February of 2012 but the nature of the termination is subject to dispute. Mr. Okuda testified that he asked the Debtor to resign because of some \"problems\" that were found but admitted on cross examination that the termination was not related to the present allegations. The Debtor asserts that while he met with Mr. Okuda and the HR director, his termination occurred after the meeting while he was hospitalized preventing him from having access to copies of the records of his activities that were in his desk and computer. If access had been given, the Debtor stated that the records would demonstrate that the vast majority of funds from settling the fabricated lawsuits were used to cover legitimate business expenses that the Debtor incurred in his employment with Fujitec.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In March of 2012, Fujitec hired a forensic accountant to investigate the Debtor's activities while employed by Fujitec. The investigation will be discussed in more detail below. The Debtor was also prosecuted. In March of 2013, the Debtor pleaded guilty to felony aggravated theft charges under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2913.02(A)(1) in the Warren County Court of Common Pleas [Pl. Ex. 1]. In conjunction with the guilty plea, the Debtor was ordered to pay $5,000 in restitution to Fujitec [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Besides the $5,000 restitution order, no factual findings were made regarding the theft nor the amount of damages Fujitec sustained [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The Debtor testified that he paid the $5,000 restitution debt to Fujitec.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Debtor relinquished his license to practice law with disciplinary proceedings pending. Currently, the Debtor works part-time doing home remodeling for his own company, Vita Nova Properties and is not otherwise employed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Investigation of the Debtor's Activities While Employed at Fujitec\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Fujitec hired Mr. Todd Pleiman (\"\n   <em>\n    Mr. Pleiman\n   </em>\n   \"), a partner at RSM US LLP (\"\n   <em>\n    RSM\n   </em>\n   \") in March of 2012 to conduct a forensic accounting investigation (the \"\n   <em>\n    investigation\n   </em>\n   \") of alleged thefts by the Debtor while employed at Fujitec. Mr. Pleiman\n   is a certified public accountant who has been employed by RSM for eleven years and is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Ohio Society of Certified Public Accountants. He has served on the University of Dayton Accounting Advisory Board and the Finance Committee of the Dayton Children's Hospital. He has conducted five or six similar forensic investigations of employee activities on behalf of other companies prior to investigating the Debtor. Mr. Pleiman testified that his role in the investigation was to review summary statements created by RSM employees, invoices and other information to ensure that the documents relied upon in the investigation supported the conclusions that his team at RSM were reaching.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Mr. Pleiman's Conclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The investigation undertaken by Mr. Pleiman and his team at RSM led Mr. Pleiman to conclude that the Debtor engaged in three schemes to convert funds from Fujitec, which included: (i) the setup of fictitious law firms to make and settle fictitious lawsuits against Fujitec; (ii) the use of a company credit card for personal charges; and (iii) padding and forging expense reports for reimbursement of expenses that did not occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With respect to the first scheme, Mr. Pleiman testified at trial that the Debtor set up three fictitious law firms as a way to funnel the settlement funds provided by Fujitec, under the guise of settling lawsuits, into Huntington National Bank and U.S. Bank accounts controlled by the Debtor. Mr. Pleiman formed his opinion based on checks, emails and other records he received from Fujitec, information gleaned from the computer provided by Fujitec that was purportedly used by the Debtor at work, bank statements received from Fujitec and/or the prosecutor, and internet searches of the law firms and case information found in these records. Mr. Pleiman opined that each of the law firms did not exist, except for on paper; Fujitec checks payable to each of the three fictitious law firms were deposited into bank accounts under the Debtor's control; and the bank accounts and signature cards linked to the fictitious law firms were traceable to the Debtor via the Debtor's computer. As a result of this scheme, Mr. Pleiman calculated that a total of $150,125 was fraudulently paid by Fujitec to the three law firms under the guise of settling fictitious claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Mr. Pleiman testified to the Debtor's alleged use of a Fujitec credit card for personal expenses. Mr. Pleiman's opinion was based on a summary prepared by RSM employees analyzing monthly credit card statements that RSM received from Fujitec. RSM differentiated between charges that appeared business-related versus those that were personal by attempting to match the statements to business expenses for which reimbursement requests were made. Mr. Pleiman testified that while the Debtor used the credit card for legitimate business expenses, he also used the card for personal charges. Mr. Pleiman concluded that the Debtor's personal expenses on the credit card totaled $29,170.74. Of that amount, the Debtor was reimbursed for $10,995.42 and an additional $18,175.32 in personal charges remained unpaid on the credit card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, Mr. Pleiman analyzed copies of expense reports, invoices and credit card statements provided by Fujitec to determine which of the Debtor's reimbursement requests were for legitimate business trips and expenses and which were for trips or expenses that did not occur. In making the determination, Mr. Pleiman compared the records to airline flight activity and sky miles records to see if the trips occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Pleiman also discussed hotel invoices that appeared to be created on the computer provided by Fujitec and allegedly used by the Debtor. From a review of these records, Mr. Pleiman concluded that the Debtor was reimbursed $17,386 for padded expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The other component of Plaintiff's alleged damages discussed at trial was the costs of the investigation of the Debtor. Mr. Pleiman testified that the investigation lasted a couple of months and that he and RSM charged just over $48,000 for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on Mr. Pleiman's testimony, the total amount of damages to Fujitec for the Debtor's three fraudulent schemes plus the cost of the investigation equals $244,681.74. However, this amount does not match the $224,081.83 that Plaintiff's counsel asserts is the total nondischargeable debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Documentary and Computer Evidence to Support Mr. Pleiman's Conclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The business records reviewed and relied upon by Mr. Pleiman or other RSM employees to reach their conclusions include photo-copies of Fujitec checks, emails, bank account statements and signature cards, credit card statements for a Fujitec credit card allegedly used by the Debtor, expense reports, and invoices (together, the \"\n   <em>\n    Business Records\n   </em>\n   \") [Pl. Exs. 2-7]. In addition, Mr. Pleiman and other RSM employees relied upon information gleaned from the computer that the Debtor allegedly used while working at Fujitec, including allegedly doctored hotel receipts (the \"\n   <em>\n    Computer Records\n   </em>\n   \") [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Furthermore, Exhibits 6 and 7 include summaries created by RSM employees to document the amount of the alleged conversion of funds by the Debtor as gleaned from the Business and Computer Records (the \"\n   <em>\n    Summary Evidence\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Pleiman testified that except for bank statements received from the prosecutor, the Business Records relied upon in the investigation were provided by various members of Fujitec's management. Mr. Pleiman stated that he believed the documents were authentic and accurate because they were approved by members of Fujitec management including, Ray Gibson, Fujitec's Chief Financial Officer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Melissa Busch, the Controller. Neither Mr. Gibson nor Ms. Busch were called by the Plaintiff to testify. While Mr. Okuda, the President of Fujitec, testified that Fujitec provided the Business Records to Mr. Pleiman, he was not personally involved in the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Throughout Mr. Pleiman and Mr. Okuda's testimony, the Debtor raised a continuing objection to the documentary evidence as hearsay, for lack of authentication, and for failure of the Plaintiff to lay the proper foundation for admission. While the Debtor did not object to Mr. Pleiman's qualifications as an expert, he asserted that Mr. Pleiman's conclusions were based on facts of which he had no personal knowledge and that he, instead, discerned from inadmissible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1334 and the general order of reference entered in this district.

Accordingly, this Court must first look to nonbankruptcy law to determine whether any liability exists before addressing the issue of nondischargeability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At trial, the Plaintiff maintained that the Debtor employed three fraudulent schemes to pilfer money from Fujitec, those being, the settlement of fake lawsuits, the improper use of the company credit card and falsification of expense reports. The Plaintiff noted that the Debtor pleaded guilty to aggravated theft charges pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code 2913.02(A)(1) [Pl. Ex. 1]. This felonious conduct, the Plaintiff argued, is an admission against interest and forms the basis for liability,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which damages the Plaintiff contends totals between $185,686.33 and $196,681.74.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Debtor fully acknowledged pleading guilty to theft. The Debtor, however, denied any liability stemming from his theft conviction beyond the $5,000 in restitution that he has already paid. The Debtor maintained that the theft charge related solely to the settlement of fictitious lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As such, the Debtor argued that his admissions in connection with the theft charge do not extend to the Plaintiff's allegations at trial relating to the Debtor's purported improper use of the company credit card and falsification of expense reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the Debtor maintained that the majority of money from settling the fictitious lawsuits was used to pay legitimate business expenses. Any liability beyond that, the Debtor argued, is covered by the Release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   While the Debtor's guilty plea to felonious theft under Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2913.02 is an admission that very well may establish wrongful conduct under one or more of the state law claims for relief in the Amended Complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Plaintiff must also provide admissible evidence to establish the amount of damages suffered. For example, to establish the tort of conversion under Ohio law, which the Plaintiff appears to plead in the Amended Complaint, a plaintiff must demonstrate \"that the plaintiff owned or had a right to possess the subject property at the time of the alleged conversion [and] that the defendant's alleged conversion was the result of a wrongful act or disposition of the plaintiff's property rights.\"\n   <em>\n    CMEA Title Agency, Inc. v.

N.D. Ohio 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, a viable claim for conversion also requires a plaintiff to prove \"damages ... that occurred as a result of the alleged conversion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"901360\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/335/376/#p386\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Debtor's guilty plea under Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2913.02(A)(1) to knowingly obtaining or exerting control over property with the purpose of depriving the owner of such property without the owner's consent arguably establishes the first two elements of conversion but does not establish quantifiable damages beyond the $5,000 in restitution the Debtor was ordered to pay. Such quantifiable damages are what the Plaintiff was required to prove at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In an effort to prove damages,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Plaintiff relied on documentary evidence in\n   the form of the Business Records, Computer Records, and Summary Evidence, and the testimony of Mr. Pleiman and Mr. Okuda. For the reasons that follow, the Debtor's objections to the admissibility of the documentary evidence and the testimony of Mr. Pleiman and Mr. Okuda are sustained. The documentary evidence relied on by the Plaintiff to establish the facts is inadmissible hearsay. While Mr. Pleiman is a qualified expert, and his expert testimony is admissible, his conclusions as to the Debtor's liability are afforded no weight by this Court because the conclusions are not verifiable nor corroborated by any other witness's testimony or admissible documentary evidence. Mr. Okuda similarly failed to lay the proper foundation for the documentary evidence and lacked sufficient personal knowledge of the underlying events to establish the amount of damages. As such, this Court concludes that the Plaintiff did not carry its burden of establishing the existence of a debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Admissibility of Plaintiff's Documentary Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To establish the critical facts of the Debtor's alleged liability, Plaintiff proffered documentary records, cumulatively found in Plaintiff's Exhibits 2-7, as testified to by Mr. Pleiman and, to some extent, Mr. Okuda. The Debtor objected to the admissibility of the documentary evidence as hearsay and for failure to lay the proper foundation for authenticating the documents. Unfortunately, each of Plaintiff's exhibits contain multiple documents of varying types and Mr. Pleiman did not specifically testify as to each page or document within each exhibit making it difficult for this Court to sift through the documents for admissibility purposes. To aid in this process, this Court divides the documents in Plaintiff's Exhibits 2-7 based on categories relevant under the Rules of Evidence: Business Records, Computer Records and Summary Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Business Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Most of the documents presented in Plaintiff's Exhibits 2-7 are documents generated by Fujitec, banks, or other businesses, which this Court will label for evidentiary purposes as the Plaintiff's Business Records. This Court agrees with the Debtor that the Business Records constitute statements, other than ones made by a declarant while testifying, offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein and are thus, hearsay.

Furthermore, neither witness testified to how Fujitec kept and relied upon the records from third-party businesses and banks in the ordinary course of Fujitec's business. To the extent the bank statements within the exhibits were not kept by Fujitec but, instead, were provided to Mr. Pleiman by a prosecutor, Mr. Pleiman never specifically identified which bank statement fell into that category nor did he establish that he is a custodian or other qualifying witness as to any bank statements provided by a prosecutor. As such, these third-party generated business records are not admissible under the Business Records Exception through the testimony of Mr. Pleiman or Mr. Okuda. Because no other exception was articulated for admissibility of the Business Records, this Court concludes that they are inadmissible.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

This Court concludes that the Plaintiff did not lay an adequate foundation for the admission of the Computer Records under Rule 803(6) or otherwise assure this Court that the Computer Records were, in fact, retained in and retrieved from a secure computer used by the Debtor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <strong>\n     3.

Fed. R. Evid. 602. Mr. Pleiman's knowledge of the facts, however, is limited to what was discerned through the documents he received from Fujitec and a prosecutor, records that this Court has deemed inadmissible. Because Mr. Pleiman has no personal knowledge of the events that occurred beyond his review of these inadmissible hearsay documents, Mr. Pleiman's fact testimony is also deemed inadmissible hearsay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Nonetheless, Mr. Pleiman may still testify as an expert to the extent he meets the requirements of Rule 702 which provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n    A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n    (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n    (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Fed.

R. Evid. 704.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    This Court concluded during the trial that Mr. Pleiman was qualified as an expert witness based on his training and experience. Mr. Pleiman testified that he has been a certified public accountant for\n    eighteen years, a partner at RSM for eleven years and has served on or been a member of various accounting boards and societies.

While recognizing that expert testimony may embrace an ultimate issue to be decided pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 704, the court found it \"unusual,\" although not categorically unheard of, that the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    evidence in the case to meet the trustee's burden of proof was expert evidence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453045\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/271/575/#p585\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (noting that an expert is usually called upon to summarize and render an opinion as to the facts derived from direct testimony and business records in evidence).

Instead, Malek relied on what the trustee told him and the summary report of the debtor's business records that was excluded from evidence.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453045\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/271/575/#p585\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Without the underlying facts in evidence and without meaningful testing or validation of the underlying sources, the court concluded that the Malek report was entitled to no weight and, ultimately, entered judgment in favor of the defendant-investors.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453045\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/271/575/#p585\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453045\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/271/575/#p585\">\n     at 587-88\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    In the case at hand, Mr. Pleiman opined that the Debtor orchestrated three alleged schemes to convert funds from Fujitec in the total amount of $196,681.74. While his opinion is admissible, it is of questionable efficacy to this Court as the trier of fact. As in\n    <em>\n     Lake State Commodities,\n    </em>\n    none of the business records that might support Mr. Pleiman's opinion were admitted into evidence. Furthermore, Mr. Pleiman testified that he took no measures to independently verify the accuracy of the records he received from Fujitec and the prosecutor nor did he interview the Debtor or other Fujitec employees as part of the investigation. Instead, Mr. Pleiman testified that he assumed that the documents received from Fujitec were authentic and accurate because they were approved by members of Fujitec management, none of whom testified at trial.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Mr. Pleiman's conclusions are belied by further assumptions he made during the investigation. Mr. Pleiman concluded that the Debtor converted $29,170.74 from Fujitec through his alleged use of a Fujitec credit card for personal expenses but, on cross-examination, admitted that these cards were issued in the employees' names and paid directly by the employees. Mr. Pleiman conceded that he was unaware of any prohibition against Fujitec employees\n    using the credit cards for personal expenses nor did he check other employee credit cards to see if they included personal expenses. Mr. Pleiman made further assumptions about the type of expenses that seemed personal without verifying whether specific expenses for a show or dinner may have had a business purpose such as entertaining colleagues. With respect to his conclusion that the Debtor converted an additional $17,386 through \"padded\" expenses submitted to Fujitec for reimbursement, Mr. Pleiman admitted that he assumed that a business expense was manufactured by the Debtor if he submitted a receipt for it but the expense did not appear on the Fujitec issued credit card. Mr. Pleiman conceded on cross examination that if a business expense was paid for in some manner other than with the company credit card he would not know.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Further exacerbating the shortcomings of his opinions is the fact that Mr. Pleiman did not file an expert report. As such, this Court is left with no verification of Mr. Pleiman's methods or calculations. For example, Mr. Pleiman concluded that the Debtor converted $150,125 by funneling funds through three law firms under the guise of settling fictitious claims but he did not provide any summary calculation of transactions needed to reach this amount.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    The need for verification is further underscored by the fact that Mr. Pleiman's conclusion of the amount converted through the three separate schemes, $196,681.74, does not match the $185,686.33 in damages that Plaintiff counsel quoted in his opening statement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Based on the questionable assumptions and the inability of this Court to verify his calculations, this Court finds Mr. Pleiman's expert testimony unreliable. In addition, giving weight to Mr. Pleiman's conclusions on the ultimate issue of damages without admissible evidence to support his conclusions would subvert the rules of evidence. Accordingly, Mr. Pleiman's expert opinions, while admissible, are given no weight by this Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Mr. Okuda's Testimony and the Debtor's Testimony\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The remaining evidence is not sufficient to establish that the Debtor owes a debt to Fujitec and, via subrogation, the Plaintiff. This Court begins with Mr. Okuda's testimony. Mr. Okuda testified that when he came to the United States in March of 2011, the Debtor was already Fujitec's Chief Legal Officer. He testified that Fujitec found some \"problems\" with the Debtor and the Debtor was asked to resign in February of 2012. Upon cross-examination, however, Mr. Okuda conceded that the decision to terminate the Debtor had nothing to do with the present allegations. Moreover, Mr. Okuda did not testify to the specifics of Debtor's alleged misconduct at Fujitec, except to deny being aware of it, and to state that he was not involved in the investigation. His testimony was similarly vague on the issue of damages. Mr. Okuda testified in very general terms to the amount of damages arising from the Debtor's wrongful actions, stating that he believed the damages totaled $224,000, including \"something like $180,000\" reimbursement to Fujitec from the Plaintiff plus \"$40,000 something\" for the cost of the investigation. This Court affords no weight to Mr. Okuda's testimony regarding the amount of damages given his lack of personal knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    That leaves the Debtor's testimony. During his testimony, the Debtor admitted to settling fictitious lawsuits for Fujitec, although he said he was asked to do so by Mr. Okuda in order to justify the current accrual in the budget for settling claims and lawsuits. The Debtor testified that the funds received from the settlement of fictitious lawsuits were not converted by him but were, in large part, applied to legitimate Fujitec business expenses. The Debtor asserted that the only debt owed to Fujitec was the $5,000 in court ordered restitution, which he had already paid. Accordingly, neither the Debtor's testimony nor the guilty plea and related judgment entry ordering restitution establish a debt beyond the $5,000 that the Debtor has already paid to Fujitec.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Plaintiff's Claim for Recovery of the Costs of Investigation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Without proof of an underlying debt properly founded on nonbankruptcy law, the Plaintiff has provided this Court with no basis for holding the Debtor liable for Fujitec or the Plaintiff's investigative expenses. Even if there was a basis, the only evidence of the expenses were the differing statements from Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Pleiman and Mr. Okuda that the investigation cost $49,395, \"just over\" $48,000, and \"$40,000 something\" respectively. The Plaintiff proffered no invoice or itemization of the costs in support of these statements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    For the reasons stated above, this Court concludes that Plaintiff Federal Insurance Company failed to establish that the Debtor owes a debt beyond the $5,000 in restitution that the Debtor has already paid. As such, judgment is rendered in favor of the Defendant-Debtor Darren Lee Courtney.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    This opinion constitutes this Court's findings of facts and conclusions of law in accordance with Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    <strong>\n     SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-136\">\n     In addition to his hearsay objection, the Debtor objected to the documentary evidence for the Plaintiff's failure to lay the proper foundation for authentication of the records. As noted above, meeting the Business Records Exception to the hearsay rule would satisfy the authentication requirement.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-137\">\n     Rule 803(6) also provides for the foundation being laid through a certification that complies with Rule 902(11) (for authenticating certified domestic records of regularly conducted activity) or Rule 902(12) (for authenticating certified foreign records of regularly conducted activity) or with a statute permitting certification. Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)(D). In response to the Debtor's evidentiary objections for lack of authentication, the Plaintiff did not attempt to lay a foundation through a certification or statute permitting certification. However, this Court notes that letters purportedly from a records custodian of Huntington National Bank sent to the Warren County Prosecutor's office with bank statements and signature cards were included in the Plaintiff's exhibits [Pl. Ex. 2, p. 57; Ex. 3, p. 1 and Ex. 5, p. 1]. The Huntington National Bank letters were not discussed or mentioned by Plaintiff's counsel during the trial and he did not attempt to lay the foundation for admission of any documents through these letters.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Streets v.
