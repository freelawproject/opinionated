The Partnership, for purposes of its Motion, does not \"contest that the Trustee has established a prima facie case\" pursuant to Section 547(b), but asserts that even if the Transfer were avoidable under Section 547(b), the transfer is protected from avoidance under Sections 547(c)(1), 547(c)(2)(A) and (B), and 547(c)(4).

The following constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 23, 2014, Turner Grain Merchandising, Inc. (\"\n   <strong>\n    Turner Grain\n   </strong>\n   \" or the \"\n   <strong>\n    Debtor\n   </strong>\n   \") filed a case under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. (SUF \u00b6 2). The case was converted to a case under Chapter 7 on May 15, 2015. (SUF \u00b6 2). Richard L. Cox was initially appointed as the trustee and served in that capacity until M. Randy Rice was appointed the successor trustee. (SUF \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 7, 2016, the Trustee filed this adversary proceeding alleging that a payment by check dated July 31, 2014, in the amount of $405,274.68 (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Transfer\n   </strong>\n   \") was a preferential transfer. (SUF \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to approximately mid-August of 2014, Turner Grain was in the business of purchasing grain, including wheat, from farmers in eastern Arkansas and surrounding areas. (SUF \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hill &amp; Hill is a farming partnership engaged in growing grain in and around Lee County, Arkansas, and is owned by Billy Hill, Jeff Hill and Tanya Hill. (SUF \u00b6 5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hill &amp; Hill, in the ordinary course of its business, sold rice, soybeans, corn, and wheat to Turner Grain as well as to other grain buyers. (SUF \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the ordinary course of the Partnership's business, Jeff Hill would contact Turner Grain and inquire about pricing options and then enter a booking agreement with Turner Grain for a specific amount of grain for future delivery at a set price. (SUF \u00b6 7). Although booking agreements may have been made in Jeff Hill's name, it was understood by all parties that the booking agreements were for Hill &amp; Hill's crops. (SUF \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When the time period for delivery under a specific booking agreement arrived, Jeff Hill would communicate with Turner Grain to notify it as to when the delivery would begin and how many truckloads of grain were anticipated. (SUF \u00b6 11). Deliveries under the booking agreements typically spanned a number of weeks until the contract was complete depending on the number of bushels involved, the weather, and other factors over which neither party had control. (SUF \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The checks issued by Turner Grain in payment for grain delivered under the booking agreements with Hill &amp; Hill were usually made payable to Hill &amp; Hill and the Bank, its lender. (SUF \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Both parties have presented timelines for the Court to consider in analyzing Hill &amp; Hill's ordinary course of business defense. The parties dispute the actual number of transactions between Hill &amp; Hill and Turner Grain. Each have fifteen \"transactions\" in their original timelines although the transactions are not the same. The information presented by the parties in their respective timelines is reflected in detail in the ordinary course of business discussion below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On or about December 20, 2013, the Bank made a loan to Hill &amp; Hill for the sum of $1,098,535.00 as evidenced by a promissory note (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Agricultural Loan\n   </strong>\n   \"). (SUF \u00b6 27; Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. A). On or about December 20, 2013, Hill &amp; Hill granted the Bank a security interest\n   to secure the repayment of the Agricultural Loan and all other indebtedness owed to the Bank by Hill &amp; Hill. (SUF \u00b6 27; Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The security agreement granted the Bank a security interest in all Hill &amp; Hill's assets, including \"any and all crops now growing or to be grown in the year 2014 wherever located including all now owned or hereafter acquired inventory and commingled goods wherever located and all products and proceeds thereof.\" (SUF \u00b6 27; Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A UCC financing statement was filed in the office of the Arkansas Secretary of State on December 27, 2013, reflecting Hill &amp; Hill as the \"debtor\" and the Bank as the \"secured party\" (the \"\n   <strong>\n    UCC-1\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. C). The collateral listed on the UCC-1 was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   All present and future right, title and interest in and to any and all personal property of [Hill &amp; Hill], whether such property is now existing or hereafter created, acquired or arising and wherever located from time to time, including without limitation the following categories of property as defined in the Revised Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (the \"UCC\"): goods (including inventory, equipment, fixtures, farm products and any accessions thereto), instruments (including promissory notes), documents, accounts (including health-care insurance receivables), chattel paper (whether tangible or electronic), deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights (whether or not the letter-of-credit is evidenced by a writing), commercial tort claims, securities and all other investment property, general intangibles (including payment intangibles and software), all supporting obligations and all proceeds, products, additions, accessions, substitutions and replacements of the foregoing property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Any term used herein which is defined in the UCC shall have the meaning set forth in the UCC, and if the meaning is modified by an amendment, modification or revision to the UCC, such modified definition will apply automatically as of the date of such amendment, modification or revision to the UCC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   This financing statement covers, and is intended to cover, all personal property of [Hill &amp; Hill].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   All of the following which [Hill &amp; Hill] owns now or in the future, together with all parts, accessories, repairs, replacements, improvements, and accessions, and wherever located: Government payments and programs: All payments, accounts, general intangibles, and benefits including, but not limited to, payments in kind, deficiency payments, letters of entitlement, warehouse receipts, storage payments, emergency assistance and diversion payments, direct payments and counter-cyclical payments, and conservation reserve payments under any preexisting, current, or future federal or state government program.\n   <em>\n    Any and all crops now growing or to be grown in the year 2014 wherever located including all now owned or hereafter acquired inventory and commingled goods wherever located and all products and proceeds thereof.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. C) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his affidavit, Bradley A. Chambless, the chief lending officer of the Bank, stated that \"in accordance with the Food Security Act, the Bank gave direct notice to Turner Grain of its security interest in the crops.\" (Mot. Ex. 3 \u00b6 6). Two notices were attached to Mr. Chambless's affidavit. (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. D). The first notice is titled, \"Farmers that have pledged crops for 2013 to the Farmers and Merchants\n   Bank, Stuttgart, Arkansas.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. D). The notice includes the name of the entity farming, an address, and an ID number. (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex D). Included in the notice was \"Hill &amp; Hill Partnership, 3396 Hwy 238, Moro, AR 72368, ID # XXXX5172.\" (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. D). The second notice is titled, \"Farmers that have pledged crops for 2014 to the Farmers and Merchants Bank, Stuttgart, Arkansas.\" (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. D). The second notice also included \"Hill &amp; Hill Partnership, 3396 Hwy 238, Moro, AR 72368, ID # XXXX5172.\" (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. D). The address for Hill &amp; Hill in the notices is the same address listed on the promissory note, security agreement, and UCC-1 for Hill &amp; Hill. The notices do not include the address of the Bank, a description of the farm products subject to the Bank's security interest, the amount of such products, nor the name of the county or counties in which the farm products are produced or located. No additional notices appear in the Court's record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Debtor acknowledged receiving a copy of the 2014 list of farmers that had pledged crops to the Bank by acknowledgements dated April 16, 2014, and July 24, 2014. (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On or about March 31, 2014, Turner Grain and Hill &amp; Hill entered into a booking agreement for Turner Grain to purchase 55,000 bushels of wheat grown by Hill &amp; Hill for June-July 2014 delivery. (Mot. Ex. 2 \u00b6 8). The wheat was delivered, and Turner Grain paid Hill &amp; Hill for the wheat by issuing a check dated July 31, 2014. The check was made payable jointly to Hill &amp; Hill and the Bank in the amount of $405,274.68, and is the Transfer at issue in this proceeding. (Mot. Ex. 2 \u00b6 9). The check was deposited into Hill &amp; Hill's bank account on August 4, 2014. (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Tanya Hill stated in her affidavit that the Transfer was intended by the Debtor and the Partnership to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Tanya Hill also stated in her affidavit that after the Transfer, Hill &amp; Hill \"delivered 800.71 bushels of corn with a value of $4,099.64 and 352 bushels of wheat with a value of $2,471.04 for which [Hill &amp; Hill] never received payment.\" (Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6 14). In addition, she stated in her affidavit that the Debtor's \"unilateral cancellation of outstanding contracts at the time it closed relieved Turner Grain of an obligation of at least $300,897.43 at market prices.\" (Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court having reviewed the Summary Judgment Documents finds that the Motion should be granted in part and denied in part. As discussed below, the Court denies the Motion as to the affirmative defense of Section 547(c)(1). The Court grants the Motion as to the first element of the affirmative defenses of Section 547(c)(2)(A) and (c)(2)(B), but denies the Motion as to the affirmative defenses of Section 547(c)(2)(A) and (c)(2)(B) overall. The Court grants the Motion as to the affirmative defense of Section 547(c)(4) as it relates to the 800.71 bushels of corn and 352 bushels of wheat, but denies the Motion\n   under 547(c)(4) as it relates to the cancellation of contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As stated above, the Trustee seeks to avoid the Transfer as a preferential transfer against the Partnership and the Bank. The Partnership asserts that even if the Transfer were avoidable under Section 547(b), the Transfer is protected from avoidance under Sections 547(c)(1), 547(c)(2)(A) and (B), and 547(c)(4). Each of the affirmative defenses will be discussed separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Contemporaneous Exchange for New Value - Section 547(c)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The contemporaneous exchange for new value defense provides that the Trustee may not avoid a preferential transfer to the extent that such transfer was \"(A) intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor; and (B) in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The purpose of this exception is to protect transactions that do not result in a diminution of the bankruptcy estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Velde v.

N.D. Ala. 1995) ). To prevail on the contemporaneous exchange for new value exception, the Partnership has the burden of proving that both the Debtor and the Partnership intended the exchange to be contemporaneous; that the exchange was, in fact, contemporaneous; and that the exchange was for new value.\n   <em>\n    Harrah's Tunica Corp. v. Meeks (In re Armstrong),\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414089,9431311\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/517/\">\n    291 F.3d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (8th Cir. 2002) (citing\n   <em>\n    Official Plan Comm. v.

(Mot. Br. at 8-12). Consistent with that argument, Mr. Chambless states in his affidavit, \"[t]he Bank's security interest in the wheat sold to Turner Grain was not released until the Bank's receipt of the payment on August 4, 2014.\" (Mot. Ex. 3 \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Trustee responded, arguing that noncompliance with the requirements of the Food Security Act of 1985 (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Food Security Act\n   </strong>\n   \")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   resulted in the wheat being purchased by Turner Grain free and clear of the Bank's security interest so any act by the Bank to \"release\" its security interest in the wheat was of no new value to Turner Grain. (Resp. Br. at 9-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Partnership then raised a second theory in its Reply Brief. There, the Partnership argued that even if the Food Security Act requirements were not met, \"the Bank nonetheless retained an enforceable security interest in the\n   <em>\n    proceeds\n   </em>\n   \" of the crop and \"[w]hen [the Bank] received the check, the Bank released its security interest in the crop\n   <em>\n    proceeds\n   </em>\n   .\" (Reply Br. at 18, 20) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons stated below, summary judgment as to both theories is denied but for different reasons. The Court will discuss the Partnership's two theories separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (1) Security Interest in Crops / Wheat\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The three elements of the contemporaneous exchange for new value defense are intricately related. While parties may\n   intend a contemporaneous exchange for new value, there must still, in fact, be a contemporaneous exchange where new value is given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As to the first element, the intention of the parties, the Partnership asserted as a statement of undisputed fact that \"[t]he Transfer described in the Complaint was intended by Turner Grain and the [Partnership] to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to Turner Grain, specifically, the release of [the] Bank's security interest in the wheat and the exchange was, in fact, substantially contemporaneous.\" (SUF \u00b6 32). In support of this statement the Partnership relies on both the affidavit of Tanya Hill, in which she makes the same statement, and Exhibit C to her affidavit, which are copies of the check stub for the Transfer and the related settlement sheets. (Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6 12; Mot. Ex. 1, at Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Trustee disputes the Partnership's statement on the basis that it is a legal conclusion inappropriate for inclusion as an undisputed fact. (Resp. SUF \u00b6 32). Other than a denial of the statement, the Trustee's Response and Sur-Reply do not further address this first element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to the second element, that the exchange was, in fact, contemporaneous, the Partnership relies on Mr. Chambless's affidavit in which he stated that \"[t]he Bank's security interest in the wheat sold to Turner Grain was not released until the Bank's receipt of the payment on August 4, 2014.\" (Mot. Ex. 3 \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In his Response Brief the Trustee stated that he \"does not dispute that the Transfer was jointly payable to the Partnership and the Bank. Nor ... that the Bank\n   <em>\n    would have\n   </em>\n   released its lien contemporaneously with receiving and endorsing the check for deposit.\" (Resp. Br. at 10) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the discussion that follows on the third element, the Court determines that Turner Grain received the wheat free and clear of the Bank's security interest pursuant to the Food Security Act resulting in no new value being given in the exchange. Therefore, regardless of the Partnership's asserted intention and the parties' agreement that the Bank \"would have\" released the security interest in the wheat upon receipt of the Transfer, the absence of new value in the exchange is fatal to the Partnership's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Indeed, the third element requires that the exchange\n   <em>\n    was for new value\n   </em>\n   . New value is defined by statute to mean \"money or money's worth in goods, services, or new credit, or release by a transferee of property previously transferred to such transferee in a transaction that is neither void nor voidable by the debtor or the trustee under any applicable law, including proceeds of such property, but does not include any obligation substituted for an existing obligation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (2012).

ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 4-9-203 (Supp. 2017). To perfect the security interest, a financing statement must be filed with office of the Secretary of State. ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 4-9-501 (Supp. 2017). The financing statement must meet certain requirements and is \"sufficient only if it: (1) provides the name of the debtor; (2) provides the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party; and (3) indicates the collateral covered by the financing statement.\" ARK.

From the record it is undisputed that the Bank gave value to Hill &amp; Hill in the form of the Agricultural Loan; Hill &amp; Hill had rights in the collateral, the wheat grown by the Partnership; and Hill &amp; Hill authenticated a security agreement granting the Bank a security interest in the collateral,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]ny and all crops now growing or to be grown in the year 2014 wherever located.\" (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. B). The Bank then filed a financing statement with the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office with the name and address of both Hill &amp; Hill and the Bank, along with a description of its collateral. (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   There is no dispute that Turner Grain was a buyer in the ordinary course of business buying farm products from Hill &amp; Hill, an entity engaged in farming operations. Therefore, applying Arkansas law, Turner Grain bought the wheat related to the Transfer from Hill &amp; Hill subject to the Bank's security interest. ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 4-9-320 (2001). The analysis, however, does not end here. The Court must now consider the relationship of Arkansas law to the Food Security Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Under the Food Security Act, notwithstanding the provisions of Arkansas law, Turner Grain, as a buyer in the ordinary course of business buying farm products from Hill &amp; Hill, a seller engaged in farming operations, would take free of the security interest created by Hill &amp; Hill in favor of the Bank even though the Bank's security interest in crops was properly perfected under Arkansas law, unless exceptions contained in Section 1631(e) of the Food Security Act allow a different result.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As discussed above, Arkansas does not have a central filing system; consequently, Turner Grain would take subject to the Bank's security interest only if the requirements of Section 1631(e)(1)(A) are met. Accordingly, the Court must determine if the Bank's notices strictly comply with the requirements of Section 1631(e)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   It is not disputed that the Bank sent Turner Grain the two notices and that Turner Grain acknowledged receipt of the notices. For the reasons that follow, however, the Court finds that as a matter of law, the undisputed facts prove that the notices do not strictly comply with the requirements of Section 1631(e)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The first notice is titled, \"Farmers that have pledged crops for 2013 to the Farmers and Merchants Bank, Stuttgart, Arkansas.\" (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. D). The notice includes \"Hill &amp; Hill Partnership, 3396 Hwy 238, Moro, AR 72368, ID # XXXX5172.\" (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. D). The second notice is substantially the same with the title change indicating that it covers crops for 2014 instead of 2013. (Mot. Ex. 3, at Ex. D). The notices do not contain the address for the Bank (other than Stuttgart, Arkansas), the quantity and description of the farm products subject to the security interest, or the name of each county in which the farm products are produced or located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Based on the undisputed facts concerning the notices, the Bank's notices do not strictly comply with the Food Security Act's direct notice exception. Therefore, Turner Grain purchased the wheat related to the Transfer free of the Bank's security interest even though Turner Grain knew of the existence of the Bank's security interest and even though the Bank held an otherwise properly perfected security interest under Arkansas law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (2012) ;\n   <em>\n    Farm Credit Midsouth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228509\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/371/450/#p453\">\n    371 F.3d at 453-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   This result is consistent with the\n   <em>\n    Velde\n   </em>\n   case relied on by the Partnership.

(Reply Br. at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For this theory the Partnership asserts that Turner Grain sold the wheat at issue to \"Farmers Supply\" or to \"ADM\" prior to its purchase of the crops and \"[t]hereafter, the Debtor held the proceeds of the wheat which were subject to the Bank's security interest.\" (Reply Br. at 20) (referencing the deposition testimony of Gale Hamrick). The Partnership further asserts that \"Turner Grain paid the crop proceeds by way of a check made jointly payable to the Partnership and the Bank. When it received the check, the Bank released its security interest in the crop proceeds.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3936608,3825142\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/469/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The record fails to support the assertion of identifiable proceeds being part of the Transfer. The testimony the Partnership quoted from Ms. Hamrick's deposition in support of its theory is general, vague, and insufficient to support the propositions asserted. In addition, Ms. Hamrick made clear in her deposition that her duties and responsibilities only involved the purchase side of Turner Grain's business operations with the farmer, that she had nothing to do with Turner Grain's sale of farm products to other producers, and she never handled the bank deposits. (Resp. Ex. 4 at 9-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Without a record to support the assertions being made under the Partnership's \"crop proceeds\" theory, no further legal analysis of the crop proceeds theory is necessary at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Partnership has failed to meet its burden on the affirmative defense of contemporaneous exchange for new value, and summary judgment on this affirmative defense is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Ex. 1 \u00b6 11). Jeff Hill's affidavit contains the identical statement. (Mot. Ex. 2 \u00b6 11). The Trustee argues that the Transfer was atypical for several reasons: the Transfer paid four loads twice; the overage delivered was paid at the contract rate instead of the market rate; delivery sheets were sent to Hill &amp; Hill twenty-three days prior to the Transfer being made; the Transfer replaced a previously voided check; and an employee of Turner Grain who processed the Transfer was subsequently employed by a company owned and controlled by Jeff Hill. (Resp. Br. at 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court does not believe there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was any undue pressure asserted\n   by Hill &amp; Hill to Turner Grain related to the Transfer, nor is there a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the payment method,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   check made payable to Hill &amp; Hill and the Bank, is atypical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   However, other unresolved issues regarding unusual payment methods remain regarding the voided checks, the payment of the overage, delivery sheets sent to Hill &amp; Hill prior to the Transfer, and the twenty-three day period between the date the Debtor may have generated and forwarded the delivery sheets and the date the Transfer was issued. Such issues would require the Court to weigh the evidence and make credibility findings, acts not appropriate at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    (b)\n    <em>\n     The Timelines for Last Dates of Delivery and Check Dates\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court reviewed the Summary Judgment Documents and summarized all information related to each transaction to determine,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   the contract involved in the transaction, the last date of delivery for the contract, the date the check was issued, and other facts presented by the exhibits for each of the transactions. Although the Court's goal was to use the information to create a timeline supported by the record with facts not genuinely in dispute for analysis, the following discussion will illustrate why that goal was not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Tanya Hill included the Partnership's original timeline in her affidavit and its revised timeline in her supplemental affidavit. (Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6 6; Reply Br. Ex. 1 \u00b6 9). The Partnership based its ordinary course of business analysis on a comparison of (1) the number of days between the last date of delivery for the grain confirmation related to the Transfer and the date the check for the Transfer was issued; and (2) the number of days between the last date of delivery for pre-preference period booking agreements and grain confirmations and the dates the Debtor issued checks for payment of that grain. (Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10; Reply Br. Ex. 1 \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Trustee makes a similar analysis in his Response. (Resp. Ex. 9).

Confirmations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   When the Court was attempting to create a timeline supported by facts not genuinely in dispute, the primary fact sought from the information presented was the booking agreement or grain confirmation related to the numerous loads shown as being delivered in the Summary Judgment Documents. When asked about the contracts between Hill &amp; Hill and Turner Grain, Jeff Hill and Gale Hamrick both testified that a written contract would usually follow after an oral booking agreement. (Resp. Ex. 1 at 10; Resp. Ex. 4 at 11). Jeff Hill, Tanya Hill, and Gale Hamrick all testified in their depositions that the payment process would begin after the final load would be delivered completing a booking agreement or contract. (Resp. Ex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   1 at 28-29; Resp. Ex. 3 at 11-13; Resp. Ex. 4 at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Partnership asserts that its timeline reflects the number of days after completion of delivery of grain under a booking agreement to the date Turner Grain issued checks in payment for the grain. (Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10). The Court, however, has been unable to tie the loads reflected on the Partnership's original timeline to particular\n   <em>\n    booking agreements or grain confirmations\n   </em>\n   . In attempting to identify the booking agreement or contract the Court makes several observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   First, except as to Transaction 11, the parties appear to be assuming the settlement sheets or delivery sheets associated with each check are all related to the same booking agreement or grain confirmation. Then with this assumption the parties use the last date reflected on the sheets associated with the checks as the \"last delivery date\" for the transaction. However, the supporting documentation and the deposition testimony do not support this methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   For example, Jeff Hill attached to his affidavit the following six booking agreements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   (1) Contract Number JC-1002, for 140,000 bushels of corn with shipment expected to begin \"September 2014 - February 2015,\" signed by Gale Hamrick March 31, 2014. (Mot. Ex. 2, at Ex. A (Bates No. Hill &amp; Hill 187) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   (2) Contract Number JC-2000, for 60,000 bushels of soybeans with shipment expected to begin at \"Buyers Call,\" signed by Gale Hamrick March 31, 2014. (Mot. Ex. 2, at Ex. A (Bates No. Hill &amp; Hill 188) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   (3) The third agreement appears to be a duplicate of the first agreement described above. (Mot. Ex. 2, at Ex. A (Bates No. Hill &amp; Hill 1061) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   (4) The fourth agreement appears to be a duplicate of the second agreement described above. (Mot. Ex. 2, at Ex. A (Bates No. Hill &amp; Hill 1060) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   (5) The fifth agreement appears to be a duplicate of the first agreement described above. (Mot. Ex. 2, at Ex. A (Bates No. Hill &amp; Hill 1059) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   (6) The sixth agreement appears to be a duplicate of the second agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   (Mot. Ex. 2, at Ex. A (Bates No. Hill &amp; Hill 1062) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Mr. Hill references a seventh agreement related to the Transfer that was to be attached as Exhibit B to his affidavit, but the filing did not include the agreement. (Mot. Ex. 2). The agreement related to the Transfer was attached to Mr. Hill's deposition. (Resp. Ex. 1, at Ex. 30). The Transfer agreement, Contract Number JC-3000, was for 55,000 bushels of wheat with shipment expected to begin \"June-July 2014\" and was signed by Gale Hamrick March 31, 2014. (Resp. Ex. 1, at Ex. 30 (Bates No. Hill &amp; Hill 183); Resp. Ex. 4 at 42-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The Court attempted to tie the above booking agreements or grain confirmations to the appropriate transactions but was unable to do so. There are no grain confirmations for rice but Transaction Nos. 1, 2, 3, 11-1, 11-2, 11-3, 11-4, and 18 all involve rice. The settlement sheets for Transaction No. 1 reference \"MGRR\" as the \"contract\" instead of a designation such as JC-1002, JC-2000, or JC-3000. (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. A). The settlement sheet for Transaction No. 2 references \"600D\" as the \"contract.\" (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. B). The settlement sheets for Transaction Nos. 3, 11-1, 11-2, 11-3, and 11-4 reference \"LGRR\" as the \"contract.\" (Resp. Ex. 9, at Exs. C, K). The settlement sheet for Transaction No. 18 has the contract information blank but the check's memo has \"LGRR.\" (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. R). From the information provided, the Court is unable to determine if Transaction\n   Nos. 3, 11-1, 11-2, 11-3, 11-4, and 18 are all covered under one \"LGRR\" contract or actually involve three or more booking agreements or contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   There is only one grain confirmation for wheat, Contract Number JC-3000 for 55,000 bushels of wheat, and it has been identified as the grain confirmation related to the Transfer (Transaction No. 19). (Resp. Ex. 1 at 24-26; Resp. Ex. 1, at Ex. 30). Two Purchase Settlement Summaries associated with Transaction No. 19 refer to Contract No. A001110-01. (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. S (Bates Nos. Hill &amp; Hill 1056-1057) ). Two other Purchase Settlement Summaries associated with Transaction No. 19 refer to Contract No. A000575-01. (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. S (Bates Nos. Hill &amp; Hill 1127-1128) ). The Court is unable to locate the contracts referred to on the Purchase Settlement Summaries and unable to determine whether the Transfer is, in fact, associated with loads delivered only in connection to Contract JC-3000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   There is one grain confirmation for corn, Contract Number JC-1002, for 140,000 bushels of corn with shipment expected to begin \"September 2014 - February 2015\" signed by Gale Hamrick March 31, 2014. (Mot. Ex. 2, at Ex. A (Bates No. Hill &amp; Hill 187) ). There are seven transactions for corn, Transaction Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 17, but there are no transactions for corn after March 31, 2014. The settlement sheets for Transaction Nos. 7, 8, and 9 reference \"Hill &amp; Dozier\" as the \"contract.\" (Resp. Ex. 9, at Exs. G-I). The settlement sheets for Transaction Nos. 10 and 11 reference \"YC\" as the \"contract.\" (Resp. Ex. 9, at Exs. J, L). The purchase settlement summary sheet for Transaction No. 15 references two contract numbers, Contract Nos. 0001163-01 and 000105-01. (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. O). The settlement sheet for Transaction No. 17 references \"3/14/2014\" as the \"contract.\" (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. Q). Again, neither the documents presented in support of the Motion nor the documents presented by the Trustee provide the Court with sufficient information to determine whether the transactions involve one or more contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Finally, Transaction No. 16 involves soybeans. The Grain Confirmation for soybeans, Contract Number JC-2000, for 60,000 bushels of soybeans, by process of elimination, would appear to relate to Transaction No. 16, the only transaction involving soybeans. However, Check No. 18095 related to Transaction 16 in the amount of $799,075.22 was issued December 12, 2013, more than three months before the contract date of March 31, 2014. (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. P; Mot. Ex. 2, at Ex. A (Bates No. Hill &amp; Hill 188) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The Purchase Settlement Summary for Transaction No. 16 refers to three contracts, Contract Nos. A000732-01, A000733-01, and A000734-01, and references 64,170.44 bushels of soybeans. The Settlement Sheet has three different prices. Gale Hamrick testified at her deposition that Jason Coleman would have probably booked three different contracts for soybeans. When asked if \"Turner Grain customarily settle[d] and [paid] three different contracts simultaneously,\" Ms. Hamrick responded, \"[c]orrect.\" (Resp. Ex. 4 at 34-35.) The Court was unable to tie the three contract numbers to any of the loads reflected on the delivery sheets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   As stated at the outset of this subsection, the parties appear to be assuming the settlement sheets or delivery sheets associated with each check are all related to the same booking agreement or grain confirmation. Then with this assumption the parties use the last date reflected on the sheets associated with the checks as the \"last delivery date\" for the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The above discussion highlights two problems with this methodology. First, as\n   illustrated by Transaction No. 16 and the testimony of Ms. Hamrick, it appears that Turner Grain, at least on occasion, would issue a check in payment of loads associated with more than one contract. Indeed from the above discussion it appears there are transactions other than Transaction No. 16 involving more than one contract. Second, without being able to associate the loads being delivered to a particular booking agreement or contract, a determination cannot be made as to when the\n   <em>\n    last load is delivered under a particular contract\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Court finds that the Partnership's analysis based on the last date of delivery under a contract is fatally flawed. Without being able to associate the loads being delivered to a contract, it is impossible for the Court to determine whether a load is the \"last load\" completing a particular contract. If the answer is in the 1,870 pages of the Summary Judgment Documents, it was not uncovered by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   (ii) Reliability of Last Date of Delivery Dates in Timelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   In addition to the difficulties encountered in determining whether the transactions cover part of a contract, just one contract, or more than one contract, a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to the source of the information used by the Partnership in its timelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   It is clear that the delivery dates reflected on the delivery sheets associated with the Transfer, Transaction No. 19, prepared using the AGRIS software, are untrustworthy. In preparing her original timeline, Tanya Hill determined the last date of delivery for Transaction No. 19 by referring to the Turner Grain Delivery Sheets. Based on that information, she listed July 8, 2014, as the last date of delivery. The Trustee's timeline reflected June 24, 2014, as the last date of delivery. After the Trustee produced the actual delivery receipts for Transaction No. 19, Tanya Hill revised her timeline to also use June 24, 2014, as the last date of delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The Court reviewed the details contained in the actual delivery sheets associated with the Transfer. (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. S). There are seven Turner Grain Delivery Sheets involving a total of sixty-four loads of wheat associated with the Transfer. (Resp. Ex. 9, at Ex. S). The Court matched delivery sheets to sixty of the loads. Every delivery date on the Turner Grain Delivery Sheets for which the Court found the corresponding delivery receipt was inaccurate, ranging from one to sixteen days off. Although the issue of the \"last date of delivery\" appears to be resolved for Transaction No. 19, at a minimum the inaccuracies found by the Court call into question the veracity of the last dates of delivery for Transaction Nos. 15 and 16, also prepared using the AGRIS software. An excellent example of the unreliability of the dates is the fact that Tanya Hill's original timeline has December 8, 2013, for the last delivery date for Transaction No. 16; however, in her revised timeline she used the date of October 26, 2013 - a\n   <em>\n    seventy day\n   </em>\n   difference. The errors in the supporting documentation relate directly to dates the Partnership used in its timelines, making the Partnership's analysis unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <em>\n    (c)\n    <em>\n     Additional Issues Raised\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The parties have raised other unresolved issues regarding the timelines: whether Transaction Nos. 4, 5, 6, and 13 involving checks written to Hill &amp; Hill by Ivory Rice should be included in the analysis; whether Transaction No. 9 should be included in the analysis, with the Trustee arguing it should not because it was a payment of a missed load; whether Transaction Nos. 11 and 11-1, 11-2, 11-3, and 11-4 should be viewed as one contract or four; whether Transaction 10 should be included\n   in the analysis since the delay in payment was due to the request made by Hill &amp; Hill to not be paid on the transaction until 2013; and whether voided checks should be considered in the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   While the Partnership argues that revising the timeline to accept the Trustee's arguments would still support granting summary judgment, the Court finds that the determination of the issues stated above would necessarily require the Court to weigh the evidence, make credibility determinations or undertake further fact finding in order to create a timeline the Court deems appropriate for analysis. Those actions are not properly performed at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Therefore, for the reasons stated above and viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the Trustee, the Partnership's Motion as to the issue of whether the Transfer was made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the Debtor and the transferee is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (2) Made According to Ordinary Business Terms\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Partnership argues that the Trustee cannot avoid the Transfer because the Transfer was made according to ordinary business terms. To determine whether the transfer at issue was made according to ordinary business terms, the creditor must introduce evidence of a \"prevailing practice among similarly situated members of the industry facing the same or similar problems.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S.A.

The Partnership concedes in its Reply Brief that the Trustee has created a disputed issue of fact regarding the industry norms under Section 547(c)(2)(B). Therefore, based on this concession, summary judgment will be denied on the issue of whether the Transfer was made according to ordinary business terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   In conclusion, the Partnership's Motion is granted as to the initial requirement of the ordinary course of business defense that the transfer was in payment of a debt incurred by the Debtor in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the Debtor and Hill &amp; Hill.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (2012).

The corn and wheat represent \"new value\" within the statutory definition as they are money's worth in goods. Because it is undisputed this new value was given after the Transfer and the Debtor did not compensate Hill &amp; Hill for the goods, the Court finds that summary judgment should be granted to Hill &amp; Hill pursuant to Section 547(c)(4) in the amount of $6,570.68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (2) Cancellation of Contracts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   In its Motion, the Partnership asserts that the Debtor's unilateral cancellation of outstanding contracts at the time it closed relieved the Debtor of an obligation of at least $300,897.43 at market prices and that to the \"extent that the Partnership gave subsequent new value, the Transfer is unavoidable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4).\" (Mot. \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   In support of this allegation, Hill &amp; Hill attached the Affidavit of Tanya Hill in which she makes the same statement contained in the Partnership's Motion that the Debtor's \"unilateral cancellation of outstanding contracts at the time it closed relieved [the Debtor] of an obligation of at least $300,897.43 at market prices.\" (Mot. Ex. 1 \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The Partnership does not discuss the subsequent new value defense in its Brief nor cite any cases in support of its theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The Trustee did address this affirmative defense in his Response. The Trustee first states he does not dispute that the Debtor canceled contracts with Hill &amp; Hill subsequent to the Transfer but argues nothing in the record indicates the date on which the contracts were cancelled, whether prepetition or postpetition. (Resp. Br. at 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The Trustee also disputes the market value of the farm products, alleging the $300,897.43 amount it is not supported by the record. The Trustee then argues that the cancellation of the contracts did not replenish the estate, and thus did not provide new value to the Debtor. (Resp. Br. at 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The Partnership fails to address its subsequent new value defense in its Reply, and therefore, fails to rebut the argument raised by the Trustee that the cancellation of the contracts does not replenish the estate and does not meet the requirements for \"new value\" under Section 527(a)(2) and (c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   As pointed out by the Trustee, the record contains insufficient facts to determine the date or dates the outstanding contracts were canceled, a fact material to the analysis.
