Plaintiff Eric Walter Fuhrman's Amended Complaint seeks avoidance of the mortgage and disallowance of the claim owed to Defendants and alleges violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 17, (\"RESPA\") and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"FDCPA\"). This instant Motion for Summary Judgment was filed following the Court's issuance of a written Opinion on March 30, 2018, denying Defendants' Motion To Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). While cautioning that the Plaintiff \"ultimately may not be able to prevail\" on the various counts, the Court denied Defendants' Motion To Dismiss concluding that Plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts in his Amended Complaint to survive a motion to dismiss as to all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are not in dispute. In October of 2004, Plaintiff and his father, Walter W. Fuhrman, jointly owned a parcel of real estate as joint tenants with full rights of survivorship. This property is commonly known as \"8423 M-65, Posen, Michigan 49776\" and is more fully described as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Township 34 North Range 6 East Section 34 Parcel in the Southwest 1/4 of\n   the Northwest 1/4 Commencing 200FT North of the Southwest Corner thence East 210FT, thence North 200FT, thence West 210FT, thence South 200FT to the Point of Beginning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 16, 2004, Walter Fuhrman sought financing from Homecomings Financial Network, Inc., and obtained a loan in the amount of $54,000. Walter Fuhrman executed a promissory note in that amount; Plaintiff is a not a party to that note and has no liability thereon. Walter Fuhrman and Plaintiff executed a document purporting to establish a mortgage in the property. The mortgage was recorded in the Presque Isle County Records and was later assigned to Green Tree Servicing, LLC, and finally to Defendant Wilmington. The legal description of the property in the mortgage contains what Defendants consider a scrivener's error. Instead of stating \"Range 6 East,\" the mortgage states \"Range 6 West.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants and their predecessors submitted billing statements to Walter Fuhrman and later to Plaintiff. These statements mentioned payments for escrowed property taxes and property insurance, property inspection fees, late fees, and other fees. Walter Fuhrman passed away in 2015. Plaintiff, believing the note and mortgage were enforceable, made payments to Defendants and their predecessors in interest; the payments were accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges the following facts which the Court accepts for purposes of this motion. Plaintiff states that despite charging the account with escrow advances for taxes, Defendants failed to disburse payments to the Presque Isle County Treasurer for property taxes and failed to actually have property inspections performed. Instead, Plaintiff paid the property taxes directly, incurring fees in the process. In April of 2017, Defendants attempted to initiate foreclosure proceedings on the property by advertisement. In May of 2017, Plaintiff, through counsel, requested a full payment history relative to the mortgage and other information. However, Defendant Rushmore declined to provide any information, stating that Plaintiff was not a borrower under the note and not entitled to the information he had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 24, 2017, Plaintiff filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Defendant Rushmore filed a proof of claim on behalf of Defendant Wilmington on September 25, 2017. Plaintiff initiated this adversary proceeding on September 26, 2017, against Defendants Wilmington and Rushmore along with Defendant Ditech Financial. Plaintiff sought disallowance of the claim based on the incorrect description of the property in the mortgage as well as the alleged failure to obtain the consent of Walter Fuhrman's wife on the mortgage, along with allegations of violations of RESPA, FDCPA, and the Michigan Consumer Protection Act (\"MCPA\"). Defendant Ditech filed a motion to dismiss and the court granted that motion on December 27, 2017. Defendants Wilmington and Rushmore brought a joint motion to dismiss on January 4, 2018. In his response to the motion to dismiss, Plaintiff conceded that he could not prevail on the arguments based on the failure to obtain Walter Fuhrman's wife's consent and the MCPA violation, so he filed an Amended Complaint on January 25, 2018, reflecting this. Under the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff sought avoidance of the mortgage due to the incorrect legal description and disallowance of the claim as a result. He also re-alleged violations of RESPA and FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In support of this motion, Defendants offer the Affidavit of Laura J. Grossman, who is a searcher/examiner for Huron\n   Shores Title Agency of Presque Isle County. Ms. Grossman has worked in the real estate title insurance agency industry for approximately 35 years and has the requisite knowledge to form opinions in this case. As stated in Ms. Grossman's Affidavit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   6. As part of my responsibilities as Searcher/Examiner of the Huron Shores Title Agency of Presque Isle County, I conduct searches of the real property records maintained by the Presque Isle County Register of Deeds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   7. I am aware that the Presque Isle County Register of Deeds maintains both a grantor/grantee index and a tract index to index recorded real estate documents and transfers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   8. On August 27, 2018, I conducted a search of the grantor/grantee index of the Presque Isle County Register of Deeds under the name of \"Eric W. Fuhrman\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   9. On August 27, 2018, I also conducted a search of the tract index of the Presque Isle County Register of Deeds using the following legal description:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Land situated in the Township of Pulawski, County of Presque Isle, and State of Michigan, described as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Township 34 North Range 6 East, Section 34, Parcel in the Southwest 1/4 of the Northwest 1/4 Commencing 200FT North of the Southwest Corner thence East 210FT, thence North 200FT, thence West 210FT, thence South 200FT to the Point of Beginning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   10. On August 27, 2018, I also conducted a search of the tract index of the Presque Isle County Register of Deeds using the following parcel identification number: 130-034-000-011-00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   11. The legal description and parcel identification numbers contained in paragraphs 9 and 10, above, are the property commonly known as 8423 M-65, Posen, Michigan 49776 (the \"Property\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   12. The results of my aforementioned searches of the grantor/grantee and tract indices included the discovery of a mortgage granted to Walter W. Fuhrman, a married man and Eric W. Fuhrman to Homecomings Financial Network, Inc., on October 16, 2004, which was recorded against the Property on October 26, 2004, in the Presque Isle County Records at Liber 400, Page 912-929 (the \"Mortgage\"). A copy of the Mortgage is attached as Exhibit A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   15. Further, through my searches I discovered that the legal description for the Property has not been platted; it is a metes and bounds description.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff has not offered any counter affidavit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 157(a), and 157(b)(1) and E.

Bankruptcy trustees typically acquire the status of a hypothetical bona fide purchaser for purposes of this statute as they are without notice of a third party's claimed interest until the bankruptcy is filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   With the Plaintiff Debtor asserting this status, as is the case here, the analysis is less typical, because a history of the pre-bankruptcy facts and circumstances is relevant. While at first blush, this analysis would appear to involve issues of fact, such is not always the case, and here, the element of notice is facially problematic for Plaintiff. The Court finds there is no genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff had, at a minimum, constructive notice of Defendants' mortgage despite the incorrect legal description. There is no dispute that there was a minor error in the legal description for this property. Even so, the Court concludes that both a grantor/grantee index search utilizing Plaintiff's name, as well as a tract index search with the parcel identification number, which has remained constant, identify the existence of the subject mortgage and would have identified the existence of the mortgage to Plaintiff during the relevant time. These undisputed facts, as supported by the Affidavit of Ms. Grossman and unanswered by\n   Plaintiff, lead this Court to conclude there is no material fact in dispute on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   While Plaintiff would have this Court look strictly at the incorrect legal description and declare the mortgage invalid for that reason alone, Plaintiff's position ignores the requirement that his status must be that of a bona fide purchaser, for avoidance under Section 544(a). The case law relied upon by Plaintiff still requires the subsequent \"purchaser\" to have acted in good faith and without notice. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff is not a bona fide purchaser of the subject property for purposes of Section 544(a), and summary judgment should be granted as to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Turning to Count II, Plaintiff alleges in his Amended Company that: \"If Count I of Debtor-Plaintiff's complaint is successful then Defendants have no enforceable claim against property of the Debtor-Plaintiff.\" (\u00b6 31, Amended Complaint, ECF No. 28). Plaintiff further alleges that he \"did not execute a promissory note in favor of Defendants or their predecessors in interest.\" (\u00b6 32, Amended Complaint, ECF No. 28). To the extent Defendants' motion seeks summary judgment that its lien is valid as to the subject real property, the Court concludes that there is no genuine issue here. Because the mortgage is valid, such mortgage obligation remains in place. The Court further concludes that there is no genuine issue that there can be no enforceable personal obligation of Plaintiff as he did not sign the promissory note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Statutory Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As stated in this Court's March 30, 2018 Opinion, Plaintiff alleges multiple RESPA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 17, and FDCPA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , violations. The Court rejected Defendants' argument that the RESPA count does not give parties a private cause of relief, finding that, instead, \"to the extent the Plaintiff's allegations serve as an objection to the amount of the claim, they are properly before this Court.\" The Court also rejected Defendants' argument that the FDCPA count should be dismissed, concluding that the issues of whether the alleged behavior was sufficiently harassing, oppressive, or abusive \"are questions of fact that need to be further explored during discovery and trial if necessary. The Court concluded that while these counts were not normally ones over which this Court would decide in isolation, such were sufficiently connected with the mortgage avoidance and claim disallowance counts to allow this Court to determine these counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because the Court has determined that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the mortgage avoidance and disallowance of claim counts as a matter of law, this Court concludes that, at most, it has \"related to\" jurisdiction over these counts as they do not \"arise under\" or \"arise in\" a bankruptcy proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Thus, these counts are considered non-core because such do not \"invoke[ ] a substantive right created by federal bankruptcy law or one which could not exist outside of bankruptcy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Sanders Confectionery Prod., Inc. v.

The only basis for jurisdiction is that the Plaintiff happens to be the Debtor in the underlying Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. \"Related to\" proceedings are those that could be commenced in a federal or state court independent of the bankruptcy case, with the possibility of a conceivable effect upon the bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    Gardner v.

The Court concludes that Plaintiff's claims against Defendants could conceivably impact his bankruptcy estate, if Plaintiff ultimately prevails and funds are recovered. Accordingly, the Court concludes that \"related to\" jurisdiction does exist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because only non-core counts remain, the Court is authorized pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the District Court, but may not enter a final order or judgment as to these remaining counts.
