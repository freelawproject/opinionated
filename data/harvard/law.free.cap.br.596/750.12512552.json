ROBINSON, CHIEF UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC (\"Carrington\") holds a mortgage (the \"Mortgage\") on the Debtor's residence (the \"Mortgaged Property\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Mortgage secures the Debtor's Note in the original principal amount of $141,112 (the \"Note\"). Carrington filed a proof of claim in the Debtor's chapter 13 bankruptcy case for the prepetition Mortgage debt, and now seeks to recover the additional fees paid to its attorneys for their postpetition legal work. The Debtor objects and argues that the claim for postpetition attorney's fees should not be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I -\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Debtor filed two back-to-back cases for relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the spring of 2017. Her first case (case no. 17-01226; the \"First Case\") was dismissed after a show-cause hearing because of deficient schedules. (First Case Docs. 8, 29.) The Debtor filed the instant case four days later, and in her proposed chapter 13 plan (Doc. 2), which was eventually confirmed, she acknowledged she was thirteen months behind on her Mortgage installments. She proposed to pay the thirteen delinquent installments and her on-going monthly Mortgage payments under the plan, through the trustee. It was obvious that her bankruptcy filings were attempts to save her home from foreclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to Rules 3001 and 3002 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carrington, through its attorney, filed a timely proof of claim (amended claim # 8 and herein, the \"POC\") in which it listed the amounts due on the petition date under the Note and Mortgage, including principal, interest, prepetition fees and charges, escrow deficiency, and a calculation of the prepetition arrearage. Copies of the Note and the Mortgage were filed with the POC. The Debtor did not object to the POC. Soon after filing its POC, Carrington, also through its attorney, filed a Notice of Postpetition Mortgage Fees, Expenses, and Charges pursuant to Rule 3002.1(c) (the \"Postpetition Fee Notice\"), claiming an additional $600 for attorney's fees; $300 for the First Case and a like\n   amount for the instant case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor filed a Motion for Determination of Fees, Expenses, or Charges Pursuant to Rule 3002.1(e) (Doc. 55 and herein, the \"Motion\") in which she objected to the allowance of the additional fees. Carrington responded to the Motion, and relied almost exclusively on the language of Rule 3002.1 as authorizing the additional fees. (Doc. 62.) The Debtor filed a brief in support of her Motion (Doc. 75), arguing that the Mortgage did not authorize the assessment of attorney's fees for a simple chapter 13 case. Additionally, she argued that employing an attorney for plan review and filing a proof of claim was unnecessary and the amount of the fees was unreasonable. The court conducted an evidentiary hearing, and then took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II -\n   <em>\n    Legal Services Performed by Carrington's Attorney\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing Carrington's attorneys, through testimony and proffer, described the legal services they and their law firm performed with respect to the Debtor's bankruptcy case. Immediately after being retained by Carrington, they accessed the Debtor's case through PACER\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and created a file. They reviewed the petition, schedules, and other related bankruptcy documents, including the Debtor's proposed chapter 13 plan. The plan was scrutinized for its intended treatment of the Mortgage. Carrington provided them with copies of the Note and Mortgage along with the Debtor's loan history and account balances. They reviewed the Note and Mortgage, the loan history and account information, and then signed and filed the POC along with supporting documents and required attachments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the firm monitored the case, reviewing all events, looking for those that might affect Carrington's interest as mortgagee. The firm charged a flat fee of $300, the same amount it charged for all Carrington's chapter 13 cases. The fee was negotiated based on competitive bidding with other firms. The same law firm prepared and filed the Postpetition Fee Notice for Carrington.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   III -\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This is a contested matter under Rule 9014 to determine whether attorney's fees incurred postpetition in a chapter 13 case by a creditor holding a claim secured by a mortgage encumbering a debtor's principal residence are allowable under Rule 3002.1(e).

Similarly, Alabama law recognizes that, if the mortgage contract so provides, the mortgagor's obligation to pay a mortgagee's attorney's fees may be treated as an obligation secured by the mortgage. In paragraph 7 of the Mortgage, the Debtor agreed that if \"there is a legal proceeding that may significantly affect [Carrington's] rights in the [Mortgaged] Property (such as\n   <em>\n    bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   ...), then [Carrington] may do and pay whatever is necessary to protect ... [Carrington's] rights in the [Mortgaged] Property.\" (emphasis added.) Paragraph 7 goes on to state that \"amounts disbursed by [Carrington] under this paragraph shall become an additional debt of [Debtor] and secured by this [Mortgage].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A chapter 13 bankruptcy case is a \"legal proceeding\" and as discussed below, has the potential to significantly and adversely affect a mortgagee's interest in mortgaged property. As a creditor, a debtor's mortgagee is a party to her chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings, especially, as in this case, when it is scheduled as a creditor who is to be paid under a debtor's plan. Although \"attorney's fees\" or the like are not specifically listed in paragraph 7 of the Mortgage as expenses Carrington may incur and pass on to the Debtor for reimbursement, there are, in fact, no specific descriptions of expenses enumerated under the \"may do and pay\" language of paragraph 7. According to the Debtor's interpretation, the failure to specifically include attorney's fees under paragraph 7 should result in attorney's fees for bankruptcy representation never being considered expenses covered by paragraph 7. The court disagrees. Paragraph 7, which authorizes the \"Lender [to] do and pay whatever is necessary to protect the ...

Notably, most of the cases on the Debtor's side of this issue were decided before the 2011 amendments to the Code and Rules, and their premise was that filing a proof of claim involved nothing more than putting numbers on a form with no significant legal ramifications, and required no legal analysis of the underlying documents and plan treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In practice, the Debtor's argument could be applied to many legal matters. Anyone with basic reading and writing skills may be capable of following instructions and completing a form, but it may be unwise to do so when the consequences of noncompliance are significant, and the risks may not be fully understood by a layman. Nonetheless, although the Mortgage authorized Carrington to hire an attorney to represent its interest in the Debtor's bankruptcy case, the court agrees with the Debtor that if the services associated with the attorney's charges required no legal expertise to protect Carrington's interest, the Debtor should not be responsible for those charges. Hence, the issue becomes whether the Debtor's bankruptcy posed a significant risk to Carrington's interest under the Mortgage, and if so, was that risk allayed as a result of the services performed by Carrington's attorney-reviewing the petition, schedules, and proposed plan; reviewing the Mortgage and Note; reviewing the loan history and accounting; and preparing or inspecting, signing and filing the proof of claim-rather than those same tasks being performed by a non-lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The risks and penalties associated with a flawed proof of claim are not insignificant, particularly for a residential mortgage creditor. Preparing, signing, and filing a proof of claim may not be complicated-the\n   Official Form is readily available online and Rule 3001 states what is required, including attachments and escrow account statement-but the consequences of an incomplete or inaccurate claim travel with the creditor throughout the case and potentially have significant legal and evidentiary repercussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, with few exceptions, if a creditor wants its claim allowed and paid through a chapter 13 plan, it must file a timely proof of claim. Rule 3002(a). A proof of claim filed by a residential mortgage claimant must include detailed information: an itemization of the interest, fees, expenses and other charges, and the amount necessary to cure any default, and should attach copies of the note and mortgage that evidence the debt and security. Rule 3001(c), (d). A mortgage creditor holding an escrow account, such as Carrington in this case, must also file an escrow analysis prepared as of the petition date. Rule 3001(c)(2)(C). If a proof of claim is executed and filed in accordance with the Rules, it constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim. Rule 3001(f). However, a residential mortgage creditor who fails to follow the mandates of Rule 3001(c) may suffer significant detrimental consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A noncompliant proof of claim is not entitled to a prima facia evidentiary presumption of its validity or amount, but more importantly, a court may:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (i) Preclude the holder from presenting the omitted information, in any form, as evidence in any contested matter or adversary proceeding in the case, unless the court determines that the failure was substantially justified or is harmless; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (ii) Award other appropriate relief, including reasonable expenses and attorney's fees caused by the failure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Rule 3001(c)(2)(D) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Rule 3002.1(i) which sets out identical sanctions for a creditor's failure to provide information required by that Rule. Thus, in a contested matter or adversary proceeding challenging a residential mortgagee's secured claim after it filed a deficient proof of claim, the claim may not be presumed valid or its amount accurate, and potentially the creditor may be precluded from offering evidence to prove the amount of its claim or the existence and perfection of its security interest, or both, and be required to pay the debtor's attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Milliman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201475937\">\n    2018 WL 1475937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

The Debtor objected to the court's consideration of the 2016 HUD Letter for any purpose other than as establishing HUD's maximum allowable fee and argued that nothing in the 2016 HUD Letter actually authorized the collection of attorney's fees in this case. The court agrees that it is the Mortgage and applicable nonbankruptcy law, not the 2016 HUD Letter in isolation, that controls whether the fees are properly added to the Mortgage debt. The Mortgage, however, specifically incorporated the fees authorized by HUD, which are set out in detail in the 2016 HUD Letter. To the extent the Debtor argues that the court should not consider the 2016 HUD Letter despite its being explicitly made part of the parties' contract under paragraph 8 of the Mortgage, the court overrules that objection.
