ENG's motion\n   and the debtor's response set forth the following body of uncontested facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    UNCONTESTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 14, 2013, the debtor entered into a Commercial Lease Agreement (the \"\n   <em>\n    Lease\n   </em>\n   \") with ENGS for the lease of a 2011 Kenworth T800 with Cobra Truck-Mounted Hot Oil United (the \"\n   <em>\n    Equipment\n   </em>\n   \"). ENGS is the owner of the Equipment and filed a UCC-1 covering the Equipment. Additionally, the Texas Certificate of Title shows that ENGS is the owner of the Equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Lease required the debtor to make a one-time advance payment to ENGS in the amount of $ 100,000.00. In addition, the Lease required the debtor to make monthly rental payments of $ 9,520.74 to ENGS for a period of forty months. The Equipment has a useful life of approximately 20 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Paragraph 2 of the Lease provides that the debtor may not cancel the Lease during its term for any reason, including equipment failure, loss or damage. Any request for cancellation or early termination is at ENGS's sole discretion. Paragraph 9 of the Lease, titled \"END of Lease Events,\" provides that upon expiration of the Lease, the debtor can terminate the Lease with no additional obligations or, alternatively, the debtor can purchase the Equipment by choosing one of four opinions: (1) the \"Fair Market Value\" option; (2) the \"Stated Purchase\" option; (3) the \"Payment Upon Termination\" option; or (4) the \"TRAC Lease\" option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As one of the attachments of the Lease, the debtor and ENGS entered into a terminal rental adjustment clause (\"\n   <em>\n    TRAC\n   </em>\n   \") rider arrangement. Pursuant to the TRAC, the \"Estimated Fair Market Value\" at the time the Lease expires is $ 74,300.00. The TRAC provides that it is anticipated that the Equipment will be sold on the open market to a third party upon the expiration of the initial term of the Lease. If the Equipment is sold for less than the Estimated Fair Market Value, the deficiency shall be paid by the debtor to ENGS. If the Equipment is sold for more than the Estimated Fair Market Value, ENGS shall pay the surplus to the debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Paragraph 2 of the TRAC, titled \"CONDITIONS FOR RETURNED VEHICLES,\" provides that if, at the expiration of the Lease or an earlier termination, the debtor returns the Equipment to ENGS, the debtor shall ensure that all operating components will be able to perform their originally intended operating function. Any vehicle returned with \"Normal Wear and Tear\" will be accepted with no additional charges owing. However, for vehicles returned in a condition beyond \"Normal Wear and Tear,\" additional charges will be calculated based on paragraph 2 of the TRAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Paragraph 3 of the TRAC, titled \"INTENT; TITLE,\" provides that it is the express intent of the parties that the Lease constitutes a true lease and not a sale of the Equipment. Paragraph 3 further provides that title to the Equipment shall at all times remain in ENGS. The Lease provides that the debtor shall acquire no ownership, title, property, right, equity, or interest in the Equipment other than its leasehold interest solely as lessee subject to all the terms and conditions of the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The debtor defaulted on the Lease and remains past due under the Lease. Prior to bankruptcy, ENGS filed a lawsuit against the debtor and the guarantor of the Lease, Otila Salinas, in the 143\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court of Reeves County, Texas, Case No. 17-04-21930-CVR, and obtained a writ of sequestration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 1, 2017 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Petition Date\n   </em>\n   \"), the debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The debtor has continued to possess and use the Equipment post-petition. According to an affidavit by one of the debtor's owners in support of its opposition to ENG's motion, the Equipment is currently worth more than the Estimated Fair Market Value of $ 74,300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 30, 2017, ENGS filed its\n   <em>\n    Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay or, Alternatively, Adequate Protection without Waiver of 30-Day Hearing Requirement\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Stay Relief Motion\n   </em>\n   \"). On January 24, 2018, the Court entered the\n   <em>\n    Order on Motion for Relief from Stay\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Stay Relief Order\n   </em>\n   \"), pursuant to which the stay was conditionally continued, and the debtor was to make monthly payments to ENGS in the amount of $ 3,960.00 for the six finance agreements and one Lease between ENGS and the debtor. The Stay Relief Order also provided that $ 645.00 of the monthly payment should be applied to the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 19, 2018, the debtor filed the\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Complaint to Determine Lien or Interest in Property\n   </em>\n   the \"\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   \"), seeking the Court's determination that the Lease is a financing transaction. ENGS filed its answer on February 28, 2018. The Court held a trial scheduling conference on May 3, 2018, and entered an Order Arising from Management Conference setting certain deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On July 24, 2018, in the underlying bankruptcy case, the debtor filed the\n   <em>\n    Amended Plan of Reorganization of Royal T. Energy, LLC\n   </em>\n   . ENGS objected to confirmation of the proposed reorganization plan. On September 7, 2018, the debtor filed a\n   <em>\n    Second Amended Plan of Reorganization of Royal T. Energy, LLC\n   </em>\n   . At the confirmation hearing held on September 11, 2018, the Court confirmed the proposed plan. Subsequently, the Court entered its\n   <em>\n    Order Confirming Debtor's Amended Plan of Reorganization\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Confirmation Order\n   </em>\n   \"). Pursuant to the Confirmation Order, the debtor is to pay ENGS, for the Lease, the amount of $ 59,925 in 60 equal monthly installments with interest at the rate of 5% per annum, pending the final resolution of this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Confirmation Order also provides that ENGS reserves the right to fully litigate this adversary proceeding and any related matters, including but not limited to, asserting all claims and defenses in the adversary proceeding. If the Lease is determined to be a true lease, the Equipment shall be surrendered to ENGS and ENGS reserves the right to assert any lease rejection damage claim within 30 days of the date of such judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this adversary proceeding, the parties dispute whether the Lease is a true lease or a financing transaction. To determine whether a contract is a true lease, the Fifth Circuit looks to state law.\n   <em>\n    First Guaranty Bank. v. Pioneer Health Services, Inc. (In re Pioneer Health Services, Inc.),\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=739%20Fed.%20Appx.%20240\">\n    739 Fed.Appx. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . 242-43 (5th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted). Here, Paragraph 16 of the Lease provides that it is governed by Illinois law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Illinois, like many other states, has adopted the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 1-203(b) of the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (the \"\n   <em>\n    I-UCC\n   </em>\n   \") sets forth the standard for determining of whether a transaction in the form of a lease is really a security agreement. It provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (b) A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the\n   term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (2) the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (3) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (4) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   810 ILCS 5/1-203(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In short, \u00a7 1-203(b) of the I-UCC provides that a \"lease will be construed as a security interest as a matter of law if the debtor cannot terminate the lease and one of the enumerated requirements is satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    Banterra Bank v.

Accordingly, in this proceeding, the debtor has the burden of rebutting the presumption that the Lease is a true lease by proving the elements of I- UCC \u00a7 1-204(b) or by establishing that the economic realities of the transaction created a security agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2896789\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/341/256/#p268\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If that presumption is overcome, then the burden shifts to ENGS to refute the evidence that the Lease constitute a security agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2896789\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/341/256/#p268\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, the debtor cannot terminate the Lease. However, to satisfy the \"\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   test\" and establish that the Lease is really a financing agreement as a matter of law, the debtor must also satisfy one of the four enumerated factors. The debtor has not attempted to do so. The Court, therefore, concludes that the debtor has failed to satisfy the \"\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   test\" as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Instead, the debtor seeks to establish that the Lease is a financing transaction based on the specific facts and \"economic\n   realities\" of the transaction. First, the debtor asserts that the presence of the TRAC rider is a \"key factor\" for establishing that the transaction is a security agreement. However, the TRAC rider does not grant the debtor equity in the Equipment. The TRAC rider simply shifts the risk that the actual value of the Equipment at the end of the Lease will be less than the Estimated Fair Market Value. As one court explained, a TRAC rider \"is simply a more sophisticated means to measure the true extent to which the lessee has consumed the lessor's interest in the goods.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re HP Distribution, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3773649\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/436/679/#p694\">\n    436 B.R. 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694 (Bankr. D. Kan. 2010) (holding that the lessee's duties to hold the lessor harmless for any depreciation in addition to the agreed residual price does not make the transaction more like a loan than a lease).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The debtor also asserts that the TRAC rider obligates it to pay ENG a final \"balloon payment\" at the end of the Lease term. This is a misreading of the TRAC rider. As previously described, upon expiration of the Lease, the debtor has the option to either purchase the Equipment for its Estimated Fair Market Value in the pre-determined amount of $ 74,300.00 or surrender the Equipment to ENGS. If the debtor chooses to surrender the Equipment, ENGS would then sell the Equipment in the open market to a third party. If the debtor elects to surrender the equipment, the debtor would only be required to make a payment to ENGS in the event the market determines that the surrendered Equipment is worth less than the Estimated Fair Market Value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The debtor relies on\n   <em>\n    In re Grubbs Const.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040995\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/319/698/#p719\">\n    319 B.R. 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 2005), to support its arguments. However, in contrast to the TRAC rider in\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   , the TRAC rider in this case does not obligate the debtor to purchase the Equipment at the end of the Lease. The debtor has a choice to make. The fact that the TRAC rider allows ENG to retain the sale proceeds of the Equipment in the fixed amount of $ 74,300.00 does not take away the debtor's option. On the contrary, it confirms that ENG retains a meaningful reversionary interest in the Equipment and it also creates an incentive for the debtor to use and maintain the Equipment in a way that protects ENG's right as the owner of the Equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In summary, the Lease states that the parties intended the transaction to be a lease, not a security agreement. There is no indication that the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds the value of the Equipment. There is no evidence that the Estimated Fair Market Value of the Equipment was set as a price less than the anticipated fair market value of the Equipment. Finally, the debtor cannot obtain the Equipment for a nominal sum at the end of the Lease terms but must make a substantial payment to acquire it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Beckham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9444443\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/275/598/#p605\">\n    275 B.R. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605 (D.
