To the extent that any finding of fact constitutes a conclusion of law, it is adopted as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts, in pertinent part, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Delta Ag Group, LLC (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Debtor\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"), a Louisiana limited liability company, was formed in 2008. It has two members, Brad McIntyre and Jo Ann McIntyre (husband and wife), who together hold 100% of the membership interest. Debtor owns a single asset, which consists of 5 to 6 acres in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, on which rice grain storage bins were built (collectively the \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Property\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2. The Bank holds a first priority, multiple indebtedness mortgage on the Property to secure an indebtedness in the approximate amount of $ 490,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   3. On January 31, 2018, the Bank filed a \"Petition for Executory Process\" in state court against Debtor and its members styled \"\n   <em>\n    Richland State Bank vs. Delta Ag Group, LLC, Brad Allan McIntyre and Jo Ann McIntyre,\n   </em>\n   \" 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court, Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, Suit No. 2018-41 (the \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Foreclosure Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"). As a result of the Foreclosure Action, the state court issued an Order of Executory Process and a Writ of Seizure and Sale directing the Morehouse Parish Sheriff (the \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sheriff\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \") to seize and sell the Property. Debtor Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   4. The Sheriff valued Debtor's property at $ 1,400,000. Debtor Ex. 4. No party in intertest has disputed this valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   5. A public auction of the Property was scheduled by the Sheriff to commence on April 18, 2018. Debtor Ex. 5. Two (2) days before the scheduled Sheriff's auction, Debtor filed a petition for relief in this Court under Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 16, 2018 (Case No. 18-30619). Debtor Ex. 14. Debtor's Chapter 12 case had the effect of staying the scheduled Sheriff's sale for the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   6. Shortly after the filing of Debtor's Chapter 12 case, the Bank moved to dismiss that case on the grounds that Debtor had not conducted any farming operations in the year prior to the Chapter 12 bankruptcy filing and did not otherwise qualify for relief under Chapter 12. Debtor consented to the dismissal of its Chapter 12 case. Debtor Ex. 6, 7, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   7. Following the dismissal of Debtor's Chapter 12 case, the Sheriff set a new sale date of August 22, 2018. The sale was set with benefit of appraisal, but no bids were received at the first offering in an amount\n   equal to the required two-thirds of the appraised value [$ 1,400,000], which was $ 933,333.33. Debtor Ex. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   8. Acting pursuant to Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure article 2336, the Sheriff set a second auction for the Property, but this time without benefit of appraisal and thus without any minimum bid requirement. Debtor Ex. 6. The day before this Sheriff's sale was to occur, Debtor filed a new petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which is the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . Debtor Ex. 6, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   9. Debtor experienced financial difficulties beginning in 2014, when its part-owner, Brad McIntyre, was investigated and indicted on federal farm fraud charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ricky McIntyre, the father of Brad McIntyre and father-in-law of Jo Ann McIntyre, began making payments on the promissory note to the Bank in 2014 and has made all payments since. Ricky McIntyre is a creditor of the bankruptcy estate and, undisputedly, an insider pursuant to \u00a7 101(31)(C)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   10. Ricky McIntyre is the holder of a multiple indebtedness mortgage encumbering the Property to secure an indebtedness in the approximate amount of $ 625,000. This mortgage is subordinate to the Bank's mortgage. Debtor Ex. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   11. As part of his criminal sentencing, the District Court imposed a fine or order of restitution on Brad A. McIntyre requiring him to pay restitution in the amount of $ 4,311,247.00. Thereafter, pursuant to the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203613\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), the United States filed a \"Notice of Nominee Lien\" in the property records of Morehouse Parish to secure payment of the restitution or fine. The Notice of Nominee Lien designates Debtor as constituting the \"nominee\" of Brad A. McIntyre. By virtue of the Notice of Nominee Lien, Debtor's Property is encumbered by a lien in favor of the United States even though Debtor was not the party ordered to pay the fine or restitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Essentially, the United States contends that Debtor is or was designated to act on behalf of Brad A. McIntyre. The lien is for the full amount of the restitution ($ 4,311,247.00), plus penalties equal to 25% of the principal amount for any past due payments which may arise. Debtor Ex. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   12. As a result of the mortgages held by the Bank and Ricky McIntyre and the nominee lien held by the United States, there is no equity in the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   13. It is undisputed that Debtor has no employees or ongoing business operations. While the Debtor has yet to file a plan of reorganization, the testimony elicited at trial revealed that Debtor's rehabilitation plans involve renting out storage space at the grain storage facility to other area\n   farmers. Testimony also revealed that Debtor's plan is to have Ricky McIntyre manage the leasing of the grain storage bins due to his connections in the industry and the fact that he already leases approximately 15,000 acres of cropland near the grain storage facility. According to Ricky McIntyre, it is common for him to lease land to area farmers with the requirement that they would bring a portion of their crops to the grain storage facility for drying\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and storage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   14. At trial, Jo Ann McIntyre candidly admitted to having no experience in operating grain storage facilities. Ms. McIntyre further admitted that she has no contracts in place for potential lessees at the grain storage facility, and that she is not aware of any licensing or bonding requirement for a grain storage business such as Debtor plans to operate in Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   15. Jo Ann McIntyre and Ricky McIntyre were credible witnesses. Notwithstanding this finding, the Court did not find Ricky McIntyre's testimony credible with respect to his projections of Debtor's future financial performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Conclusions of Law and Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This Court makes the following conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 7052 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.

For example, the moving party may establish cause by showing that there is substantial or continuing loss to the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation; gross mismanagement of the estate; failure to maintain insurance that poses a risk to the estate or the public; or unauthorized use of cash collateral that is substantially harmful to a creditor. See, \u00a7 1112(b)(4).

At trial, the Bank's counsel advised that the Bank would adamantly oppose any plan proposed by Debtor. That leaves only two (2) non-insider creditors eligible to cast a ballot in favor of the plan. Absent a ballot accepting the plan by either the United States or the Sheriff, any\n   plan proposed by Debtor is dead on arrival. This dynamic does not support a finding that there is a reasonable likelihood that a plan could be confirmed within a reasonable time especially considering that the United States and the Sheriff have not: (1) participated in this case, (2) filed a proof of claim, (3) filed a notice of appearance, or (4) filed an objection to the pending motions to dismiss. Moreover, Debtor's express reservation of its right to object to the entirety of the claim held by the United States for approximately $ 4,300,000 makes the possibility of the United States casting a ballot even more unlikely than the typical case. In this Court's experience, governmental units rarely cast ballots accepting a plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although it is possible that the Sheriff and the United States may cast ballots in favor of a plan, Debtor failed to come forward with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to meet its burden under \u00a7 1112(b)(2) to establish a reasonable likelihood of achieving confirmation with the support of any impaired creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   This Court's finding of Debtor's inability to confirm a plan for lack of an accepting impaired class is similar to findings made by other courts invoking \u00a7 1112(b) to dismiss a case prior to confirmation. For example, one court found that \"cause\" under \u00a7 1112(b) existed where a single creditor held ninety-nine percent of the amount of unsecured claims, the debtor proposed to impaired his claim under a plan, and he stated his intention not to vote for it, thereby making it impossible to confirm a plan.\n   <em>\n    In re Babayoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713492\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/445/64/#p76\">\n    445 B.R. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76-77 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2011). Similarly, another court found that cause under \u00a7 1112(b) was present where a single creditor held seventy-eight percent of the unsecured debt and objected to the plan because his claim was impaired, so that confirmation of a plan was impossible.\n   <em>\n    In re Local Union 722 Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4121635\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/414/443/#p453\">\n    414 B.R. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.2009). Another court found cause under \u00a7 1112(b) present where plan confirmation was impossible over objection of creditor who controlled over one-third of a class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re B &amp; B West 164th Street Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6517447\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/147/832/#p842\">\n    147 B.R. 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Debtor failed to prove that it can obtain insurance within a reasonable period of time fixed by this Court - \u00a7 1112(b)(2)(B)(ii).\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Although Debtor proved, as required by \u00a7 1112(b)(2)(B)(i), there is a \"reasonable justification for the act or omission\" that forms the basis of the motion to dismiss (in this case, the failure to provide insurance), Debtor failed to prove that it can remedy this default within a reasonable period of time. Curing a default within a reasonable period of time is an additional requirement, set forth in \u00a7 1112(b)(2)(B)(ii), independent of the requirement in \u00a7 1112(b)(2)(B)(i) of \"reasonable justification.\" There is simply no evidence in the record to support the notion that Debtor will be able to obtain insurance if it is given additional time by this Court, other than the sheer hope or optimism expressed by Debtor's management. Debtor has not satisfied its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Other grounds for Dismissal need not be addressed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because the Bank and UST established \"cause\" to dismiss or convert under \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(C) and Debtor failed to establish a defense under \u00a7 1112(b)(2), the Bank's attempt to dismiss this case due to lack of good faith need not be discussed.

N.D. Ill. May 13, 2005) (noting that the court can choose to take either course no matter which one the movant has sought). Whether a chapter 11 case should be dismissed or converted depends on what is \"in the best interest of creditors and the estate.\" \u00a7 1112(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The best interest of the estate turns on whether its economic value is greater in or out of bankruptcy. In determining whether conversion or dismissal is appropriate, a court should consider what assets would be available for a chapter 7 trustee to liquidate and administer for the benefit of unsecured creditors if the case were converted. When the estate has no assets with equity that a trustee could liquidate to pay unsecured creditors, dismissal is in the best interests of creditors and the estate. When there are estate assets with equity, conversion is the better course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In this case, considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court believes that dismissal is in the best interests of the estate and the creditors, especially considering that there is no equity in Debtor's Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Although this Court is reluctant to dismiss any Chapter 11 case before a debtor is given the opportunity to propose a plan, the Court is required to apply the burden-shifting analysis set forth \u00a7 1112(b)(2). Applying that analysis, this Court concludes the Bank met its initial burden to establish \"cause\" for dismissal or conversion pursuant to \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(C) (failure to maintain appropriate insurance). Therefore, the burden shifted to Debtor to prove this case should not be dismissed or converted by proving each element set forth in \u00a7 1112(b)(2). Debtor failed to establish its burden of proof required by \u00a7 1112(b)(2) as it failed to prove: (i) the existence of specific unusual circumstances that establish that the appointment of a trustee, dismissal or conversion would not be in the best interest of creditors and the estate; (ii) there is a reasonable likelihood of a Chapter 11 plan being confirmed within a reasonable time; and (iii) the cause for dismissal or conversion can be cured within any reasonable period of time fixed by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court determines the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee or an examiner is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in the best interests of creditors and the estate. See, \u00a7 1112(b)(1). Instead, the Court determines it is in the best interests of the estate and its creditors to\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum of Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Brad McIntyre was under investigation by federal authorities in 2014 and he was indicted in 2015.
