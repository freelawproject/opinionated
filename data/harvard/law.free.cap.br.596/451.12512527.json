Picard (\"Picard\" or the \"Trustee\"), as trustee for the liquidation of the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (\"BLMIS\") under the Securities Investor Protection Act (\"SIPA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78aaa\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the substantively consolidated estate of Bernard L. Madoff under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, moves for summary judgment on claims to avoid and recover certain transfers. He argues that such transfers are subject to avoidance under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) because Madoff made them with the intent to \"hinder, delay or defraud,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , its creditors. Defendants, recipients of those transfers, are various brokerage customers of BLMIS. Each, without knowledge of Madoff's scheme, invested money and withdrew in transfers more than he, she, or it invested. They cross-move for summary judgment and assert that they are entitled to retain the money transferred to them. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Bankruptcy Court entered a Report and Recommendation (the \"Report\"). It set forth various proposed conclusions of law and recommended that the Court grant the Trustee's motion for judgment and deny defendants' cross-motion for judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants object to the Report. They request that the Court grant summary\n   judgment to them and deny the Trustee's motion for summary judgment. The Trustee asks that the Court adopt the Report in full and enter a final judgment in his favor. For the reasons that follow, the Court, on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, adopts the Bankruptcy Court's recommendation, grants summary judgment to the Trustee, and denies summary judgment to defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court assumes familiarity with those decisions and sets out here only those facts relevant to the instant dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Madoff Ponzi Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For many years, Madoff operated a fraudulent investment business, BLMIS, initially as BLMIS's sole member and later as its chairman and chief executive. Lowrey Stip. \u00b6 1. BLMIS was an investment firm that collected brokerage customers' funds and purported to invest those funds on behalf of the customers. But Madoff never invested that money. Instead, he used principal infused by \"new and existing customers to fund withdrawals of principal and supposed profit made by other customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Net Equity Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5904163,5875527\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/229/\">\n    654 F.3d at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Ponzi scheme did not generate legitimate profits for BLMIS's customers. When BLMIS's customers \"withdrew money from their accounts ... they did not actually receive returns on successful investments, but instead only the very money that they and others had deposited ... for the purpose of purchasing securities.\"\n   <em>\n    Picard v. Greiff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146355\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/476/715/#p718\">\n    476 B.R. 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 718 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (\"\n   <em>\n    Greiff\n   </em>\n   \"). To conceal Madoff's fraud, BLMIS \"generated fictitious paper account statements and trading records.\"\n   <em>\n    Net Equity Decision\n   </em>\n   at 231-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Madoff's scheme was exposed in 2008, when the infusion of new capital was unable to support the withdrawals sought by customers. In the end, \"the final customer\n   statements issued by BLMIS falsely recorded nearly $ 64.8 billion of net investments and related fictitious gains.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 232.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The SIPA Trustee and the Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 11, 2008, Madoff was arrested on federal criminal charges. Lowrey Stip. \u00b6 2. The same day, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") initiated proceedings against BLMIS and Madoff in this District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Secs. LLC et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 08 Civ. 10791. After Madoff's arrest, a court in this District granted an application by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\"SIPC\"), filed pursuant to SIPA \u00a7 78eee(a)(4)(B) and based on BLMIS's inability to meet its obligations to securities customers as they came due. Lowrey Stip. \u00b6 5. That court issued a protective order under SIPA and appointed Irving Picard as Trustee for BLMIS's liquidation.\n   <em>\n    Net Equity Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5904163,5875527\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/229/\">\n    654 F.3d at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On December 15, 2008, the SEC consented to combine its own action with SIPC's application pursuant to SIPA \u00a7 78eee(a)(4)(A). Lowrey Stip. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A brief primer on SIPA is useful here. SIPA liquidations are distinct from ordinary bankruptcy actions. \"In a SIPA liquidation, a fund of 'customer property,' separate from the general estate of the failed broker-dealer, is established for priority distribution\n   <em>\n    exclusively among customers.\n   </em>\n   The customer property fund consists of cash and securities received or held by the broker-dealer on behalf of customers, except securities registered in the name of individual customers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5904163,5875527\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/229/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 233 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78\n   <em>\n    lll\n   </em>\n   (4) ) (emphasis added).

Second, avoidance actions may be taken only to recover funds transferred within two years of the date of the filing of the petition (the \"reach-back period\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Transfers to Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By the time Madoff's Ponzi scheme was exposed in 2008, some brokerage customers had withdrawn from their accounts more money than they initially invested, while others had not withdrawn even the amount of the principal initially invested. A customer who deposited more than he or she withdrew has a \"net equity\" claim for the difference. Those customers who withdrew more than they deposited would have a net equity of zero.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inter-Account Transfer Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20183492\">\n    2016 WL 183492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Other courts have described customer withdrawals in excess of that customer's initial investment as \"fictitious profits,\"\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051961\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/499/416/#p419\">\n    499 B.R. at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because such proceeds were not based on legitimate securities transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants are among those investors who withdrew more money than they deposited in their respective BLMIS accounts. In other words, each received fictitious profits and has a net equity of zero. Defendants are: James Lowrey, the estate of Marianne Lowrey, Turtle Cay Partners, and Coldbrook Associates Partnership (the \"Lowrey Defendants\"); South Ferry Building Company, Emmanuel Gettinger, Abraham Wolfson, and Zev Wolfson (the \"South Ferry Defendants\"); South Ferry # 2 LP, Emmanuel Gettinger, Aaron Wolfson, and Abraham Wolfson (the \"South Ferry # 2 Defendants\"); and United Congregations Mesora (\"Mesora\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem., Add. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is undisputed that defendants acted in good faith and without knowledge of Madoff's fraud. At the time of each withdrawal, each defendant believed that the amounts of the withdrawal represented legitimate profits BLMIS had generated by using the money that defendant had invested to trade securities. Lowrey Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. In fact, as reviewed above, the withdrawals came from principal deposits of other investors. Transfers by BLMIS to investors like defendants were necessary for Madoff to perpetrate his fraudulent scheme, by creating the illusion of a profitable investment firm and thereby inducing new investors to deposit money with BLMIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051961\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/499/416/#p419\">\n    499 B.R. at 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Trustee's Avoidance Actions Under Section 548(a)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In 2010, the Trustee filed four adversary proceedings against defendants. The Trustee sought to avoid and recover, consistent with the two-year reach-back provisions of \u00a7 548(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, the fictitious profits that defendants had received in excess of the amount that they invested with BLMIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Proc. No. 10-04387 (Lowrey Defendants); Adv. Proc. No. 10-04488 (South Ferry Defendants); Adv. Proc. No. 10-04350 (South Ferry # 2 Defendants); Adv. Proc. No. 10-05110 (Mesora). The Trustee stipulated that defendants had opened their accounts with BLMIS and made withdrawals in good faith, without knowledge of Madoff's scheme. Lowrey Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. The Trustee further asserted, and defendants do not dispute, that BLMIS had transferred the funds at issue \"with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud some or all of [BLMIS's] then existing and/or future creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. The Trustee seeks to recover a total of $ 9,520,673 from the Lowrey Defendants; $ 6,620,000 from the\n   South Ferry Building Company Defendants; $ 21,955,000 from the South Ferry # 2 Defendants; and $ 3,200,000 from Mesora.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants asserted common affirmative defenses before the Bankruptcy Court and this Court. They principally argue that they are entitled to retain the fraudulent transfers because they received these from BLMIS in exchange \"for value\" under \u00a7 548(c), and thus, the transfers may not be clawed back. As detailed below,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   pp. 462-63, defendants argue that they gave BLMIS \"value\" in two alternative forms: First, BLMIS received value for each transfer \"through the satisfaction or discharge of the broker's contractual and legal obligations under state law to pay Defendants the securities entitlements reported by the broker.\" Def. Br. at 7. Second, \"each payment also discharged state and federal tort claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty that each Defendant held at the time of transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties agreed to partially consolidate the adversary proceedings involving the defendants, and to litigate their cross-motions for summary judgment based on a stipulated factual record. On December 6, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court heard arguments on the cross-motions. On March 22, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued the Report. It recommended that judgment be entered for the Trustee, and the defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Legal Background to the Bankruptcy Court's Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Several cases in this District have addressed the critical question before the Bankruptcy Court: whether, as defendants claim, the discharge of an antecedent debt, in the context of a Ponzi scheme, qualifies as \"for value\" within the meaning of \u00a7 548(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Judge Rakoff first considered that question in\n   <em>\n    Picard v.

Judge Rakoff joined that authority. He held that \"those transfers from [BLMIS] to defendants that exceeded the return of defendants' principal ... were not 'for value.' ... [T]he transfers must be assessed on the basis of what they really were; and they really were artificial transfers designed to further the fraud ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6464280,1793549\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/1286/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   , Judge Rakoff reaffirmed this holding and elaborated on his reasoning. There, recipients of transfers from BLMIS had argued that they held \"federal and state law claims\" against BLMIS that were discharged by the transfers, and that these claims constituted \"antecedent debts.\" 499 B.R.at 421. In other words, the transferees argued\n   they were entitled to retain the transfers under \u00a7 548(c) insofar as those transfers compensated them for state and federal claims that they held against BLMIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 422. Judge Rakoff acknowledged that \"in non-SIPA cases, payments in satisfaction of claims have been recognized as providing value to the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Greiff\n   </em>\n   , and for the reasons elaborated in detail below,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   p. 463-66, Judge Rakoff again held that in the context of a SIPA liquidation, \"only a defendant's investment of principal may count as 'value' with respect to the customer property estate for purposes of section 548(c).\" 499 B.R.at 422. Therefore, the recipient of a transfer from BLMIS receiving fictitious profits did not give \"value,\" and those transfers could be avoided under \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   , Judge Rakoff also adopted a method for calculating a transferee's fraudulent transfer exposure. As noted, \u00a7 548(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code limits transfers subject to avoidance to those made \"within 2 years before the date of the filing of the petition ....\" The Trustee proposed, and Judge Rakoff accepted, a \"Net Investment Method\" for calculating the total value of the fraudulent transfers within this period. Under this method, a defendant's exposure is calculated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   First, amounts transferred by [BLMIS] to a given defendant at any time are netted against the amounts invested by that defendant in [BLMIS] at any time. Second, if the amount transferred to the defendants exceeds the amount invested, the Trustee may recover these net profits from that defendant to the extent that such monies were transferred to that defendant in the two years prior to [BLMIS'] filing for bankruptcy.

Transferees argued that this method violated \u00a7 548(a)(1), on the ground that it permitted the Trustee effectively to avoid withdrawals made before the two-year reach-back period by considering such withdrawals in liability calculations.

The Bankruptcy Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court here considered-against the background of this case authority, in particular\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   -defendants' claim to be entitled to retain the fraudulent transfers. After reviewing the governing precedents, the Bankruptcy Court recommended granting summary judgment in the Trustee's favor and denying defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment. It held, based on the parties' stipulation that BLMIS had made the disputed transfers with \"actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\" creditors, \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A), that the Trustee had made out a prima facie case to avoid and recover the transfers. Report at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court then considered-and rejected-defendants' claims to have an affirmative defense. As to the argument that defendants had given \"value\" for the transfers within the meaning of \u00a7 548(c), the Bankruptcy Court held that this argument was \"previously raised or adopted by the Defendants and rejected by the District Court expressly or by implication.\" Report at 14. It noted that the defendants in this action here had been parties to\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   , which had rejected virtually identical arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 16 tbl.2 (comparing arguments in Defendants' 2012 Memorandum against arguments made in their memorandum of law before the Bankruptcy Court). Thus, the Bankruptcy Court stated, the law of the case doctrine foreclosed defendants' \"for value\" arguments, barring contrary subsequent controlling authority. And, it held, no such authority exists. Defendants had, in particular, pointed to\n   <em>\n    Ida Fishman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338986,6055436\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/411/\">\n    773 F.3d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2014), which held that claims to avoid certain transfers must be dismissed because the transfers were protected by the safe harbor of a separate provision of the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 546(e). But the transfer at issue in\n   <em>\n    Ida Fishman\n   </em>\n   did not include intentional fraudulent transfers under \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A), such as those here. As to such transfers, the Bankruptcy Court concluded after extensive analysis that\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   remains good law, and is law of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 22-31. It therefore recommended that defendants' \"for value\" defense be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants also argued that the Trustee's proposed method of calculating their\n   fraudulent transfer exposure-the Net Investment Model-violated the two-year reach-back limitation imposed by \u00a7 548(a)(1). The Bankruptcy Court again determined that Judge Rakoff had rejected that very argument in\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Defendants argued that the later decision in\n   <em>\n    California Public Employees' Retirement System v.

Second, defendants argue that the Bankruptcy Court wrongly granted an \"unpleaded claim\" when it stated that BLMIS had violated the SEC's financial responsibility rules. Third, they argue they are entitled to summary judgment because the Trustee's method of calculating the fraudulent transfer exposure is inconsistent with \u00a7 548(a)'s two-year reach-back period.

Because the assets of a customer property estate may be used only to satisfy the customers' net equity claims on a priority basis, Judge Rakoff reasoned, \"to the extent that payments of defendants' state and federal law claims would discharge an antecedent debt, that debt runs against [BLMIS's] general estate, not the customer property estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051961\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/499/416/#p419\">\n    499 B.R. at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He noted that \"while SIPA provides that a trustee is 'vested with the same powers and title with respect to the debtor and the property of the debtor, including the same rights to avoid preferences, as a trustee in a case under [the Bankruptcy Code],' \" SIPA also provides that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code apply only to the extent those provisions are consistent with SIPA.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051961\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/499/416/#p419\">\n    499 B.R. at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78fff -l(a) ).

Put differently, Judge Rakoff reasoned, the provisions of the 1934 Act allow any federal and state claims against BLMIS's general estate, but they do not permit those claims to run against a customer-property estate in a SIPA liquidation, which proceeds by distributing this estate solely to customers according to their net equity. This conclusion, Judge Rakoff held, is the \"logical application of the policy motivating SIPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 425. In a SIPA liquidation, \"it is often the case that the universe of funds available consists primarily of customer investments of principal, which ... are no longer sufficient to reimburse all customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In such cases, Judge Rakoff explained, \"it is also likely that each and every customer has a claim against the debtor\" for various state law claims sounding in tort.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In SIPA, Congress made \"the policy decision ... to attempt to treat each investor equitably by providing for recovery of customer property and pro rata distributions based on each customer's net-equity claim, rather than merely letting those who came out ahead retain the amounts obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   systematically considered and squarely rejected the very statutory arguments that defendants now make in support of an affirmative \"for value\" defense.

On this basis, defendants argue, the Bankruptcy Court \"wrongly treated the Trustee's claims as if the property sought was already in the SIPA customer estate and as though the value defense should be applied as if they submitted net equity claims for those sums in the later SIPA proceeding.\" Def. Mem. at 4-5. This argument is unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    Fairfield\n   </em>\n   does not limit the ability of a trustee in any liquidation to seek to recover intentionally fraudulent transfers such as those at issue here. Nor is\n   <em>\n    Fairfield\n   </em>\n   in tension with Judge Rakoff's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   On the contrary, it is defendants' construction that is problematic, in that, as the Trustee notes, defendants suggest that \"the only property that could be recovered would be property that had already been recovered.\" Trustee's Mem. at 33. Such a reading would gut the Bankruptcy Code's avoidance provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, defendants argue that even if\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   remains good law-and it clearly does-it is inapplicable here because it arose in a distinct procedural context. As defendants note,\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   resolved a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Accordingly, Judge Rakoff assumed the truth of the factual allegations in the Trustee's complaint, which did not plead the affirmative defenses on which defendants here rely. By contrast, defendants note, the instant litigation arises out of cross-motions for summary judgment based on stipulated facts. Defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   assumed that they were \"investors in the business of Madoff Securities,\" Def. Mem. at 39, whereas it is stipulated here that defendants were \"innocent retail securities customers of the Broker,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179963,4195671\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/199/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Lowrey Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Defendants argue that this distinction matters because securities customers enjoy rights that equity investors do not: (1) state law rights to receive full payment of reported securities entitlements; and (2) the federal protections of \u00a7 29(b) of the 1934 Act, which ensures BLMIS's obligations despite Madoff's fraud. Def. Mem. at 39 n.18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants' attempt thus to cabin\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   to apply only to equity investors is unavailing. As Judge Rakoff explicitly explained in\n   <em>\n    Greiff\n   </em>\n   (on which\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   relied) the distinction between equity investors and other creditors who seek to enforce by law BLMIS's false representation about their purported gains or profits-including customers of a brokerage firm who seek to retain fraudulent transfers-is a \"distinction without a difference.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146355\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/476/715/#p718\">\n    476 B.R. at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, customers of BLMIS \"faced the same risk as equity investors\" in BLMIS because they \"contracted for another to use its best efforts to try to generate a profit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146355\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/476/715/#p718\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Judge Rakoff explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Any entitlement defendants had to return on their investment, then, depended on a representation that [BLMIS] had in fact generated a profit. The complaints allege that [BLMIS's] representations in this regard were wholly fraudulent. Thus, defendants, in effect, ask the Court to enforce the scheme on the\n   ground that the vehicle of this particular Ponzi scheme ... styled itself as a stockbroker. Such a distinction pays only lip service to the underlying realities of the Ponzi scheme, and the Court rejects it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146355\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/476/715/#p718\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146355\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/476/715/#p718\">\n    at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, even if defendants are correct that\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   treated them, based on the pleadings, as equity investors as opposed to brokerage customers,\n   <em>\n    Greiff\n   </em>\n   makes clear that this distinction is of no moment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For all the reasons above,\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   's holding remains law of the case. Accordingly, defendants cannot prevail on their affirmative defense that they gave \"value\" in exchange for the fraudulent transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    B. SEC Financial Responsibility Rules\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Next, defendants argue that the Bankruptcy Court improperly ruled for the Trustee and against defendants on a claim he had not pled-under the SEC's financial responsibility rules. They argue that the Trustee lacked standing to pursue such a claim, and that the Bankruptcy Court was wrong to resolve it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This argument is meritless, and is quickly dispatched. The Bankruptcy Court's Report does indeed discuss the SEC's \"Customer Protection Rule,\" promulgated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .15c3-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   That Rule requires broker-dealers like BLMIS to segregate and protect customer property from their other operations. It thereby ensures that customer property held by a broker will be available for distribution to customers if the firm fails.\n   <em>\n    See Broker-Dealers; Maintenance of Certain Basic Reserves\n   </em>\n   , Exchange Act Release No. 34-9856,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1972%20WL%20125352\">\n    1972 WL 125352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Nov. 13, 1972) (a rationale behind the Rule is to \"facilitate the liquidations of insolvent broker-dealers\n   and to protect customer assets in the event of a SIPA liquidation through a clear delineation in Rule 15c3-3 of specifically identifiable property of customers\"). Violations of this Rule may trigger a SIPA liquidation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SIPA \u00a7 78eee(b)(1)(C). As noted, in the event of a SIPA liquidation, the pool of customer funds is to be returned to the broker's customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SIPA \u00a7 78\n   <em>\n    lll\n   </em>\n   (4) (defining \"customer property\" broadly to include \"cash and securities ... at any time received, acquired, or held by or for the account of a debtor from or for the securities accounts of a customer, and the proceeds of any such property transferred by the debtor, including property unlawfully converted\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendants mischaracterize the use to which the Bankruptcy Court put the SEC's Customer Protection Rule. The Bankruptcy Court did not resolve, to the defendants' detriment, an unpleaded claim for violations of that Rule. Rather, the Bankruptcy Court discussed the Rule in the course of evaluating defendants' \"for value\" arguments. The Bankruptcy Court concluded that the Rule reflected Congress's intent to create a pool of customer funds, separate from the broker's own assets, that may be returned to customers upon liquidation of the brokerage firm. The Rule thus, in the Bankruptcy Court's view, lent further support to its conclusion that customer property does not belong to the debtor brokerage firm and cannot be used by the debtor to satisfy its own antecedent debts. This form of legal analysis by the Bankruptcy Court was entirely proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Calculation of Defendants' Fraudulent Transfer Exposure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, defendants object to the method by which the Bankruptcy Court recommended calculating their exposure for the fraudulent transfers. Section 548(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code allows trustees to avoid transfer made \"within 2 years before the date of the filing of the petition ...\" In\n   <em>\n    Greiff\n   </em>\n   , Judge Rakoff interpreted this provision. He adopted the Trustee's proposed \"Net Investment Method\" for calculating exposure for transfers occurring within the two-year reach-back period set forth in \u00a7 548(a)(1) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   As for the calculation of how much the Trustee may recover under these claims, the Court adopts the two-step approach set forth in\n   <em>\n    Donell v. Kowell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039591\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/762/#p771\">\n    533 F.3d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 771-72 (9th Cir. 2008). First, amounts transferred by [BLMIS] to a given defendant at any time are netted against the amounts invested by that defendant in [BLMIS] at any time. Second, if the amount transferred to the defendant exceeds the amount invested, the Trustee may recover these net profits from that defendant to the extent that such monies were transferred to that defendant in the two years prior to [BLMIS] filing for bankruptcy. Any net profits in excess of the amount transferred during the two-year period are protected from recovery by the Bankruptcy Code's statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146355\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/476/715/#p718\">\n    476 B.R. at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants argue that this method is inconsistent with \u00a7 548(a)(1) because it permits the Trustee to consider withdrawals made outside the statutory two-year reach-back limitation, and use these withdrawals to reduce the investor's net equity. Def. Mem. at 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendants have made this argument before-without success. The Net Investment approach was first articulated in connection with BLMIS in\n   <em>\n    Greiff\n   </em>\n   . As the Bankruptcy Court noted,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Report at 32, defendants then challenged that approach in\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' 2012 Mem. at 28-29 (\"[A] fatal flaw to the Trustee's approach is that time-barred\n   fraudulent transfer claims would be used offensively to increase the maximum fraudulent transfer exposure of Defendants.\"). They argued then, as now, that \u00a7 548(a)(1) establishes a statute of repose, precluding the Trustee from taking into account transfers executed before the two-year reach-back period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40 (\"Like statutes of limitations, reach-back periods are statutes of repose established by legislatures in recognition of the fact that it would be unfair and unreasonable to force a person to litigate a particular issue more than a certain number of years after the occurrence giving rise to the claim.\"). Judge Rakoff rejected that argument in\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   He explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   It is true that section 548(a)(1) allows the Trustee to avoid only those transfers made by the debtor \"on or within 2 years before the date of the filing of the [bankruptcy] petition.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). Yet there is no similar limitation in section 548(c) with respect to whether a given transfer is \"for value.\" The concept of harm or benefit to the estate is separate from the concept of the reach-back period, which merely serves to allow finality to ancient transactions.... Thus, there is no reason why a line should be drawn at the beginning of the reach-back period in determining whether a transfer was for value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051961\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/499/416/#p419\">\n    499 B.R. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (first alteration in\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, as to the Trustee's proposed calculation method, too,\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   is law of the case, and forecloses defendants' challenge absent \"an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Virgin Atl.

The Court held that the three-year period was a statute of repose because (1) it \"runs from the defendant's last culpable act (the offering of the securities), not from the accrual of the claim (the plaintiff's discovery of the defect in the registration statement),\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2049, and (2) the \"pairing of a shorter statute of limitations and a longer statute of repose is a common feature of statutory time limits,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendants here argue that the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    CalPERS\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent with the Trustee's calculation method. They argue that Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 546(a) imposes a statute of limitations within which the Trustee must commence the avoidance proceeding, while \u00a7 548(a) is a statute of repose that \"looks back two years from the petition date to identify the transfer that may be attacked\" and may not be equitably tolled. Def. Mem. at 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Defendants' argument misses the point. Judge Rakoff's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   did not turn on whether \u00a7 548(a)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   was a statute of repose or a statute of limitation. And it contains no discussion of equitable tolling. Judge Rakoff acknowledged that \u00a7 548(a)(1) establishes a two-year reach-back period, and that transfers before that date may not be recovered. But, he explained, \"[t]he concept of harm or benefit to the estate is separate from the concept of the reach-back period,\" and so there is no reason \"why a line should be drawn at the beginning of the reach-back period in determining whether a transfer was for value.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051961\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/499/416/#p419\">\n    499 B.R. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    CalPERS\n   </em>\n   is therefore misplaced.

Defendants' complaint is that the Trustee has offered a new basis to purportedly distinguish\n   <em>\n    Fairfield Greenwich\n   </em>\n   , a case defendants claim undermines\n   <em>\n    Antecedent Debt Decision\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   But as explained above, the Court has independently concluded that\n   <em>\n    Fairfield Greenwich\n   </em>\n   is inapposite. Accordingly, the Court denies defendants' motion as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court adopts in full the Bankruptcy Court's recommendation, set forth in its thorough Report. The Court grants the Trustee's motion for summary judgment and denies defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment. The Court enters judgment in the amounts set forth on pages 458-59, footnote 2, of this decision. The Court further respectfully requests that the Clerk of Court terminate the motion pending at docket entry 8 in case number 18 Civ. 5381 and the motions pending at docket entry 10 in case numbers 18 Civ. 5430; 18 Civ. 5452; and 18 Civ. 5453.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Unless otherwise specified, all docket entries refer to the docket in case number 18 Civ. 5381, the first of four substantively consolidated cases assigned to this Court. The Court draws its account of the facts from the parties' submissions, including defendants' joint memorandum of law in support of their objections to the Bankruptcy Court's Report,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 3-1 (\"Def. Mem.\"), the Trustee's response to defendants' objections,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 4 (\"Trustee Mem.\"), letters from the parties identifying supplemental legal authority,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkts. 22, 23, 27, and joint stipulations the parties submitted in each Avoidance Action. These joint stipulations consist of the joint statement of undisputed facts in Adv. Proc. No. 10-04387, Dkt. 75 (\"Lowrey Stip.\"); the joint statement of undisputed facts in Adv. Proc. No. 10-04488, Dkt. 83 (\"South Ferry Stip.\"), the joint statement of undisputed facts in Adv. Proc. No. 10-04350, Dkt. 90 (\"South Ferry # 2 Stip.\"); and the joint statement of undisputed facts in Adv. Proc. No. 10-05110, Dkt. 57 (\"Mesora Stip.\"). Like the parties and the Bankruptcy Court, for ease of reference the Court will refer to the Lowrey Stip. unless citation to a case-specific stipulation is necessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Specifically, the Trustee seeks to recover the following from each defendant:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n    1.
