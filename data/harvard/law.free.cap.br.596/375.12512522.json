Having reviewed the extensive record and for the reasons set forth below, the Court resolves the matters as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff owned a parcel of property located in Seattle, at 515 35th Avenue South. On August 3, 2005, a quit claim deed was recorded that transferred 100% of Plaintiff's ownership interest to Williams Family Holdings LLC, whose sole member was Plaintiff. Dkt. # 123-1 at 2. Williams Family Holdings LLC secured a loan of one million three hundred eleven thousand dollars ($ 1,311,000) from Defendant PLG on or about January 24, 2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 111 at 17-33. The loan was intended to facilitate the construction of a single family residence on the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. The loan was secured by a deed of trust upon the property, executed the same day by Plaintiff as the Managing Member of Williams Family Holdings LLC. Dkt. # 144-1 at 45-68. Plaintiff also personally guaranteed the loan. Dkt. # 111 at 18-33. On January 25, 2007, Defendant PLG recorded a January 22, 2007 assignment of the Deed of Trust Defendant PRK, as custodian for the noteholders in Defendant PLG I. Dkt. # 144-1 at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff began construction on the property but the project was not completed in the anticipated timeframe and ran into financial trouble due to the conduct of Defendant PLG and its agents. Dkt. # 3 at \u00b6 34; Dkt. # 111 at 2-13. Plaintiff attempted to refinance the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the trustee on the deed of trust ultimately initiated non-judicial foreclosure under Chapter 61.24, Revised Code of Washington. Dkt. # 111 at 37-39; 84-85. The trustee sale was scheduled for September 11, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. Plaintiff, with Defendant Jolley's assistance, filed for voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy on September 10, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Nevertheless, the trustee held the trustee sale, as scheduled, on September 11, 2009, with Defendant PRK purchasing the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-39. Plaintiff's Chapter 7 bankruptcy was later dismissed, on October 7, 2009, \"for Failure to File Schedules or Statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the trustee sale, Defendant PRK and Plaintiff each asserted ownership over the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78, 84-85. On January 19, 2010, Plaintiff filed a \"Notice of Fraud and Intent to Litigate\" against the property with the King County Auditor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89-92. Defendant PRK initiated an unlawful detainer action against Plaintiff in King County Superior Court on January 29, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111-17. Also on January 29, 2010, Plaintiff filed a lis pendens against\n   the property with the King County Auditor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131-33. Defendant PRK ultimately was granted a Writ of Restitution to restore possession of the property. Dkt. # 123-1 at 32-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ultimately, the property was sold, on December 8, 2010, to Defendant Owners via a Statutory Warranty Deed that was recorded on December 14, 2010. Dkt. # 123-1 at 36-37. The Defendant Owners only connection to Plaintiff is that they own the property that he also claims to own. Prior to instituting this action, Plaintiff recorded several documents against the property. These included an Affidavit of Patent, an Affidavit of Acceptance, and a Quit Claim Deed. Dkt. # 123-1 at 39-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 11, 2018, Plaintiff filed this action against 29 named defendants. Dkt. # 1. On July 6, 2018, the Court granted several motions and dismissed Plaintiff's claims against seven defendants and several claims against Windermere Defendants. Dkt. # 107. In that Order, the Court determined that Plaintiff's Complaint had not adequately pled RICO claims as to any Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12. Additionally, the Court found that the majority of Plaintiff's state law claims were subject to a three year statute of limitations. Because Plaintiff's claims against the moving defendants were all premised on activity taking place prior to January 11, 2015, they were untimely and Plaintiff did not point to any contradictory authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-24. Accordingly, the Court dismissed certain claims and granted Plaintiff leave to amend. Plaintiff did not file an amended complaint. Because several defendants had not appeared and Plaintiff had not provided proof of service, the Court also subsequently issued an Order to Show Cause, directing Plaintiff to show cause as to proper service of those defendants or, alternatively, why he should be granted an extension to properly serve those defendants.

The question, therefore, is whether Plaintiff, as the sole member of the LLC, had a personal interest in the property. The appropriate starting point is the Washington Limited Liability Company Act (Chapter 25.15, WASH. REV. CODE ) in effect at the time of the trustee sale. Under that Act, a LLC is granted \"the same powers as an individual to do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its business and affairs.\" WASH. REV. CODE \u00a7 25.15.030(2) (2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Act also makes clear that the LLC and its members are separate entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WASH. REV. CODE \u00a7 25.15.125(2) (2010) (\"A member or manager of a limited liability company is personally liable for his or her own torts.\"). \"A member has no interest in specific limited liability company property,\" only a \"limited liability company interest,\" which is personal property. WASH. REV. CODE \u00a7 25.15.245(1) (2010). This interest is merely \"a member's share of the profits and losses of a limited liability company and a member's right to receive distributions of the limited liability company's assets.\" WASH. REV. CODE \u00a7 25.15.005(6) (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under the Act, the Washington Supreme Court has expressly held that LLC members have no ownership in property owned by the LLC and that assets and property owned by the LLC are not part of a member's bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against McGrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4298010\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/178/280/#p301\">\n    178 Wash.2d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20P.3d%20615\">\n    308 P.3d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625 (2013),\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bravern Residential, II, LLC v.

Dkt. # 145 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But Washington law is clear that LLC members do not have ownership interests in property owned by the LLC. Even if there was a factual dispute as to Plaintiff's intent or the state's tax treatment of the transfer, Plaintiff does not provide any authority indicating these issues are relevant to his underlying legal claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's claims against Defendant Owners, Windermere Defendants, PRK Defendants, and Defendant Jolley, to the extent they are premised on the trustee's deed violating the bankruptcy stay and therefore being void, are dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Plaintiff's State Law Claims Against Defendant Owners Fail\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's claims against Defendant Owners are somewhat distinct from those asserted against Windermere Defendants,\n   PRK Defendants, Defendant Jolley, and the previously dismissed defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 107. Some claims relate to the occupation of the property-which is ongoing-and the Court will therefore consider Plaintiff's claims against Defendant Owners separately and in more depth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant Owners interpret Plaintiff's Complaint as seeking to deprive them of their property and of alleging (1) conspiracy to slander title, (2) unlawful possession, (3) forceable entry, (4) conspiracy to deprive Plaintiff of his property rights, and (5) that Defendant Owners \"turned a blind eye to the alleged bankruptcy stay violation.\" Dkt. # 122 at 4. Defendant Owners present various procedural and substantive barriers to Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, and most importantly, Plaintiff lacks standing because his claims depend on ownership of the property.

Any claims premised on actions of Defendant Owners at the time they acquired the property-2010-are barred by applicable statutes of limitations, as noted above. Plaintiff's claim to possession is also barred by the earlier state court unlawful detainer action because the state court determined that Plaintiff was not entitled to possession of the property. Dkt. # 122 at 9-10 (citing sources in support). Lastly, Defendant Owners argue that, in any event, they have adversely possessed the property as they have actually, openly, and notoriously possessed the property since they acquired it in December 2010 and the requisite seven years therefore ran prior to Plaintiff filing suit. Dkt. # 122 at 10 (citing WASH. REV. CODE \u00a7 7.28.070 ). For all these reasons, Plaintiff's claims against Defendant Owners fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Dkt. # 145 at 2-3. However, Plaintiff does not cite to the applicable rule or approach its standards. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) provides that \"[i]f a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.\" FED.

However, none of those entities have appeared in this action and as of July 10, 2018, Plaintiff had not filed proof of service with regard to those entities. In response to the Court's Order to Show Cause Regarding Service (Dkt. # 108), Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that the DOR was served by leaving the summons with an individual at the front desk of a DOR office in Seattle. Dkt. # 110. Plaintiff also admitted that the purported service was untimely and that he was confused as to the status of service on the DOR prior to the Court's show cause order. Dkt. # 112. Plaintiff has never provided any proof or argument that either Northwest Trustee Services, Inc. or Fidelity National Title Company of Washington Services, Inc. have ever been properly served. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claims against both Northwest Trustee Services, Inc. and Fidelity National Title Company of Washington Services, Inc. are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With regard to DOR, service is to be effected upon the agency's chief executive officer or as provided by state law. FED. R. CIV. P. 4(j)(2)(A)-(B). Washington law allows for service upon the State or an agency of the State \"by leaving the summons and complaint in the office of the attorney general with an assistant attorney general.\" WASH.

Rather, Plaintiff appears to rely on California State court cases and baldly asserts, without any factual basis, that defense counsel has harmed him. Because Plaintiff fails to provide any legal basis for his claims against defense counsel, and for the numerous reasons set forth in the responses to Plaintiff's Motion (Dkts. # 137, # 138, and # 139), the Court denies Plaintiff's Motion. To the extent Plaintiff raises new arguments in his reply, the Court does not consider them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Plaintiff was previously advised that this practice did not comply with the Court's local rules. Dkt. # 107 at 2 n.4 (citing LCR 7(b)(1) ). Plaintiff's failure to follow the local rules is made more egregious by the fact that Plaintiff sought, but was denied, leave to file an over-length response. Dkts. # 141 and # 142.

However counsel for Defendant Owners does not assert she had knowledge of the underlying facts, only to the complete and accurate nature of the documents attached. Dkt. # 123. Plaintiff's request is baseless and the Court notes that he does not, in any manner, challenge the authenticity of the documents attached to the declaration.
