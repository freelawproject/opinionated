Todd, the Debtor, proceeding under chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, appeals from the judgment of the bankruptcy court, entered on March 23, 2018, disallowing the Debtor's exemption of her inherited individual retirement account (\"IRA\"). The Debtor timely filed a notice of appeal with the bankruptcy court on April 4, 2018. The Court has jurisdiction to consider this appeal, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), as an appeal from a final judgment, order, or decree entered by the United States Bankruptcy Court in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The issue on appeal is whether the Debtor's inherited IRA is exempt pursuant to New York C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5205(c)(1), (c)(2), or excluded from the property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) as a spendthrift trust as defined in C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5205(c)(3). The bankruptcy court ruled that the Debtor's inherited IRA is neither exempt nor excluded from the property of the estate. For the following reasons, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The case is currently proceeding under chapter 7. Pursuant to certain pre-petition contractual indemnifications between the Debtor and Appellee, Appellee has asserted a claim against the Debtor for $ 1,769,317.00. The Debtor claimed her exemptions under New York law and sought to exempt the inherited IRA from the property of the estate. Appellee objected, and the bankruptcy court disallowed the exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The bankruptcy court held that because the Debtor maintains exclusive control over the inherited IRA-namely, that \"the Debtor may withdraw 'funds at any time, for any reason, and without penalty' \"-it is not an exempt trust under section 5205(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    In re Todd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511781\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/585/297/#p301\">\n    585 B.R. 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301 (Bankr.

Irrespective of how an account is referred to under the tax code, \"a trust account will not come within the exemption set forth in section 5205(c)(1) where the account holder or beneficiary may withdraw funds therefrom at will.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Ondrey\n   </em>\n   , No. 99-CV-0011E,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20409497\">\n    1999 WL 409497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1 (W.D.N.Y.

As the bankruptcy court correctly determined, because the Debtor has unfettered access to the inherited IRA, the Court finds that section 5205(c)(1), standing alone, does not exempt it from the property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Section 5205(c)(2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The question then becomes whether the more expansive language of section 5205(c)(2) encompasses the inherited IRA. Section 5205(c)(2) sets forth certain types of assets that, while not expressly mentioned in section 5205(c)(1), are nonetheless exempt:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [A]ll trusts, custodial accounts, annuities, insurance contracts, monies, assets or other interests established as part of, and all payments from, either any trust or plan, which is qualified as an individual retirement account under section four hundred eight or section four hundred eight A of the United States Revenue Code of 1986 ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205205\">\n    N.Y.

An asset of this kind will \"be considered a trust which has been created by or which has proceeded from a person other than the judgment debtor, even though such judgment debtor is ... an individual who is the settlor of and depositor to such account plan,\" and therefore, exempt under section 5205(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The bankruptcy court reasoned that for the inherited IRA to be exempt, it must be \" 'qualified as an individual requirement account under section four hundred eight ... of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Todd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511781\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/585/297/#p301\">\n    585 B.R. at 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5205(c)(2) ).

Alternatively, \"qualified\" could be read as to limit the scope of section 5205(c)(2) to only accounts that receive the same tax benefits as traditional IRAs. Under this second reading, inherited IRAs, which are treated differently than traditional IRAs by the tax code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are not exempt under section 5205(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The bankruptcy court, having taken into account the legislative history of the provision, held that this second reading of the statute is more aligned with the legislature's intent to protect individuals' own retirement funds. While in agreement with the bankruptcy court's disposition, the Court need not look to the legislative history to resolve the ambiguity, as canons of statutory construction provide sufficient clarity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Debtor, for example, contends that the inherited IRA is exempt, so long as it is one of the retirement assets covered by section 5205(c)(2). However, the Debtor's argument fails to consider the limited enumeration of persons who may enjoy the benefit of this exemption. To read section 5205(c)(2) as exempting any asset other than by those set forth in the enumeration of judgment debtors would amount to reading this limitation entirely out of the statute, rendering it superfluous, and impermissibly broadening the exemptions available under section 5205(c)(1). Because\n   a court should not read statutory language as being superfluous, the enumeration must have effect-namely, to set forth the limited instances in which this provision applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that section 5205(c)(2) provides that a judgment debtor falling into one of these enumerated categories may claim an exemption under section 5205(c)(2) -all others must claim their trust exemptions directly under section 5205(c)(1). While a traditional IRA is a retirement asset covered by section 5205(c)(2), because an inheritor to an IRA is not one of the categories of judgment debtors enumerated by the statute, the Debtor's inherited IRA is not exempt from the property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Legislative History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A review of the legislative history evinces an intent to protect accounts established for individuals'\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   retirement. In the years leading up to the amendments to section 5205, bankruptcy courts had been holding that various retirement accounts were not exempt. In 1989, the legislature passed Chapters 84 and 280 as amendments to section 5205(c)(2) and related statutes. The Memorandum in Support of Chapter 84 indicates that the purpose of the amendment is to \"make the protection of IRAs of qualified retirement plans explicit in order to avoid potential disqualification by bankruptcy judges ....\" Memorandum in Support, S. 3567; A. 5753, Chapter 84 (1989).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Memorandum of Assemblyman Sheldon Silver similarly suggests that Chapter 280 was introduced to \"counter the increasingly callous manner with which bankruptcy courts [were] including qualified plan interests as assets available to bankruptcy creditors ....\" Memorandum of Assemb. Sheldon Silver, N.Y. Legislative Annual 158-59 (1989). The purpose of the amendment was to \"advance[ ] the interests of New York retirement plan participants by ensuring that\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   retirement benefits are fully protected\" and to avoid a legislative scheme where \"citizens concerned about protecting\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   retirement benefits have an incentive to relocate in a state that has adopted [a] more explicit statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The statute was notably amended again in 1994 to explicitly include IRAs. Aware that bankruptcy courts were construing the language of section 5205(c)(2) narrowly, the legislature amended the statute to protect only certain retirement accounts without mention of inherited IRAs. Such an omission has meaning, and the Court will not read into a statute what the legislature has intentionally left out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Against this legislative backdrop, it is even more clear that section 5205(c)(2) expands the trust exemption only to those judgment debtors that are expressly enumerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. The Inherited IRA is not \"Qualified\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With this legislative history in mind, even if the Debtor could avail herself of this statute, the inherited IRA is not \"qualified\" under section 408 of the tax code. The bankruptcy court thoroughly examined the attributes of inherited IRAs that make their inclusion inconsistent with the intent of the legislature:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The funds within inherited IRAs are traceable only to the descendants that\n   established the IRAs. Since inherited IRA holders cannot contribute to the accounts, inherited IRAs may not be used to actively save money for retirement. Moreover, the funds in inherited IRAs may be accessed at any time without penalty. Additionally ... inherited IRA holders are under an obligation to draw down their accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    In re Todd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511781\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/585/297/#p301\">\n    585 B.R. at 304-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As the bankruptcy court discussed, and as the Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Clark v.
