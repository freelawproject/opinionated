INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the Court is the objection (\"Objection,\" ECF No. 281) filed by the movant, Timothy G. Manners (\"Mr. Manners\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Proof of Claim No. 5-1 (\"Claim 5-1\") filed by Joseph McMahon (\"Mr. McMahon\"), and Mr. McMahon's motion to strike the Objection (\"Motion to Strike,\" ECF No. 385).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Objection, Mr. Manners\n   objects to Claim 5-1 on the basis that it is barred by res judicata, judicial estoppel, and Mr. McMahon's status as an independent contractor. In the Motion to Strike, Mr. McMahon argues that: (1) Mr. Manners and the Debtor, David X. Manners Company, Inc. (\"Debtor\"), acquiesced in the second suit, which would eliminate any res judicata defense, and (2) judicial estoppel does not apply. For the reasons stated below, the Objection is OVERRULED in part and the Court ABSTAINS in part and the Motion to Strike is DENIED as to Mr. McMahon's standing argument and DENIED as moot as to the remainder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II. JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and derives its authority to hear and determine this matter on reference from the District Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b)(1). This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   III. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court recites the following facts and procedural history, which are not in dispute:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. The Debtor filed a Chapter 11 Voluntary Petition on October 22, 2015 (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2. On January 27, 2016, the case was converted to a Chapter 7 case (ECF No. 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3. On March 4, 2016, Mr. McMahon filed proof of claim 4-1 (\"Claim 4-1\") in the amount of $ 249,533.62 on the basis of a jury verdict in the New York Supreme Court, Orange County, Index No. 4523/2012 (\"Suit 1\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   4. On April 21, 2016, Mr. McMahon filed Claim 5-1 in the amount of $ 298,587.74 on the basis of a suit pending in the New York Supreme Court, Orange County, Index No. 297/2015 (\"Suit 2\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   5. Mr. Manners, the Debtor's principal, filed a motion for leave to object to Claim 5-1 on October 20, 2017 (ECF No. 212). Mr. McMahon objected to that motion (ECF No. 213). The Court granted Mr. Manners derivative standing on February 13, 2018 (ECF No. 257), and, in a supplemental order dated February 23, 2018 (ECF No. 263), the Court explained that the grant of derivative standing was to allow Mr. Manners to first seek relief from the automatic stay to reduce the jury verdict in Suit 1 to a final judgment and then file an objection to Claim 5-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   6. Mr. Manners and the Chapter 7 Trustee, Richard M. Coan (\"Trustee\"), filed a joint motion for approval of stipulation for relief from the automatic stay to allow Mr. Manners to reduce the jury verdict in Suit 1 to judgment (ECF No. 269). Mr. McMahon objected, raising issues of standing, judicial estoppel, and equitable considerations (ECF No. 275).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   7. On March 27, 2018, Mr. Manners filed his objection to Claim 5-1, raising issues of res judicata, judicial estoppel, and Mr. McMahon's employment status (ECF No. 281).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   8. The Court granted the motion for relief from stay on April 26, 2018 (ECF No. 297). In its order, the Court noted that allowing formal judgment in Suit 1 to enter \"would allow the issues related to res judicata, collateral estoppel, the [\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   ] doctrine, and judicial estoppel\n   to be distinctively and properly briefed and tried in a contested hearing where the legal significance of the jury verdict and judgment in Suit 1 can be evaluated consistent with applicable law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   9. On May 5, 2018, Mr. McMahon appealed the Court's rulings on derivative standing and relief from stay to the District Court (ECF No. 306). The Court denied Mr. McMahon's motion to stay pending appeal (ECF No. 310) and request for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 313) on May 22, 2018 (ECF No. 327).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   10. On June 22, 2018, the District Court dismissed the appeal and remanded the case to this Court (ECF No. 359). In its ruling, the District Court held that Mr. McMahon lacked standing to appeal the grant of derivative standing and relief from stay (ECF No. 360).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   11. On June 28, 2018, the New York Supreme Court, Orange County entered final judgment in Suit 1 (ECF No. 380).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   12. Mr. McMahon filed the Motion to Strike on August 20, 2018, arguing that: (1) Mr. Manners lacks standing to contest Mr. McMahon's claims; (2) res judicata and collateral estoppel do not preempt Mr. McMahon's claims; and (3) Mr. Manners did not have permission from the Court to object to Claim 5-1 on the basis of judicial estoppel, which Mr. McMahon also argues is inapplicable (ECF No. 385).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   13. The Court heard oral arguments on October 11, 2018 (ECF No. 403). At the hearing, the Court took judicial notice of the proceedings in Suit 1 and Suit 2, to which no party objected (ECF No. 407). The Court then requested and received copies of the operative complaint and jury instructions from Suit 1 and the defendants' answer to the complaint in Suit 2 (ECF Nos. 407 and 410). Later, the Court requested and received copies of all motions, responses, and replies filed by the parties, along with any judicial rulings, orders, and decisions in Suit 2 that predated the commencement of this bankruptcy case (ECF Nos. 411, 413, 414, and 415).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   IV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A. Applicable Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Objections to Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A properly filed proof of claim is prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(f). Unless a party in interest objects, it is deemed allowed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). An objection must be lodged in accordance with Fed. R. Bank. P. 3007. The objecting party must \"produce evidence at least equal in probative force to that offered by the proof of claim and which, if believed, would refute at least one of the allegations that is essential to the claim's legal sufficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Driscoll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858145\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/379/415/#p420\">\n    379 B.R. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420 (Bankr. D. Conn. 2008) (citations omitted). \"If the objector produces sufficient evidence to negate one or more of the sworn facts in the proof of claim, the burden reverts to the claimant to prove the validity of the claim by a preponderance of the evidence. The burden of persuasion is always on the claimant.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Vanegas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9351711\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/290/190/#p193\">\n    290 B.R. 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193 (Bankr.

In order for a court to strike a defense as insufficient: (1) there must be no question of fact that might allow the defense to succeed; (2) there must be no substantial question of law that might allow the defense to succeed; and (3) the [respondent] must be prejudiced by the inclusion of the defense.... As the Second Circuit has noted [e]ven when a defense presents a purely legal question, the courts are very reluctant to determine disputed or substantial issues of law on a motion to strike; these questions quite properly are viewed as determinable only after discovery and a hearing on the merits. To do otherwise would be to run the risk of offering an advisory opinion on an abstract and hypothetical set of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143235\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/474/441/#p446\">\n    474 B.R. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446-47 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although motions to strike are viewed with disfavor, the Court's disposition of the Objection renders much of the Motion to Strike moot. The Court, therefore, need only address Mr. McMahon's standing argument, which is meritless. With that noted, the Court now addresses the parties' substantive arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B. Mr. Manners Has Standing to Object to Claim 5-1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. McMahon again challenges Mr. Manners's standing to object to Claim 5-1. As noted above in the factual recitation and footnote 1, the Court granted Mr. Manners derivative standing in order to object to Claim 5-1, among other things. Mr. McMahon appealed the Court's order granting derivative standing to the District Court, which dismissed Mr. McMahon's appeal, holding that Mr. McMahon lacks standing to contest this Court's order. Having taken his appeal no further, Mr. McMahon's lack of standing is now the law of the case, and this Court has no power to reject the express holding of an appellate court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ben Zvi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11124397\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/89/#p95\">\n    242 F.3d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"The mandate rule compels compliance on remand with the dictates of the superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.\" [citation, emphasis, and internal quotation marks omitted] ). Mr. McMahon's protestation that \"the issue simply has not been raised before\" (ECF No. 399) is both incorrect and irrelevant. Therefore, this Court must reject Mr. McMahon's argument that Mr. Manners does not have standing and DENY the Motion to Strike in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   C. Res Judicata Does Not Bar Claim 5-1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   There is no dispute that the pending lawsuit underlying Claim 5-1 is premised on the same core facts as the judgment underlying Claim 4-1. Mr. Manners argues that res judicata, therefore, bars Claim 5-1. The Court reluctantly finds, despite its concerns about judicial efficiency, that res judicata does not apply to Claim 5-1 in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Res Judicata Does Not Apply Facially\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Res judicata, or claim preclusion, provides that a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action. [T]he preclusive effect of a state court determination in a subsequent federal action is determined by the rules of the state where the prior action occurred ....

Claim 4-1, the suit of which has been reduced to judgment, was tried only as a breach of contract matter (ECF Nos. 213, Exs. 1 and 5; 410, Ex. A). Claim 5-1, which has remained pending since the implementation of the automatic stay, alleged that Mr. McMahon was an employee (ECF No. 213, Ex. 2). There is no dispute that the two suits concern the same series of connected transactions, albeit premised on alternative legal theories. It is also beyond dispute that there is a judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   underlying Claim 4-1. Further, Mr. McMahon is the plaintiff and the Debtor is the defendant in both suits. At first blush, then, it would appear that res judicata applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The problem, however, is that the Debtor did not raise res judicata as a defense until filing an objection to Mr. McMahon's motion for summary judgment in Suit 2 (ECF No. 395, Ex. A). In its answer to the complaint, neither res judicata nor prior pending action appear at all (ECF No. 410, Ex. C). Likewise, the Debtor did not file a motion to dismiss the action on the basis of either res judicata or prior pending action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, according to the CPLR,\n   the Debtor is deemed to have waived its res judicata defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Even If Res Judicata Applies Facially, the Debtor Acquiesced\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Assuming that res judicata does apply facially, Mr. McMahon has argued in his Motion to Strike that the Debtor and Mr. Manners acquiesced to the maintenance of Suit 2.

Therefore, the Court finds that Mr. McMahon has met his burden to prove acquiescence. Because res judicata does not apply to Claim 5-1, either facially or through the Debtor's acquiescence, the Court OVERRULES the Objection and DENIES the Motion to Strike as moot in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   D. Judicial Estoppel Does Not Bar Claim 5-1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mr. Manners also argues in the Objection that judicial estoppel bars Claim 5-1. Specifically, he contends that because Mr. McMahon claimed in Suit 1 that he was an independent contractor, he cannot assert in Suit 2 that he is an employee. Mr. McMahon argues in the Motion to Strike that the doctrine does not apply because the New York Supreme Court denied Mr. McMahon's eligibility for damages as an independent contractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees with Mr. McMahon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In New York, under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, \"a party who assumes a certain position in a prior legal proceeding and secures a favorable judgment therein is precluded from assuming a contrary position in another action simply because his or her interests have changed[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Brooke S.B. v.

The problem with Mr. Manners's argument is that the only count in the operative complaint of Suit 1 that was tried and went to the jury was a breach of contract claim (ECF Nos. 213, Exs. 1 and 5; 410, Ex. A). Mr. McMahon's count alleging that he was entitled to damages under Labor Law \u00a7 191-c was\n   <em>\n    dismissed\n   </em>\n   prior to trial commencing without any determination of its merits because the trial court found that that law only applies to independent contractors in manufacturing and the Debtor's business did not involve manufacturing (ECF No. 213, Ex. 5). There is nothing, then, in the breach of contract claim in Suit 1 that \"assumes a contrary position\" to the breach of employee contract claim in Suit 2 (ECF No. 213, Ex. 2). Mr. McMahon did not secure a favorable judgment on his independent contractor claim because it was not tried in Suit 1. Therefore, Mr. Manners's judicial estoppel argument must fail. Thus, the Court OVERRULES the Objection and DENIES the Motion to Strike as moot in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   E. The Court Abstains from Ruling on Mr. McMahon's Employment Status\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Mr. Manners argues in the Objection that, because Mr. McMahon was an independent contractor, not an employee, Claim 5-1 must be disallowed. That, however, is the entirety of Mr. Manners's argument in this regard. Mr. McMahon takes umbrage with Mr. Manners's assertion of this argument as improper in his Motion to Strike but does not actually address the argument. In his previously filed response to the Objection, however, Mr. McMahon asserted as a legal and factual matter than he was an employee of the Debtor (ECF No. 288). Neither party addressed the issue during oral argument, and no evidence was presented that would allow this Court to make a determination in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Given the nature of the shifting burden of proof in filing and objecting to proofs of claim and the contingent nature of Claim 5-1, the Court finds that it would work a miscarriage of justice to make any factual or legal determinations as to Mr. McMahon's employment status absent admissible evidence.

The list of factors the Court should consider includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (1) the effect of the efficient administration of the bankruptcy estate; (2) the extent to which issues of state law predominate; (3) the difficulty or unsettled nature of the applicable state law; (4) comity; (5) the degree of relatedness or remoteness of the proceeding to the main bankruptcy case; (6) the existence of the right to a jury trial; and (7) prejudice to the involuntarily removed defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5914618\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/534/465/#p477\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On balance, these factors favor abstention. The first factor does not weigh in favor either way because the issue of Mr. McMahon's employment status can be effectively litigated in either forum. The second, third, and fourth factors weigh heavily in favor of abstention because the question of employment status is one of New York state law and one that, as evidenced by the law, is a fact-intensive inquiry, which leads this Court to conclude that the New York courts are in a better position to decide the issue, especially in light of the fact that that issue should be the only unresolved question in Suit 2. The fifth factor seems to weigh against abstention because Mr. McMahon is the largest creditor of the estate but may have less significance pending the outcome of the adversary proceeding against Mr. Manners and others. The sixth factor weighs in favor of abstention because Mr. McMahon is entitled to a jury trial in New York in Suit 2. The final factor also weighs in favor of abstention because it would be more convenient for Mr. McMahon to litigate his employment claim in New York. Despite his apparently having moved to Ohio, his attorney is based in New York, as were the Debtor's attorneys in Suit 2. Therefore, the Court finds that, in the interests of justice and comity with state courts and law, abstention is proper regarding the issue of whether Mr. McMahon was an independent contractor or employee of the Debtor. The Court retains jurisdiction to decide whether Claim 5-1 is to be disallowed pending the outcome of Suit 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   V.

Mr. Manners argues that the Motion to Strike should be denied as procedurally improper because the Objection is a contested matter and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(c) does not incorporate Fed. R. Bank. P. 7012, which would be the vehicle to seek to dismiss or strike the Objection (ECF No. 394). Rule 9014(c), however, also allows the Court to incorporate procedural rules not listed. In the interests of justice and judicial economy, the Court will consider Mr. McMahon's motion in this contested matter and consider it as a motion to strike. In any regard, Mr. McMahon's arguments in his Motion to Strike largely mirror his arguments in his response to the Objection (ECF. No. 288). Additionally, given the Court's disposition of the Objection, the Court's decision to address the motion as a motion to strike is harmless.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Part III, \u00b6 11 of this opinion. There is apparently also an appeal pending in Suit 1, in which Mr. McMahon challenges the trial court's denial of his motion to amend his complaint to add a count alleging that he was an employee (ECF No. 213, Exs. 4 and 5). This attempted amendment would have added the same allegations underlying Suit 2 (ECF Nos. 89, Ex. 12; 213, Ex. 2). Mr. McMahon also moved to consolidate Suit 1 and Suit 2, to which the Debtor and Mr. Manners objected (ECF No. 213, Ex. 4). The New York Supreme Court denied the motion to consolidate (ECF No. 213, Ex. 4). Suit 1 and Suit 2 were both stayed by the commencement of this bankruptcy case. Although the Court granted relief from stay to allow for final judgment to enter in Suit 1, the stay was reimposed upon the entering of that judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    At this point, it is too late for the Debtor to assert that there is another action pending between the parties because Suit 1 has been reduced to final judgment.

Mr. McMahon did make a waiver argument, however, in his reply brief to the Debtor's response to his motion for summary judgment in Suit 2 (ECF No. 415, Ex. G), so the issue has been explicitly raised elsewhere. It must be noted that, in deciding the motion for summary judgment, the New York Supreme Court determined neither Mr. McMahon's employment status nor the propriety of res judicata (ECF No. 415, Ex. I).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Although Debtor's counsel engaged in no such colloquy with the New York Supreme Court, it is worth noting that, at the hearing when the trial court stated that she would deny consolidation of Suit 1 and Suit 2, she stated that Mr. McMahon's employment status was \"standing on its own[,]\" \"going to be done in another case[,]\" and that it would be \"deal[t] with\" in another case (ECF No. 213, Ex. 4).
