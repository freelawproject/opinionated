The U.S. Trustee and Select Portfolio Servicing Inc., as servicing agent for U.S. Bank NA, as trustee, for the Chase Mortgage Finance Corporation (\"U.S. Bank\") filed objections to the amended statement. A hearing on the matter was held on December 11, 2018. After reviewing the relevant Court dockets, the pleadings filed in this case and arguments of Counsel and the Debtor, the Court makes the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law sustaining the objections to the Amended Disclosure Statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Findings of Fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Debtor and Azra Yasmin, his wife, executed a promissory note dated July 10, 2006 in the original amount of $ 911,000.00.

Title to the property is vested in Furqan Mohammed, Azra Yasmin and Hasan Norman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Case No. 18-10785, Docket No. 29 (Motion for Relief) Part 2 (Loan Documents) at 1-2 and 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Debtor and Azra Yasmin filed Case No. 10-19040 requesting relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on October 26, 2010. Case No 10-19040 at Docket No. 1 (\"Petition\"). While the case was pending, U.S. Bank filed a motion for relief from the stay alleging that the post-petition arrears were $ 158,085.16I from January 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Docket Nos. 55 and 63.

Case No 16-13258 at Docket No. 1(\"Petition\"). The Debtor's plan proposed to pay $ 717.75 per month for 60 months for a total of $ 43,065.00. U.S. Bank objected to the plan alleging it failed to pay pre-petition mortgage arrears in excess of $ 300,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Docket 21. The Trustee filed a motion to dismiss the case for material default alleging the debtor had made only one plan payment in five months. The motion was subsequently amended to note that the Debtor was not eligible to be a debtor in Chapter 13 because his debts exceeded the limits described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Docket Nos. 22 and 25.

The motion alleged that the pre-petition arrears were $ 363,270.44, and that the case filing stayed a foreclosure scheduled for March 8, 2018. The motion also alleged the Debtor's previous bankruptcy was commenced two days before a scheduled foreclosure on the Debtor's residence and that the successive bankruptcy petitions were part of a scheme to delay, hinder or defraud the creditor in its attempts to foreclose on the property. In addition to relief from the stay, the creditor requested the imposition of an equitable servitude to prevent a stay in any future bankruptcy proceedings from affecting the property for a period of two years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his response to the motion for relief, the Debtor challenge the standing of U.S. Bank to file the pleading and allege that Hassan Norman was not a legal title holder to the property because he did not sign the Deed of Trust and that Mr. Norman's signature on the Deed of Trust was forged by U.S. Bank or its agents. The Debtor also alleged that the promissory note referenced above was unsecured due to Rescission and therefore, the Deed of Trust securing the promissory note was void under the Truth in Lending Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Docket No. 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtor failed to appear at the hearing on the motion for relief held on June 13, 2018. The Court, after reviewing the previous case filings, the pleadings in this case and the argument of counsel for U.S. Bank, found that the instant case was filed in bad faith based on the six-year default period and the Debtor's two latest bankruptcy petitions filed shortly before scheduled foreclosure sales. The Court entered an Order granting the motion for relief that included an equitable servitude on the property for a period of two years from the date of the entry of the Order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Docket 45.

First, the Debtor has failed to provide adequate information to creditors that would allow them to make informed decisions about whether to vote in favor of a plan. Second, the Statement fails to disclose the Debtor's prior bankruptcy cases. Third, the Statement fails to disclose a prior finding of bad faith in this case and that U.S. Bank has been granted\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   relief from the automatic stay. Fourth, the Debtor has failed to show that the plan is feasible.

When the Court granted U.S. Bank\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   relief from the stay, it declined to exercise its authority to dismiss the case in order to give Mr. Mohammad one last opportunity to propose a plan of reorganization. He was put on notice in the pleadings filed by the U.S. Trustee and U.S. Bank and at the hearing on his first Disclosure Statement that he needed to include information regarding his prior bankruptcies in an amended Statement; however, he chose not to do so. In short, his Amended Disclosure Statement contained the same deficiencies as the previous disclosure statement. Under these circumstances, the Court has no reason to believe that a second amended disclosure statement would be proposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Mohammad knew that he was responsible for showing how he could afford to pay for his plan. His attempt to meet that responsibility by filing the Affidavit of Contribution has fallen short. The Affidavit alone is insufficient evidence of the Debtor's ability to fund a feasible plan. No supporting documents were attached to the document to indicate the source of the funds of the family members and their expenses and liabilities that would take precedence over their proposed contributions. The Monthly Operating Reports filed by Mr. Mohammad in this case do not show a history of income contributions from his family members comparable to the contributions they propose to pay into the plan. None of the Debtor's family members appeared in this Court to testify to their ability to provide the Debtor with the income necessary to fund his plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Debtor has established a history of proposing plans that are only feasible with substantial financial contributions of family members; however, there is no evidence before the Court to demonstrate that the proposed contributions are sufficiently stable and regular to support a plan or that they would be likely to continue for the duration of a plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   U.S. Bank's objection to the Debtor's treatment of its claim is well founded. First, the Debtor proposes to cure the arrearages in the amount of $ 346,996.50 through the plan even though the stated arrears according to the Bank's allowed claim is $ 418,975.95. This alone makes the plan not feasible. Second, the Disclosure Statement describes a plan that would allow curing the mortgage deficiency over a period of no less than 179 months. The Court finds the length of time to cure is unreasonable and its proposal demonstrates an abuse of the bankruptcy process. The plan under review is nothing more than a visionary scheme unsupported by evidence of financial viability. Thus, the debtor has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence, that he can propose a feasible plan\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A court may deny approval of a disclosure statement, even if it is not by\n   itself deficient, if a debtor's plan has no hope of being confirmed.\n   <em>\n    In re Bermuda Bay, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 09-32133 and 09-32130,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205218071\">\n    2009 WL 5218071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr.E.D.Va.
