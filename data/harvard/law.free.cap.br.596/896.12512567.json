Rosania, Jr., United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   A priority for wages was included as part of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 upon its enactment and has been a feature of bankruptcy law since that time. The\n   purposes of allowing a priority claim for wages are to alleviate hardship on employees involved in a bankruptcy case and to encourage employees to stay with an employer in financial difficulty. The amount of the priority claim and the time-period to measure such claim have evolved and increased over time. Both the amount of the priority claim and the time-period are legislative decisions. Previously, the amount of the priority wage claim was $ 2,000 for wages earned within 90 days of the bankruptcy filing under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Presently, an employee may be paid up to $ 12,750 for wages earned within 180 days of the bankruptcy filing. This case involves the interpretation of the priority wage statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment filed by High Plains Computing, Inc. dba HPC Solutions (\"Debtor\") and employee-creditor, Dustin Greenberg (\"Greenberg\"). The issue presented is whether a commission owed to Greenberg by the Debtor was\n   <em>\n    earned\n   </em>\n   within the 180 days prior to the Debtor's bankruptcy filing, such that a portion of the commission is entitled to priority status under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). The Court has core jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and (B) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed. The Debtor is a Colorado corporation that offers a broad-based portfolio of services and solutions in information technology, unified communications, and professional services for governmental and healthcare industries. The Debtor works with manufacturers of software, cloud computing, collaboration, storage, and integration, and it provides developmental services, data management services, network engineering, and related services and support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From March 2013 to February 2017, Greenberg was employed by the Debtor in contract management and sales, earning salary and commissions. According to the Debtor's employee handbook, commissions are based on each employee's employment agreement. On May 18, 2016, Greenberg entered into a compensation agreement with the Debtor. The compensation agreement states that it takes precedence over the employment agreement where context requires but that the terms of the employment agreement otherwise apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the terms of the compensation agreement, Greenberg earned commissions as a percentage of gross sales on contracts that he assisted in procuring. The Debtor's employee handbook provides that commissions are \"paid once the [Debtor] is paid in full\" on a contract, and \"on the last payday of the month following the end of the quarter.\" The Debtor's compensation and incentive plan confirms that commissions are \"paid on the Quarter of receipt of payment\" on a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 10, 2016, the Debtor entered into a contract with the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") to provide hardware and services. Because Greenberg assisted in procuring the USDA contract, he was entitled to receive a commission on the contract once the USDA paid the Debtor in full. The USDA made payment in full on the contract on either November 26, 2016, or November 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Per the Debtor's employee\n   handbook, Greenberg should have received his commission for the USDA contract on the last payday in January 2017, which was January 27, 2017. The Debtor did not pay Greenberg his commission on said date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Greenberg voluntarily resigned his position with the Debtor on February 16, 2017. At the time of his resignation, the Debtor still had not paid Greenberg his commission for the USDA contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The State Court Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 11, 2017, Greenberg filed a complaint against the Debtor for breach of contract (i.e., the compensation agreement) in the District Court for the City and County of Denver, Case No. 2017-CV-31317 (the \"State Court Case\"). Through the State Court Case, Greenberg sought to recover $ 31,312.97 in unpaid wages, representing his commission for the USDA contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 10, 2017, the Debtor and Greenberg entered into an agreement to settle the State Court Case. Under the settlement agreement, the Debtor agreed to pay Greenberg $ 26,528.92. Specifically, the Debtor was to pay Greenberg $ 1,500 within seven days after execution of the settlement agreement, and $ 5,000 per month, commencing June 15, 2017, until the settlement amount was paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, the Debtor paid Greenberg $ 1,500 pursuant to the settlement agreement, reducing the total amount owed to $ 25,028.92. The Debtor made no further payments to Greenberg under the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Bankruptcy Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on May 23, 2017. The Debtor filed its original Schedule E/F on June 9, 2017, and amendments thereto on June 13, 2017; June 30, 2017; September 5, 2017; and September 15, 2017. On the original Schedule E/F and subsequent amendments, the Debtor listed a claim owed to Greenberg in the amount of $ 25,028.92, of which $ 12,850 was entitled to priority status under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). Greenberg's claim was not marked as disputed on any of the filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 21, 2017, Greenberg filed Proof of Claim No. 8-1, asserting a claim in the total amount of $ 26,528.92, of which $ 12,850 was entitled to priority status under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 23, 2018, the Debtor filed its Second Amended Plan of Reorganization (the \"Plan\"). Article V \u00a7 5.1 of the Plan provided that all allowed pre-petition wages and employee claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) would be paid in full upon confirmation. The Court entered an Order confirming the Plan on March 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Debtor did not pay any portion of Greenberg's claim upon confirmation of the Plan. Instead, on April 20, 2018, the Debtor objected to Greenberg's claim. Greenberg filed a response, and the parties subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment and respective responses thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties agree that the total amount of Greenberg's claim should be reduced from $ 26,528.92 to $ 25,028.92, because he previously received a payment of $ 1,500 under the settlement agreement. However, the Debtor disputes that any portion of Greenberg's claim is entitled to\n   priority status. Specifically, the Debtor argues that Greenberg earned his commission on the USDA contract when the Debtor and the USDA entered into the contract on November 10, 2016. Thus, the Debtor asserts that because Greenberg's commission was earned 194 days pre-petition, no portion of his claim is entitled to priority status under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Greenberg argues that his commission on the USDA contract was earned, not when the Debtor and the USDA entered into the contract, but when the USDA paid the Debtor in full on the contract on November 26, 2016. As a result, Greenberg contends that he earned the commission 178 days pre-petition, such that $ 12,850 of his claim is entitled to priority status under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The fact that the commission was not payable until a later date and was contingent upon a future event is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether Greenberg's claim is entitled to priority status under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). While the Court acknowledges the unfortunate result that Greenberg's commission was earned a mere 14 days before the priority period, it must guard against construing statutory priority too broadly and engaging in ad hoc judicial activism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re S.
