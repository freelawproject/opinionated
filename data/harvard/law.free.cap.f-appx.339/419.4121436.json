That order affirmed an immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) February 2007 denial of Petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">Having conceded removability as an \u201calien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled\u201d, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, Petitioner sought immigration relief based on his claimed persecution, by Chinese officials, for violating and resisting China\u2019s family-planning policy. The IJ denied relief, finding: Petitioner was not a credible witness; and, in the alternative, he could not establish eligibility for relief based on his girlfriend\u2019s forced abortion because such relief is limited to spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">The BIA agreed that Petitioner was not entitled to relief based on his girlfriend\u2019s abortion. It also noted that Petitioner may have been eligible for relief based on his own resistance to China\u2019s family-planning policies, but found that he had not met his burden of proving eligibility for such relief because he failed to provide credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-17\">Petitioner challenges the credibility determinations made by the IJ and the BIA, and contends he demonstrated eligibility for relief. Our court reviews the BIA\u2019s order and, additionally, the underlying IJ decision where, as in this instance, it had \u201csome impact on the BIA\u2019s decision\u201d. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cWe review factual findings of the BIA and IJ for substantial evidence, and questions of law <em>de novo </em>\u201d. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007). For substantial-evidence review, \u201cwe may reverse a decision on a factual finding only when the evidence <em>compels </em>us to do so\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Rjeversal is improper unless we decide not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence <em>compels </em>it\u201d, (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Petitioner was not entitled to relief based on his girlfriend\u2019s abortion because such relief is limited to spouses. <em>See Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 531, 532 (5th Cir.2004). Additionally, concerning his possibly being otherwise eligible for relief, the underlying credibility determinations are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d at 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Petitioner\u2019s testimony, regarding the age his girlfriend became pregnant, details concerning her abortion, and how and when he obtained documents filed in support of his application, was either: internally inconsistent; inconsistent with his written application; or inconsistent with other evidence. In sum, the evidence does not compel a conclusion that Petitioner\u2019s testimony was credible. <em>See Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir.2006). Along that line, the BIA\u2019s holding Petitioner failed to carry his burden of establishing eligibility for asylum, withholding of deportation, or relief under the CAT, is also supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
