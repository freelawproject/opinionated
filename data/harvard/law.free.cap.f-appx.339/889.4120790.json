He seeks review of the Bureau of Immigration Ap-. peals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) denial of his appeal of the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his Motion to Reopen. Petitioner had moved to reopen the IJ\u2019s final order of a grant of voluntary departure. Petitioner contends for and relies on ineffective assistance of counsel: he contends that his counsel coerced him into withdrawing his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s counsel denied these contentions in an affidavit, and the IJ found Petitioner not credible. Because Petitioner failed to establish that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness, the IJ and the BIA did not abuse their discretion in rejecting his Motion to Reopen. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">\u201cWe review the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). Motions to reopen ai-e disfavored, especially in <em>removal </em>proceedings, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">\u201cCongress has provided by statute under section 1229a(c)(6) of the INA that an alien has the option to file one motion to reopen a final administrative order of removal within 90 days of that order. One of the grounds an alien may claim in a motion to reopen is ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2005). This Court has decided that the BIA may require the alien to meet the following test to show ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-12\">A motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel\u2019s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1274.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In addition to complying with these procedural requirements, a petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cmust also show prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cPrejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Petitioner failed to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different if Petitioner\u2019s counsel had performed differently. Given our limited and deferential standard of review, we decide that the BIA and the IJ did not abuse their discretion in denying Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Reopen; and we affirm their decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
