In his petition for review, Zapata-Gomez argues that the BIA failed to sufficiently articulate its reasons for denying his motion. He further argues that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied his motion to the extent that he sought to reopen his asylum proceeding. Both arguments fail. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Zapata-Gomez argues that the BIA failed to sufficiently articulate its reasons for denying his motion. Procedurally, when the BIA has not made findings of fact or has not applied the law to those facts, appellate courts should remand to allow the BIA to make such determinations in the first instance. <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam) (\u201c[A] court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands.\u201d). Remanding a case is also appropriate when the BIA fails to give \u201creasoned consideration\u201d to all the evidence. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375, 1377 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">Substantively, \u201c[w]e review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Chacku v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted). \u201cA motion to reconsider a decision must be filed with the [BIA] within 30 days after the mailing of the [BIA] decision.... \u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). The motion \u201cshall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">Here, the BIA explained that it denied Zapata-Gomez\u2019s motion because the motion was untimely. The BIA mailed its decision on May 21, 2008, but it did not receive Zapata-Gomez\u2019s motion until three days after the June 20, 2008 deadline for filing a motion to reconsider. Because the motion was untimely, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">Finally, to the extent that Zapata-Gomez\u2019s motion includes a substantive challenge to the denial of reconsideration, it is still meritless. Zapata-Gomez failed to specify any errors of fact or law in the prior BIA decision. Thus, he has failed to establish any substantive error in the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">Zapata-Gomez argues that the BIA abused its discretion by not granting his motion to the extent that he sought to reopen his asylum proceeding and have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>new evidence considered. \u201c[W]e employ a very deferential abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the BIA\u2019s decision on a motion to reopen regardless of the underlying basis of the alien\u2019s request for relief.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1802 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted). One independent ground upon which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen is the \u201cfailure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable.... <em>\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Here, Zapata-Gomez\u2019s new evidence was previously available and not material. The police investigation exhibit that he had submitted to the immigration judge was not new. Zapata-Gomez also did not explain in his motion to the BIA why he could not have previously obtained his other exhibits. He even admitted that his new exhibits were \u201ctechnically available earlier.\u201d Thus, he fails to show that the new evidence was previously unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Zapata-Gomez also fails to show that the new evidence is material. Even liberally construed, the evidence showed only that his uncle was possibly fatally shot by an armed group. It did not connect the murder to FARC or otherwise help establish that Zapata-Gomez suffered persecution on a protected ground. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying his request to reopen the asylum proceedings and consider new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Because we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s final order denying Zapata-Gomez\u2019s motion to reconsider or reopen, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
