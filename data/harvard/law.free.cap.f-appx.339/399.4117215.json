Because each appeal presents the same issue, we ORDER case no. 08-11076, case no. 08-11078, and case no. 08-11079 consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-24\">In each case from which these consolidated appeals arose, the district court denied Bertram relief from his sentence, which he had sought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. The district court reasoned that \u00a7 3742 applies only on direct appeal, that each of Bertram\u2019s direct appeals had been dismissed years earlier, and that conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>quently the district court had no jurisdiction to grant relief under \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Bertram\u2019s briefs and IFP motions in this court do not address the question of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to review his sentence under \u00a7 3742. Accordingly, Bertram is deemed to have abandoned any challenge to the denial of his IFP motions and the dismissal of his claims. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, given that Bertram presents no other meritorious challenge and that \u201cit is apparent that [the appeals] would be meritless,\u201d dismissal is proper. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cThe provisions for modification of a sentence under \u00a7 3742 are available to a defendant only upon direct appeal of a sentence or conviction.\u201d); 5th Cir.
