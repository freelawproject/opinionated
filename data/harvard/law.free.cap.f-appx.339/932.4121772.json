The IJ found Vail credible, but that he had not established harm that rose to the level of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Further, the IJ found that because Vail did not meet his burden of proof for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the higher burden for withholding of removal, and was also ineligible for CAT relief. The BIA dismissed Vail\u2019s appeal, agreeing with the IJ that Vail\u2019s credible account of threats from gang members who were trying to recruit him, without physical or other harm, did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA further noted that resistance to gang recruitment is not a basis for asylum, and that Vail failed to offer any other challenge to the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">On appeal, Vail argues for the first time that he was persecuted based on his membership in the particular social <em>group </em>of the Mayan Indians. He contends that he and his family were threatened because they are Mayan, and argues that the IJ failed to take into account the cumulative effect of the multiple harms he suffered at the hands of the Maras.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). Because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions were based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1029 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-9\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); Al <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) and (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The BIA has held that a \u201cparticular social group\u201d refers to persons who \u201cshare a common, immutable characteristic ... such as sex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances ... a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.\u201d <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439, 447 (BIA 1987). Furthermore, the group must have sufficient \u201csocial visibility,\u201d and persecution based on membership in a particular social group should not be defined so broadly that it becomes \u201ca catch-all for all groups who might claim persecution.... \u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196-98 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Matter of E-A-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 591, 594-95 (BIA 2007) (holding that \u201c[p]ersons who resist joining gangs have not been shown to be part of a socially visible group within Honduran society.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Furthermore, \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, [while] ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quotations and alteration omitted). In determining whether an alien has suffered past persecution, the fact-finder must consider the cumulative effects of any alleged incidents. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861-62 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must show that there is a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of suffering persecution if he returns to his home country. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). The fear of persecution must be \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d and \u201c[i]n most cases, the objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The alien must show a nexus between a statutorily protected ground and the feared persecution, and he can do so by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">However, the alien does not need to prove that he would be \u201csingled out\u201d for persecution if (1) there is a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution against similarly situated individuals and (2) his or her inclusion within that group of individuals makes fear of persecution reasonable. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). Once an applicant makes an initial showing of fear of future persecution, the government may rebut his evidence by \u201cdemonstrating, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating within the country if, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Because Vail raises for the first time on appeal that he was persecuted because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>is Mayan, we lack jurisdiction to consider that argument. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (stating that the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional, such that we lack jurisdiction to consider an alien\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination that was not raised before the BIA). Further, Vail failed to raise any argument in his brief about the denial of CAT relief and thus has abandoned that issue. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">As for Vail\u2019s argument that the IJ failed to consider the cumulative effect of the multiple harms he suffered at the hands of the Maras, the record shows that Vail has failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor. First, Vail does not identify the particular social group to which he allegedly belongs; we agree with the IJ that if the group is young men in Guatemala who have been threatened with harm due to their refusal to join a gang, the group fails to meet the definition of a particular social group as defined under the INA. <em>See Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1196-98; <em>Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 233. This group is overly broad, Vail presented no evidence of its social visibility, and the group\u2019s defining attribute would be its persecution by gangs. <em>See id. </em>Further, the BIA has held that persons who resist gang membership do not constitute a \u201csocially visible group.\u201d <em>E-A-G- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 594-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Yet even if Vail had established membership in a statutorily protected group, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that Vail failed to show past persecution. Vail\u2019s allegations of persecution rest on two visits to his house by members of the Maras, who threatened to kill him if he refused to join the gang or went to the police. Under our case law, this conduct does not compel the conclusion that Vail suffered past persecution, particularly in light of his testimony that he suffered no physical harm. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The record also supports the finding that Vail failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution and that such fear was reasonable. Again, the only basis for his claim of fear of future persecution were two threats by the Maras. Vail failed to present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he ... will be singled out for persecution on account of\u2019 a statutorily listed factor. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286; <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotation omitted). Moreover, because Vail failed to establish eligibility for asylum, his withholding of removal claim necessarily fails. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33 (a petitioner must demonstrate that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be persecuted if he were to return to his country of origin, a more stringent standard than required for asylum eligibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Thus, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determination that Vail has not shown past persecution on account of a protected ground or a reasonable fear of future persecution if he were to return to Guatemala. Thus, he is ineligible for asylum and necessarily cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. Accordingly, we deny Vail\u2019s petition as to asylum and withholding of removal, and dismiss his petition as to CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
