No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Nodd originally was assigned a base offense level of 40, based on her possession of 8 kilograms of crack cocaine. Her guidelines range was life imprisonment. But the district court departed downwardly and imposed a 360-month sentence because Nodd was not as culpable as leaders of the conspiracy who had received life sentences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Nodd filed her first section 3582(c)(2) motion pursuant to Amendment 505 to the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court acknowledged that Amendment 505 reduced the maximum base offense level in crack cocaine cases to 38 and noted that, with a base offense level of 38, Nodd\u2019s guidelines range would be 324 to 405 months. But the court denied the motion, concluding that a sentence reduction was inappropriate in Nodd\u2019s case because her original sentence represented a substantial departure, both from her original guidelines range and the range calculated under Amendment 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">In the instant section 3582(c)(2) motion, Nodd sought a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706, which changed the threshold drug quantity for a base offense level of 38 from 1.5 to 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. She argued that both Amendments 505 and 706 reduced the maximum base offense level for crack cocaine offenses to 38; so, because her offense level remained at 40, she was entitled to have her base offense level reduced to 38. The district court concluded that Amendment 706 did not apply to Nodd because she had been held accountable for 8 kilograms of crack cocaine, and, thus, the amendment did not lower her guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and questions of statutory interpretation in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, MeFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). On appeal, Nodd repeats her argument that she is entitled to have her base offense level reduced to 38 pursuant to Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-17\">When a sentencing guideline is amended and given retroactive effect, the district court, \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,\u201d may reduce a previous sentence under the amendment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>plicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under section 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">After Amendment 706, the maximum base offense level of 38 in crack cocaine eases corresponds to 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine instead of 1.5 kilograms or more. So, because Nodd was held accountable for 8 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering her guidelines range and the district court committed no error in denying her section 3582(c)(2) motion. The applicability of Amendment 706 is driven by drug quantity; the amendment was designed to lower the base offense levels only of those defendants attributed with less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009) (explaining that \u201ca base offense level of 38 still applies to defendants responsible for 4.5 kilograms or more\u201d of crack cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Nodd takes issue with her base offense level of 40. But Amendment 505, not Amendment 706, gave Nodd the opportunity to have her base offense level reduced to the current cap of 38. Contrary to Nodd\u2019s assertion, Amendment 706 did not affect the base offense level cap of 38 established by Amendment 505; the cap of 38 remained unchanged after Amendment 706. That the district court, in its discretion, chose not to reduce Nodd\u2019s sentence under Amendment 505 is unimportant to the resolution of the present appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">Nodd also argues that her original sentence incorrectly was calculated because the district court applied the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing instead of when sh\u00a1e committed the offense. She characterizes this as an <em>ex post facto </em>violation that this .Court now can correct to prevent manifest injustice. But Nodd\u2019s challenges to the original calculation of her sentence are beyond the scope of a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding, and we need not address them. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings under this statute to cases where a retroactive amendment affects the applicable guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-10\">. On Nodd\u2019s direct appeal, we remanded her case to the district court for resentencing so that the court could make specific findings about the scope of her participation in the conspiracy and the quantity of drugs attributable to her. On remand, the district court again imposed a 360-month sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b995-18\">. Amendment 505, which became effective after Nodd was sentenced and is retroactively applicable, reduced the upper limits of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 drug quantity table and capped the base offense level at 38 for a defendant who is accountable for 1.5 kilograms or more of cocaine base. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 505.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b996-7\">. In the prior section 3582(c)(2) proceedings, the court did not explicitly change Nodd's base offense level; but the court did acknowledge that Nodd's base offense level would be 38 under the amended guideline.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
