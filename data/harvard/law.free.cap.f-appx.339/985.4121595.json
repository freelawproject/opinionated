Gutzmore\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">On appeal, Gutzmore argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 706 lowered his base offense level from 38 to 36. He argues that the district court\u2019s original sentencing determinations regarding the drug quantity attributed to him cannot stand in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Gutzmore argues that his sentence is disparate with similarly situated individuals that were sentenced after <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct, 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Finally, he argues that the U.S. Sentencing Commission exceeded its delegated authority because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)\u2019s prohibition against a reduction below the amended guideline range violates <em>Booker </em>now that the guidelines are advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>ments, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state a reduction of a term of imprisonment is not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Here, Amendment 706 would reduce Gutzmore\u2019s base offense level to 36. However, all other sentencing determinations remain unchanged. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, with the exception of the amended guideline range, \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged\u201d). Therefore, after reinstating the original enhancements that total 4 levels, Gutzmore would have a total offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of III, and his applicable guideline range remains unchanged. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (table) (providing a sentencing range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment for a defendant with a criminal history category of III and an offense level of 40 to 43). Therefore, the district court properly determined that it was not authorized to reduce Gutzmore\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (stating that a reduction of a term of imprisonment is not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range). Finally, Gutzmore\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument is foreclosed by precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">.
