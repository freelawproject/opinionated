For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-15\">In 1997, a jury found Benton guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), and three counts of possession with intent to distribute a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">The probation officer prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and determined that Benton was responsible for 197.87 grams of crack cocaine and 221.3 grams of powder cocaine, which, after being converted into their marijuana equivalent, gave Benton a base offense level of 34 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The probation officer applied a two-level enhancement for the possession of a dangerous weapon under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), giving Benton an adjusted offense level of 36. However, the probation officer determined that Benton was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and, because the statutory maximum penalty for the offense was life imprisonment, Benton received a new, superseding offense level of 37, pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A). Benton\u2019s status as a career offender also gave him a criminal history category of VI, which, combined with his offense level of 37, produced an applicable guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-17\">The district court adopted the factual findings and guideline calculations contained in the PSI and sentenced Benton to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. The judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>specifically provided that Benton was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. We subsequently granted Benton\u2019s motion to voluntarily dismiss his direct appeal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">In 2007, the government filed a motion to reduce Benton\u2019s sentence based on his substantial assistance, pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b). The court held a hearing on the motion, where the government requested a 33% reduction and defense counsel requested a 50% reduction. The district court ultimately ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-6\">I have to say that, under the circumstances ... it doesn\u2019t seem to me that the Government\u2019s recommendation is an unreasonable recommendation. It would work out, though, still to a very lengthy sentence, right? It would take you to 240 months instead of 360, right? That\u2019s what it works out to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-7\">I\u2019ll give you a little extra consideration. But I just can\u2019t justify doing more. So I\u2019m going to reduce your sentence\u2014 instead of 240, I\u2019m going to take another 36 months off and make it to 204 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The district court did not otherwise explain why it selected that particular sentence, and, in its written order, it clarified that \u201call other terms and conditions of the Judgment and Commitment Order shall remain in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">In May 2008, and relying on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, Benton filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for a reduced sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A federal public defender was appointed and filed a memorandum in support of the motion. Relying on our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert.denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), counsel argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that Benton was eligible for a sentencing reduction because, in reducing his sentence under Rule 35, the district court relied \u201con non-career-offender guideline analyses.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">The district court denied Benton\u2019s motion on the ground that Benton was sentenced as a career offender and, therefore, Amendment 706 would not reduce his applicable guideline range. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">Construing this language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we held in <em>Moore </em>that certain defendants who were sentenced as career offenders were ineligible for a sentencing reduction under Amendment 706 because that amendment would not reduce their applicable guideline ranges. 541 F.3d at 1330 (\u201c[Ajlthough Amendment 706 would reduce the base offense levels applicable to the defendants, it would not affect their guideline ranges because they were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (providing for superseding offense levels based on the statutory maximum penalty where those levels are \u201cgreater than the offense level otherwise applicable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-18\">Although Benton was originally sentenced as a career offender, he contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>that the above holding of <em>Moore </em>is inapplicable because, in granting him a Rule 35 reduction, the district court relied on \u201cnon-career-offender considerations.\u201d In <em>Moore, </em>we addressed a similar argument advanced by two career offenders who received downward departures at sentencing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. 541 F.3d at 1329-30. We rejected their argument on the ground that there was no indication that the district court based its sentences \u201con the guideline range[s] that would have applied absent the- career offender designation.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. As a result, Amendment 706 did not affect the guideline ranges upon which the defendants\u2019 sentences were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Similarly, in this case, there is nothing in the record to support Benton\u2019s assertion that the district court, in reducing his sentence under Rule 35, based its sentence on the guideline range that would have applied had Benton not been sentenced as a career offender. Indeed, in its written order granting Benton a Rule 35 reduction, the district court clarified that all of the terms and conditions from the original judgment of conviction \u2014 which specifically referenced Benton\u2019s career-offender status \u2014 were to remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Thus, like the defendants in <em>Moore, </em>Benton was not eligible for a sentencing reduction because Amendment 706 would not affect the guideline range upon which his original sentence or Rule 35 sentence was based. We also note that any inaccuracies contained in the district court\u2019s order are inconsequential, as the court clearly and correctly denied Benton\u2019s motion on the ground that he was sentenced as a career offender. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
