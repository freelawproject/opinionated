The sentence was imposed following this court\u2019s order granting the Government\u2019s motion to remand for resentencing. The 120-month sentence represented both an upward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines and an upward variance from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the Guidelines sentencing range. The district court based the sentence primarily on Menzies\u2019s extensive and violent criminal history and his repetitive and illegal association with firearms. Menzies challenges the sentence as substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Although \u201ca district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range[,]\u201d the court \u201cmay not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Instead, the court must \u201cmake an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. The district court thus did not err by disregarding the sentencing range set forth in the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The district court also did not err by relying upon factors it considered under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 in order to impose a non-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2008). The court was free to conclude that the applicable Guidelines range gave too little weight to Menzies\u2019s extremely violent history and the need for its sentence to provide just punishment and protect the public. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Given that Menzies\u2019s criminal conduct was more akin to a Category V or VI offender rather than a Category I offender, the district court also had a \u201csignificant justification\u201d for its chosen sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Finally, we perceive no error in the district court\u2019s finding that Menzies had a longstanding, repetitive, and illegal association with firearms. Such finding was amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
