As part of the plea agreement, Merrifield waived the right to appeal any issue, except issues related to the application of the Sentencing Guidelines or the basis of an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-26\">Merrifield filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel at both trial and on appeal. The district court found that the ineffective assistance claims were barred by the appeal waiver. Merrifield requested a certificate of appealability, but did not address the district court\u2019s determination that his ineffective assistance of counsel claims were barred by the appeal waiver. This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>granted Merrifield\u2019s COA with respect to (1) whether this court should take cognizance of the unraised issue of whether the district court erred in finding that Merri-field\u2019s ineffective assistance claims were barred by the appeal waiver in Merri-field\u2019s plea agreement; and (2) if this court takes cognizance of the unraised issue, whether the district court erred in its procedural ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Government concedes that this Court has discretion to consider whether the district court erred in finding that Merrifield\u2019s ineffective assistance claims were barred by the appeal waiver despite Merrifield not raising the issue in his <em>pro se </em>request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In light of the Government\u2019s concession, we exercise our discretion to address the issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appeal waiver was silent as to Merrifield\u2019s right to collaterally challenge his conviction and sentence under \u00a7 2255. The district court erred in finding that the waiver barred review of Merrifield\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims brought through a \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of Merrifield\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion in part and REMAND for the consideration of Merri-field\u2019s ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
