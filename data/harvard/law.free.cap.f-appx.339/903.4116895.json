Subsequent to dismissing Rodriguez\u2019s claim, the district court ordered the vessel forfeited to the United States Government, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(b), because twenty-two undocumented aliens were discovered on-board the vessel when it was intercepted by the United States Coast Guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-23\">The district court dismissed Rodriguez\u2019s claim because he failed to timely comply with a court order compelling the production of discovery. On appeal, Rodriguez argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his claim because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>his failure to comply with the court order was the result of a misunderstanding, rather than the result of willfulness or bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">We review sanctions imposed by the district court under Rule 37(b) for an abuse of discretion and to determine that the district court\u2019s factual findings are fully supported by the record. <em>Serra Chevrolet, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., </em>446 F.3d 1137, 1146-47 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A district court\u2019s finding that a party\u2019s failure to comply with a discovery order was willful is reviewed for clear error. <em>See Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., </em>987 F.2d 1536, 1542-43 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">If a party does not comply with a court order to produce discovery, a court may issue further orders that are just, including dismissing the action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A). We have held that Rule 37(b) only permits the dismissal of an action if a party willfully or in bad faith failed to obey a discovery order. <em>Malautea, </em>987 F.2d at 1542 (citation omitted). A dismissal is not justified under Rule 37(b) if a party\u2019s failure to comply with a discovery order was caused by simple negligence or a misunderstanding of the court order. <em>See EEOC v. Troy State Univ., </em>693 F.2d 1353, 1357 (11th Cir.1982) (citation omitted). If the party does not provide a credible explanation of how he interpreted an order compelling discovery in a way that excluded certain documents from the scope of the order, the party\u2019s unsupported assertion that it misunderstood the order is insufficient, and it is not clear error for the district court to find that the party\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery order was willful and in bad faith. <em>Malautea, </em>987 F.2d at 1543. Further, when a party claims that he was unable to produce documents in the time allowed by the court, but he does not produce any evidence to support the argument, a district court\u2019s finding of willfulness is not clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">\u201cRule 37 sanctions are intended to prevent unfair prejudice to the litigants and insure the integrity of the discovery process.\u201d <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019n, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam). \u201c[T]he severe sanction of a dismissal or default judgment is appropriate only as a last resort, when less drastic sanctions would not ensure compliance with the court\u2019s orders.\u201d <em>Malautea, </em>987 F.2d at 1542. A district court is not required to first impose lesser sanctions if the lesser sanction would be ineffective. <em>Id. </em>at 1544. A district court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a claim under Rule 37(b) if it finds that a party willfully failed to comply with the opposing party\u2019s discovery request, even if we would have imposed a lesser sanction. <em>OFS Fitel, LLC v. Epstein, Becker &amp; Green, P.C., </em>549 F.3d 1344, 1367 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Here, Rodriguez has neither alleged nor provided a credible explanation as to how he interpreted the district court\u2019s discovery order in a manner that would have permitted him to provide discovery after September 17th. Additionally, although Rodriguez asserts that he was unable to timely produce the documents, due to the quantity of documents requested, he did not produce any evidence to support his argument. Therefore, because Rodriguez has neither provided a credible explanation of his alleged misunderstanding of the court\u2019s order nor produced evidence demonstrating that he could not have timely produced the documents, the district court did not clearly err by finding that Rodriguez\u2019s failure to provide all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>the requested documents by September 17th was willful and in bad faith. <em>Malau-tea, </em>987 F.2d at 1542-43. Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Rodriguez\u2019s claim, as the district court (1) entered an order compelling Rodriguez to produce all discovery by September 17th; (2) found that Rodriguez willfully failed to comply with the order; (3) found that the government was prejudiced by Rodriguez\u2019s willful failure to comply; and, (4) was not required to first apply lesser sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Rodriguez\u2019s claim to the vessel. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
