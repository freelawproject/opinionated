There is no dispute that the first discrimination charge was filed with the Broward County Civil Rights Division and that this charge was \u201cdual-filed\u201d with the local office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on that date, and that notice of the filing, along with a copy of the actual discrimination charges, was sent to plaintiffs prior to the effective date of the policy. The district court correctly concluded that this notice to plaintiffs of the claim against them satisfied the policy language excluding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>claim. Therefore, this claim was not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The district court\u2019s finding that the second and third charges were \u201cinterrelated\u201d with the initial claim because they were related to the same incident is not erroneous. The district court correctly concluded that these claims are not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Finally, the district court did not err in finding that the fourth claim, based upon different incidents and different time-frames, is unrelated to the initial charge. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that this claim is covered by the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\">.
