After reviewing her allegations, the district court set a deadline for Monardes to show cause why her claims should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The show cause deadline was extended when Monardes informed the court that she was in the process of obtaining counsel; the court cautioned that it would not grant any further extensions. On the reset deadline date, Monardes moved for a second continuance. The district court denied the motion. Subsequently, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>reviewed Monardes\u2019s claims and found no allegations of citizenship upon which it could properly exercise diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). It further noted Monardes\u2019s failure to satisfy the previous show cause order. Accordingly, the court dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Monardes timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Acsg\">\u201cWhen addressing a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we review application of law de novo and disputed factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Branch Consultants v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>560 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cA district court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous only if, after reviewing the record, this Court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The district court based its dismissal on Monardes\u2019s failure to allege the citizenship of any of the parties. Instead, Monardes alleged that she was a \u201cresident of the State of New Mexico\u201d and that \u201cAyub ... is a resident of El Paso, Texas and [Sotelo] is a resident of Mexico and El Paso, Texas.\u201d The district court found these allegations of the defendants\u2019 residency insufficient to establish diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">\u201cFor purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the domicile of the parties, as opposed to their residence, is the key.\u201d <em>Combee v. Shell Oil Co., </em>615 F.2d 698, 700 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see also Preston v. Tenet Healthsystem, Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>485 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cA party\u2019s residence in a state alone does not establish domicile.\u201d). An allegation of residency is not sufficient for diversity jurisdiction purposes; instead, a plaintiff must allege citizenship to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1332(a). <em>See Nadler v. Am. Motors Sales Corp., </em>764 F.2d 409, 413 (5th Cir.1985). Because Monardes failed to allege or,otherwise establish the citizenship of the defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of diversity jurisdiction was proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">. In her brief, Monardes argues that she unsuccessfully sought the defendants' answers to interrogatories which would have established their Mexican citizenship. Monardes further claims that she was prepared to produce witnesses at a docket call hearing who would have testified to the defendants' citizenship, but that the case was dismissed prior to that hearing. However, the show cause order, which Monardes did not satisfy, clearly indicated that a failure to comply would result in a dismissal of the case. Monardes was, therefore, on notice before the scheduled hearing that her case was subject to dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-14\">. To the extent Monardes presents other assertions and arguments in her brief, they do not address whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction. The court therefore need not consider those claims in resolving this appeal. <em>See Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (\"Although we liberal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ly construe briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants and apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel, <em>pro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
