That sentence is above the guideline-sentencing range of 24 to 30 months provided by the November 2007 Sentencing Guidelines. Had Holmes been sentenced when originally scheduled, in September 2007, the then-applicable 2006 Sentencing Guidelines (and their rules for counting prior sentences) would have provided for career-offender sentencing and a guideline-sentencing range of 151 to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United </em>States, 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for a guidelines issue preserved in district court, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">The district court\u2019s imposing the above-the-range sentence was based primarily on the seriousness of Holmes\u2019 violent criminal history and its being under-represented. This under-representation resulted from counting Holmes\u2019 purse-snatching, attempted-armed-robbery, and two armed-robbery convictions as a single sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). The number and character of the past offenses speaks to \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d, and is a factor relevant under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (providing factors to be considered in imposing a sentence); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n. 3 (addressing increased sentences for multiple prior sentences counted as a single sentence); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 363 (5th Cir.2009). In the light of the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) criminal-history assessment, its imposing an above-guideline sentence based upon these prior convictions was not an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Lopez-Salas, </em>513 F.3d 174, 181 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">The district court also found that Holmes attempted to interfere with a witness\u2019 participation in another federal prosecution by attempting to stab that witness. Because the district court\u2019s finding was based on a credibility determination after a hearing, \u201cwe will not substitute our read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ing of the evidence for that of the district court\u201d. <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>881 F.2d 1305, 1310 (5th Cir.1989). The threat, whether or not carried out, was a manifestation of Holmes\u2019 character and, obviously, a relevant sentencing factor. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In addition, the district court found that Holmes used questionable practices to delay sentencing until the more-favorable 2007 Guidelines took effect. Among other things, Holmes had moved just before the scheduled September 2007 sentencing for it to be re-set after 1 November in order to obtain the benefit of the relevant amendment. As another example, on the day before the 2007 Guidelines took effect, Holmes\u2019 lawyer appeared with Holmes at the scheduled sentencing hearing and announced that Holmes had fired him a month prior to the hearing. After questioning Holmes and the lawyer, the district court concluded that the story \u201cjust didn\u2019t smell good\u201d. Again, our court will not disturb the district court\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Nixon, </em>881 F.2d at 1310. Moreover, the district court plainly stated that the manipulation of the process did not \u201cweigh heavily in [its] decision\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The district court thoroughly considered the Sentencing Guidelines, analyzed and applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and explained its reasoning, in accordance with <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. 586 at 597-98. The extent of the increase was not substantively unreasonable. <em>See id.; United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492 &amp; n. 40 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In challenging the district court\u2019s reasons for the increase, Holmes essentially asks our court to substitute his assessment of the evidence and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors for that of the district court. Needless to say, this approach is contrary to the deferential, abuse-of-diseretion review dictated by <em>Gall. See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
