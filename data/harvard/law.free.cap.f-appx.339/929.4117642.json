Brunette had been charged with removability based on a Florida conviction for possession of cocaine, and the BIA found that Brunette was ineligible for cancellation of removal based on his 1984 Canadian conviction for possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. On appeal, Brunette argues that: (1) we have jurisdiction over his petition for review because he is raising a question of law regarding the interpretation of \u00a7 4(3) of the Canadian Narcotics Control Act; and (2) the BIA erred by finding that his admission was unlawful without analyzing the elements of the Canadian statute that he was convicted of violating. After careful review, we dismiss the petition in part, and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-17\">We review whether we have subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c/D/e <em>novo </em>review of the BIA\u2019s interpretation <em>[of </em>the statutes it administers] is informed by the principle of deference articulated in <em>Chevron, U.S.A, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see Quinchia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2008) (holding <em>Chevron </em>deference is required for a precedential three-member decision of the BIA but is not appropriate for a non-prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>dential single-member decision that does not rely on existing BIA or federal court precedent). We review only the BIA\u2019s decision unless the BIA expressly adopts the immigration judge\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1312 (11th Cir.2006). The BIA did not expressly adopt the immigration judge\u2019s decision, so we review only the BIA\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Turning to the jurisdictional question first, we agree with Brunette that we have jurisdiction to review the purely legal question that Brunette raised regarding his eligibility for cancellation of removal. We recognize that we generally do not have jurisdiction to review \u201cany ... decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security-\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Moreover, \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Notwithstanding limitations on jurisdiction contained in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)-(C), we are not precluded from reviewing constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Savoury, </em>449 F.3d at 1311-12 (holding that we have jurisdiction to review an alien\u2019s legal eligibility for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Applying the case law here, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review the legal question of Brunette\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Savoury, </em>449 F.3d at 1311-12. Because Brunette is not seeking review of the denial of discretionary relief by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security or review of his removability based on his criminal conviction, the statute does not affect our jurisdiction to review Brunette\u2019s legal challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Turning to the merits, we are unpersuaded by Brunette\u2019s claim that the BIA erred by finding him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. An alien is deported if he is convicted of a controlled substance offense. 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). However, the Attorney General may cancel removal if an alien:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-11\">(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5 years,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-12\">(2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-13\">(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229b(a). In 1988, an alien who had \u201cbeen convicted of a violation of ... any law or regulation of ... a foreign country relating to a controlled substance\u201d was inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(23)(A) (1988). The fact that immigration officials erroneously admitted an alien who was legally inadmissible does not render the alien lawfully admitted. <em>Savoury, </em>449 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">If a criminal statute covers some conduct that constitutes an immigration bar and some that does not, the statute is divisible. <em>Jaggemauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir.2005). When the statute is divisible, \u201cthe fact of conviction and the statutory language alone are insufficient to establish\u201d what conduct an alien was convicted of committing. <em>Id. </em>at 1355. In those circumstances, the BIA is \u201cpermitted to look to the record of convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>tion to determine whether\u201d the alien has committed an immigration violation. <em>Id. </em>In the absence of appropriate findings based on the underlying facts of conviction,' the government must show that the full range of conduct covered by the pertinent statute falls within the relevant description. Ba<em>har v. Ashcroft, </em>264 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Under Canadian law, to possess \u201cany narcotic for the purpose of trafficking\u2019\u2019 is a crime punishable by life imprisonment. R.S.C.1985, c. N-l \u00a7 4(2) \u2014 (3). Trafficking is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-5\">(a) to manufacture, sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-6\">(b) to offer to do anything referred to in paragraph (a)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(23)(A) (1988), a Canadian drug conviction may render an alien inadmissible. <em>Mullen-Co-fee v. I.N.S., </em>976 F.2d 1375, 1379 (11th Cir.1992). We lack jurisdiction over issues that an alien did not exhaust by arguing them to the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Because Brunette\u2019s Canadian conviction rendered him inadmissible, his admission was unlawful. <em>Savoury, </em>449 F.3d at 1313. The BIA correctly concluded that Brunette\u2019s unlawful admission showed that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he did not have the required five-year period of <em>lawful </em>permanent residence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As for Brunette\u2019s suggestion that the government has not shown he was removable, we lack jurisdiction over the issue because he did not exhaust it before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. Accordingly, Brunette\u2019s petition for review is dismissed in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-21\">. To the extent that Brunette argues that the prior conviction was waivable, the BIA did not commit an error of law by finding that his Canadian conviction, with a statutory maximum of life imprisonment, was a drug trafficking offense. Moreover, Brunette's claim that the BIA erred by failing to conduct divisibility analysis is without merit. When Brunette entered, immigration law rendered inadmissible all aliens who had foreign controlled-substance convictions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(23)(A) (1988). Even assuming that Brunette's conviction was not a trafficking offense, his conviction was \"relat[ed] to a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id.; see Mullen-Cofee, </em>976 F.2d at 1379.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
