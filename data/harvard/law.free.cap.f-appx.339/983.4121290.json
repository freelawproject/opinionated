Paquin appeals his 37-month sentence following his guilty plea to one count of knowingly possessing images of child pornography that have been transported in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Pacquin argues that the sentencing enhancement, which applies to offenders found to possess \u201cat least 10 images, but fewer than 150,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(A), should not have been applied, given his belief that he had taken reasonable steps to delete all but one child pornographic image from his computer prior to law enforcement involvement. After reviewing the relevant statutes, the record, and the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">Pacquin purchased memberships to several child pornography websites from which he admitted purchasing and downloading child pornography on four occasions. However, after Paquin\u2019s wife found child pornography on one of his floppy disks, which she destroyed, and on one of his computers, he attempted to delete the images from his computers. Several months thereafter, law enforcement authorities investigating child pornography websites obtained Pacquin\u2019s personal information and visited Pacquin\u2019s home. After receiving his consent, they searched his computers which turned up 132 images of child pornography in the unallocated file space. A search of a separate hard drive revealed one image of child pornography that had not been deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>Paequin pled guilty to one count of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment, followed by a 40-year period of supervised release. Paequin only disputes the two-level enhancement applied to his sentence, arguing that only one image should have been considered in calculating the applicable guideline range, as he had done everything short of physically destroying his computer to dispose of the other 132 images found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The government responds by arguing that it is immaterial whether or not Pae-quin took reasonable steps to dispose of the images, given his admission that he did in fact possess them at one time. The government notes that the district court is permitted to consider this admission in assessing Pacquin\u2019s relevant conduct for sentencing purposes. The government further argues that Paequin had not fully disposed of the images as it was possible to retrieve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">It is undisputed that Paequin possessed 133 child pornographic images during the relevant time period. The record reflects that the court took into consideration Pa-quin\u2019s efforts to delete the images and withdraw from the criminal conduct and elected to impose a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. Under the circumstances reflected in this record, we cannot say that the district court erred in interpreting the guidelines to require the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">.
