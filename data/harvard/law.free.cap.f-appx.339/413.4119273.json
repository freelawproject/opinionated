We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Gulfport-Brittany and Matthews (collectively, \u201cGulfport-Brittany\u201d) co-owned the Brittany Apartments (\u201cthe Apartments\u201d) in Gulfport, Mississippi, when the Apartments were damaged by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005. According to Appellants, they have incurred costs stemming from physical damage to the Apartments, loss of business income, and the necessity of complying with ordinances and/or laws associated with the demolition and reconstruction of the Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">The property manager for the apartments, Heritage Properties, Inc., had obtained three commercial property insurance policies covering various properties, including the Apartments. Aspen Insurance UK Limited (\u201cAspen\u201d) provided the underlying policy with occurrence limits of $5 million, and Certain Underwriters of Lloyd\u2019s (\u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d) issued the first layer of excess coverage, also with occurrence limits of $5 million. RSUI provided the final layer of excess coverage with policy limits of $140 million per occurrence. The RSUI policy also included a scheduled sub-limit of $2,458,014 for the Apartments. Heritage Properties filed claims with each insurer, and Aspen and Lloyd\u2019s both paid up to their $5 million limits. RSUI paid $2,458,014, but denied further liability. Gulfport-Brittany filed suit in the district court seeking a declaration that they were entitled to them costs up to $140 million under the policy generally as well up to $2.5 million under the Ordinance or Law coverage. RSUI counterclaimed for a declaration that it was not obligated to make any further payments. Gulfport-Brittany filed a motion for partial summary judgment, and RSUI filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted RSUI\u2019s motion and denied Gulfport-Brittany\u2019s, and Gulfport-Brittany timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Chichakli v. Szubin, </em>546 F.3d 315, 316 (5th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is proper when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact exists if the summary judgment evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmovant.\u201d <em>Stover v. Hattiesburg Pub. Sch. Dist., </em>549 F.3d 985, 991 (5th Cir.2008). The facts and evidence must be taken in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Because this is a diversity case, we apply Mississippi substantive law. <em>See Delta &amp; Pine Land Co. v. Nationwide Agribusiness Ins. Co., </em>530 F.3d 395, 399 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cThe proper construction of an insurance contract provision is a question of law.\u201d <em>Farmland Mut. Ins. Co. v. Scruggs, </em>886 So.2d 714, 717 (Miss.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Gulfport-Brittany argues first that the RSUI policy is ambiguous and therefore must be construed in favor of the insured. <em>See Noxubee County Sch. Dist. v. United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>883 So.2d 1159, 1165 (Miss.2004). In particular, GulfportBrittany maintains that the Excess Physical Damage Schedule (\u201cDamage Schedule\u201d) and the Excess Physical Damage Coverage Form (\u201cCoverage Form\u201d) found in the RSUI policy conflict with the Scheduled Limit of Liability endorsement. The Coverage Form states that \u201cthe limits of [RSUI\u2019s] liability shall be those set forth in Item 7 under the designation \u2018Limit Insured\u2019 and the Company shall be liable to pay the ultimate net loss up to the full amount of such \u2018Limit Insured.\u2019 \u201d Item 7 of the Damage Schedule sets the \u201cLimit Insured\u201d at $140 million per occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The Scheduled Limit of Liability endorsement, on the other hand, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">1. In the event of loss hereunder, liability of the Company shall be limited to the least of the following in any one \u201coccurrence\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">a. The actual adjusted amount of the loss, less applicable deductibles and primary and underlying excess limits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">b. 100% of the individually stated value for each scheduled item of property insured at the location which had the loss as shown on the latest Statement of Values on file with this Company, less applicable deductibles and primary and underlying excess limits. If no value is shown for a scheduled item then there is no coverage for that item; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-12\">c.The Limit of Liability as shown on the Declarations page of this policy or as endorsed to this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">Thus, Gulfport-Brittany argues, the policy is ambiguous because it is unclear whether the per occurrence limit for damage to the Apartments is $140 million or $2,458,014 (as stated in the latest Statement of Values). \u201cAmbiguity however, [cannot] be forced into a policy where there is none.\u201d <em>Miss. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Walters, </em>908 So.2d 765, 769 (Miss.2005). The \u201cInsuring Clause\u201d in the Coverage Form states that RSUI\u2019s indemnification is \u201c[s]ubject to the limitations, terms and conditions contained in this Policy or added hereto.... \u201d This clearly includes the Scheduled Limit of Liability endorsement, and we agree with the district court that there is no conflict: the policy creates an overall $140 million per occurrence limit with scheduled sub-limits for individual properties, including the Apartments. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he contract must be viewed as a whole. All parts must be harmonized as much as reasonably possible, and no part or word can be stricken unless the result is fairly inescapable.\u201d (citation omitted)). The policy is not ambiguous, and the district court did not err in holding that the scheduled limit applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">Gulfport-Brittany also argues that RSUI owes additional payments as a result of its adoption, through the \u201cMaintenance of Primary Insurance\u201d clause found in the Coverage Form, of the Ordinance or Law endorsement contained in the primary Aspen policy, which provides $2.5 million in coverage. As the district court noted, however, the \u201cMaintenance of Primary Insurance\u201d clause states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-15\">In respect of the perils hereby insured against, this Policy is subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>same warranties, terms and conditions (except as regards the premium, the amount and limits of liability other than the deductible or self-insurance provision where applicable, and the renewal agreement, if any; and EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN) as are contained in or as may be added to the policy(ies) of the primary insurers)\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Thus, while the RSUI policy is subject to most aspects of the Aspen policy (including the Ordinance or Law endorsement), it is expressly <em>not </em>subject to the \u201camount and limits of liability\u201d in the Aspen policy. The scheduled limit in the RSUI policy therefore applies, and the district court did not err in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
