The district court sentenced Vargas to consecutive terms of 120 months of imprisonment on Count One and 60 months of imprisonment on Count Two, for a total of 180 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Vargas contends that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced him to a consecutive five-year term of imprisonment for his conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae. Because his argument turns on statutory interpretation, de novo review applies. <em>See United, States v. Salazar, </em>542 F.3d 139, 144 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1669, 173 L.Ed.2d 1039 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Section 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae provides that, \u201c[ejxcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law\u201d any person who uses or carries a firearm during and in relation to or in furtherance of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime \u201cshall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime[,] ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae. Vargas\u2019s argument turns on the first phrase of this provision, the so-called \u201cexception\u201d clause. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>205 Fed.Appx. 196, 197 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">In <em>Collins, </em>this court rejected the reading of \u00a7 924(c) urged by Vargas. <em>Collins, </em>205 Fed.Appx. at 197-98. Although <em>Collins </em>is unpublished, this court recently adopted the reasoning and holding of <em>Collins </em>in a published opinion. <em>See United States v. London, </em>568 F.3d 553, 564 (5th Cir.2009). Therefore, the district court did not err when it sentenced Vargas to a consecutive five-year term of imprisonment for his conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
