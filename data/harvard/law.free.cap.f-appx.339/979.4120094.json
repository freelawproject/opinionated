After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-19\">Here, Steward\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered most of the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amends. 706, 713. At Steward\u2019s original sentencing, his base offense level was 32 based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u2019s drug quantity table. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Steward\u2019s total offense level was 29. With a criminal history category of IV, Steward\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court varied downward by one month and imposed a 120-month sentence, the statutory mandatory minimum ten-year sentence for Steward\u2019s offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Later, the district court granted the government\u2019s substantial assistance motion, filed pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), and reduced Steward\u2019s sentence to 84 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Amendment 706 reduced Steward\u2019s base offense by two levels to 30, which yields a potential guidelines range of 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5). However, because of the ten-year statutory mandatory minimum, Steward\u2019s actual guidelines range is 120 to 125 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). Thus, Steward\u2019s new, amended guidelines range after Amendment 706 is 120 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment, which is lower than the original guidelines range of 121 to 151 months. Nonetheless, the district court did not err in denying Steward\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Steward\u2019s original sentence was ultimately \u201cbased on\u201d that applicable statutory mandatory minimum and not on the sentencing range derived in part from the offense level in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (authorizing a district court to modify a sentence only when the sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d a sentencing range that has been lowered by a Sentencing Guidelines amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Steward argues that the district court\u2019s subsequent Rule 35(b) reduction \u201cdispensed with\u201d the statutory mandatory minimum for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) purposes. However, we have rejected this argument in the context of an analogous substantial assistance motion made pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Williams, </em>this Court concluded that a district court\u2019s granting of a \u00a7 5K.1.1 motion does not \u201ceffectively waive[ ] the statutory mandatory minimum and thus entitle! ] [the defendant] to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1339. Likewise, the subsequent granting of a Rule 35(b) motion does not waive the statutory mandatory minimum as to the original sentence in order to make a defendant somehow entitled to a \u00a7 3582(e)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">. \"In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v.
