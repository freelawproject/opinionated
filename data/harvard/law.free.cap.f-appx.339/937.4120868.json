The district court ruled that Ahmed\u2019s charge of discrimination was untimely. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-26\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and review the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate when there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<judges id=\"b959-27\">Before a plaintiff may file a complaint of discrimination or retaliation under Title</judges>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>VII, he must exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>Willcerson v. Grinnell Corp., </em>270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2001). To exhaust his remedies, the plaintiff must file a timely charge of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>In Georgia, a plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination within 180 days after the alleged act of discrimination. <em>Watson v. Blue Circle, Inc., </em>324 F.3d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Ahmed complains that the Board committed five discrete acts of discrimination on the basis of his national origin and retaliation. First, Ahmed alleges that \u201c[f]rom and after\u201d he was hired as a tenure-track instructor, the Board \u201cbegan to treat him differently than similarly situated African American and White instructors.\u201d According to Ahmed, this discrimination began in the fall of 2002 when he complained about his disparate workload to his supervisor and Chairman of the Department of Computer Sciences, Merle King, and King responded, \u201cYou must be happy doing this kind of work coming from a country like Bangladesh.\u201d Second, Ahmed alleges that he was denied course releases in the spring of 2003, the fall of 2003, and the spring of 2004. Third, Ahmed alleges that in the spring of 2005 he discussed his disparate workload with King, who replied that he would \u201ccorrect the situation.\u201d Fourth, Ahmed alleges that King gave Ahmed a derogatory third-year performance evaluation in March 2005 that was \u201cmarkedly different\u201d from his second performance evaluation and reviews for promotion given by King and two other colleagues in the fall of 2004. Fifth, Ahmed alleges that in the March evaluation King changed the weights assigned to the components of Ahmed\u2019s job \u201cin order to give [Ahmed] a poor evaluation\u201d and \u201cset the stage\u201d to terminate Ahmed. Sixth, Ahmed alleges he was sent a letter in August 2005 stating the Board would not renew his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Ahmed\u2019s charge of discrimination was untimely. Ahmed filed his charge on April 11, 2006. For Ahmed\u2019s charge to have been timely, the acts about which Ahmed complained must have occurred on or after October 13, 2005. None of the acts described in Ahmed\u2019s charge occurred after August 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Ahmed argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the limitation period from February 7, 2006, when he submitted a charge in which the notary failed to state that Ahmed appeared before him, but we disagree. \u201cAlthough a court may equitably toll a limitation[ ] period, the plaintiff[ ] must establish that tolling is warranted.\u201d <em>Bost v. Federal Express Coiy., </em>372 F.3d 1233, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). Tolling is appropriate when the plaintiff establishes his filing is untimely due to \u201cextraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999). The Georgia Commission on Equal Opportunity told Ahmed in a letter dated January 24, 2006, that, for the charge \u201cto be timely, it [had to] be <em>signed, dated, notarized, and received by [the] office within 180 days of the adverse employment actions.\u201d See Watson, </em>324 F.3d at 1258 (requiring a plaintiff file a charge of discrimination in Georgia within 180 days after the alleged discrimination); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l). Ahmed failed to act with due diligence to correct his deficient charge. Ahmed waited about a month before he contacted the Commission to inquire about the status of his charge, and then he waited another month to file a new charge. Neither Ahmed\u2019s status as a <em>pro se </em>litigant nor his alleged ignorance about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>the administrative process constitute the type of extraordinary circumstances that warrant tolling, particularly when the Commission informed Ahmed of the strict deadline. <em>See Wakefield v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>181 F.3d 967, 969-70 (11th Cir.1997) (refusing to equitably toll the time to appeal a decision of the Railroad Retirement Board for a <em>pro se </em>litigant). The district court did not err when it granted summary judgment in favor of the Board on the ground that Ahmed\u2019s charge of discrimination was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The summary judgment in favor of the Board is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
