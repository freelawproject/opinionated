MacKusick, Stockbridge, GA, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b929-5\">John Andrew Horn, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Matthew Jackson, Atlanta, GA, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b929-7\">Before TJOFLAT, BLACK and BARKETT, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b929-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">On October 7, 2008, appellant pled guilty to an indictment that charged him and Clifton Devon Berry, Jr., with aiding and abetting each other in knowingly causing false representations to be made with respect to information required to be kept in the records of a federal firearms licensee, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) and 2. On January 20, 2009, the district court sentenced appellant to a prison term of 24 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He now appeals his sentence, arguing that the court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (2008) in calculating the total offense level for the \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) offense because the Government failed to prove that he \u201cused or possessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense\u201d by shooting Sean Rowser in the foot during an altercation in New York. He asserts that under New York law, he would only have been criminally liable for the misdemeanor offense of third-degree assault because he fired one round into the air. He also argues that the Government failed to prove that the shooting was not justified as self-defense or defense of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">We review a district court\u2019s application the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, this court, after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe government bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2006). If a defendant challenges one of the factual bases for his sentence, the government must prove the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">A party who fails to object to a fact stated in a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) admits the fact for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006). A challenge to facts contained in the PSI must be asserted with specificity and clarity; otherwise, the challenge is waived. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">The base offense level for a \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) offense must be increased by four levels \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(2008). \u201cIf the resulting offense level is less than level 18,\u201d the offense level is increased to level 18. <em>Id. </em>The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) defines \u201canother felony offense\u201d as \u201cany federal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>state, or local offense, other than the explosive or firearms possession or trafficking offense, punishable by imprisonment by a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l4(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Under New York law, a person is guilty of third-degree assault, a class A misdemeanor punishable up to one year imprisonment, when he either (1) \u201c[w]ith intent to cause physical injury to another person ... causes such injury to such person or to a third person;\u201d (2) \u201crecklessly causes physical injury to another person;\u201d or (3) <em>\u201c[w]ith criminal negligence </em>... causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 120.00 (emphasis added). \u201cCriminal negligence\u201d is defined as \u201cfail[ure] to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 15.05(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">In contrast, a person commits second-degree assault, a felony in New York, when <em>\u201c[w]ith intent to cause physical injury to another person, </em>he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 120.05(2) (emphasis added). \u201cA person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 15.05(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">At sentencing, appellant did not object to the PSI\u2019s statement of fact that he \u201cpulled out a black handgun and shot Row-ser in the right foot.\u201d Because he did not object to this statement, the district court did not clearly err in finding that appellant did, in fact, shoot Rowser and thereby committed an assault in the second degree under New York law. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 120.05(2). Furthermore, (1) his admission that he discharged a firearm near Rowser, (2) his arrest for committing a second-degree assault on Rowser, (3) his recorded admission of previously shooting nine individuals, and (4) the lack of any evidence indicating that the shooting was justified, such as in self-defense, supported the district court\u2019s finding that he committed \u201canother felony offense.\u201d In sum, based on the facts presented in the record, we are not left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court erred by finding that appellant committed second-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-10\">.
