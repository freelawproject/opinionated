McKinnies\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, McKinnies argues that he was entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced his base offense level and therefore changed his applicable guideline range. McKinnies also contends that the district court\u2019s drug quantity finding at his original sentencing was ambiguous, and that his case should be remanded for further proceedings. He further argues that the district court: (1) incorrectly determined that he was a career offender; and (2) failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as the crack/cocaine powder sentencing disparity and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), (c)(2). During a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the district court may only calculate the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range, and it may not disturb any of its original factual findings. <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1561-63 (11th Cir.1997). Indeed, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amends the Drug Quantity Table in <em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 </em>2Dl.l(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). However, if a defendant is a career offender, his base offense level is determined under the career-offender guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) and not the drug-quantity guideline in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">McKinnies\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent. We recently held that defendants who are sentenced under the career-offender guideline are not sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and are, therefore, ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. McKin-nies\u2019 remaining arguments are likewise barred by precedent. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not, by itself, permit a district court to impose a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction); <em>Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1561-63 (barring the district court from re-examining factual findings made during the original sentencing proceedings). Accordingly, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-11\">.
