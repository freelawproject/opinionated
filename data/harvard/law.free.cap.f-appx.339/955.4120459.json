Trupei argues that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition because the newly discovered evidence supporting his claim of innocence could not be used to support his prior \u00a7 2255 motion, which Trupei asserts makes \u00a7 2255 \u201cinadequate\u201d for the relief he now seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-24\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>view <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">We explained the interplay and distinctions between \u00a7 2241 petitions and \u00a7 2255 motions at length in <em>Darby:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-5\">The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition only if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s (AED-PA\u2019s), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause, and, consequently, a petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive motion restrictions simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). The savings clause only applies to \u201copen a portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding when (1) the \u201cclaim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a non-existent offense; and, (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">405 F.3d at 944-945 (emphasis added); <em>see also Flint v. Jordan, </em>514 F.3d 1165, 1168 (11th Cir.) (holding that the failure to meet the first prong of the savings clause analysis \u2014 a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision \u2014 ends the inquiry), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 222, 172 L.Ed.2d 167 (2008); <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3 (\u201cOnce the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 opens the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, the proper inquiry in that \u00a7 2241 proceeding will be whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence of the crime \u2022 for which he has been convicted[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Trupei\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition on the record before it. Nowhere in his petition, his briefing in the district court, or in his appellate brief does Trupei cite a retroactive Supreme Court decision that applies to his claim. Rather, Trupei merely asserts that his discovery of new evidence to support his claim of innocence makes \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. This does not meet the applicable standard. <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945. Trupei has therefore failed to meet the first prong of the savings clause test, which ends our inquiry. <em>Flint, </em>514 F.3d at 1168. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
