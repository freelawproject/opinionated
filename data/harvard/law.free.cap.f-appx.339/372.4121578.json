The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the order of the immigration judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\">Puente contends that he is eligible for an adjustment of status because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(f) exempts the ground of inadmissibility set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). This court has previously upheld as reasonable the BIA\u2019s determination that \u00a7 1255(i) does not exempt the ground of inadmissibility set forth in \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). <em>Montera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 256 (5th Cir.2005). Although Puente argues that this court should revisit <em>Montera-Cruz </em>in light of decisions from the Ninth and Tenth Circuits that interpret the \u00a7 1255 waiver more broadly, one panel of this court may not overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-19\">Finally, Puente contends that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) leaves the statute open to a constitutional attack on equal protection grounds. Puente does not identify which classes or groups of immigrants are allegedly treated differently by the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). Further, this court has held that the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) is both different from and more culpable than the conduct of an alien who is inadmissible only under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). <em>Mortera-Cruz, </em>409 F.3d at 255-56. Therefore, Puente\u2019s con-clusional equal protection claim is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Accordingly, Puente\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
