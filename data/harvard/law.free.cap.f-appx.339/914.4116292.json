After careful review, we deny the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning while also adding its own explanations, and, therefore, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">To the extent the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions are based on legal determinations, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). We review factual determinations, however, under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cFindings of fact made by the [IJ] may be reversed by [us] only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (alterations and quotation omitted). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion, and \u201cthe BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">First, we are unpersuaded by Montenegro\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in denying him asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. An alien may receive asylum if he proves that he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d which is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-11\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-12\"><em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)) (emphases omitted). \u201cThe asylum applicant must establish eligibility for asylum by offering \u2018credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record.\u2019\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cUncorroborated but credible testimony from the applicant may be sufficient alone to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818-19 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">Accordingly, to be eligible for asylum, \u201cthe alien must, with credible evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>establish (1) past persecution on account of [his] political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that [his] political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) and (b)). Although the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) does not define persecution, we have recognized that \u201cpersecution\u201d is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (quotations and bracket omitted). We have held that threats alone do not give rise to a persecution-based claim for relief. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Moreover the combination of verbal threats and a minor beating do not amount to persecution. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (alien\u2019s claim that police officers beat him and detained him for 36 hours did not compel the conclusion that the alien established persecution). We also have held that neither threatening phone calls nor condolence notes are sufficient to establish persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (\u201cmenacing telephone calls and threats to [an alien] ... do not rise to the level of past persecution\u201d); <em>see also Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237. Nevertheless, we have found persecution where, despite enduring no \u201csignificant physical attacks,\u201d an alien received numerous death threats, was dragged by her hair out of her vehicle, and was kidnapped and beaten. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1009-10 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">\u201cA showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u2018well-founded fear,\u2019 subject to rebuttal by the [government].\u201d <em>Se-pulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)). If an alien does not establish past persecution, he bears the burden \u25a0of showing that it is more likely than not that he will suffer persecution on the basis of the protected ground, and he would not be able to avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his country, if, under all of the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2), (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Withholding of removal may be granted if the alien establishes that, if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The burden of proof for an applicant seeking withholding of removal is higher than the burden imposed on an asylum applicant. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303. Accordingly, where a petitioner fails to establish eligibility for asylum, he likewise fails to establish entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Eligibility for CAT relief requires the applicant to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The CAT defines torture as the intentional infliction of \u201csevere pain or suffering.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). To obtain CAT relief, the alien must demonstrate that the torture would be inflicted by the government or with the government\u2019s acquiescence, i.e., the government would be aware of the torture and fail to intervene. <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). The burden of proof for an alien seeking withholding of removal under the CAT, like the burden for an alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA, is higher than the burden for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>showing entitlement to asylum. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303. Thus, where the alien is unable to meet the less stringent standard for asylum, his claim for CAT relief necessarily fails. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s findings that Montenegro was not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. With regard to asylum, while Montenegro established that he was threatened on account of his political opinion by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d), the verbal threats of which he complained were insufficient to rise to the level of persecution, as defined by our caselaw. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237-39; <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Montenegro did not allege that he was kidnapped, beaten, or otherwise subjected to any actions beyond in-person verbal threats. <em>See De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1009-10. The evidence therefore does not compel the conclusion that he experienced persecution. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Further, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Montenegro did not establish that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution, particularly in light of the fact that he returned to Colombia for one week after having taken refuge in the United States, and two of his sons remained in Colombia unharmed. Moreover, Montenegro had not experienced anything beyond mere harassment in the two years that he was threatened by the FARC while living in Colombia. As a result, the record does not compel the conclusion that Montenegro had a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Finally, since Montenegro did not establish past persecution, he had the burden of showing that he would be unable to avoid persecution by relocating to another part of Colombia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2), (b)(3). Although the 2005 Country Report indicated that the FARC\u2019s presence in Colombia is country-wide, it does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Montenegro failed to meet his burden, particularly where: (1) Montenegro did not try to relocate within Colombia before moving to the United States; (2) two of his sons lived safely in Colombia; and (3) he offered no basis for his conclusion that relocation was impossible beyond his personal belief that the FARC dominated Colombia. Consequently, we deny the petition with respect to Montenegro\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">Because the burden of proof for an applicant seeking withholding of removal or CAT relief is higher than that for an applicant seeking asylum, and Montenegro failed to meet his burden for asylum, he necessarily failed to satisfy his burden for withholding of removal or CAT relief, and the IJ and BIA properly denied these claims. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303; <em>see also Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1292. The IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief also was proper on the additional basis that the 2005 Country Report supported the conclusion that the Colombian government does not acquiesce to the FARC\u2019s torture and killings. Accordingly, Montenegro did not meet- his burden of showing that he would be tortured by the Colombian government, or with its acquiescence, if returned to Colombia, and the IJ and BIA properly denied CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">We also reject Montenegro\u2019s claim that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen. It is within the discretion of the BIA to deny a motion to reopen for at least three reasons: \u201c(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case [of eligibility for asylum]; (2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and (3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1302. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>showing of a well-founded fear of future persecution, an asylum applicant must show that \u201c[t]here is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution\u201d if he is returned to his native country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(i)(B). For withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution if returned to their home country, which is a higher burden than that for asylum. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 424-25, 429, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Montenegro\u2019s motion to reopen, as the documents that he submitted did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. None of the documents related to past persecution, and they were insufficient to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution: (1) the condolence note allegedly sent by the FARC was an example of harassment and intimidation, but not persecution, especially since Montenegro received numerous other threats without experiencing any further action by the FARC, <em>see Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237 (finding that a condolence note alone was insufficient to entitle the applicant to asylum); (2) the letters from the elected officials were based on knowledge garnered by \u201cacquaintances\u201d and did not reflect their own firsthand information or personal knowledge; (3) the 2007 Country Report did not contain any information regarding a specific threat to Montenegro or people who are similarly situated to him, and, thus, did not establish a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that he would be persecuted if returned to Colombia, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(i)(B); and (4) the letter that Javier sent to Montenegro also did not establish this \u201creasonable possibility,\u201d as it was not specific regarding the threat from the FARC and did not point to any specific instances in which either Javier or Montenegro was threatened. Therefore, because none of the documents that Montenegro submitted established a <em>prima facie </em>case of eligibility for asylum, they also necessarily did not meet the higher burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of eligibility for withholding of removal, and the BIA did not abuse its broad discretion in denying the motion to reopen. <em>See Stevic, </em>467 U.S. at 424-25, 104 S.Ct. 2489; <em>see also Gbaya, </em>342 F.3d at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Lastly, regarding Montenegro\u2019s claim that the BIA failed to consider Javier\u2019s letter, this argument is contradicted by the BIA\u2019s order, which specifically referred to the letter and one of its claims. Moreover, even if the BIA did err, the error was harmless, because, as discussed above, Javier\u2019s letter was not specific as to the threat that the FARC posed to Montenegro. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(i)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-6\">. Javier Montenegro, the Montenegro's son, filed a separate application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, and his application was consolidated with his parent's by the IJ. However, Javier returned to Colombia before the conclusion of these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
