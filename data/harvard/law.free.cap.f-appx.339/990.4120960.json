Harrell argues that the district court erred in failing to grant him a downward variance in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and in failing to address his assertions of error in his trial and original sentencing hearing. He also argues that the district court erred in failing to hold a hearing to address his arguments relating to these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">\u2018We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing rage that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements provide that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not \u201ca full resentencing of the defendant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3). <em>\u201c[A]U </em>original sentencing determinations [must] remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Furthermore, <em>Kimbrough </em>is not applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). A defendant is not entitled to a hearing on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4) (stating that the defendant\u2019s presence is not required at a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">Harrell\u2019s argument for a downward variance is foreclosed by precedent. <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192-93. Harrell\u2019s remaining assertions of error were outside the scope of the proceeding, <em>see Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781, and he was not entitled to a hearing on his motion, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
