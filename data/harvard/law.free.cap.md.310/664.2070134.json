The problem of intergovernmental immunity at hand arises from Maryland\u2019s having included in the measurement of the franchise tax imposed on the appellee, Maryland National Bank (the Bank), interest earned by the Bank on certain bonds issued by an instrumentality of the United States. The problem of interpretation arises because there are different federal statutes on which the adversaries rely to support their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Maryland imposes a franchise tax on domestic financial institutions for the privilege of existing as a corporation and on foreign financial institutions for the privilege of transacting business in this state in corporate form. Md.Code (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol., 1986 Cum.Supp.), Art. 81, \u00a7 128A(a). The tax is measured by net earnings. \u00a7 128A(b). The Bank is a corporation organized and existing under the National Bank Tax Act. For purposes of state taxation it is to \u201cbe treated as a bank organized and existing under the laws of the State or other jurisdiction within which its principal office is located.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 548 (1982). The Bank\u2019s principal office is in Maryland and the Bank is subject to the franchise tax on financial institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">There is no contention in this case that the Maryland tax is other than a true franchise or privilege tax. Nor is there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>any contention that the tax applies or is administered in a discriminatory fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">For the years 1979 through 1982 the Bank included in its report of net earnings subject to the franchise tax a total of $2,818,727.79 of interest on consolidated bonds of Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB). It paid the tax under protest and then claimed a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The State Department of Assessments and Taxation (the State) denied the refund and, on the Bank\u2019s appeal, the Maryland Tax Court ordered the refund to be made. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the order of the Tax Court and we issued the writ of certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration of the State\u2019s appeal by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The Bank relies principally on \u00a7 13, as amended, of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of July 22, 1932, ch. 522, \u00a7 13, 47 Stat. 735, now codified as 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433. Section 1433 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">Any and all notes, debentures, bonds, and other such obligations issued by any bank, and consolidated Federal Home Loan Bank bonds and debentures, shall be exempt both as to principal and interest from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority. The bank, including its franchise, its capital, reserves, and surplus, its advances, and its income, shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority; except that ... any real property of the bank shall be subject to State, Territorial, county, municipal, or local taxation to the same extent according to its value as other real property is taxed. The notes, debentures, and bonds issued by any bank, with unearned coupons attached, shall be accepted at par by such bank in payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>of or as a credit against the obligation of any home-owner debtor of such bank.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The State submits that, when interpreted in the light of history, \u00a7 1433 has no application to a franchise tax and that the controlling statute is 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a) (1982). The latter provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">Stocks and obligations of the United States Government are exempt from taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State. The exemption applies to each form of taxation that would require the obligation, the interest on the obligation, or both, to be considered in computing a tax, except\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">(1) a nondiscriminatory franchise tax or another non-property tax instead of a franchise tax, imposed on a corporation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">(2) an estate or inheritance tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The State has analyzed the problem correctly, in our view.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The doctrine of intergovernmental immunity rests on the nature of the federal system created by the United States Constitution. With particular respect to a prohibition against state taxation of the obligations of federal instrumentalities, the doctrine has been recognized since <em>M\u2019Culloch v. Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. (17 U.S.) 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). In connection with the issuance of treasury notes to finance the Civil War and to prevent their possible taxation by the states, Congress undertook to express the constitutional prohibition in a statute. P. Hartman, <em>Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation </em>\u00a7 6:20, at 340 (1981) (Hartman). That enactment essentially became Rev.Stat. \u00a7 3701 and, later, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 742 (1952), which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-10\">Except as otherwise provided by law, all stocks, bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>States, shall be exempt from taxation by or under State or municipal or local authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In 1865 the Supreme Court struck down the application of a New York property tax to obligations of the United States own\u00e9d by a bank, saying that \u201cthe tax is imposed on the property of the institutions, as contradistinguished from a tax upon their privileges or franchises.\u201d <em>The Bank Tax Case, </em>2 Wall. (69 U.S.) 200, 209, 17 L.Ed. 793, 795 (1865). There followed a line of cases in the Supreme Court, decided while the substance of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 742 was in effect, sustaining privilege taxes measured by nontaxable federal securities. The judicial rationale was \u201cthat the taxing State has power to impose the tax on a privilege, which it had power to withhold; and which, therefore, the State has the power to tax---- [W]hen the State is imposing a tax on its own creation, it is not interfering with the operations of the Federal Government.\u201d Hartman, <em>supra, </em>at 348 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Writing in 1956 in <em>Werner Machine Co. v. Director of Div. of Taxation, </em>350 U.S. 492, 494, 76 S.Ct. 534, 535, 100 L.Ed. 634, 637, the Supreme Court said in a per curiam opinion that it \u201chas consistently upheld franchise taxes measured by a yardstick which includes tax-exempt income or property, even though a part of the economic impact of the tax may be said to bear indirectly upon such income or property.\u201d The Court then cited, in chronological order, <em>Society for Sav. v. Coite, </em>6 Wall. (73 U.S.) 594, 18 L.Ed. 897 (1868); <em>Provident Inst. for Sav. v. Massachusetts, </em>6 Wall. (73 U.S.) 611, 18 L.Ed. 907 (1868); <em>Hamilton Co. v. Massachusetts, </em>6 Wall. (73 U.S.) 632, 18 L.Ed. 904 (1868); <em>Home Ins. Co. v. New York, </em>134 U.S. 594, 10 S.Ct. 593, 33 L.Ed. 1025 (1890); <em>Educational Films Corp. of America v. Ward, </em>282 U.S. 379, 51 S.Ct. 170, 75 L.Ed. 400 (1931); and <em>Pacific Co. v. Johnson, </em>285 U.S. 480, 52 S.Ct. 424, 76 L.Ed. 893 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">In <em>Educational Films, supra, </em>decided in the year before enactment of the Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>[W]e cannot say that the rule applied by this court for some seventy years, that a nondiscriminatory tax upon corporate franchises is valid, notwithstanding the inclusion of tax exempt property or income in the measure of it, has failed of its purpose, or has worked so badly as to require a departure from it now; or that the present tax, viewed in the light of actualities, imposes any such real or direct burden on the federal government as to call for the application of a different rule. [282 U.S. at 392, 51 S.Ct. at 173.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Present 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a) was enacted in 1959.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 1959 enactment was a response to an Idaho statute which imposed a tax upon individuals measured by an individual\u2019s net income. Idaho took the position that the tax need not exempt interest received on federal obligations. The 1959 amendment plainly did more than make clear that the interest on federal obligations was tax exempt. Idaho relied on the formal distinction between a tax on an individual, measured by his net income, and a tax on the income itself____ To answer this argument, the amend-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">ment abolished the formalistic inquiry whether the tax is <em>on </em>a distinct interest, and replaced it with the inquiry whether \u201ccomputation of the tax\u201d requires consideration of federal obligations. <em>[American Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Dallas County, </em>463 U.S. 855, 867, 103 S.Ct. 3369, 3377, 77 L.Ed.2d 1072, 1082 (1983) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The Bank submits that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433, which authorizes FHLB bonds, is more specific as to FHLB bonds than 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a), that \u00a7 1433 declares an exemption from \u201call\u201d taxation, and that the omission of franchise taxation from the specifically enumerated exceptions to the grant of exemption demonstrates congressional intent for FHLB bonds to be exempt from state franchise taxes \u201cboth as to principal and interest.\u201d If we assume that FHLB bonds are \u201cobligations of the United States Government\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>meaning of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a) (see discussion, infra), then the Bank\u2019s interpretation of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433 places it in irreconcilable conflict with 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a) insofar as nondiscriminatory franchise taxes are concerned. The rules of statutory construction applied by the Supreme Court to federal statutes are not significantly different from those which we apply. In <em>Watt v. Alaska, </em>451 U.S. 259, 266-67, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 68 L.Ed.2d 80, 88 (1981), Justice Powell said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">Sole reliance on the \u201cplain language\u201d of \u00a7 401(a) would assume the answer to the question at issue. These cases involve two statutes, each of which by its literal terms applies to the facts before us. Restatement of the terms of \u00a7 401(a) cannot answer which statute Congress intended to control. Recognizing this, the Secretary invokes the maxim of construction that the more recent of two irreconcilably conflicting statutes governs. 2A C. Sands, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.-02 (4th ed. 1973). Without depreciating this general rule, we decline to read the statutes as being in irreconcilable conflict without seeking to ascertain the actual intent of Congress. Our examination of the legislative history is guided by another maxim: \u201c \u2018repeals by implication are not favored,\u2019 \u201d____ \u201cThe intention of the legislature to repeal must be \u2018clear and manifest.\u2019 \u201d ... We must read the statutes to give effect to each if we can do so while preserving their sense and purpose. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArZ\">In the case before us the two statutes can be read compatably by reading 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433 in the light of the direct tax-indirect measurement distinction which shone more brightly in 1932, when \u00a7 1433 was enacted, than it does today. The Maryland franchise tax does not offend \u00a7 1433\u2019s command that \u201call [FHLB] bonds, and other such obligations ... shall be exempt both as to principal and interest from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by ... any State\u201d because Maryland has not taxed the bonds or the interest on them. Maryland has taxed the privilege of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>doing business as a financial institution in corporate form in this state and has measured the tax by net income which constitutionally may, under the principle established by the intergovernmental immunity cases cited above, include interest on federal obligations. Thus, the exemption first created in 1932 for FHLB bonds and interest does not control here because the Maryland franchise tax does not tax interest on the FHLB bonds. Title 31, \u00a7 3124(a) later abolished the long-standing legal distinction in the intergovernmental immunity context between direct tax and indirect measurement, but the abolition was accompanied by an express federal consent to using interest on federal obligations to compute a nondiscriminatory franchise tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><em>American Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Dallas County, supra, </em>relied upon by the Bank, is not to the contrary. The Court in that case invalidated a Texas tax on bank shares which included tax-exempt United States obligations in its computation. The Texas tax, however, was a property tax imposed directly on the federal obligations held by the Texas taxpayer and consequently violated the immunity defined in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The Bank emphasizes in its argument that the reconciliation which we have approved above renders part of the first sentence of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433 surplusage. The Bank\u2019s point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>is that an excise tax imposed on the transfer of the assets of a decedent to the decedent\u2019s legatees and measured by the value of the assets of the decedent\u2019s estate is not a direct tax on the estate assets. <em>See, e.g., United States v. United States Manufacturers National Bank, </em>363 U.S. 194, 198, 80 S.Ct. 1103, 1106, 4 L.Ed.2d 1158, 1162 (1960); <em>Greiner v. Lewellyn, </em>258 U.S. 384, 387, 42 S.Ct. 324, 324, 66 L.Ed. 676, 677 (1922); <em>Plummer v. Coler, </em>178 U.S. 115, 130, 20 S.Ct. 829, 835, 44 L.Ed. 998, 1006 (1900). The Bank correctly notes that, if the exemption for the principal and interest on FHLB bonds applies only to direct taxes, it was unnecessary for Congress parenthetically to except expressly from the exemption \u201cestate, inheritance, and gift taxes[.]\u201d The canon of construction which endeavors to give meaning to each word of a statute and to avoid construing any words as surplusage is not an immutable physical law of the universe, but is simply a guide to statutory construction. In the instant matter we are persuaded that Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 13 of the Homeowners Loan Act of 1932 is revealed by the seventy years of constitutional adjudication antedating the enactment, and not by an inflexible application of the no surplusage canon.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The Bank further submits that FHLB bonds are not \u201cobligations of the United States Government\u201d within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a) because 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1435 provides in part that \u201c[a]ll obligations of Federal Home Loan Banks shall plainly state that such obligations are not obligations of the United States and are not guaranteed by the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This argument does not produce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>result sought by the Bank. If the principal and interest of FHLB bonds are totally excluded from \u00a7 3124(a), then the exemption conferred by that section would not apply to FHLB bonds, including the extension of the exemption to the use of the federal security\u2019s income in computing the tax. The State then could still measure the franchise tax on the Bank\u2019s privilege by the income from those obligations, because the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental immunity, as applied by the Supreme Court, does not prevent measuring a franchise tax by including income on federal obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In any event the meaning of \u201cobligation\u201d in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1435 does not determine its meaning in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124. Consolidated FHLB bonds are the joint and several obligations of all twelve Federal Home Loan Banks. G. Munn, <em>Encyclopedia of Banking and Finance, </em>at 333 (8th ed. 1983). Section 1435 alerts investors that the bonds do not carry the full faith and credit of the United States. In 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a) the obligations are those of the United States \u201cGovernment\u201d and include those of government agencies and instrumentalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The foregoing conclusion is supported by the federal income tax treatment of interest on federal obligations. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">The tax status of interest on obligations and dividends, earnings, or other income from evidences of ownership issued by the Government or an agency and the tax treatment of gain and loss from the disposition of those obligations and evidences of ownership is decided under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.). An obligation that the Federal Housing Administration had agreed, under a contract made before March 1, 1941, to issue at a future date, has the tax exemption privileges provided by the authorizing law at the time of the contract. This subsection does not apply to obligations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>evidences of ownership issued by the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, or a department, agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision of the District, territory, or possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">This statute is the Public Debt Act of February 19,1941, ch. 7, \u00a7 4(a), 55 Stat. 9, with amendments which are not here material. Section 4(b) of the Act of February 19, 1941, further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">The provisions of this section shall, with respect to such obligations, be considered as amendatory of and supplementary to the respective Acts or parts of Acts authorizing the issuance of such obligations, as amended, and supplemented.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The instrumentalities of the United States which issued obligations carrying tax free interest prior to March 1,1941, included the Federal Home Loan Banks. <em>See </em>P-H, <em>1987 Federal Income Taxes, </em>118285(5). As a result of the Public Debt Act of 1941, interest upon and gain from the sale or other disposition of FHLB bonds is subject to taxation as provided in the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See </em>1 Moody\u2019s, <em>Bank &amp; Finance Manual, </em>2916 (1987). The phrase, \u201cobligations of the United States Government,\u201d as used in the Act of September 22,1959, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a) is at least as broad as \u201cobligations ... issued by the Government\u201d as used in the Public Debt Act of 1941, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(b). Thus, \u00a7 3124(a) obligations include FHLB bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Our analysis and interpretation of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433 is shared by the Office of General Counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. In an opinion of October 29, 1975, the General Counsel had ruled that \u00a7 1433 rendered immune from inclusion in taxable income under an Arkansas tax dividends received by a federal savings and loan association on the capital stock it held in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Little Rock. In reliance on that opinion a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>association in Florida took the position that its dividend income on FHLB stock was not taxable by Florida. When the Florida tax collector pointed out that Florida\u2019s imposition was a franchise tax measured by net income, the savings and loan association turned to the FHLB Board. In an opinion of January 13, 1976, the General Counsel assumed that the Florida statute was \u201ca valid franchise tax under Florida law\u201d and, on that assumption, concurred in the conclusion of the Florida tax collector. After reviewing the Supreme Court cases which had \u201cenunciated the distinction between a direct tax upon net income and an excise or franchise tax measured by net income,\u201d the General Counsel concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">Since the tax immunity of Federal Home Loan Bank stock under \u00a7 13 of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act is no greater than that of the securities in <em>Tradesmens [National Bank of Oklahoma City v. Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>309 U.S. 560, 60 S.Ct. 688, 84 L.Ed. 947 (1940)] (Federal Reserve Bank stock) or <em>Werner [Machine Co. v. Dir., supra, </em>350 U.S. 492, 76 S.Ct. 534, 100 L.Ed. 634] (United States Treasury bonds), in our view there appears to be no legal impediment to inclusion of Federal Home Loan Bank stock dividends in the income of savings and loan associations for the purpose of determining the franchise tax imposed by [the Florida statute].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Also on January 13, 1976, the Office of General Counsel rendered the same opinion to a federally chartered savings and loan association in Michigan because the Michigan \u201ctax in question is more in the nature of a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business in the State than a direct tax on [the association\u2019s] income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">These opinions on behalf of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board likely concern the second sentence of \u00a7 1433 (\u201cThe bank, including its franchise, its capital, reserves, and surplus, its advances, and its income, shall be exempt from all taxation ...\u201d). Inasmuch as the second sentence of \u00a7 1433 is interpreted to recognize the judicial history of intergov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ernmental immunity, the first sentence of \u00a7 1433 should be interpreted in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

Comm\u2019r of Taxation, </em>303 Minn. 124, 226 N.W.2d 611, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 886, 96 S.Ct. 181, 46 L.Ed.2d 118 (1975); and <em>Schwinden v. Burlington Northern, Inc., </em>691 P.2d 1351 (Mont. 1984), later proceeding, 730 P.2d 422 (Mont.1986). In these cases the analysis related to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(a) and its predecessor, rather than to the statute authorizing the federal securities, the income of which was included in the tax measurement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b730-5\">.
