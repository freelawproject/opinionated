The juvenile court (Hammerman, J.) found Valerie to be a CI\u00d1A and committed her care and custody to DSS on September 7, 1973, subject to its further order.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Eight years later, in October of 1982, DSS recommended that the juvenile court rescind the order of commitment; Valerie had been returned to her mother\u2019s care the previous year, and DSS believed her mother was providing acceptable care. The juvenile court (Allen, J.) accepted DSS\u2019s request and ordered on November 10, 1982, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4S\">\u201cthe Order committing the Respondent [Valerie] to said Agency [the Baltimore City DSS] be, and the same is hereby rescinded, and said Agency is discharged from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>further responsibility for the care, custody, and/or supervision of the Respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Valerie was returned to foster care placement by DSS sometime in February of 1985 for reasons not disclosed in the record. DSS, however, did not petition the court for recommitment until over a year later in May of 1986. In the interim, not only had Valerie become 18 years old and thus ineligible for consideration as a CINA under a new petition, but DSS had exceeded its own six-month limit on voluntary foster care placements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Valerie could therefore continue receiving foster care services only if she were recommitted to DSS\u2019s custody under the original CINA adjudication by the juvenile court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">DSS\u2019s request for a hearing to review Valerie\u2019s foster care placement was denied by the juvenile master on May 20, 1986, on the ground that \u201c[t]he effect of the [juvenile court\u2019s] rescission order was to cancel the commitment order and to close the original case.\u201d The master\u2019s recommendation was approved by the juvenile court (Mitchell, J.) on July 21, 1986. Although the court agreed with DSS\u2019s and Valerie\u2019s contention that the rescission language of Judge Allen\u2019s 1982 order did not, of itself, terminate the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">\u201cThe further language of Judge Allen\u2019s Order accomplished that. After the committing Order was rescinded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the agency was discharged from further care responsibilities for the Respondent____ [Referring to the dictionary, discharge means to free or end the effect of a legal order. The Court\u2019s orders then in use contained discharge rather than terminate when referring to the cessation of jurisdiction. The net effect is the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Valerie appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari on our own motion to consider the important question raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">It is, of course, a basic premise that a court obtaining jurisdiction of the person and subject matter retains it until final disposition of the case. <em>See Eggleston v. State, </em>209 Md. 504, 511, 121 A.2d 698 (1956); <em>Hunter v. Warden, </em>198 Md. 655, 656, 80 A.2d 611 (1951). The Juvenile Causes Act, in \u00a7 3-804(a) of the Article provides that the juvenile court \u201chas exclusive original jurisdiction over a child alleged to be delinquent, in need of supervision, in need of assistance or who has received a citation for a violation.\u201d Although exclusive original jurisdiction may be waived by the juvenile court under specific circumstances, it is presumed that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction continues: \u201cuntil that person reaches 21 years of age unless terminated sooner.\u201d \u00a7 3-806(a). Under this Section, jurisdiction, once acquired, terminates (with some exceptions not here pertinent) only if the juvenile court so orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The Juvenile Causes Act does not specify the precise language necessary to terminate the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. However, the Maryland Rules contain approved \u201cForms for Juvenile Causes,\u201d one of which, Form 920, sets forth an appropriate order of termination of jurisdiction under Md.Rule 920<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>FINAL ORDER OF TERMINATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">ORDERED, this .............. day of ............... 19..., by the .............. Court for .............. City/ County, Maryland, sitting as a Juvenile Court, that this proceeding be, and it hereby is, terminated; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADQ\">ORDERED, that a copy of this Order be served on the Respondent and on .....................</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">Recommended: ..........................</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">Master for Juvenile Causes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">Judge</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">In comparing the above language with that of the 1982 order issued by Judge Allen, which Judge Mitchell construed to have terminated juvenile court jurisdiction, we note initially that Form 920 uses the word \u201cterminate,\u201d in keeping with the language of \u00a7\u00a7 3-806(a) and 3-804(a) of the Courts Article and Md.Rule 920. The 1982 order, on the other hand, uses the term \u201cdischarge.\u201d According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), \u201ctermination\u201d refers to an \u201cend in time or existence,\u201d \u201ccessation,\u201d or \u201cconclusion,\u201d (at p. 1319), whereas \u201cdischarge\u201d means \u201cto release,\u201d \u201cannul,\u201d \u201cextinguish an obligation\u201d (at p. 416). Thus, given the presumption of a juvenile court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction, we do not view \u201cdischarge\u201d in this context as meaning a cessation of the entire panoply of petitions that could be filed in juvenile court concerning the care and custody of a child adjudged a CINA. Moreover, the language of the 1982 order specifically refers to discharging the \u201cagency ... from further responsibility for the care, custody, and/or supervision of the Respondent\u201d; it does not, directly or indirectly, suggest a termination of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. Consequently, we hold that the 1982 order did not terminate the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over Valerie.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>We have previously considered cases involving the termination of juvenile court jurisdiction. <em>In re Johanna F., </em>284 Md. 643, 399 A.2d 245 (1979), concerned a delinquent child committed for detention in November of 1972. Between 1972 and 1978, Johanna absconded from various juvenile facilities at which she had been placed. A subsequent court order in July of 1978 committed her to the custody of the Juvenile Services Administration for placement at a facility particularly suited to her needs. Johanna, however, contended that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction over her in 1978. She argued that, under \u00a7 3-825(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, the original order of 1972 had lapsed three years from the date it was entered; the expiration of the custody order thus allegedly divested the juvenile court of its jurisdiction over her. We there held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u201cIt is clear that jurisdiction and custody are separate and distinct. The statutes and rules regarding them are unambiguous and in no way conflicting. Section 3-825(b) only qualifies the court\u2019s power regarding custody. The running of the period which a custody order may not exceed serves only to bring an end to that order; the jurisdiction of the court over the person still exists. The jurisdiction which the court gained by an allegation and an adjudication that a child is delinquent remains inviolate, completely unaffected by the lapse of a custody order. In short, the jurisdiction of the court is not terminated because the custody order terminated upon the passage of three years.\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 651, 399 A.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">More recently, in <em>In re Arlene G., </em>301 Md. 355, 483 A.2d 39 (1984), we held that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>children adjudged CI\u00d1AS was not terminated when another court appointed the director of a child placement agency as the guardian of the children. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\u201cAs the Juvenile Court observed, the mere appointment of a guardian, albeit the Agency, does not mean that the children are not at that time, or may not in the future be, children in need of assistance. The Juvenile Court obtained jurisdiction as to the custody of the children upon the allegation and determination that they were in need of assistance. Its jurisdiction was continuous in its discretion, unimpaired by the guardianship orders of the Equity Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 363, 483 A.2d 39.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Finally, we note that a fundamental purpose of the Juvenile Causes Act is to \u201cprovide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this [Act]____\u201d \u00a7 3-802(a)(1). Terminating jurisdiction over a CINA, absent an express indication from the court order that such an effect was intended, hardly accomplishes that purpose. Therefore, in view cf the presumption of continuing jurisdiction, and of the express instruction of \u00a7 3-802(b) that the Act \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate ... [its] purposes,\u201d we conclude that the effect of the 1982 order was merely to relieve DSS from further responsibility at that time for Valerie\u2019s custody. The order did not terminate the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR BALTIMORE CITY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">.
