The issue in this case is whether the phrase \u201cany other gaming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>device\u201d in \u00a7 255(b) encompasses slot machines otherwise prohibited by \u00a7 264B.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">On September 28, 1984, Maryland State Police officers, executing search and seizure warrants, seized 149 slot machines from nineteen locations in Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne\u2019s, Somerset and Talbot Counties. The seized devices were in the possession of twenty-four organizations, each of which was either a bona fide fraternal or war veterans\u2019 group within the contemplation of \u00a7 255(b). The State subsequently filed forfeiture petitions, which were consolidated and transferred to the Circuit Court for Worcester County.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, stipulating to the following facts: 1) The machines seized by the police were slot machines as defined by \u00a7 264B; 2) each machine was used for gambling; and 3) no individual or group of individuals benefitted financially or received any of the proceeds from the machines\u2019 operation. The State contended that slot machines are inherently illegal to possess under \u00a7 264B, and thus, were subject to forfeiture as contraband per se. The organizations, however, argued that \u00a7 255(b) exempts such devices from \u00a7 264B\u2019s ban on the possession of slot machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The trial court (Cathell, J.) granted the organizations\u2019 motions and ordered the State to return the slot machines. The court first determined that slot machines are \u201cgaming devices\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 255(b). It then found that \u00a7 264B did not repeal the exemption to the gaming laws contained in \u00a7 255(b), and, as a consequence, the slot machines were not contraband per se when held by organizations to which \u00a7 255(b) applies. Therefore, the court concluded, the State could not seize the machines without instituting criminal proceedings. After the State appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, we granted certiorari prior to decision by the intermediate appellate court to consider the important issue raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In 1962, then Governor Tawes appointed a committee to recommend procedures to abolish slot machines. That committee, known as the Emory Commission, focused on the four Southern Maryland counties in which commercial gambling was legal; the committee acknowledged, however, that various nonprofit organizations also had licenses for slot machines in these counties. Emory Commission Report at 9. The committee report also noted that free play \u201cslot machines are prevalent throughout most of the State____ In fact, there are probably more machines in other parts of the State____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. The Report recommended a statewide ban on any machine that could be used as a gambling device. <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The General Assembly responded to this Report by enacting Chapter 617 of the Acts of 1963, now codified as \u00a7 264B, which flatly proscribed slot machines in Maryland. In those jurisdictions that allowed slot machines prior to July 1, 1963, however, \u00a7 264B.II phased in this prohibition over five years by gradually decreasing the number of machines that could be licensed in each jurisdiction. Uncodified \u00a7 4 of the Act provided \u201c[t]hat all laws or parts of laws, public general or public local, inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of any such inconsistency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">During pendency of this legislation in the General Assembly, an amendment was proposed to exempt slot machines operated by various nonprofit organizations in Anne Arundel County; the amendment failed. 1963 House Journal 875, 924. At least three other attempts to amend \u00a7 264B to authorize the possession of slot machines by various organizations also failed. H.B. 547 (1973); H.B. 1470 (1972); H.B. 722 (1969). In 1985 and 1986, the General Assembly did pass such legislation, but then Governor Hughes vetoed it. VI Laws of Maryland 3630 (1986) (Governor\u2019s message vetoing S.B. 218); VI Laws of Maryland 3909 (1985) (Governor\u2019s message vetoing S.B. 774). By ch. 157 of the Acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>1987, the General Assembly authorized certain organizations in eight counties to operate slot machines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">As originally enacted by ch. 679 of the Acts of 1949, what is now \u00a7 255(b) contained a limited exemption from the State\u2019s antigambling laws for Caroline County. Since that time, the legislature has amended \u00a7 255 numerous times, primarily to expand its geographic reach. Ch. 478 of the Acts of 1981, however, not only added St. Mary\u2019s County, but also expanded the allowable gambling activities permitted in that county and specifically excluded slot machines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\"(b) Generally\u2014(1) This subtitle may not be construed to make it unlawful for any volunteer fire company or bona fide fraternal, civic, war veterans\u2019, religious or charitable organization or corporation to conduct or hold a carnival, bazaar, or raffle for the exclusive benefit of any such volunteer fire company or fraternal, civic, war veterans\u2019, religious or charitable organization or corporation, if no individual or group of individuals benefits financially from the holding of any bazaar, carnival, or raffle or receives or is paid any of the proceeds from any carnival, bazaar, or raffle, for personal use or benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">(2) The organization or corporation may award prizes in cash or in merchandise by such devices as are commonly designated as paddle wheels, wheels of fortune, chance books, bingo, or any other gaming device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">(3) However, carnivals, bazaars, or raffles shall be managed by the members of such group, organization or corporation personally through its members.

Nicely, </em>304 Md. 1, 10, 497 A.2d 142 (1985); <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 418, 379 A.2d 1007 (1977). In other words, we seek out the legislature\u2019s objective, goal, or purpose. <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). In doing that, we look at the statutory language and we look at that language in the context in which it appears, including related statutes, pertinent legislative history, and \u201cother material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 525 A.2d 628. Furthermore, we construe statutes, if at all feasible, so that no word or phrase is rendered surplus or meaningless. <em>City of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174 (1984); <em>Hirsch v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Resources, </em>288 Md. 95, 116, 416 A.2d 10 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The issue here is whether the phrase \u201cany other gaming device,\u201d as used in \u00a7 255(b), includes slot machines. The organizations claim it does. The State insists that in view of \u00a7 264B, it does not. We must examine \u00a7\u00a7 255(b) and 264B in light of the principles outlined above and our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>previous decisions and decide which construction best comports with the goal or object the General Assembly sought to achieve in enacting these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In <em>Clerk v. Chesapeake Beach Park, </em>251 Md. 657, 248 A.2d 479 (1968), we examined the effect of \u00a7 264B on local laws in Calvert County that authorized the possession of coin-operated mechanical and electrical \u201camusement\u201d devices. These machines did not offer cash pay-offs, but awarded free plays that could be redeemed for merchandise. We held that \u00a7 264B banned the possession of these machines. We noted that \u00a7 246 required a liberal construction of the gaming laws in order \u201cto prevent the mischiefs intended to be provided against.\u201d After studying the legislative history of \u00a7 264B, we determined that the General Assembly intended to ban \u201cany ... machines that furnished gratification or reward to a winning player other than further free plays.\u201d 251 Md. at 666, 248 A.2d 479. Thus, we concluded that ch. 617, \u00a7 4 repealed local Calvert County laws to the extent that they authorized the use of slot machines. <em>Id. </em>at 669, 248 A.2d 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In <em>State v. 158 Gaming Devices, </em>304 Md. 404, 499 A.2d 940 (1985), we again had to determine whether certain devices came within \u00a7 264B\u2019s definition of slot machine. We held that \u00a7 264B banned the possession of all such machines adapted for gambling. Thus, \u201ca free-play device, equipped with ... odds mechanisms, a meter for recording the number of free plays released, or other recognized indicia of a gambling device\u201d came within the statutory ban. 304 Md. at 432, 499 A.2d 940. In addition, we noted that slot machines are contraband per se because they are inherently illegal to possess. <em>Id. </em>at 433, 499 A.2d 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In <em>American Legion v. State, </em>294 Md. 1, 447 A.2d 842 (1982), we addressed the relationship between \u00a7 255 and \u00a7 356, which makes it unlawful to conduct a lottery. At its club in Washington County, the American Legion sold packs of tickets from a jar that offered the purchaser a chance to win cash prizes, either instantly or when all the tickets from a particular jar were sold. The State argued that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>activity constituted the operation of a lottery in contravention of \u00a7 356. We rejected this contention. First, we noted that the legislature had always distinguished between gaming and lotteries. 294 Md. at 6, 447 A.2d 842 (quoting <em>Bender v. Arundel Arena, </em>248 Md. 181, 189, 236 A.2d 7 (1967)). In fact, we noted that the provisions relating to lotteries and gambling appear in separate subtitles of Art. 27. Then we determined that the General Assembly did not intend that activities within the scope of \u00a7 255 be considered lotteries. <em>Id. </em>[294 Md.] at 8, 447 A.2d 842. Because the American Legion\u2019s activities involved an activity within the scope of \u00a7 255, we held that it had not violated \u00a7 356. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 447 A.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The organizations in this case rely heavily on <em>American Legion. </em>According to them, we construed \u00a7 255 in that case to allow covered organizations to conduct any type of gambling activities. Thus, they argue, \u00a7 255 exempts eligible organizations from \u00a7 264B\u2019s ban on the possession of slot machines. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In <em>American Legion, </em>we had to determine which subtitle of Art. 27 governed the Legion\u2019s activity. Because Maryland had traditionally drawn a distinction between games of chance and schemes of lottery, we concluded that the gaming subtitle, rather than the lottery subtitle, applied. We also noted that the activity involved chance books, one of the expressly permitted activities listed in \u00a7 255(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">This case, however, involves two provisions of the same subtitle: \u00a7 264B outlawing slot machines and \u00a7 255(b) permitting certain gaming activities. Specifically, we are faced with interpreting the meaning of a general phrase, \u201cany other gaming device,\u201d following a list of particular items. The other devices listed are not inherently illegal; they only become so when used for gambling purposes. The doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>then, would dictate that we construe \u201cany other gaming device\u201d to include only devices similar to the ones listed\u2014those legal to possess when not used for gaming purposes. <em>158 Gaming Devices, supra, </em>304 Md. at 429 n. 12, 499 A.2d 940; <em>State v. Sinclair &amp; Sinwellan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Corp., 274 Md. 646, 658, 337 A.2d 703 </em>(1975); <em>Giant of Md. v. State\u2019s Attorney, 274 </em>Md. 158, 167, 334 A.2d 107 (1975). Application of this doctrine would exclude slot machines from the phrase \u201cany other gaming device.\u201d <em>See 158 Gaming Devices, supra, </em>304 Md. at 433, 499 A.2d 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">We think that this result accords with the legislative intent. Both <em>158 Gaming Devices </em>and <em>Chesapeake Beach </em>clearly indicate our belief that the General Assembly intended a total abolition of slot machines adapted for gambling. In those cases, we relied heavily on the Emory Commission Report in determining the meaning of \u00a7 264B. As noted above, that report acknowledged that many nonprofit organizations operated slot machines; however, the report did not recommend any exemption from its proposed statewide ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The General Assembly rejected on at least four occasions proposed amendments of \u00a7 264B that would have exempted certain organizations from its coverage. As earlier indicated, two such amendments were passed by the legislature, but vetoed by the Governor. The 1987 General Assembly passed ch. 157 to amend \u00a7 264B to allow nonprofit organizations in eight Eastern Shore counties to own slot machines. These persistent attempts to amend \u00a7 264B indicate that the 1963 General Assembly did not intend to exempt any organizations from \u00a7 264B\u2019s reach. <em>See Vournas v. Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 123, 129, 476 A.2d 705 (1984); <em>Demory Brothers v. Bd. of Pub. Works, 273 </em>Md. 320, 326, 329 A.2d 674 (1974); <em>Bosley v. Dorsey, </em>191 Md. 229, 240, 60 A.2d 691 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Furthermore, \u00a7 264B, in uncodified \u00a7 4, provided that it repealed all inconsistent laws. Clearly, if \u00a7 255(b) allowed possession of slot machines prior to the enactment of \u00a7 264B, that provision would be inconsistent with the blanket prohibition of slot machines. Thus, \u00a7 4 mandated the repeal of \u00a7 255(b) to the extent of its inconsistency with \u00a7 264B. <em>Chesapeake Beach, supra, </em>251 Md. at 669, 248 A.2d 479; <em>see also Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Schloss</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>berg, </em>306 Md. 48, 61, 63, 507 A.2d 172 (1986); <em>Dep't of Nat. Resources v. France, </em>277 Md. 432, 460, 357 A.2d 78 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The broad interpretation of \u201cany gaming device\u201d proposed by the organizations in this case would render the list of particular devices surplusage. If the General Assembly intended to authorize the use of any and all gambling devices, it would not have listed the particular devices. In addition, it would not have amended \u00a7 255 in 1981 to allow a different group of activities in St. Mary\u2019s County. We thus reiterate that we construe \u201cany other gaming device\u201d to include only devices similar to the ones listed, namely, those legal to possess when not used for gaming purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In light of the provisions of \u00a7 264B, therefore, we conclude that, at the time of the seizures in this case, the phrase \u201cany other gaming device\u201d in \u00a7 255(b) did not permit the organizations to own and operate slot machines. Such devices, being contraband per se, were properly seized by the police.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY FOR THE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\">.
