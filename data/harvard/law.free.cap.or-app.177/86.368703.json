ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(i). Accordingly we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Respondent and petitioners were coworkers. Tension between respondent and petitioners apparently began in 1998 when Schiffner chose Rogers rather than respondent for a promotion. Respondent suspected that Schiffner and Rogers were having an affair and believed that Rogers had received the promotion because of that relationship. Consequently, respondent filed an internal ethics grievance with his employer, which was ultimately rejected for of lack of evidence. In September 1998, respondent resigned from his position in lieu of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Respondent decided to obtain proof of the suspected affair and determined that the most likely time for illicit meetings would be early in the mornings when Rogers ordinarily worked out at a gym. At about 5:00 a.m. on December 8, 1998, respondent drove near Rogers\u2019s home and saw that Rogers\u2019s truck was not there. He then went to the gym where Rogers usually worked out and confirmed that Rogers\u2019s truck was not there. Finally, respondent proceeded to Schiffner\u2019s apartment, where he found Rogers\u2019s truck parked nearby. Respondent took photographs both of Rogers\u2019s truck and of Schiffner\u2019s apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>On December 11 and December 28, 1998, respondent again drove past Rogers\u2019s home and gym early in the morning to verify Rogers\u2019s absence and then proceeded to Schiffner\u2019s apartment. On both of those occasions, he again took photos of Rogers\u2019s truck and of Schiffner\u2019s apartment complex. During the December 11 episode, respondent waited and watched Schiffner\u2019s door until he observed Rogers leave at 6:20 a.m. On December 28, one of Schiffner\u2019s neighbors \u201cnearly stumbled\u201d over respondent as he was poised with a video camera, waiting to film Rogers leaving Schiffner\u2019s apartment. Concerned that he \u201chad been discovered,\u201d respondent abandoned his efforts to document the suspected affair further.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Although the record is unclear, it appears that Schiffher became aware of respondent\u2019s presence outside her apartment on at least one of those occasions. There is no evidence that she told anyone about respondent\u2019s conduct or expressed any contemporaneous concern about, or experienced any contemporaneous apprehension from, his presence outside her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">From December 28, 1998, to August 16, 1999, respondent\u2019s interactions with petitioners \u2014 both direct and indirect \u2014 ceased. Then, between August 16, 1999, and December 15, 1999, respondent had several conversations with four people \u2014 Hemmer, Scott, Parks, and Pilgrim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014 about his past employment and his efforts to document petitioners\u2019 suspected affair. During respondent\u2019s conversations with Hemmer, Scott, and Pilgrim, he became visibly angry to the point that they were each concerned that respondent might act violently towards petitioners. For example, Pilgrim testified that \u201cin light of everything that goes on in our society today and all of the other violence and things that take place, that I felt that there could have been some potential harm with regards to [petitioners].\u201d Consequently, they each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>related the substance of those conversations either to their supervisors or to petitioners directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Respondent\u2019s conversation with Parks occurred on November 23, 1999, during a break from work. In that conversation, respondent told Parks that he had been \u201cblacklisted\u201d by the state and explained how he had been denied a promotion as a consequence of an affair between a male coworker and his female supervisor. Respondent went on to tell Parks how he had waited outside his female coworker\u2019s apartment and had taken photographs to document the affair.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">During that conversation, respondent neither threatened petitioners nor mentioned petitioners by name. At one point during the conversation, in response to a question from Parks, respondent noted that he did have a permit to carry a concealed weapon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But as Parks testified, respondent \u201cdidn\u2019t appear angry or hostile. I thought he thought of himself to me more of a victim than anything else.\u201d Nevertheless, Parks was concerned by respondent\u2019s efforts to document the suspected affair. Consequently, Parks later mentioned the conversation to a coworker, who urged her to tell her supervisor. On December 2, 1999, acting on that advice, Parks discussed the conversation with her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">On December 3,1999, petitioners filed stalking complaints against respondent with the Oregon State Police. ORS 163.744. After two evidentiary hearings on those complaints, the circuit court issued the permanent SPOs sought by petitioners in January 2000. In a letter ruling accompanying those orders, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201cI find that a Stalking Order should be issued in favor of Petitioners Schiffner and Rogers since [Banks] admitted that he had \u2018contacted\u2019 them as that term is used in ORS 163.730(3)(c) by waiting outside their home. Mr. Banks admitted taking photographs of [Rogers\u2019s] vehicle when it was parked at [Schiffner\u2019s] home. [Parks] testified that [Banks] had spoken with her about his negative feeling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>towards [Schiffher] and [Rogers] and in the same conversation stated that at that time he had a concealed weapons permit. I do believe that it is objectively reasonable for [Schiffner] and [Rogers] to be alarmed by [Banks\u2019s] \u2018contact.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">On appeal, respondent argues that the circuit court erred in issuing the SPOs because the testimony at hearing failed to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the statutory requirements for granting an SPO were satisfied. ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B). As amplified below, we conclude that respondent\u2019s conduct in attempting to document the suspected affair on December 8, 11, and 28, 1998, constituted \u201crepeated and unwanted contact.\u201d ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(i). However, we further conclude that respondent\u2019s conversations with third parties in the fall of 1999 did not constitute \u201ccontacts\u201d within the meaning of the anti-stalking statutes. Finally, we conclude that petitioners failed to prove that they were alarmed or coerced by the December 1998 contacts as opposed to the fall 1999 events. Because proof of alarm or coercion arising from repeated and unwanted contacts is a prerequisite to the issuance of an SPO, <em>see </em>ORS 163.728(2)(a)(B)(i), the court erred in issuing the SPOs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B) allows a court to enter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\u201cA court\u2019s stalking protective order if the court finds by a perponderance of the evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201c(i) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">\u201c(ii) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201c(iii) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">In construing the statute, we look first to its text in context, giving common words their \u201cplain, natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). The unambiguous requirements of subparagraph (i) are several: the person against whom the SPO is sought must act with intent\u2014 either intentionally, knowingly or recklessly; that action must constitute a contact as defined by ORS 163.730(3); that person\u2019s contacts must be repeated and unwanted by the other person; the contacts must be with the person seeking the SPO or with a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household as defined by ORS 163.730(4), (5); and the contact must cause alarm to or coerce the other person as defined by ORS 163.730(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">That last requirement warrants further examination because of its relevance to the facts presented here. The plain language of the statute indicates that there must be a causal relationship between the contact and the alarm or coercion felt by the other person \u2014 the alarm or coercion must arise from the contact. Because the legislature did not limit the proximity of that causal relationship, the contexts from which the causal relationship may occur are diverse. Perhaps most obvious is where alarm arises contemporaneously with the contact. In that instance, there is no question that the alarm has arisen directly from the contact. However, there are also instances where alarm may arise from a contact, yet not contemporaneously with the contact. First, a person may become aware of a contact that initially raises no concern to the other person, yet upon later reflection by the other person causes that person alarm. Second, the other person may be unaware of a contact or a series of contacts, but when the person later learns of the contact(s), the person becomes alarmed. <em>See Boyd v. Essin, </em>170 Or App 509, 517, 12 P3d 1003 (2000), <em>rev den </em>331 Or 674 (2001) (\u201cIt is sufficient if the act, <em>when learned, </em>gives rise to an unwanted relationship or association between the petitioner and the respondent.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>(Emphasis added.)). Finally, instances may arise where the other person initially believes a contact to be innocuous but, upon obtaining further information about the person initiating the contact or the true nature of the contact itself, later understands the contact in a new light and only then becomes alarmed. The key to each of the above contexts, for purposes of determining whether or not an SPO should be issued, is that the alarm must arise from the contacts and not independently from events or information that do not constitute contacts under the statutory provision. And although the context surrounding the contacts may give added meaning to the contacts, <em>see Weatherly v. Wilkie, </em>169 Or App 257, 263, 8 P3d 251 (2000) (context of parties\u2019 history may give contacts added import or ominous meaning), the statute unambiguously requires that the other person\u2019s alarm arise from the contacts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The remaining subparagraphs, (ii) and (iii), limit when an SPO may be issued. The unambiguous language of subparagraph (ii) requires that the other person\u2019s alarm or coercion be objectively reasonable. Subparagraph (iii) limits the type of alarm that will warrant issuance of an SPO: the other person\u2019s alarm must be for his or her <em>personal </em>safety or <em>the personal </em>safety of an immediate family member or household member. Only when all of the above requirements and limitations are met may a court issue an SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">With the statute so understood, our disposition turns on the resolution of two issues: First, did respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>engage in repeated and unwanted contact with either petitioner \u2014 and, if so, what precisely were those contacts? And, second, did petitioners actually experience alarm or coercion arising from those contacts?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">We first address what conduct by respondent constituted contacts within the meaning of the anti-stalking statutes. ORS 163.730(3). On appeal, as at hearing, petitioners argue that the universe of potentially actionable contacts include both respondent\u2019s conduct in December 1998 and his subsequent conversations with third parties between August and November 1999. Respondent acknowledges that his attempt to document the affair in December 1998 arguably constitute contacts but asserts that his subsequent conversations with third parties \u2014 and particularly the conversation with Parks on which the trial court relied \u2014 were not contacts for purposes of ORS 163.730(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Respondent is correct. Turning first to respondent\u2019s conduct <em>vis-a-vis </em>Schiffner, respondent admits that, on three occasions in December 1998, he waited outside her apartment so he could obtain proof of the suspected affair. That conduct is explicitly covered by ORS 163.730(3)(c), which defines \u201ccontact\u201d to encompass \u201c[w]aiting outside the home * * * of the other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Conversely, respondent\u2019s later conversations with Hemmer, Scott, Parks, and Pilgrim do not constitute contacts as defined by ORS 163.730(3). In particular, although respondent expressed anger and frustration towards petitioners in those conversations, we are not persuaded that those conversations represented either an attempt to \u201ccommunicate with [petitioners] through a third person,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(f), of an intentional effort by respondent to affect petitioners\u2019 relationship with those persons. ORS 163.730(3)(h). Accordingly, those conversations do not fit into any of the enumerated types of contacts in ORS 163.730(3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even if those conversations did fit into one of the enumerated categories, they would not constitute \u201ccontacts\u201d in this instance. The Supreme Court has held that \u201ca contact based on communication must consist of a threat that convincingly expresses <em>to the addressee </em>the intention that it will be carried out, and that the actor has the ability to do so.\u201d <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 306, 977 P2d 379 (1999) (emphasis in original). Because the 1999 conversations were with third parties and did not contain any direct threats to petitioners, they do not constitute contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">A similar, albeit not identical, analysis applies to respondent\u2019s alleged contacts with Rogers. As noted, on more than one occasion in December 1998 respondent drove by Rogers\u2019s house to see whether Rogers was home, drove to Schiffner\u2019s apartment in search of Rogers, and then waited until he saw Rogers leave her apartment. The term \u201ccontact\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>encompasses both \u201c[following the other person,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(b), and \u201c[c]oming into the visual or physical presence of the other person,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(c). Respondent, by effectively following Rogers to Schiffner\u2019s apartment and then watching Rogers leave her apartment, both \u201cfollowed\u201d Rogers and came \u201cwithin his visual or physical presence.\u201d See <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>165 Or App 467, 474, 998 P2d 680 (2000) (\u201c[A] person is within another\u2019s \u2018visual or physical presence\u2019 when the person is capable of being seen \u2014 whether or not the person is in fact seen \u2014 or when the person is within physical calling distance.\u201d). Thus, respondent\u2019s December 1998 conduct constitutes contacts with respect to Rogers. However, as with Schiffner, respondent\u2019s later conversations with third parties do not constitute contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The issue thus reduces to whether petitioners (or either of them) were actually alarmed because of the December 1998 contacts. ORS 163.730(1) defines \u201calarm,\u201d as \u201cto cause apprehension or fear resulting from the perception of danger.\u201d <em>See also Delgado v. Souders, </em>146 Or App 580, 587, 934 P2d 1132, <em>rev allowed </em>326 Or 43 (1997) (\u201calarm,\u201d as it is used in ORS 163.730(1), \u201cultimately contemplate[s] <em>a reasonable apprehension of physical </em>harm\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Here, petitioners adduced no proof of alarm or coercion arising from the December 1998 contacts. Rather, their alarm arises from the anger and frustration respondent expressed to others almost a year after the contacts stopped. Furthermore, petitioners offer no explanation how the 1999 conversations paint the December 1998 contacts in a new light sufficient to arouse alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">This is a very close case. The vehemence of respondent\u2019s 1999 conversations was sufficient to cause three people to report those conversations to others out of fear that respondent might resort to violence against petitioners. Furthermore, we have no doubt that the alarm expressed by petitioner Schiffner is genuine. However, the 1999 conversations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>and the alarm arising from those conversations cannot form the basis for issuing an SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">In sum, petitioners failed to prove that they were actually alarmed or coerced by the December 1998 contacts, as opposed to the 1999 conversations. Consequently, no matter how censurable or potentially embarrassing respondent\u2019s conduct may have been, the court erred in issuing the SPOs.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"> In civil stalking proceedings, the party applying for relief is denominated the \u201cpetitioner\u201d and the party against whom relief is sought is the \u201crespondent.\u201d Obviously, that nomenclature can be confusing in an appeal like this, where the \u201crespondent\u201d below is the appellant, and the \u201cpetitioner\u201d below is the respondent. Thus, for consistency and in accordance with our own rules governing the designation of parties in briefs, ORAP 5.15, all references to \u201crespondent\u201d are to Banks and all references to \u201cpetitioners\u201d are to Rogers and Schiffner collectively. Nevertheless, for clarity, we will refer to each petitioner individually by his or her surname.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\"> At the time of those conversations, Hemmer and Pilgrim worked at Oreg1on Department of Transportation, Scott was an ex-employee of the Public Utilities Commission and was acquainted with Rogers, and Parks was a coworker of respondent, who at that time was working as a temporary employee at the Oregon Vocational Rehabilitation Division. Because the trial court relied on respondent\u2019s conversation with Parks, we recount the substance of that conversation in some detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\"> Respondent owned several firearms and commonly carried a handgun in his car, including during December 1998. Petitioners knew that respondent owned firearms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> Respondent also assigns error to the form SPO\u2019s prohibition against \u201c[cjommunicating with business or government entities with the intent of affecting some right or interest of the petitioner or the person to be protected if other than the petitioner.\u201d Defendant correctly notes that that language was derived from a former definition of \u201ccontact,\u201d ORS 163.730(3)(i) (1993), and has since been modified. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1995, ch 353, \u00a7 1. Given our disposition, we need not reach, and do not decide, that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\"> Two hypotheticals may illustrate the distinction between contextually informed alarm arising from a contact and alarm arising from later \u201cnoncontact\u201d conduct or expression:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">(1) \u201cA\u201d gives \u201cB\u201d a rose.

Conversely, the second hypothetical, assuming that C\u2019s conversation with E is not itself a contact, is not actionable in that D\u2019s alarm arises not from the contact, the giving of the rose \u2014 which, in fact, was nonthreatening \u2014 but from C\u2019s subsequent threatening statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b122-5\"> As amplified below, we find that neither petitioner actually experienced alarm from any contact. Consequently, we do not address whether such alarm, if it had been experienced, would have been objectively reasonable. <em>See </em>ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(ii).

I also agree with the the majority that the stalking protective order (SPO) issued to Rogers should be reversed. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Schiffner did not experience alarm from the December 1998 contacts as informed by respondent\u2019s later actions. I would accordingly affirm the SPO issued to Schiffner.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The governing statute here is ORS 163.738, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">\u201c(2)(a) * * * The court may enter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">\u201c(B) A court\u2019s stalking protective order if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">\u201c(i) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">\u201c(ii) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-15\">\u201c(iii) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">I agree with the majority that, under ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B), \u201cthere must be a causal relationship between the contact and the alarm or coercion felt by the other person \u2014 the alarm or coercion must arise from the contact.\u201d 177 Or App at 92. In my opinion, Schiffner established that causal connection in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The majority acknowledges that \u201cthe contexts from which the causal relationship may occur are diverse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority sets out a number of those possible contexts, including \u201cinstances * * * where the other person initially believes a contact to be innocuous but, upon obtaining further information about the person initiating the contact or the true nature of the contact itself, later understands the contact in a new light and only then becomes alarmed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93. According to the majority, the evidence that Schiffner presented was insufficient to establish that she was alarmed by the December 1998 contacts when she further understood their nature in light of information she later obtained about respondent. I disagree with that reading of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In my view, the record in this case supports the conclusion that Schiffner was not initially alarmed in December 1998. The record, however, also supports the conclusion that, after Schiffner found out about respondent\u2019s continuing and virulent anger at her, she viewed respondent\u2019s presence outside her house and attempts to videotape her in a new light and was alarmed by them. Schiffner testified that \u201c[a]lmost every morning when I get up before I turn on the lights I look outdoors to see if I can see him outside.\u201d That Schiffner now takes additional precautions based on her apprehension that respondent will repeat the kind of contact in which he engaged in December 1998 indicates to me that it is her knowledge of that contact itself \u2014 viewed through the lens of respondent\u2019s later conduct \u2014 that caused her alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Schiffner presented sufficient evidence to establish that she experienced actual, reasonable apprehension for her personal safety because of respondent\u2019s December 1998 contacts after she became aware of his later interactions with third parties. Because I would hold that Schiffner established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>actual, reasonable apprehension for personal safety as required by ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(iii), I would reach respondent\u2019s argument that Schiffner\u2019s alarm was not objectively reasonable as required by ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(ii). ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(ii) requires that it be \u201cobjectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact\u201d before a stalking protective order may issue. \u201cAlarm\u201d is defined to mean \u201cto cause apprehension or fear resulting from the perception of danger.\u201d ORS 163.730(1). We have construed \u201cdanger\u201d to involve a reasonable apprehension of physical harm. <em>Delgado v. Souders, </em>146 Or App 580, 587, 934 P2d 1132, <em>rev allowed </em>326 Or 43 (1997). The question is not whether any of us would have felt apprehension or fear from the perception of danger of physical harm as a result of respondent\u2019s December 1998 contacts. The question is whether Schiffner\u2019s alarm was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">That question must be answered in light of the surrounding circumstances that make up a victim\u2019s \u201csituation.\u201d ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(ii). In assessing whether a petitioner\u2019s alarm is objectively reasonable, we must consider contacts both collectively and in the context of the parties\u2019 relationship and other circumstances known to the petitioner. <em>See Boyd v. Essin, </em>170 Or App 509, 518, 12 P3d 1003 (2000), <em>rev den </em>331 Or 674 (2001). In <em>Boyd, </em>we stated that contacts that might appear innocuous when viewed in isolation may take on a different character when viewed in the context of other behavior by a respondent. <em>Id. See also Weatherly v. Wilkie, </em>169 Or App 257, 263, 8 P3d 251 (2000) (context of the parties\u2019 history may give contacts \u201cadded import or ominous meaning\u201d). Viewed in context, the alarm experienced by Schiffner was objectively reasonable. She knew that respondent was angry at her because he believed that the affair had caused Schiffner to pass him over for a promotion. He had been upset enough about that incident to file a grievance. She also knew that he had a permit for a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In my opinion, the lapse of time between the contacts and the filing of the stalking petition supports, rather than undercuts, the reasonableness of Schiffner\u2019s alarm. That respondent was still angry more than eight months later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>about an incident involving petitioners could cause a reasonable person to be alarmed that respondent was obsessive about what he perceived as unfairness on Schiffner\u2019s part. Several of the third-party witnesses testified that, when respondent approached them, he became upset to the extent that it affected him physically. The third-party witnesses were not close friends of respondent\u2019s. Many were his former coworkers, who indicated that they did not know him well. However, when they ran into him by chance, nearly the first thing he brought up was how angry he was with petitioners. Viewed in that light, an objectively reasonable person who knew what respondent had said and how he had acted to the third-party witnesses could feel a level of alarm about the earlier contacts beyond what he or she had felt earlier. Schiffner\u2019s testimony is detailed enough to allow the inference that she was told sufficient substance of the third-party interactions to impute to her knowledge of those aspects of the interactions. I would conclude that Schiffner\u2019s alarm was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d and, accordingly, would affirm the issuance of Schiffner\u2019s SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Because I would affirm the issuance of Schiffner\u2019s SPO, I would reach respondent\u2019s second assignment of error. In that assignment, respondent contends that the trial court erred in including the following restriction in the SPO: \u201cCommunicating with business or government entities with the intent of affecting some right or interest of the petitioner or the person to be protected if other than the petitioner.\u201d Respondent argues that restrictions on contacts with government entities have not been permissible under the stalking statutes since the legislature removed the phrase \u201cor government\u201d from the above quoted definition of contact in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Respondent is correct. Under ORS 163.738(2)(b), a court may include in the list of types of contact from which a respondent must refrain \u201call contact listed in ORS 163.730 * * Communicating with a business entity is currently a form of contact listed in ORS 163.730(3)(i), but communicating with a government entity has not been a form of contact since 1995. Or Laws 1995, ch 353, \u00a7 1 (deleting phrase \u201cor government\u201d from ORS 163.730(3)(i)); Or Laws 1995, ch 353, \u00a7 12 (effective date of act June 14, 1995). The court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>entering an SPO that limited respondent\u2019s contacts with government entities, and I would remand with instructions to correct Schiffner\u2019s SPO to delete the phrase \u201cor government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">As noted above, I concur with the majority\u2019s disposition as to Rogers\u2019s SPO. Rogers\u2019s testimony is far more cursory. The only indication in the record that Rogers knew what those witnesses had said is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\u201c[The court]: Mr. Rogers, is your statement similar to these folks here; someone else told you that this man maybe made threats against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">\u201cA: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">That testimony is not sufficient to establish, or to allow an inference, that Rogers knew enough of the substance of respondent\u2019s statements to the third-party witnesses to make any alarm he experienced \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d Accordingly, I concur in the majority\u2019s reversal of the issuance of Rogers\u2019s stalking protective order, but for the reasons discussed above I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s reversal of the issuance of Schiffner\u2019s stalking protective order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
