He now appeals from the lower court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 motion which was based upon his contention that the pre-sentence report which stated that he \u201ccomes from a notorious family of hoodlums\u201d was highly prejudicial and unwarranted and that the report failed to include several letters that he had sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>mitted to the probation officer containing information favorable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">The lower court, after disposing of appellant\u2019s contention, went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-6\">\u201cThe Court is satisfied that no fact material to this petition is in dispute even reading the petition as favorable to petitioner\u2019s cause as possible, the contentions border on the frivolous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">From our own examination of the record, we are satisfied that this assessment of appellant\u2019s contentions is correct. The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1174-23\">. Carbonaro v. United States, 428 F.2d 795 (8 Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
