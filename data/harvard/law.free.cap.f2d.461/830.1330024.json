The merchandise is imported from France in coils of 660 feet in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>length, and is wound on plastic reels. Although the precise composition of the merchandise is not indicated, it is not disputed that it is a synthetic material.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention in the court below, and its principal argument here, is that the imported tennis string should not have been classified as cordage of man-made fibers but rather as lawn-tennis equipment and parts thereof under item 734.88, TSUS. It urges that the imported merchandise is \u201cput up and packaged for retail sale\u201d and, therefore, should be classified under the applicable provisions for lawn tennis equipment and parts pursuant to headnote l(ix) of Schedule 3, Part 1, Subpart E.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The Government notes that Congress has expressly defined \u201ccordage\u201d as \u201cassemblages of textile fibers or yarns, in approximately cylindrical form and of continuous length, whether or not bleached, colored, or treated, designed and chiefly used as an end product, and comprising cable, rope, cord, and twine\u201d (Schedule 3, part 2, headnote 1(a) ), and maintains that the merchandise falls squarely within that statutory definition. The Government also asserts that appellant\u2019s challenge to the applicability of the \u201ccordage\u201d provision is based on its unproven contention that the merchandise is \u201cput up and packaged for retail sale.\u201d Hence, it contends that the appellant has neither established the correctness of the claimed classification, nor rebutted the presumed correctness of the classification of the customs officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The following are the pertinent provisions of the Tariff Schedules of the United States:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-8\">Schedule 3, Part 1, Subpart E \u2014 Man-made Fibers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayp\">Subpart E headnotes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-9\">1.

It has been shown only that the coil is sold, as packaged, to sporting goods dealers and tennis professionals. The individual customer may select Elascord when he brings in his racket to be restrung, but there is no evidence that he buys a whole coil. In fact, the Victor [Sports] cat-alogue * * * indicates the contrary. It lists string per set of 22 feet and 11 feet, and per string of 22 feet. It also lists coils of 35 feet and reels of 660 feet and 1800 feet. It would be unreasonable to assume, without evidence, that a reel of 660 feet \u2014 enough to string about 20 tennis rackets \u2014 is a retail package. Thus, plaintiff\u2019s claim that the merchandise is classifiable as parts of lawn-tennis equipment has not been sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-24\">The words \u201cracket strings put up and packaged for retail sale,\u201d used in the pertinent headnote, are not defined in the Tariff Schedules, the Tariff Classification Study, nor in the United States Tariff Commission\u2019s Summaries of Trade and Tariff Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-25\">Under these circumstances we have examined the various lexicographic definitions to ascertain the meaning of \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>tail\u201d and \u201cretail sale\u201d. The following definitions have proven helpful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-4\">WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY UNABRIDGED 1968</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">retail. 1: to sell in small quantities (as the single yard, pound, gallon): to sell directly to the ultimate consumer (cloth) (groceries) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">retail: the sale of commodities or goods in small quantities to ultimate consumers \u2014 opposed to WHOLESALE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">WEBSTER\u2019S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY OF THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE, College Edition 1964</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">retail: the sale of goods or articles individually or in small quantities directly to the consumer: opposed to <em>wholesale.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">The courts have relied upon these and other lexicographic definitions in determining the meaning of the word \u201cretail\u201d. They have also found it necessary to determine whether sales were \u201cretail\u201d or \u201cwholesale\u201d. In Jenkins Brothers v. United States, 25 CCPA 90, 96, T.D. 49093 (1937), this court quoted the definition found in the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary which states that \u201cretail\u201d is the \u201c* * * selling of goods in small quantities especially by those who have bought in large quantities to resell at a profit.\u201d \u201cWholesale,\u201d on the other hand, refers to sales of a given item in larger quantities than a corresponding \u201cretail\u201d sale. Hence, wholesale sales denote \u201c \u2018selling * * * to retailers or jobbers rather than consumers.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. United States, 26 Cust.Ct. 642, 645 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">The Supreme Court of the United States in Roland Electrical Co. v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657, 674, 66 S.Ct. 413, 421, 90 L.Ed. 383 (1946), quoted with approval a statement from the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences (Yol. 13, p. 346) that the \u201c * * * distinguishing feature of the retail trade * * * consists in selling merchandise to ultimate consumers.\u201d It was noted that the distinction between \u201cretail\u201d and \u201cwholesale\u201d is not merely between the size and volume of the sales, but also between the types of purchasers. Whereas the wholesale purchaser is influenced by a profit or business motive, the retail purchaser \u201cis actuated solely by a desire to satisfy his own personal wants or those of his family or friends through the personal use of the commodity.\u201d (Beckman and Engle in Wholesaling Principles and Practice (1937), p. 25, quoted in 326 U. S. at 674, 66 S.Ct. 413). It is therefore made clear that sales to a customer, who purchases goods for the purpose of resale \u201cin one form or another,\u201d constitutes \u201cwholesaling\u201d and not \u201cretailing.\u201d (Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, Vol. 15, p. 411, quoted in 326 U.S. at 674, 66 S.Ct. 413). In the <em>Roland Co. </em>case, the Supreme Court also stated that \u201cGovernmental usage makes the same distinction on the basis of use for which the goods are purchased,\u201d and, among others, quoted from a Bureau of Census publication that sales of goods to \u201cprofessional users\u201d are \u201cwholesale sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">Bearing the foregoing in mind, it cannot be said that the court below erred in concluding that only tennis string put up and packaged for sale in small quantities for ultimate consumers was to be classified as lawn-tennis equipment, and parts thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">An examination of the record reveals that, at the trial, appellant succeeded in showing only that Elascord is sold to \u201csporting goods dealers and the tennis professional.\u201d It did not prove that these were sales to the ultimate consumer. Consequently the Customs Court could not have found that the merchandise consisted of \u201cracket strings put up and packaged for retail sale.\u201d Therefore, since it cannot be said that the Customs Court erred on the evidence before it, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">It is to be noted that the construction given by the Customs Court to the entire statutory scheme is in accord with the administrative ruling of the Treasury Department which applies to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>merchandise at bar. The ruling states (100 Treas. Dec. 625, 632):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-4\">A material approximately .058 inch in diameter (15 gauge) composed of mul-tifilament continuously extruded man-made fiber yarn of white and blue color, encased in a hollow tube of man-made fiber, the white and blue filaments being plied so that the finished product presents a spiral effect, if imported in lengths of 35 feet, the amount required for stringing of one tennis racket, classifiable under the provision for Lawn-tennis equipment, and parts thereof: * * * Other, in item 734.88, TSUS. <em>If imported in lengths of 660 feet, on reels, classifiable under the provision for Cordage: </em>* * * <em>Of man-made fibers in item 316.60 TSUS. </em>Bureau letter dated May 5, 1965. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">This ruling cannot be said to be unreasonable or unwarranted by the pertinent statutory language. See National Labor Relations Board v. Denver Building and Construction Trades Council, 341 U.S. 675, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284 (1951); United States v. American Trucking Assoc., Inc., 310 U.S. 534, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). Since the administrative ruling finds support in both lexicographic definitions and judicial decisions, clearly it has a \u201creasonable basis in law.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U.S. 111, 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Alternatively, appellant seeks to have the merchandise classified as parts of lawn-tennis equipment independently of whether it is packaged for retail sale. In essence, appellant contends that the tennis strings are parts of tennis equipment, and that this classification is more specific than the classification as cordage.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">We think that argument is without merit. In the words of the court below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-11\">* * * the racket strings of man-made fibers classifiable under schedule 7, part 5D, are limited to those put up and packaged for retail sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-12\">* * * all parts of a statute must be read together and all relevant head-notes are to be considered in determining Congressional intent. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc. v. United States [428 F.2d 856] 57 CCPA 115, C.A.D. 988 (1970). We conclude that it was the intent of Congress that tennis racket strings of man-made fiber put up and packaged for retail sale be classified under item 734.88 (schedule 7, part 5D), as other lawn-tennis equipment and parts, and that tennis racket strings of man-made fiber, not so packaged, be classified under item 316.60 as cordage of man-made fiber. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">We are in agreement with that reasoning of the Customs Court. Its decision and judgment are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A9n\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">BALDWIN, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-25\">.
