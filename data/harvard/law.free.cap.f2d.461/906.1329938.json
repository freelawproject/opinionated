In all, eight defendants were originally indicted for the conspiracy and various individual substantive counts. After various guilty pleas, deaths, and dismissals, only Cook and defendants Chapman and Renderer went to trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chapman and Renderer were granted directed verdicts on the conspiracy charge at the close of the government\u2019s case, leaving only Cook before the jury on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The evidence introduced at trial indicates the following. On December 16, 1968, Jimmy Jack Holmes, an accomplished thief of some repute, with an accomplice, embarked on what proved to be a profitable venture. On that date, Holmes, accompanied by Willie Urquhart, burglarized a post office in Sani-bel, Florida, from which he stole approximately $17,000 in unused postage stamps. The loot was taken to Miami, Florida, where Holmes, as a result of an earlier phone call to Bill Urquhart, his Tampa \u201cconnection,\u201d contacted defendant Cook. Arrangements were made for a meeting between Cook and the burglar at a local Toddle House, where an agreement was made that Holmes was to receive in turn for the stolen merchandise thirty-five per cent of the stamps' face value. The parties proceeded then to Cook\u2019s residence, where the stamps and approximately $5,500 were exchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">On January 18, 1969, Holmes, with Willie Urquhart and another burglar, Stafford Allison, committed a second burglary at a post office in Brooksville, Florida. The stamps stolen at this burglary, worth approximately $87,000, were also taken to Miami. Holmes phoned Cook\u2019s residence and was told by Cook\u2019s wife that her husband was not present but that another fence would be made available if the burglars would come on over. Upon arriving at the Cook residence, Holmes met Herman (Hy) Gordon and his partner, defendant Chapman, who purchased the stamps for an agreed price of $32,000, or thirty-five per cent of their face value. Gordon paid Holmes $3,000 as a down payment, and Holmes returned to the Cook residence a week later and was paid an additional $29,000 by Cook\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">On March 27, 1969, Holmes, Allison and Urquhart executed a third burglary at the Azalea Park post office in Orlando, Florida. Shortly thereafter, at approximately 12:30 a. m., the burglars arrived at the Cook residence. Allison and Holmes took a foot locker containing the stolen stamps, in the face amount of $40,000, into Cook\u2019s house while Urquhart waited in the car. A police car arrived in front of the house shortly thereafter, and the police arrested Urquhart as Holmes and Allison watched from the window of the house. Cook ordered the burglars to get rid of the merchandise, and the burglars complied by throwing the locker into a canal in back of Cook\u2019s house. Approximately two weeks later, Cook represented to Holmes that he, along with another unidentified party, had fished the water-soaked stamps out of the canal but had received only $3,000 for their sale. He further stated that he had paid $1,500 to his fellow fisherman and offered to split the remaining $1,500 with Holmes. At about this same time, approximately the same quantity of water-soaked stamps turned up in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>hands of defendant Renderer, who ultimately sold them to Otto Powers at the low rate of twenty-five per cent of their face value because of their water-soaked condition. Powers later pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The government proved that Holmes, acting with various other individuals, committed seven other post office burglaries. In each case, the proceeds were brought to Miami and sold directly to Cook or, in Cook\u2019s absence, to another party at Cook\u2019s residence. On two other occasions, stamps in the approximate amount of those taken in the burglaries subsequently turned up in the hands of Renderer, Chapman, or both. Powers was each time summoned from his home in Tampa by Renderer and purchased the stolen merchandise for approximately seventy per cent of its face value. Powers in turn would transport the stamps to New York where they were sold to various retailers for eighty per cent of their face value. Upon Powers\u2019 return to Miami, his supplier was paid the originally agreed price. In addition to these transactions, Powers admitted having had three direct transactions with Holmes for the purchase of post office burglary proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\"> Cook first complains of a fatal variance between the language of the indictment and the proof adduced at trial and of the trial court\u2019s refusal to sever his trial from that of Chapman and Renderer. Both these complaints are based on defendant\u2019s contention that he was charged with a single conspiracy, whereas two separate conspiracies were proven \u2014 one to burglarize post offices and one to distribute the loot. The indictment charges a conspiracy to burglarize post offices and alleges that a part of the conspiracy was the intent to distribute the proceeds of the burglaries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Assuming that the indictment alleged, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>the evidence showed, separate conspiracies, each of which was participated in by some but not all of the named members, we do not deem Cook to have been prejudiced by his being tried with Chapman and Renderer. Defendant\u2019s reliance on Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), is misplaced. <em>Kotteakos </em>required that such a variance affect substantial rights by creating the possibility of a transfer of guilt from one group of conspirators to another unconnected group. Assuming only separate conspiracies were shown, a review of the record in the instant case convinces us that sufficient evidence was introduced to prove Cook\u2019s participation in both the conspiracy to burglarize and the conspiracy to distribute the proceeds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under such circumstances, Cook could not have been prejudiced by being tried with both sets of conspirators. <em>See </em>United States v. Walker, 5th Cir. 1972, 453 F.2d 1205; Monroe v. United States, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 234 F.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Cook next contends that his conviction must be reversed because Holmes, Allison, and Powers, defendant\u2019s alleged co-conspirators, testified that they had earlier pleaded guilty to the same conspiracy charged to defendant. In United States v. Harrell, 5th Cir. 1970, 436 F.2d 606, this Court reversed appellant\u2019s conviction in part on the basis that evidence of his co-conspirator\u2019s guilty plea was admitted by the court without proper foundation or instruction. A reversal was required despite the fact that, as in the instant case, defendant\u2019s counsel made no objection at the time of the revelation and made no subsequent request to the court for a limiting instruction. We assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>without in any way deciding that <em>Harrell, </em>wherein the only person possibly a co-conspirator of defendant was forced to testify as to his prior guilty plea, is analogous to the instant case, wherein the admissions of Holmes, Allison, and Powers did not <em>necessarily </em>indicate participation by Cook. We nevertheless find no error here because Cook\u2019s attorney himself caused the evidence of the witnesses\u2019 guilty pleas to enter the case. The primary contention of the defense throughout the trial was that the testimony of these alleged co-conspirators was perjured in order that they might receive lighter sentences for their crimes. To prove this \u201cdeal,\u201d it was necessary to show their pleas and the light sentences received.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Cook\u2019s defense counsel attempted with full vig- or. He cannot so act and then sit back and hope that the trial court fails to give the limiting instructions required by <em>Harrell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Cook next complains that the prosecution and the trial judge allegedly violated a pre-trial stipulation and thereby prejudiced his case. This contention is based on the following facts. After the arrival of the police and Willie Urquhart\u2019s arrest at the Cook residence following the Azalea Park burglary, discussed previously, Cook called his attorney Vernell, who later represented him at trial. After the police left the neighborhood, Vernell arrived with a girl and another friend, Harrington, and took Holmes and Allison away with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Before trial, in order to avoid embarrassment to Vernell and to allow him to continue as defense attorney in accordance with Cook\u2019s wishes, the government agreed that the burglars, Holmes and Allison, would make no mention of any occurrences subsequent to their leaving Cook\u2019s residence. This was accomplished by the witnesses\u2019 simply stating, without further elaboration, that they left Cook\u2019s house after the incident. Vernell, however, during the presentation of the defendant\u2019s case, put Harrington on the stand. Harrington testified that after leaving Cook\u2019s house on the night in question, Holmes and Allison indicated by their conversations that Cook had known nothing of their illegal activity and wished no part in it. During his testimony, Harrington continually emphasized the presence of a third party, who was repeatedly referred to as the \u201cparty who I was with.\u201d The trial court, finding this to be an attempt by Cook\u2019s attorney to infer that the previous witnesses had withheld certain information from the government or that the government had something to hide, allowed Harrington to testify that Ver-nell was present at the time. The trial judge then informed the jury that the information was withheld from them to avoid embarrassing Vernell and to allow him to continue as counsel for Cook. Moreover, Holmes was recalled to the stand and testified, in refuting Harrington\u2019s testimony, that Vernell had arranged for their motel accommodations on the night in question and had represented himself as their attorney when they were stopped by the police a short distance from the Cook residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\"> Cook urges that the act of the trial court was a violation of the pretrial stipulation and destroyed his attorney\u2019s credibility in the eyes of the jury. We have no doubt that revealing this incident resulted in prejudice to Cook, but despite our sympathy with the defendant under such circumstances, we must agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling. Although the stipulation was violated, it is clear that Cook\u2019s attorney himself did the violating, or at least caused the violation by his actions. Upon Harrington\u2019s testimony, it was essential in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>fairness to the government to inform the jury fully of the occurrence and the reason for its not being disclosed in order to destroy the impression thus created. The only other alternative available to the trial court was the granting of a mistrial. It is clearly established that a mistrial should not be granted for prejudice flowing from a defense attorney\u2019s tactics which are prejudicial to his own case. <em>See </em>United States v. Wilson, 5th Cir. 1971, 439 F.2d 1081; United States v. Greenberg, 3d Cir. 1969, 419 F.2d 808; United States v. Licausi, 5th Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 1118. If this were not so, it would be easy to envision a halt to the entire criminal process. Under these circumstances, therefore, the trial judge must have discretion to admit rebuttal evidence to meet an issue raised by the defendant. <em>See </em>O\u2019Brien v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 522; Cotton v. United States, 8th Cir. 1966, 361 F.2d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">We recognize that a defendant is entitled to counsel freed from interests which might conflict with the interests of his client. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680, reh. den. sub. nom. Kretske v. U. S., 315 U.S. 827, 62 S.Ct. 629, 86 L.Ed. 1222 (1942); United States v. Puco, 2d Cir. 1971, 436 F.2d 761; Randazzo v. United States, 5th Cir. 1964, 339 F.2d 79; Greenberg v. United States, 1st Cir. 1960, 280 F.2d 472. In the instant situation, Vernell may have felt that it was necessary to protect his own interests in addition to those of his client. In Porter v. United States, 5th Cir. 1962, 298 F.2d 461, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-5\">The Constitution assures a defendant effective representation by counsel whether the attorney is one of his choosing or court-appointed. Such representation is lacking, however, if counsel, <em>unknown to the accused and without his knowledgeable assent, </em>is in a duplicitous position where his full talents \u2014 as a vigorous advocate having the single aim of acquittal by all means fair and honorable \u2014 are hobbled or fettered or restrained by commitments to others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">298 F.2d at 463 (emphasis added). In the instant case, however, Cook was fully aware of his attorney\u2019s involvement and the prejudice that might flow from revealing such facts to the jury. In spite of this, he expressed a desire that Vernell continue to represent him. We do not believe that such a conscious choice by Cook, with full knowledge of the possible conflict, coupled with a tactical mistake by the defense which made this possibility of conflict a reality, can warrant a mistrial, or a reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Cook finally argues that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s attitude toward and statements to and about his attorney during the trial. After a careful review of the record, we find that most of the statements complained of occurred outside the presence of the jury and the remainder were warranted, or at least not prejudicial. <em>See </em>United States v. Del Toro, 5th Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 181; Luttrell v. United States, 5th Cir. 1963, 320 F.2d 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-9\">. On the conspiracy count, the government originally indicted William Allison, Rick Chapman, Marianne Cook, Herman Gordon, Jimmy Jack Holmes, Roy Renderer, Otto Powers, and appellant here. Gordon died prior to trial; and defendants Holmes, Allison, and Powers pleaded guilty. The charges were dismissed against Marianne Cook.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-6\">.

Cook claims that there was no evidence to connect him to any of the burglaries other than proof that he purchased the proceeds. We recognize that, absent an agreement to advance a joint interest, such purchases and sales of stolen property would normally not constitute conspiratorial activity. <em>See </em>United States v. Ford, 7th Cir. 1963, 324 F.2d 950; United States v. Zeuli, 2d Cir. 1943, 137 F.2d 845; United States v. Koch, 2d Cir. 1940, 113 F.2d 982. In the instant case, however, proof was adduced that after one of the burglaries in question Cook requested Holmes to bring back some blank money orders on the next trip, and Holmes carried out the request. This evidence, coupled with the continuing nature of the activities between Holmes and Cook, fully support an inference that they were engaged in a conspiracy to burglarize post offices and distribute the proceeds for their mutual benefit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b977-7\">.
