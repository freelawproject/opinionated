(employer) seeks to set aside a Labor Board decision that it violated Sections 8(a) (1), 8(a) (3) and 8(a) (5) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We deny the employer\u2019s petition and grant the Board\u2019s cross-petition for enforcement of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-19\">The employer\u2019s work force in its neighborhood food store<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> numbered 19 when on December 22, 1969, employee Irene Burtniak began a Union <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> organizational drive. At that time she requested cards from the Union authorizing the Union to act as the employees\u2019 bargaining representative. On January 14 the Union orally requested discussion of a contract with the employer, and on January 15 it made a formal written demand for recognition. The employer on January 21 refused recognition, and the Union then filed charges with the Board alleging violation of Sections 8(a) (1), 8(a) (3) and 8(a) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-20\">The Examiner, after the hearing, concluded that the 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>charges were proven, but that the 8(a) (5) charge was not proven. The Board adopted the Examiner\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommendations, except as to the 8(a) (5) charge. The Board concluded that the employer had violated Section 8(a) (5) and it ordered the employer to bargain with the Union if requested to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The employees involved in the charges are Irene Burtniak and her daughter Lydia, Debra Romanchuk, and John Chorkawciw. All four were included as \u201cregular part time employees\u201d in the unit for which the Union claimed to be representative. Irene Burtniak had obtained signatures of the other three for Union authorization cards <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the period December 25 to December 31, 1969. Except for Irene Burtniak, the employees involved here were teen-age high school students.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The relevant testimony<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concerns a statement made by Pylawka over the telephone on the afternoon of January 14, and his separate conversations with each of the four employees within the following three day period. The conversations took place after two Union agents, on January 14, with seven authorization cards, had called on Pylawka at the store. When they disclosed their purpose to discuss representing the employees, Pylawka referred them to Datz-co, whose office as secretary of Self-Reliance was a few doors away. The employer\u2019s refusal to recognize the Union demand for recognition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The Examiner found that the employer violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act by coercive interrogation of John Chorkaw-ciw and Debra Romanchuk concerning their Union activities. In this appeal, however, the employer directs his argument only to the interrogation of John Chorkawciw.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">John Chorkawciw testified that on January 14 Pylawka asked him whether he had signed a Union card. John said he first denied signing, but then admitted signing, after Pylawka told him there was no use lying about it since Pylawka knew everyone who had signed. Pylawka in his testimony admitted talking to John about the Union, but denied saying he knew who had signed the cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">In cross-examination John was confronted with an affidavit made before the hearing. In the affidavit he had made no mention of Pylawka\u2019s inquiry concerning others who had signed the cards. The affidavit, except for this omission, was generally consistent with John\u2019s credited testimony. And the statement that he first denied signing a card, before admitting it, is significant. An employer\u2019s question concerning union activities which inspires fear among employees is unlawful under the Act, and here the initial denial of signing a card is one of the factors from which the employer\u2019s coercion might reasonably be inferred. Bourne v. N L R B, 332 F.2d 47, 48 (2nd Cir. 1964); N L R B v. My Store, Inc., 345 F.2d 494, 497 (7th Cir. 1965). Furthermore, the inquiry was directed toward a high school student, sixteen years of age. We think the Examiner was not required to find that Pylawka\u2019s interrogation of John was a mere innocent question for the lawful purpose of learning whether the Union had a card majority, as the letters were held to be in this court\u2019s opinion in Lake City Foundry Co. v. N L R B, 432 F.2d 1162, 1175 (7th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">In view of the context in which the inquiry was made, the Examiner did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>err in finding an 8(a) (1) violation. Pylawka knew that Union activity was in progress. The finding that the interrogation was coercive is indicated by John\u2019s age and his initial denial that he signed the card, and is supported by the whole evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The Examiner found that Irene Burtniak, her daughter Lydia, and Debra Romanchuk were discharged for their Union activities, in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) of the Act. If their testimony was properly credited,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the finding must be sustained as having substantial support in the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Assistant manager Kurylo knew in early December that Irene Burtniak was interested in organizing the employees. The Examiner could properly attribute his knowledge to Pylawka. Thereafter, on January 14 the Union representatives appeared at the store and talked to Py-lawka.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">1. <em>Irene Burtniak</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Irene Burtniak testified that she heard Pylawka talking on the telephone the afternoon of January 14 and that she heard him say, \u201cShe is here,\u201d and that he had no one to replace her. Later he told her that she did not know how \u201cstupid\u201d she was. The next afternoon he told her that she was \u201cstupid\u201d trying to be a \u201cunion leader\u201d and bringing the \u201cunion to my store.\u201d She testified that Pylawka told her to go home and not to come back until the Union troubles were over and to have her husband Basil talk to him. She left, and was not reemployed at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Pylawka testified that Irene Burtniak \u201cquit\u201d over a dispute concerning conditions of employment. He denied the telephone statements of January 14 and also Irene\u2019s version of their conversation the next day. Irene\u2019s husband Basil testified that he did talk to Pylawka who told him that Irene was at fault for the Union troubles of the store, and that she could not return to work until the troubles were over.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">We are not persuaded by the employer that Pylawka\u2019s testimony rather than Irene\u2019s should have been credited. Our reading of his testimony supports the Examiner\u2019s discrediting Pylawka\u2019s story. True, in her pre-hearing affidavit Irene did not state that Pylawka had accused her of being a \u201cunion leader\u201d or that Pylawka had used the word \u201cunion\u201d in referring to the \u201ctroubles.\u201d However, she said she later gave an oral statement when she recalled the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">The determination of whom to believe was for the Examiner. He observed Irene Burtniak when she was cross-examined about the omission in her affidavit and was in a proper position to evaluate her explanation. Furthermore, her husband appears to have been a credible witness. His testimony agreed with Py-lawka\u2019s that they discussed the conduct of his daughter Lydia. However, he also testified that Pylawka said Irene could not work until the Union troubles were over, since they were \u201cher fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">2. <em>Lydia, Burtniak</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-16\"> Lydia Burtniak testified that she was accused of trying to bring the Union into the store and of trying to \u201ccover up\u201d for Debra Romanchuk who had been accused both of stealing cube steaks and of failing to charge hamburger meat to a customer. Lydia testified that she was also told on January 15 not to come back until the Union troubles were over.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-17\">Pylawka admitted that Lydia had been discharged but denied the discharges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>were for her Union activity. He testified she was discharged for \u201clying\u201d to \u201ccover up for Debra.\u201d Lydia\u2019s father testified that in his conversation with Pylawka the latter criticized Lydia, but only for neglecting her work by flirting with her boy friend working in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The Examiner credited Lydia\u2019s story, and considered in context of events of January 15 we cannot say he erred. Even if Lydia was discharged for both Union activity and for \u201clying,\u201d the Examiner\u2019s finding of an 8(a) (3) violation can be sustained since the \u201clying\u201d incident was not the sole reason for the discharge. N L R B v. Symons Mfg. Co., 328 F.2d 835, 837 (7th Cir. 1964); Nachman Corp. v. N L R B, 337 F.2d 421, 423-424 (7th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">3. <em>Debra Romanchuk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The last day Debra Romanchuk worked, as cashier, was January 10. She testified that she was subsequently in the store as a customer January 14 and had a conversation with Kurylo. He admitted telling her that she might not be able to work on the 16th because of some \u201ctrouble\u201d with the Union. Debra further testified that she had been scheduled to work January 15, 16 and 17, but was unable to do so because of illness. She telephoned Pylawka on January 17 to report her illness. He told her it was \u201cunnecessary\u201d to come to work, asking whether she remembered the trouble \u201cabout the meat\u201d and then adding \u201cWell, now we have bigger trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In his testimony Pylawka admitted asking Debra the question but denied making the statement. He testified he intended during the conversation to discharge Debra because of two \u201cmeat\u201d incidents involving Debra\u2019s work as a cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The first \u201cmeat\u201d incident had to do with four cube steaks Debra was accused of taking without paying for them. There is a conflict in the testimony which, if properly credited by the Examiner, would show that Debra paid for the meat. Lydia corroborated the testimony of Debra.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">The second incident occurred on January 9 and concerned $6.50 of hamburger meat for which Debra was accused of failing to charge a customer. Kurylo accused her of deliberate dishonesty. The Examiner found that Pylawka wanted Debra fired at once, but that Kurylo advised Pylawka that the store needed her the next day, January 10, because of personnel shortage. Debra worked January 10. Her discharge was on January 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">We think the Examiner could very well conclude as he did that had Debra been discharged for dishonesty, as Py-lawka testified, she would have been discharged on January 9 and not January 17. This would be true normally, particularly in the ease of a cashier, where the honesty of the employee is of vital importance to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The Examiner and Board could well determine on the whole of this record that \u201cbut for\u201d their Union activities the three employees would not have been discharged. Mead and Mount Construction Co. v. N L R B, 411 F.2d 1154, 1157 (8th Cir. 1969). See also N L R B v. Symons Mfg. Co., 328 F.2d 835, 837 (7th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">We hold that the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s decision that the discharges of Irene and Lydia Burtniak and Debra Romanchuk violated \u00a7 8(a) (3) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">The Examiner decided that the Union did not represent a majority of the employees at the time the demand for recognition was made. In determining that the unit consisted of 14 employees, the Examiner included Christine Pylyporcz and Kurylo. The Board, however, concluded that the appropriate bargaining unit consisted of only 13 employees, and that since there were seven authorization cards signed, the Union accordingly represented a majority of the employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>on January 15. The Board included Irene and Lydia Burtniak and Debra Ro-manchuk within the bargaining unit, since they had been unlawfully discharged, but excluded Boden Bielynski,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Christine Pylyporcz and Kurylo.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The employer contends that the Union did not represent a majority of the workers. It argues that the Board should have included Boden Bielynski, Christine Pylyporcz and Kurylo within the unit. We think the Board did not err in excluding the three employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The Board found that Boden Bielynski was an accountant working twice annually for five week periods; that contrary to the hourly salary of the other employees, he was paid a flat fee of $25.00 per day; and that he did all his work at home. In our view, Bielynski\u2019s exclusion from the bargaining unit was not error since the record as a whole shows that he was not a regular part time employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The Board also decided that Pylyporcz should have been excluded. It found that she worked in her father\u2019s (Datzco\u2019s) private office, a few doors away, as his office secretary. And while she did prepare the weekly store payroll, she had no contacts with the other unit employees. The Board found no evidence in the record to support her father\u2019s testimony that she worked regularly 121/2 hours weekly. And the Board also found that she was not supervised either by Pylawka or Kurylo, as were the other unit employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We think the Board\u2019s decision that Christine Pylyporcz had no \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d with the other unit employees is supported by the record and is justified. <em>See </em>Indianapolis Glove Co. v. N L R B, 400 F.2d 363, 365 (6th Cir. 1968); see also Cherrin Corp. v. N L R B, 349 F.2d 1001, 1004 (6th Cir. 1969). Here there was something more than the mere family relationship in <em>Cherrin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The Board adopted the Examiner\u2019s finding that Kurylo was a \u201csupervisor\u201d and excluded him from the bargaining unit. There is ample evidence in the record that Kurylo was paid a weekly salary slightly less than that earned by store manager Pylawka, but significantly higher (nearly twice as much) than the other employees. There is also evidence that Kurylo was known by the other employees as the \u201cassistant manager\u201d and that his responsibilities included the assigning of employees to various tasks and reprimanding them for improper performance. Kurylo was also in charge of the store in Pylawka\u2019s absence, subject to close supervision by Datzco. This uncontroverted evidence substantially supports the Board\u2019s finding that Kurylo should not be included in the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The employer challenges the validity of the Board\u2019s order to bargain on the ground that the order lacks the necessary specific findings required under N L R B v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The Board here found the employer\u2019s unlawful conduct was of \u201csuch nature as to have a lingering, coercive effect on the employees and the use of traditional remedies\u201d was unlikely to ensure a \u201cfair and free election.\u201d It is of course essential that the Board find a causal connection between the unfair practices and the election processes. N L R B v. Drives, Inc., 440 F.2d 354, 367 (7th Cir. 1971); N L R B v. Kostel Corp., 440 F.2d 347, 351 (7th Cir. 1971); New Alaska Development Corp. v. N L R B, 441 F.2d 491, 494 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">We found in <em>Drives, Kostel </em>and <em>New Alaska </em>as we do here, insufficient compliance with the <em>Gissel </em>requirements that the Board, to justify a bargaining order, must make specific find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ings to show the causal relationship between the unlawful practices and the election processes. In Drives and <em>Kostel </em>we made the analysis and findings required by <em>Gissel </em>to sustain the order. For example, we decided not to remand in <em>Kostel </em>\u201cin view of the extended time span . . . and the simplicity of the facts\u201d: no prior election, 2-5 employees in the work force, youthful employees, a small town store and the seriousness of the unfair labor practices. We made there the requisite <em>Gissel </em>\u201cspecific findings\u201d conclusive upon the relationship of the \u201cunlawful conduct and the election process.\u201d These simple elements were not present in the <em>New Alaska </em>case and we remanded for necessary findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We shall here, as we did in <em>Kostel, </em>make the necessary analysis and findings, since the record here clearly parallels with the record there. The illegal conduct occurred in January, 1969, and the Board\u2019s order issued in February, 1971. The dispute is accordingly into the third year. Three of the four employees subject of the unfair labor practices were teen-age high school students, unsophisticated and of likely susceptibility to extraneous influence in deciding about union representation. <em>Kostel </em>440 F.2d at 352. Three other employees in the majority of seven were also teenagers, so that the impact upon the three involved would probably have a pervasive influence upon the others, making the unfair labor practices for that reason more serious than they may otherwise have been. The neighborhood store has few employees and is relatively small. The apparent ethnic character of the neighborhood and store indicates similarity to a small town. And there has been no history of collective bargaining among the store employees and no election has been held. The similarity to <em>Kostel </em>is plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We conclude, therefore, that here, as in <em>Kostel, </em>we have a \u201cless extraordinary case[s],\u201d <em>Gissel </em>395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547, in which a bargaining order is appropriate, that the \u201cpossibility of erasing the effects of the past unfair labor practices ... by an election is slight\u201d and that the \u201cemployee sentiment expressed in the cards would better be protected by the bargaining order.\u201d <em>Kostel </em>440 F.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">In reaching this conclusion we have limited our consideration to the record before us, rather than including in our consideration the factor of employee turnover since the original entry of the bargaining order. We recognize of course that in a grocery store, where much of the work force consists of youthful, regular part time employees, a turnover of employees can be anticipated, and under those changed circumstances an employer would be forced to bargain with a union that does not represent a majority of the employees. For these reasons we think the Board\u2019s order should be modified to include a provision for a notice to the employees advising them of their independent right to petition for a hew election. The precise wording of the notice is left to the discretion of the Board. <em>Drives; Kostel </em>at 353; N L R B v. Copps Corp., 458 F.2d 1227 (7th Cir., decided April 18, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The Board\u2019s order will be enforced as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-12\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-13\">.

The employer contends that the Examiner erred in discrediting the testimony of its witnesses and crediting that of the employees. It insists that the testimony of its witnesses is free of \u201cinconsistencies and contradictions\u201d while that of the employees is replete with these imperfections and is too unreliable to support the Board\u2019s decision. The employer argues therefore that the Examiner\u2019s credibility determinations were arbitrary and that we are required to set aside the Board\u2019s order. We reject the contention and argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b105-13\">.
