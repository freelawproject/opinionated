While it has the same general utility as aspirin, it is composed of acetaminophen, an aspirin substitute. The drug is sold over the counter, and no prescription is required. It is marketed in syrup and drop form for infants and young children and in tablet form for older children and adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">Appellee applies TEMPURETS to a drug having the same utility as TEM-PRA, although appellee\u2019s product is an aspirin-based analgesic. Like TEM-PRA, TEMPURETS are sold over the counter, without prescription, in dosages suitable for children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-7\">The gist of appellant\u2019s opposition is that the contemporaneous use of TEM-PRA and TEMPURETS on an analgesic for children marketed through essentially the same channels of trade on a nonprescription basis would be likely to cause confusion, mistake or to deceive and that registration of TEMPURETS should accordingly be refused under \u00a7 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d). The board held to the contrary stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-8\">[T]he marks \u201cTEMPRA\u201d and \u201cTEMPURETS\u201d are similar in' that the first four letters thereof are identical. It is apparent, however, and op-poser does not dispute, that these letters are suggestive of the fact that the products to which the marks are applied are indicated in the lowering of body temperatures, and, as further shown by the record in this case, they form the initial letters of a number of marks registered by third persons for medicinal preparations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-14\">Considering the suggestiveness of the marks, and the substantial differences between them in sound and appearance, we are not persuaded that their contemporaneous use is reasonably calculated to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1448-15\">On this appeal, appellee stresses that the board was correct in concluding that the common portion of the several marks is suggestive, that third-party registrations employing \u201cTEMP\u201d support that conclusion, that where the marks are suggestive of the goods, confusion is less likely, and that in any event, the marks \u201care not so similar as to be likely to lead to confusion.\u201d Appellant contends that the goods are directly competitive and that the marks are quite similar. Appellant does not believe that \u201cTEMP\u201d is particularly suggestive of any property of a drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-16\">We cannot agree with the board\u2019s decision in this case. While there are some differences in the sound and appearance of the respective marks, the overall impression is so Similar that we find inescapable the conclusion that the ordinary purchaser of the goods would be likely to assume that they came from the same source. The distinction between the marks which immediately strikes the senses is the \u201ce-t-s\u201d suffix of TEMPURETS as compared to TEM-PRA. However, that is a well-recognized suffix which connotes a diminutive version of the base word.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the ordinary purchaser of a non-prescription children\u2019s aspirin would consider the marks by which two analgesics of dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>ferent composition but common utility to be related, as we think he would, it would follow that he would probably assume them to be derived from the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-4\">We do not agree that \u201cTEMP\u201d is necessarily suggestive of the fever-reducing function of a children\u2019s aspirin or aspirin-substitute. We find more persuasive appellant\u2019s position that it may relate to so many concepts that no single suggestion emerges. However, even were it suggestive of the contended function, we would still be convinced that a purchaser aware of that common utility would be likely to erroneously conclude that the products came from the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">For the reasons stated, we hold that there would be a likelihood of confusion stemming from the contemporaneous use of TEMPRA and TEMPURETS on the respective drugs, and the opposition should have been sustained. The view we take of this case renders unnecessary any consideration of certain alternative arguments advanced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1448-9\">.
