We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-26\">Among the several contentions urged in support of his petition for ha-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>beas corpus relief, the appellant alleged that he was not advised by the State trial court or his court-appointed counsel of this right to pursue a direct appeal. The record reveals, and appellant admits, that that issue has never been presented to the State appellate courts of Florida, since it was not raised in either of his two appeals from the denial of his Motions to Vacate Sentence filed pursuant to Rule 1.850, Fla.R.Crim.P., 33 F.S.A. Thus, his State remedies have not been exhausted. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254, Burroughs v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1972, 454 F.2d 1165; Johnson v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1971, 453 F.2d 385; Porter v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1971, 439 F.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Appellant\u2019s appropriate remedy at this point, as delineated by the Florida Supreme Court, would be to seek habeas corpus in the Florida District Court of Appeals for the district in which he was convicted. Baggett v. Wainwright, Fla.S.Ct., 1969, 229 So.2d 239; Powe v. State, Fla.S.Ct., 1968, 216 So.2d 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
