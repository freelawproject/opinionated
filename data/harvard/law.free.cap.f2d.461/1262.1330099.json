We are in accord with the decision of the district court substantially for the reasons given in that court\u2019s opinion. See Shultz v. Local 1291, 338 F.Supp. 1204 (E.D.Pa.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\">Subsequent to its judgment ordering an election, and after this appeal was filed, the district court granted a continuance of a civil contempt proceeding instituted by the Secretary based on the alleged refusal of the Union to cooperate in the holding of the election. Thereafter, the Secretary filed a motion in this appeal to vacate the district court\u2019s order of June 9, 1972, granting the continuance. In view of our affirmance on the merits, rather than act on the motion, we expect the district court promptly to vacate its continuance order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
