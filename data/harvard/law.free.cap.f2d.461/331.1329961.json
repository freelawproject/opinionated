The labels contain directions for proper use and advice to avoid prolonged breathing of the smoke, contact with skin and eyes, and ingestion, and to keep out of reach of children. The directions contemplate use of the product in the home, advising that pets and fish be removed, and: \u201cCover tightly or remove any food in rooms to be treated.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The principal market for petitioner\u2019s products is for home use; its most significant hazards are the danger of inhalation and the risk that the smoke will penetrate coverings and leave residues on food.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In 1969 the Agricultural Research Division of the Department of Agriculture (ARS) concluded a series of studies of lindane products used in thermal vaporizers. Two general types of lindane vaporizers were being marketed, one which operated continuously and the other which volatized fixed quantities on a \u201cone-shot\u201d basis. The former, or continuous type, was approved for use in industrial establishments, but not for home use. Petitioner\u2019s products are of the latter type.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The studies indicated that continuous lindane vaporizers were in fact being used widely in homes, and that residues of lindane on food posed a threat to human health. Accordingly, ARS concluded that continued registration of lindane products intended for vaporizers was contrary to the requirements of FI FRA. Notices of cancellation were therefore sent to the entire industry in April, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">At least four manufacturers, including petitioner, exercised their statutory right to have the matter referred to a scientific advisory committee. The committee concluded that \u201cexisting data are sufficient to indicate the reality of human hazard,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and recommended that \u201ccancellation of registrations of all lin-dane products intended for vaporization should be maintained.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Acting on that recommendation, on October 5, 1970, the Administrator of ARS entered findings of fact and conclusions relating generally to the registration of lindane products for use in vaporizing devices. His order stated that the \u201cnotices of cancellation of registrations of the products involved in this proceeding are hereby affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">Petitioner then filed a timely request for a public hearing to raise objections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>to the cancellation of its three registrations based, in part, on differences between its products and the other products which had been considered especially dangerous. In addition to the difference between infrequent \u201cone-shot\u201d applications and continuous use,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> petitioner contends that the particles of its smokes are much larger than the particles of vapor produced by other lindane products and, therefore, much less apt to penetrate food coverings. It is undisputed, however, that some penetration of food coverings, other than metals and glass, does result from the use of petitioner\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Prior to the public hearing, the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s responsibilities under FIFRA were transferred to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the respondent herein. After a full evidentiary hearing, on September 20, 1971, the Examiner submitted findings and conclusions recommending that the cancellations be vacated. He found that petitioner had met its burden of proof and that its products \u201ccontain directions for use which are necessary and if complied with adequate for the protection of the public\u201d; and that \u201cwhen used as directed or in accordance with commonly recognized practice\u201d the products are \u201cnot harmful to living man.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Hearing Examiner\u2019s opinion is comprehensive and relates specifically to petitioner\u2019s products rather than to the industry in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Counsel for the Pesticides Office of respondent filed exceptions to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s recommended findings and order, stressing particularly the danger from inhalation of lindane and, secondarily, the danger from residues on food. The exceptions were reviewed by a judicial officer of the agency. It is the opinion of the Judicial Officer which raises the legal question stated at the beginning of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">The Judicial Officer agreed with the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings and conclusions pertaining to the question of exposure by inhalation. With respect to the question of residues, however, he ruled as a matter of law that \u201cany presence of lindane on processed or served food is per se contamination.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He did not disagree with the Examiner's finding that the amount of residue was not toxicologically significant, but held that since the Food and Drug Administrator had not established a tolerance for lindane residues on food for human consumption pursuant to \u00a7 406 or \u00a7 409 of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 346 and 348, even a harmless trace results in \u201cadulteration.\u201d He concluded that \u201call FIFRA labels should bear directions for use adequate to insure conformity to all pertinent regulations of other government agencies.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He therefore ordered that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>petitioner\u2019s registrations be cancelled, subject to reinstatement if the labels were modified to prohibit use in areas where food is prepared, served or stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">We stayed that order and must now determine its validity. There are three distinct theories which might support the order. Although respondent now relies on only the third, to discuss that theory intelligently it is necessary to understand why the first two are inapplicable. We shall therefore discuss the effect of (1) FIFRA apart from the requirements of FDCA; (2) the sections of the FDCA which relate to food which bears or contains any added poisonous or deleterious substance, 21 U.S. C. \u00a7 342(a) (2) (A) and \u00a7 346; and (3) the \u201cfood additive\u201d amendments to FDCA enacted in 1958, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 342 (a) (2) (C) and \u00a7 348.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The subject matter of FIFRA<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is economic poisons. The basic purpqse of the statute was to regulate the labeling of such products to provide purchasers with assurance of effectiveness and safety when used in compliance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Until the manufacturer persuades the Administrator (formerly the Secretary of Agriculture) that his proposed labeling is adequate and that use of the product in compliance with directions is safe, the product may not be registered; unregistered economic poisons may not be sold in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Registrations must be renewed at five-year intervals. Because of the continuing potential for harm from the use of such poisons, the Administrator retains a continuing right to cancel (or if an emergency exists, immediately to suspend)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> a registration. In cancellation proceedings, as in applications for initial registration, the manufacturer has the burden of proving that his product is not \u201cmisbranded\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Stearns Electric Paste Company v. Environmental Protection Agency, 461 F.2d 293, pp. 304, 305 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">The statutory definition of the term \u201cmisbranded\u201d incorporates a substantive standard of product safety. There are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>severa! tests which must be met. The directions accompanying the product, if complied with, must be \u201cadequate for the protection of the public\u201d;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> warning statements, if complied with, must be \u201cadequate to prevent injury to living man\u201d <footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and other useful life. The substantive standards, phrased in terms of protection of the public and impact on living man, require consideration of the aggregate effect of a product\u2019s use upon the environment, including not only its potential for harm, but also the benefits which would be lost by removing it from the market.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">In this case, the tests of product safety as set forth in FIFRA\u2019s definition of \u201cmisbranded\u201d were met by petitioner. The Hearing Examiner expressly found that petitioner had sustained its burden of proof. Although the Judicial Officer did not enter all of the Examiner\u2019s recommended findings, we are satisfied that they are supported by the record.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Since FIFRA itself does not condition entitlement to registration on compliance with any other statute, the language of FIFRA clearly supports the Hearing Examiner\u2019s conclusion that the order eancel-ling petitioner\u2019s registrations should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">The question is whether this conclu-. sion can stand in the face of a claimed inconsistency with another requirement of Congress. To answer that question we must understand both the purpose of that other requirement and the precise language in which it has been defined by Congress. We must also keep in mind the fact that this is a case in which the registrant has satisfactorily demonstrated the safety of its product in an adversary proceeding. We stress this fact because the provisions of FDCA to be discussed were, in large part, intended to prohibit the marketing of products which had not been adequately tested to establish their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">The Judicial Officer\u2019s holding was predicated on both \u00a7 406 and \u00a7 409 of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346 and \u00a7 348. The reasons why the former section is inapplicable illuminate our analysis of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">The FDCA prohibits the interstate shipment of adulterated food. The defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>nition of the term \u201cadulterated\u201d has changed significantly over the years. In 1914 the Supreme Court held that flour was not adulterated simply because it contained a poisonous substance which had been added during processing. United States v. Lexington Mill &amp; Elevator Co., 232 U.S. 399, 34 S.Ct. 337, 58 L.Ed. 658. The Government was required to prove that the food itself, rather than the added substance, was dangerous. That test has survived insofar as inherent ingredients of food are concerned, but the 1938 statute revised the law applicable to food which \u201cbears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substances.\u201d Such food is adulterated if the added poisonous substance is \u201cunsafe within the meaning of \u00a7 406\u201d.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, the 1938 Act modified the rule of <em>Lexington Mill </em>by focusing attention on the character of the added substance rather than the character of the food, and by shifting the burden of proving safety to the food processor.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">Section 406<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> provided that every poisonous or deleterious substance added to food was unsafe unless two conditions were met: First, that the poison is required in the production of the food, or at least its use could not be avoided by good manufacturing practice; and second, if that condition was satisfied, that the Secretary of Agriculture<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> had promulgated a regulation limiting the quantities of the substance which food may contain and such \u201ctolerance\u201d was not exceeded. Failure to satisfy either condition resulted in <em>per se </em>adulteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">The Judicial Officer held that the use of petitioner\u2019s product would violate the second condition set forth in \u00a7 406 because no tolerance had been established for lindane residues on food for human consumption.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is equally clear, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ever, that the first condition could not be satisfied; lindane is not required in the production of food<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and there is no evidence that its use could not be avoided in good manufacturing practice, or even in good practice in a domestic kitchen. As respondent now acknowledges, it therefore appears that petitioner could never comply with \u00a7 406 even if a tolerance had been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The Judicial Officer\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 406, if correct, would permanently foreclose registration of petitioner\u2019s products. Reference to that section is predicated on the assumption (which is certainly not unreasonable) that those products are poisonous or deleterious substances within the meaning of \u00a7 402.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> From that assumption, it inevitably follows that any use which leaves even a harmless trace of the product on food results in adulteration within the meaning of FDCA. The steps which lead to this conclusion are: (1) the product is a poisonous substance; (2) \u00a7 402 provides that any food which \u201cbears or contains\u201d a poisonous substance is adulterated if it is \u201cunsafe\u201d within \u00a7 406; (3) this substance is unsafe within \u00a7 406 because, as the Judicial Officer noted, no tolerance has been established, and additionally, because it need not be used in food processing. Since, as the Judicial Officer reasoned, the labeled use of the product in an area where food is stored or served is \u201cunsafe,\u201d the product is misbranded under FIFRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Respondent, we think correctly, disclaims reliance on \u00a7 406. When Congress enacted FIFRA in 1947, it adopted a concept of product safety analogous to the Supreme Court\u2019s pre-1938 interpretation of the food law in <em>Lexington Mill.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If it had adopted the <em>per se </em>approach of \u00a7 406, all domestic use of pesticides in kitchen areas would have been prohibited<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and only by an extralegal sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>tem of informal tolerances could the continued use of such products have been permitted.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> No such consequences follow, however, if we read the words used by Congress in \u00a7 406 exactly as they were written. Under that reading harmless traces of lindane residue are merely \u201cdeemed to be unsafe for purposes of the application of clause (2) (A) of \u00a7 [402] of this title,\u201d rather than unsafe for the purpose of other federal legislation as well.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">As we read \u00a7 406, therefore, the reason it does not permanently foreclose registration of petitioner\u2019s products is that its definition of product safety is only for the purposes of FDCA and is not incorporated in FIFRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">If, as respondent contends, petitioner\u2019s products are \u201cfood additives\u201d rather than added poisonous or deleterious substances, \u00a7 409 leads us to an \u201cunsafe\u201d conclusion by a path which is parallel to that indicated by \u00a7 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">A food is deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any \u201cfood additive\u201d which is \u201cunsafe\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 409.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> That section provides that any use of a food additive is unsafe unless the Administrator has either granted an exemption covering the additive or else its use is within the limits of a tolerance which he has established. Again, however, the use of an additive not covered by an exemption or by a tolerance is merely \u201cdeemed to be unsafe for purposes of the application of clause (2) (C) of \u00a7 [402] of this title.\u201d Thus, just as an exact reading of the language of \u00a7 406 avoids the Judicial Officer\u2019s construction of that provision, a parallel reading of the comparable words in \u00a7 409 will also defeat respondent\u2019s \u201cfood additive\u201d argument. In this case we believe this literal reading is supported by a fair evaluation of the history and purposes of the food additive amendment of 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">We first note that there is no suggestion in the history of the 1958 legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tion that it was intended to affect the administration of any other statute. Unlike the 1954 amendment which expressly took into account the interests of both the pesticide industry and the food industry in coordinating the regulation of the use of pesticide chemicals on raw agricultural commodities under both FDCA and FIFRA, the Senate Committee Report on the 1958 Act purports only to deal with the food processing industry.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This report identifies two broad purposes to be accomplished by the food additive legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">First, Congress intended to establish a procedure for premarketing clearance of untested food additives.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As the title of the statute plainly stated, its purpose was \u201cto prohibit the use in food of additives which have not been adequately tested to establish their safety.\u201d 72 Stat. 1784. Prior to such testing and the adoption of either an exemption or permitted tolerance limitations, new additives were to be banned by a statutory concept of <em>per se </em>adulteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Second, in evaluating the safety of new additives, the agency was to avoid the <em>per se </em>approach required by the existing statutory references to poisonous and deleterious substances. The test of safety was intended to take into account the broader concepts of safety under the intended conditions of use;<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the benefits of the additive were to be evaluated rather than merely its potential for harm.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>In short, in making its ultimate determination whether new additives, or food containing them, may be marketed, F.D. A. employs the kind of substantive standard of product safety embodied in FIFRA\u2019s \u201cinjury to man\u201d concept, rather than a narrow consideration of the character of the additive itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Thus, the concept of <em>per se </em>adulteration was designed to serve the procedural purpose of keeping products off the market until after their safety has been tested and to place the burden of demonstrating safety on industry rather than government. The registration requirements of FIFRA are designed to accomplish precisely the same objectives. Although the statutory procedures are somewhat different, both FDCA and FIFRA require premarketing clearance of new or untested products, both place the burden of proof on industry, and neither employs an automatic <em>\u201cper se\u201d </em>approach to the application of the substantive standard of product safety.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Neither of the broad purposes of the food additives legislation will be defeated by accepting the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings as controlling in this case. Those findings are not in conflict with either the letter or the spirit of FDCA or FIFRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Rejection of the Judicial Officer\u2019s reliance on a <em>per se </em>approach of the review stage of this proceeding need not foreclose a coordinated interpretation of the two statutes in a proper procedural context. Subsequent to the hearing below, the authority to determine tolerances for pesticides formerly exercised by the Secretary of Agriculture was transferred to respondent.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Nothing in either FDCA or FIFRA, or in our holding today, will prevent the Administrator from determining tolerance limits in the same proceeding in which the right to registration is adjudicated if the issues are properly framed before the hearing commences.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We merely hold that since petitioner met its burden of proof in a full evi-dentiary hearing, its registrations may not be cancelled by adopting a construction of FIFRA and FDCA which is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>required by the language or purpose of either statute.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The orders of cancellation must therefore be set aside.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\">. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 135 (z).

The basic principle of statutory construction, that two related statutes should, whenever possible, be blended to reinforce their common purpose, applies with particular force to the interrelationship of the FIFRA labeling scheme and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act tolerance-setting provisions. See Environmental Defense Fund [Inc.] v. [United States Department of] HEW, <em>supra, </em>[138 U.S.App.D.C. 381, 428 F.2d 1083 (D.C.Cir. 1970)] n. 16.

Thus, for example, we may take judicial notice of the existence of tolerances established by the Food and Drug Administration for residues of lindane on raw agricultural commodities (see Finding No. 12 quoted in footnote 12, <em>supra, </em>which was not entered by the Judicial Officer). The evidence indicates that the use of petitioner\u2019s products in the presence of <em>uncovered </em>food would be within those tolerances. Quite clearly, if the directions to remove or cover all food are complied with, the Examiner correctly concluded that the labeled use does not create toxi-eologically significant residues (see Finding No. 15 quoted in footnote 12, <em>supra, </em>wliich also was not entered by the Judicial Officer). See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 120.133. We mention this tolerance as only one of several items which support the Examiner\u2019s recommended findings; we do not mean to imply that compliance with the tolerance for lindane on raw agricultural commodities under FDCA is conclusive in the determination of safety under FIFRA. While it is persuasive evidence, the government could have come forward with evidence tending to show that the residues after use of petitioner\u2019s products were nevertheless dangerous. The Hearing Examiner concluded that the government had not overcome petitioner\u2019s <em>prima fade </em>case. The Judicial Officer did not enter Finding No. 12, but on his theory of the case, it was unnecessary, since admittedly there was some residue and the Judicial Officer considered any residue as <em>per se </em>fatal to petitioner\u2019s case. Nothing in the Judicial Officer\u2019s opinion indicates that he considered the residues toxicologically significant. Thus, if the Judicial Officer\u2019s legal theory is incorrect, it is evident that registrant has met its burden.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b403-4\">.

Section 406 reads: \u2018Any poisonous or deleterious substance added to any food, except where such substance is required in the production thereof or cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice shall be deemed to be unsafe.\u2019 The section further provides that residues of such poison, where required or unavoidable, shall be within tolerance limits established by regulation.

Since sections 406 and 409 \u2018affect food that might be found in a home or restaurant\u2019 (Respondent\u2019s Exceptions to Examiner\u2019s Opinion at 4), contamination of food by lindane would seem to result in violation of the Act, since no tolerances exist.

Your committee agrees with the Food and Drug Administration that existing law should be changed to permit the use of such additives as our technological scientists may produce and which may benefit our people and our economy when the proposed usages of such additives are in amounts accepted by the Food and Drug Administration as safe.

Indeed, it is of interest that the standard of review under FIFRA is narrower than that applicable to review of a denial of a tolerance under \u00a7 409 (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 348).
