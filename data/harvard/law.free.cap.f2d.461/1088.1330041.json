The complaint is premised upon \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1125. The decisive question, as described by Chief Judge Urbon, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1155-17\">\u201cThe pivotal issue is whether labeling or advertising a product as \u2018potato chips\u2019 tends falsely to describe or represent the product when it has been fashioned from dried potato granules rather than from sliced raw potatoes.\u201d 333 F.Supp. 173, 175 (D.Neb. 1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad-\">Judge Urbom, after a five-day hearing, concluded that \u201cthe past experience of the consumer so shades the term with a raw potato overlay . . . \u201d that it would mislead the public to advertise Chipos as potato chips without any further explanation. However, he also concluded \u201cthat the phrase \u2018potato chip\u2019, standing alone, is a generic term which is capable of including both chips made of raw potatoes and chips made of dehydrated potatoes.\u201d He also found that defendant\u2019s practice of adding to its label the descriptive words \u201cfashioned from dried potato granules,\u201d would, if displayed properly, prevent misleading the public because the label would not then misdescribe or misrepresent the product. Accordingly, Judge Urbom declined to enjoin General Mills from calling Chip-os \u201cpotato chips,\u201d but he did permanently enjoin General Mills from advertising Chipos as potato chips \u201cwithout an accompanying prominent declaration that CHIPOS are made from dried or dehydrated potatoes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-19\">Appellants contention on appeal is that the phrase potato chip has only one meaning, to wit: a thin slice of <em>raw </em>potato fried in deep fat; and therefore that the qualifying phrase does not remove the confusion because it is contradictory rather than explanatory. However, it is well settled that if the contested phrase is susceptible to two meanings so that an explanatory phrase will preclude deception, it is sufficient to require the addition of the explanation rather than prohibit using the ambiguous phrase. <em>See e. g., </em>Jacob Siegel Co. v. F. T. C., 327 U.S. 608, 66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946); F. T. C. v. Royal Milling Co., 288 U.S. 212, 217-218, 53 S.Ct. 335, 77 L.Ed 706 (1933); F. T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>C. v. Good-Grape, 45 F.2d 70 (6th Cir. 1930). <em>Cf. </em>F. T. C. v. Army &amp; Navy Trading Co., 66 App.D.C. 394, 88 F.2d 776, 779-80 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">The decisive issues in this case, therefore, are the factual questions: (1) whether the phrase \u201cpotato chip\u201d is, as Judge Urbom found, \u201ccapable of including both chips made of raw potatoes and chips made of dehydrated potatoes; \u201d and, if so, (2) whether, as he found, use of the explanatory phrase required by the injunction will suffice to prevent misunderstanding the product\u2019s contents. We are satisfied that the findings of the district court are responsive to substantial evidence, and that the ultimate judgment was not induced by a misconception of the applicable law. We affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s soundly reasoned opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1156-13\">. The view we take of the ease renders immaterial the extent, if any, to which Judge Urbom relied upon the F.D.A. guideline for advertising Cliipos and a similar product (Pringles).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
