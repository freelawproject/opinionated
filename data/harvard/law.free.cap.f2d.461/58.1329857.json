Since he was a retired member of the Army, he was, however, provided medical and hospital services at a Government institution and at Government expense. There is no controversy over the value of the services rendered. The United States sued to recover the value of such services, to the extent of the coverage, from the insurer. The District Court allowed recovery, 330 F.Supp. 1097. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The insurer argues at the outset that the United States was without a right to recover herein under the Medical Care Recovery Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To this extent the United States agrees with the appellant insurer. It asserts that its right of recovery does not rest on the Medical Care Recovery Act but is based upon the insurance contract issued to Strickland by the insurer and it sues as a third-party beneficiary, entitled as such to recover under the \u201cExpenses for Medical Services\u201d provision of that contract. The policy obligates the insurer to pay, within certain limits not pertinent to this case, \u201call expenses incurred by or <em>on behalf of\u201d </em>(italics added) the insured in connection with an accident. It specifically provides in the \u201cConditions\u201d provision of the policy, that the insurer \u201cmay pay the injured person or any person or organization rendering <em>the services </em>* * * \u201d. (Italics added.) These provisions were construed in United States v. United Services Automobile Association (5th Cir., 1970) 431 F.2d 735, cert. denied 400 U.S. 992, 91 S.Ct. 459, 27 L.Ed.2d 440, reh. den. 401 U.S. 984, 91 S.Ct. 1188, 28 L.Ed.2d 338,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to authorize the United States to recover as a third-party beneficiary for medical services rendered by the United States to an insured\u2019s dependent pursuant to Section 1076, 10 U.S.C.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This result appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>sound <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and accords with what must have been the intent and understanding of the parties. It must be assumed that the insurer knew that its insured in this case was entitled to obtain medical services at the expense of the United States, as provided under Section 1074(b), 10 U.S.C. It had included as a separate part of its contract of insurance, for which it unquestionably charged a portion of its premium, this provision obligating itself to pay the medical expenses incurred as a result of an accident on behalf of the insured. To allow it to eliminate from its obligation, under this provision, any expenses incurred by the United States under the latter\u2019s statutory obligation to the insured would mean that the insurer actually would have been incurring no liability, or at least a most limited one, under this part of its policy, for which it had charged a portion of its premium. Certainly, the insurer had not intended \u2014 it undoubtedly had not adjusted its premium to take into account \u2014 any such \u201cwindfall\u201d as would result in its favor by limiting its obligation under the \u201cExpenses for Medical Services\u201d portion of its policy as it now asks of the Court. It would be unconscionable so to limit it. See Government Employees Insurance Company v. United States (10th Cir. 1965) 349 F.2d 83, 85-86, cert. den. 382 U.S. 1026, 86 S.Ct. 646, 15 L.Ed.2d 539, reh. den. 385 U.S. 939, 86 S.Ct. 1064, 15 L.Ed.2d 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The insurer, however, asserts that the insurance policy is a North Carolina contract, to be construed in accordance with the laws of that State, and that Lenoir Memorial Hospital, Inc. v. Stancil (1965) 263 N.C. 630, 139 S.E.2d 901, is conclusive that the United States may not recover as a third-party beneficiary thereunder. <em>Lenoir Memorial </em>is an unusual case. A draft for the hospital expenses of the insured was issued jointly to the insured and the hospital where he had been treated. The insured indorsed it, and, without securing the indorsement of his co-payee or making payment of his hospital bill, cashed it. The insurer paid the check, without apparently noting that the hospital had not joined in the indorsement. Unable to collect from the insured, the hospital sued on the policy to recover, as a third-party beneficiary, of the insurer. Had the hospital prevailed, the insurer would have been subjected to a double recovery. Double recovery was properly denied under these circumstances. The Court proceeded, however, to add that recovery by the hospital as a third-party beneficiary was not authorized under the policy and this language is cited by the appellant as supporting its contention that, under North Carolina law, the United States may not recover herein. We do not so construe <em>Lenoir. </em>In that case, the hospital was a pure volunteer; it owed no statutory obligation to furnish the insured medical or hospital services. Here, on the other hand, the United States was not a volunteer; it, in rendering the service, was discharging a statutory obligation, little different from the common-law obligation of a parent to a minor child, and like the parent, it is entitled to recover for its expenses incurred by reason of its statutory obligation to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2651-2653 :</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u201c2651.

In response to the claim that the insured incurs no expenses when supplied military medical care one writer argues that the serviceman\u2019s right to free medical care is part of his pay, that his medical expenses are in effect prepaid, and that he thus personally incurs an expense within the meaning of the medical payment rider.
