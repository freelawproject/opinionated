Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al, 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b311-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">For the second time Thomas appeals from an order of the district court denying his petition for the writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Again we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">Thomas filed a \u201cFirst Amended Original Petition\u201d after the case was remanded by us in which he added an allegation to the effect that the prosecutor displayed his criminal record to the jury during a trial recess. It appears that the district court denied his amended petition in reliance on a magistrate\u2019s report that Thomas had not exhausted his state remedies on the added claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">The record reflects, however, that Thomas has raised this issue both at the trial level, where his motion for mistrial was denied, and in his direct appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where the court found the claim meritless. Our previous holding in this case that Thomas need not relitigate by collateral attack in state courts an issue which has been presented to the state trial and appellate courts as a prerequisite to an application for habeas corpus relief in a federal district court is equally applicable to this appeal. Thomas v. Decker, 434 F.2d 1033 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-21\">We do not here rule on the merits of any of the other points raised in the petition. Although the magistrate\u2019s report recommended disposition on the merits of other grounds for relief asserted by Thomas, and the state\u2019s brief on this appeal has argued such other points, it would not have been appropriate for the district court to rule on any grounds asserted since the judge was of the opinion that state remedies had not been exhausted on all of the habeas corpus applicant\u2019s contentions. See Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 92 S.Ct. 509, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971); Jackson v. Wainwright, 450 F.2d 289 (5th Cir. 1971); Wheeler v. Beto, 407 F.2d 816 (5th Cir. 1969). It is not clear whether or not the district court sought to pass on the merits of any of petitioner\u2019s contentions but our action here leaves all open for such reconsideration as the court deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-22\">The judgment below is vacated and the case remanded so that Thomas\u2019 claims can be considered on their merits. Although we pretermit a decision on the merits and the propriety of the court\u2019s holding an evidentiary hearing, we note that Thomas has raised an issue which may require the examination of one or more jurors who sat at his trial. This and other relevant factors should be considered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-23\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-15\">. Thomas v. Decker, 434 F.2d 1033 (5th Cir. 1970). Subsequent to the first appeal, the court substituted Dr. George J. Beto, Director, Texas Department of Corrections for James E.
