He brought this habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 raising the issue that he was denied his right to a jury trial since he was convicted in the Louisiana State Court, as provided by the law of that State by a vote of 9 for conviction and 3 for acquittal. See La.Const, art. VII, \u00a7 41; La.Code Crim. Pro. art. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">On appeal we withheld action on appellant\u2019s contention until the Supreme Court of the United States could decide the identical issue in Johnson v. Louisiana. That case has now been decided by the Supreme Court adverse to the contention of appellant and accordingly the denial of habeas corpus was proper in this case though appellant was convicted by less than a unanimous verdict of a jury and by a 9-to-3 verdict as authorized by Louisiana law. See Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 92 S.Ct. 1620, 32 L.Ed.2d 152 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
