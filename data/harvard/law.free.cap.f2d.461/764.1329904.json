After having exhausted his state remedies, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the District of New Jersey which was denied. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Zeiler, 427 F.2d 1305 (3d Cir. 1970), appellant contends that the absence of counsel at a pretrial photographic display was violative of his constitutional rights. This argument, however, is precluded by our recent decision in United States ex rel. Reed v. Anderson, 461 F.2d 739 (3d Cir., 1972). Appellant also argues that the pretrial identification procedures were violative of the due process standards enumerated by the Supreme Court in Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). However, our examination of the record reveals that the identification procedure at issue complied with the <em>Simmons </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-18\">The order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
