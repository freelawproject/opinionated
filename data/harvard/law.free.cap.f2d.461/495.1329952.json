The school district responded by filing a \u201cMotion to Dismiss and For Summary Judgment\u201d which raised the defense of res judicata. The school district attached to its motion the Preliminary Objection of Connelly to the original Declaration of Taking and the Opinion of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and the Opinion of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirming the findings of the Common Pleas Court. (Connelly had sought certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and had failed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">The district court, 326 F.Supp. 241, concluded that the allegations contained in Connelly\u2019s complaint had been completely and finally litigated in the Pennsylvania State courts and that the issues were res judicata and accordingly dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">A review of the record shows beyond doubt that the conclusion of the District Court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">The appellant contends in this appeal that res judicata cannot be raised by motion prior to Answer but this contention is without merit, see Williams v. Murdoch, 330 F.2d 745 at 749 (3d Cir. 1964); Hartmann v. Time, Inc., 166 F.2d 127 (3d Cir. 1948) and 2A J. Moore, Federal Practice, \u00b6 8.28 at 1863 (2d ed. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-18\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
