He says that the assertion of his interrogators that the aliens had implicated him and would testify against him misled him into thinking that all of the aliens would testify against him when in fact only five were retained by the Government for that purpose. (The others were returned to Mexico, a common practice prior to this court\u2019s decision in United States v. Mendez-Rodriguez, 450 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1971).) His confession allegedly flowed from that misimpression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">We are not persuaded by the argument. Even assuming arguendo that there was an element of deception here, we are not persuaded that the reasonable effect could have been to affect the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s confession; the trial judge\u2019s apparent assessment of the confession and the surrounding facts was not plainly untenable. <em>See </em>Moser v. United States, 381 F.2d 363 (9th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1054, 88 S.Ct. 802, 19 L.Ed.2d 850 (1968); Fernandez-Delgado v. United States, 368 F.2d 34, 36 (9th Cir. 1966); United States ex rel. Lathan v. Deegan, 450 F.2d 181, 185 (2d Cir. 1971); <em>cf. </em>Williams v. Nelson, 457 F.2d 376 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
