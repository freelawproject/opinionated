All nine now appeal from the findings of contempt and the sentences imposed upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-29\">In the certificates of contempt, the court found that the 5-month trial was \u201cmarred by continual disruptive outbursts in direct defiance of judicial authority by defendants and defense counsel.\u201d It found that \u201cthroughout this case * * * the behavior of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>fendants was aimed at baiting the judge and inciting and harassing the U. S. Attorneys in an attempt to stop the trial.\u201d The entire record of the trial was made part of the contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The contempt sentences ranged from 2 months and 18 days for defendant Weiner to 4 years and 13 days for Attorney Kunstler. Many of the arguments raised by the parties were also raised in the contempt case against Bobby Seale, who was a co-defendant in the Anti-riot case until a mistrial was declared as to him, resulting in his severance. In the interest of brevity, we will incorporate the rulings in our opinion in United States v. Seale, 461 F.2d 345, when dispositive of arguments herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\n<em>Electronic Surveillance as to Seale</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Appellants argue that their contempt judgments should be reversed because of the Government\u2019s allegedly illegal electronic surveillance as to Seale. As co-defendants and counsel, they have no standing to complain that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated where, as here, their conversations or conversations on their premises were not involved. Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">We have seen in United States v. Seale, <em>supra, </em>that the only conversation possibly bearing on his contempt is contained in the first paragraph of the earliest of the three logs. There was nothing in any of the logs which could conceivably be deemed an intrusion into councils of the defendants other than Seale. There not only was no \u201cdirect intrusion * <em>* * </em>into attorney-client discussions\u201d (Hoffa v. United States, 387 U.S. 231, 233, 87 S.Ct. 1583, 1584, 18 L.Ed.2d 738), but also there was no indirect intrusion, however remote, that could possibly give appellants standing to complain of these logs under the Fifth or Sixth Amendments. Cf. Gran-ello v. United States, 386 U.S. 1019, 87 S.Ct. 1367, 18 L.Ed.2d 458; United States v. Fannon, 435 F.2d 364, 368 (7th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">If United States v. United States District Court for Eastern District of Michigan, 444 F.2d 651 (6th Cir.), certiorari granted, 403 U.S. 930, 91 S.Ct. 2255, 29 L.Ed.2d 708 (1971), is reversed by the Supreme Court, then under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(3)), the surveillances were lawful and need not be disclosed for this additional reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">We hold that the Seale logs require neither reversal nor dismissal of the contempt charges against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-17\">\n<em>Trial Before Another Judge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-18\">As a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U.S. 455, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532, the Government has conceded that the contempt convictions \u201e of all of these appellants, except the two trial counsel, should be reversed and remanded for consideration by another trial judge. The convictions of counselors Kunstler and Weinglass are asserted to stand on a different footing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-19\">The Government argues that the post-trial summary contempt punishment of the lawyers in this case was proper under Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 451, 96 L.Ed. 717. That case involved a trial judge\u2019s summary contempt conviction, after trial, of several attorneys who had represented eleven Communist Party leaders convicted of Smith Act violations in the celebrated <em>Dennis </em>trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is clear that the lawyers\u2019 contemptuous conduct in that case included an attack upon the trial judge personally. 343 U.S. at 4-5, 72 S.Ct. 451 and 343 U.S. at 33-35, 72 S.Ct. 451. (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>theless, the Supreme Court majority upheld the post-trial summary procedure, deciding that \u201csummary\u201d as used in Fed.R.Crim.Pro. 42(a) was not synonymous with \u201cinstantly\u201d but rather referred to the informality of the procedure. 343 U.S. at 9, 72 S.Ct. 451. If the trial judge could have cited the lawyers instantly, he was entitled to do so at the end of the trial since \u201cno possible prejudice to them can result from delaying it until the end of the trial if the circumstances permit such delay.\u201d 343 U.S. at 10, 72 S.Ct. at 455. Responding to the argument that post-trial summary procedure was inappropriate where the conduct in question included a personal attack on the judge, Mr. Justice Jackson, speaking for the Court, said Rule 42(a) contained \u201cno such limitation\u201d and found any distinction between personally offensive contempts and impersonal contuma-cies illusory. Predicating the applicability of Rule 42(a) upon such a distinction, he stated, \u201cwould nullify, in practice, the power it purports to grant.\u201d 343 U.S. at 12, 72 S.Ct. at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Were <em>Sacher </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s latest pronouncement on the subject, we would affirm the trial judge\u2019s use of summary procedure in the instant case since, as the Government argues, the factual postures of the two cases are closely akin. However, as Judge Me-Gowan has convincingly elaborated in United States v. Meyer, 149 U.S.App.D.C. -, 462 F.2d 827 (1972), cases subsequent to <em>Sacher </em>have considerably undermined its vitality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">In Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S. 11, 75 S.Ct. 11, 99 L.Ed. 11, the Supreme Court forbade the use of summary contempt power post-trial by a trial judge who had become \u201cpersonally embroiled\u201d with the lawyer whom he cited. 348 U.S. at 17, 75 S.Ct. 11. The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Frankfurter, held under its \u201csupervisory authority over the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts\u201d (348 U.S. at 13, 75 S.Ct. at 13) that a trial judge so embroiled could not proceed summarily after the completion of the trial but must recuse himself to allow another judge to adjudicate the contempt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court said: \u201c[T]he pith of this rather extraordinary [summary contempt] power to punish without the formalities required by the Bill of Rights for the prosecution of federal crimes generally, is that the necessities of the administration of justice require such summary dealing with obstructions to it.\u201d 348 U.S. at 14, 75 S.Ct. at 13. The thrust of the <em>Offutt </em>opinion is that where the trial judge waits until the conclusion of trial to cite for contempt, the necessity to preserve order in the courtroom cannot sanction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>summary procedure. On the other hand, the \u201cfair administration of justice\u201d (348 U.S. at 17, 75 S.Ct. 11) will not tolerate a judge who has become personally embroiled with trial attorneys to sit in judgment on their conduct, at least after the trial is over, merely because that course is more convenient, more economical and less time consuming than having another judge conduct a hearing. See United States v. Meyer, 149 U.S.App.D.C.-, 462 F.2d 827 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 84 S.Ct. 841, 11 L.Ed.2d 921, a witness, who was also a lawyer, in a state criminal trial was held in contempt for his conduct on the witness stand. The trial judge presided over the post-trial contempt proceeding. The witness-contem-nor argued this was improper because his remarks were a personal attack on the judge which \u201cnecessarily, and without more\u201d disqualified the trial judge from conducting the contempt hearing. 376 U.S. at 583, 84 S.Ct. 841. The Supreme Court rejected the argument and upheld the summary procedure in that case, concluding from its own examination of the record that the witness\u2019 conduct \u201cwas disruptive, recalcitrant and disagreeable commentary, but hardly an insulting attack upon the integrity of the judge carrying such potential for bias as to require disqualification.\u201d 376 U.S. at 584, 84 S.Ct. at 847. Moreover, contrary to the situation in <em>Offutt, </em>the Court found that the trial judge had not become personally involved with the petitioner. 376 U.S. at 585, 84 S.Ct. 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U.S. 455, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532, the Supreme Court required recusal as a matter of due process where the trial judge was the victim of an insulting personal attack by a <em>pro se </em>defendant and waited until the conclusion of the trial to cite for contempt. In that case the Court did not find the judge was an \u201cactivist seeking combat\u201d as in <em>Offutt, </em>but on the other hand, could not say from its examination of the record that May-berry\u2019s remarks were merely \u201cdisruptive, recalcitrant and disagreeable commentary\u201d as were the remarks in <em>Un-gar. </em>Rather the tenor of the bitter, vilifying remarks was such that an inevitable potential for bias was generated. 400 U.S. at 465-466, 91 S.Ct. 499. In the Court\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">\u201c[A] judge, vilified as was this Pennsylvania judge, necessarily becomes embroiled in a running, bitter controversy. No one so cruelly slandered is likely to maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\u201d 400 U.S. at 465, 91 S.Ct. at 505.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">From a distillation of the foregoing authorities, two significant propositions emerge. First, a distinction can and must be made between contumacious conduct generally and contumacious conduct which is \u201capt to strike \u2018at the most vulnerable and human qualities of a judge\u2019s temperament.\u2019 \u201d Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, <em>supra </em>at 466, 91 S.Ct. at 505. If, as Mr. Justice Jackson had intimated in <em>Sacher, </em>this distinction was illusory and unworkable, the Court would not have carefully appraised the record in <em>Ungar </em>to conclude \u201cwe cannot say there was bias, or such a likelihood of bias or an appearance of bias that the judge was unable to hold the balance between vindicating the interests of the court and the interests of the accused.\u201d 376 U.S. at 588, 84 S.Ct. at 849. The Court in <em>Mayberry </em>would not have reached an opposite conclusion on examination of the record. And the Court would not in <em>Offutt </em>have stated that it is \u201cimportant that district judges guard against [the] easy confusion\u201d of \u201cidentifying] offense to self with obstruction to law.\u201d 348 U.S. at 14, 75 S.Ct. at 13.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Second, if the conduct of the defendant includes a personal attack on the trial judge carrying such potential for bias that he is not \u201clikely to maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication\u201d <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>400 U.S. at 465, 91 S.Ct. at 505, the trial judge must disqualify himself if he waits to act until the conclusion of the trial. When the trial proceedings have terminated, the need to proceed summarily is not present. In this situation, the possible prejudice to the accused as well as the diminution of the quality of justice in the public eye<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> overrides any economy of effort that would be achieved by summary procedure. Insofar as the Court in <em>Sacher </em>saw no need to differentiate between a trial judge\u2019s ability to act instantly and his ability to cite for contempt after the trial is ended, even where personal attack is involved, it has since altered its focus. See Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, <em>supra; </em>Harris v. United States, 382 U.S. 162, 164-167, 86 S.Ct. 352, 15 L.Ed.2d 240; Offutt v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The argument is made that <em>Sacher </em>has special vitality where the eontem-nor is a lawyer. Mayberry was not a lawyer. Certainly the fact that the defendant is an attorney can have no bearing on the need to distinguish between an obstruction to justice and a personal affront which makes bias probable. But the Court in <em>Sacher </em>adverted to the desirability of avoiding instant action against a contumacious attorney because that course \u201cis not unlikely to prejudice his client.\u201d 343 U.S. at 10, 72 S.Ct. at 455. In <em>Mayberry </em>the Court recognized that \u201cinstant treatment of contempt where lawyers are involved may greatly prejudice their clients,\u201d but cautioned that \u201cit may be the only wise course where others are involved,\u201d 400 U.S. at 463, 91 S.Ct. at 504, as others were in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">In any event, the wisdom of deferring action against a lawyer has nothing to do with the requisites of due process when the trial judge \u201cdoes not act the instant the contempt is committed, but waits until the end of the trial * * <em>Mayberry, supra </em>at 463-464, 91 S.Ct. at 504. That is, while the possible prejudice to the lawyer\u2019s clients may counterbalance the need to preserve order in the court through immediate action, this consideration simply has no bearing on whether the trial judge may himself proceed summarily or must call in another judge to take his place when he has already decided to wait. See United States v. Meyer, 149 U.S.App.D.C. -, 462 F.2d 827, 840, n. 21 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Consequently, all that remains is for us to assess in the light of <em>Mayberry </em>the character of the lawyer\u2019s conduct as it appears from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">Our study of this record convinces us that under <em>Mayberry </em>the trial judge was disqualified from passing upon the contempt specifications against these lawyers because their attack upon him did carry \u201csuch potential for bias as to require disqualification.\u201d As in <em>Mayberry, </em>the insults leveled by Messrs. Kunstler and Weinglass against the trial judge were apt to strike \u201cat the most vulnerable and human qualities of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>judge\u2019s temperament,\u201d thus, requiring \u201ca public trial before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor[s].\u201d 400 U.S. at 466, 91 S.Ct. at 505; see also Cooke v. United States, 297 U.S. 517, 539, 45 S.Ct. 390, 69 L.Ed. 767; Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S. 11, 14, 75 S.Ct. 11, 99 L.Ed. 11.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Here the trial judge was the recipient of numerous and unprecedented attacks and insults by both trial counsel. These attacks would have affected any judge personally. For example, no judge could remain impartial toward Mr. Kunstler after the judge\u2019s honesty and integrity were assailed as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: I want to comment on this, your Honor, because I think what you have just said is about the most outrageous statement I have ever heard from a bench, and I am going to say my piece right now, and you can hold me in contempt right now if you wish to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">\u201cYou have violated every principle of fair play when you excluded Ramsey Clark from that witness stand. The New York Times, among others, has called it the ultimate outrage in American justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">* X * * -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">\u201cI have sat here for four and a half months and watched the objections denied and sustained by your Honor, and I know that this is not a fair trial. I know it in my heart. If I have to lose my license to practice law and if I have to go to jail, I can\u2019t think of a better cause to go to jail for and to lose my license for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">***** X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-10\">\u201cI am going to turn back to my seat with the realization that every thing I have learned throughout my life has come to naught, that there is no meaning in this court, and there is no law in this court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-13\">\u201c \u2014 and these men are going to jail by virtue of a legal lynching\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-14\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-15\">\u201c \u2014 and that your Honor is wholly responsible for that, and if this is what your career is going to end on, if this is what your pride is going to be built on, I can only say to your Honor, \u2018Good luck to you.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">The record abounds with other instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-17\">Although Mr. Weinglass engaged in lesser attacks upon the trial judge, the need for recusal is also present as to him. For example, Weinglass remarked that \u201cThe door in this courtroom seems to swing in one direction [against the defendants].\u201d He also referred to the trial judge as \u201cinhumane,\u201d called the judge\u2019s action \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d and possibly accused the judge of \u201cdishonesty.\u201d (It is unclear whether he was referring to the judge or to the prosecutors.) Moreover, the trial judge characterized Weinglass\u2019 remarks as \u201cinsulting,\u201d \u201csarcastic,\u201d and on one occasion accused him of making an \u201cinvidious comparison between the treatment the court afforded the witnesses called by the defendant as opposed to the treatment afforded witnesses called by the Government.\u201d Additionally, it would be artificial to view the conduct of either defense counsel in isolation from that of the other since defense counsel mutually supported each other\u2019s activities or,, for that matter, in isolation from the concededly disqualifying disrespect of the other defendants since the conduct of all the defendants here was inextricably interwoven. The trial judge himself felt that all the defendants worked in concert at \u201cbaiting the judge\u201d and implicated the two lawyers in this nefarious purpose as is evidenced in the common preface of the contempt certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-18\">Finally, there is really no necessity to attempt to calculate precisely the potential for bias generated by the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>these attorneys. The record reveals that their conduct tended to be productive of actual prejudice toward them on the part of the trial judge. In such a situation it matters not whether the judge\u2019s reaction was understandable or not; <em>Mayberry </em>must govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Accordingly, while regretting the necessity therefor, we conclude that all 9 contemnors must be tried before another judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\n<em>Jury Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">For the reasons given in our opinion in United States v. Seale, <em>supra, </em>each appellant whose sentences aggregated more than 6 months was entitled to a jury trial. Since defendant Lee Weiner received only a 2 months and 18 days sentence, he is not so entitled. Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522, and Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373, 86 S.Ct. 1523, 16 L.Ed.2d 629. No indictment was required of any individual, even those whose sentences aggregated more than one year. United States v. Bukowski, 435 F.2d 1094 (7th Cir. 1970), certiorari denied, 401 U.S. 911, 91 S.Ct. 874, 27 L.Ed.2d 809. On remand, the guidelines established in United States v. Seale, <em>supra, </em>will govern. As noted in that companion case, the inferential findings and descriptions contained in the preface and conclusion of the contempt certificate must be deleted in order to avoid the jury\u2019s according them undue weight. In addition, in this case the trial judge\u2019s observations prefatory to many of the individual specifications present the same potential for prejudice, and therefore they also should not be placed before the jury. However, the judge handling this case on remand shall have authority to precede each specification with an introduction necessary to set out the precise offense alleged in the following excerpt from the transcript and to place the conduct depicted therein in its proper context. If the judge to whom this case is referred for trial decides that the outside limit of a cumulative sentence for any appellant (except Mr. Weiner, who is not entitled to a jury trial by virtue of his short sentence) should be 6 months maximum, a jury trial will not be necessary for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">\n<em>Legally Insufficient Specifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">A. <em>Attorneys. </em>As noted in the companion opinion, United States v. Seale, <em>supra, </em>in order for conduct to be punishable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(1), it must \u201cclearly be shown\u201d that the conduct \u201cactually obstructed the district judge in \u2018the performance of judicial duty.\u2019 \u201d In re McConnell, 370 U.S. 230, 234, 82 S.Ct. 1288, 1291, 8 L.Ed.2d 434; Ex parte Hudgings, 249 U.S. 378, 383, 39 S.Ct. 337, 63 L.Ed. 656. Our opinion in <em>Seale </em>requires, in addition to proof of the requisite wrongful intent, proof that the misbehavior was an \u201cactual and material obstruction.\u201d See <em>Seale, supra, </em>461 F.2d at 369. Where, as here, the conduct complained of is that of an attorney engaged in the representation of a litigant, the search for these essential elements of the crime of contempt must be made with full appreciation of the contentious role of trial counsel and his duty of zealous representation of his client\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">In dealing with an attorney\u2019s contempt, the Supreme Court noted in McConnell, <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. at 236, 82 S.Ct. at 1292, \u201c[W]hile we appreciate the necessity for a judge to have the power to protect himself from actual obstruction in the courtroom * * * it is also essential to a fair administration of justice that lawyers be able to make honest good-faith efforts to present their clients\u2019 cases. An independent judiciary and a vigorous, independent bar are both indispensable parts of our system of justice. To preserve the kind of trials that our system envisages, Congress has lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ited the summary contempt power vested in courts to the least possible power adequate to prevent actual obstruction of justice * * The appellants interpret this to mean that where an attorney\u2019s conduct is involved, good faith is an absolute defense to citation for contempt. As noted in the <em>Seale </em>opinion, we do not believe <em>McConnell </em>supports such a position.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The <em>McConnell </em>opinion cannot be read as a grant of impunity for all conduct undertaken in good faith. On the contrary, the pith of <em>McConnell, </em>when reduced to its essential, is that without an actual obstruction, there can be no contempt. That view is made explicit at page 236, 82 S.Ct. at page 1292 where the Court states, \u201c[T]he arguments of a lawyer in presenting his client\u2019s case strenuously and persistently cannot amount to a contempt of court so long as the lawyer does not in some way create an obstruction which blocks the judge in the performance of his judicial duty. The petitioner created no such obstacle here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">While <em>McConnell </em>cannot be read as an immunization for all conduct undertaken by an attorney in good faith representation of his client, it does require that attorneys be given great latitude in the area of vigorous advocacy. Appellate courts must ensure that trial judges (or the jury on remand) are not left free to manipulate the balance between vigorous advocacy and obstructions so as to chill effective advocacy when deciding lawyer contempts. Admittedly, the line defies strict delineation (Goldfarb, The Contempt Power, 172 (1971)), but by our resolving doubts in favor of advocacy, an independent and unintimidated bar can be maintained while actual obstruction is dealt with appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In delineating the limits of zealous advocacy, we must repeat the instruction of Mr. Justice Jackson in Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 9, 72 S.Ct. 451, 455, 96 L.Ed. 717, where he noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cOf course, it is the right of counsel for every litigant to press his claim, even if it appears farfetched and untenable, to obtain the court\u2019s considered ruling. Full enjoyment of that right, with due allowance for the heat of controversy, will be protected by appellate courts when infringed by trial courts. But if the ruling is adverse, it is not counsel\u2019s right to resist it or to insult the judge \u2014 his right is only respectfully to preserve his point for appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">See also United States v. Schiffer, 351 F.2d 91, 94 (6th Cir. 1965) certiorari denied, 384 U.S. 1003, 86 S.Ct. 1914, 16 L.Ed.2d 1017; MacInnis v. United States, 191 F.2d 157, 160 (9th Cir. 1951), certiorari denied, 342 U.S. 953, 72 S.Ct. 628, 96 L.Ed. 708; Halliman v. United States, 182 F.2d 880, 887 (9th Cir. 1950), certiorari denied, 341 U.S. 952, 71 S.Ct. 1010, 95 L.Ed. 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Many of the contempt specifications against the attorneys arise out of their persistence in continuing argument on motions and rulings after express orders by the trial judge to cease. With respect to these specifications, appellants contend that such persistence was warranted by the trial judge\u2019s refusal to hear reasonable argument from the defense prior to ruling. In support of this contention, reliance is placed upon Cooper v. Superior Court, 55 Cal.2d 291, 10 Cal.Rptr. 842, 359 P.2d 274 (1961). In that case the Supreme Court of California accepted the appellant\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]he power to silence an attorney does not begin until reasonable opportunity for appropriate objection or other indicated advocacy has been afforded.\u201d 10 Cal.Rptr. at 846, 359 P.2d at 278. Although this principle is not without appeal in extreme situations such as <em>Cooper, </em>where the judge <em>sua sponte </em>recalled a deadlocked jury and gave them his comments on the weight of the evidence without informing counsel of his actions or allowing them an opportunity to register objections, it cannot be accepted as a general principle. If a trial judge prejudicially denies counsel an adequate opportunity to argue a point, appellate courts will reverse, and that alone will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>deter most judges from arbitrarily cutting off argument. United States v. Offutt, 145 F.Supp. 111, 114 (D.D.C.1956), modified, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 247 F.2d 88, certiorari denied, 355 U.S. 856, 78 S.Ct. 85, 2 L.Ed.2d 64 (1957); see United States v. Sacher, 182 F.2d 416, 430 and 454 (concurring opinion of Frank, J.), affirmed, 343 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 451, 96 L.Ed. 717; Hallinan v. United States, 182 F.2d 880, 885 (9th Cir. 1950), certiorari denied, 341 U.S. 952, 71 S.Ct. 1010, 95 L.Ed. 1375; United States v. Bollenbach, 125 F.2d 458, 460 (2d Cir. 1942); Sprinkle v. Davis, 111 F.2d 925, 930 (4th Cir. 1940). And where the judge is arbitrary or affords counsel inadequate opportunity to argue his position, counsel must be given substantial leeway in pressing his contention, for it is through such colloquy that the judge may recognize his mistake and prevent error from infecting the record. It is, after all, the full intellectual exchange of ideas and positions that best facilitates the resolution of disputes. However, this is not to say that attorneys may press their positions beyond the court\u2019s insistent direction to desist. On the contrary, the necessity for orderly administration of justice compels the view that the judge must have the power to set limits on argument. We simply encourage judges to exercise tolerance in determining those limits and to distinguish carefully between hesitating, begrudging obedience and open defiance.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">A reading of the specifications against the attorneys in this case reveals a pattern in the specifications for refusal to obey a court directive to cease argument. That pattern necessitates a brief comment. The record discloses that the trial judge, when ordering counsel to terminate their argument or sit down, frequently added a rejoinder or coupled the order with a statement which called for a response by the attorneys. In such situations, it is our view that an invited, additional response cannot subsequently be viewed as a contemptuous violation of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"> Appellants, relying on In re Abse, 251 A.2d 655 (D.C.Mun.Ct.App.1969), also argue that an attorney may with impunity defy a court order to refrain from reply where the judge has charged him with professional misconduct. The court in <em>Abse </em>held that an attorney charged by the trial judge with unprofessional conduct may insist upon being heard in his own defense so long as his response is respectful. We agree that there is in this limited situation cogent reason for permitting such response since appellate review is not available to vindicate an attorney who is erroneously charged with unprofessional conduct. To require him to remain silent in the face of such a charge is, as the court said in <em>Abse, </em>to render him \u201chelpless.\u201d Of course, it bears repeating that <em>Abse </em>affords only an opportunity to answer the charge respectfully. Even if the judge\u2019s accusation be unfounded or ill-tempered, it does not protect counter-misbehavior, for as the court noted in United States v. Offutt, 145 F.Supp. 111, 114 (D.D.C.1956), \u201c[T]wo wrongs do not make a right, and misconduct cannot obliterate other misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Yet another frequent charge against the attorneys is that they failed to aid the court in maintaining order. While this charge was often coupled with the additional assertion that they actively encouraged their clients in their disruptions, for purposes of remand it is necessary to distinguish between the two situations. An attorney has no affirmative obligation to restrain his client under pain of the contempt sanction, although we do not express an opinion as to the breach of professional ethics that may be involved in this situation. Indeed, compelling an attorney to control the conduct of his client under threat of the contempt sanction might well destroy the confidence in the attorney-client relationship which is necessary to a proper and adequate defense. However, where an attorney encourages disruptive behavior by a client or fans the flames <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>of existing frictions, he cannot find immunity from punishment for such conduct. As the Court said in United States v. Landes, 97 F.2d 378, 381 (2d Cir. 1938),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">\u201cCounsel should not obtrude upon the court the passion, the prejudice, or the unreason of his client. These must be left outside the courtroom door. The controversy that crosses the threshold should be a controversy sifted by the intelligence and shaped by the conscience of the lawyer, not the turmoil of personal dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Finally, as was noted in <em>Seale, </em>mere disrepect or insult cannot be punished where it does not involve an actual and material obstruction. This is particularly true with respect to attorneys where the \u201cheat of courtroom debate\u201d may prompt statements which are ill-considered and might later be regretted. In re Hallinan, 71 Cal.2d 1179, 81 Cal.Rptr. 1, 459 P.2d 255 (1969). Substantial freedom of expression should be tolerated in this area since \u201c[J]udges are supposed to be men of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate.\u201d Craig v. Harney, 331 U.S. 367, 376, 67 S.Ct. 1249, 1255, 91 L.Ed. 1546. However, as also noted in <em>Seale, </em>although it is elusive, there is a line beyond which disrespect becomes obstruction. When the remarks create an imminent prejudice to a fair and dispassionate proceeding, that line has been crossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The presence or absence of contempt may turn upon no more than how the remark was made.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For example, where the insult or disrespectful remark is shouted, the insult itself may not amount to an obstruction of the judicial process, but by the manner in which it was made it may. This was made clear in In re Little, 404 U.S. 553, 92 S.Ct. 659, 31 L.Ed.2d 708 (1972), where the Supreme Court reversed a contempt conviction for disrespectful conduct but in doing so noted, \u201c[T]here is no indication, and the State does not argue, that petitioner\u2019s statements were uttered in a boisterous tone or in any wise actually disrupted the court proceeding.\u201d Moreover, if an entirely unnecessary and not insignificant delay is occasioned by insulting remarks which serve, for instance, only to vent the speaker\u2019s spleen, a material obstruction would exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">With respect to the question of intent, we said in <em>Seale </em>that the minimum standard is one of a voluntary action known by the actor to be wrongful or one that he reasonably should have been aware was wrongful. Attorneys have a right to be persistent, vociferous, contentious, and imposing, even to the point of appearing obnoxious, when acting in their client\u2019s behalf. An attorney may with impunity take full advantage of the range of conduct that our adversary system allows. Given this extreme liberality necessary to a vital bar and thus the effective discovery of truth through the adversary process, an attorney possesses the requisite intent only if he knows or reasonably should be aware in view of all the circumstances, especially the heat of controversy, that he is exceeding the outermost limits of his proper role and hindering rather than facilitating the search for truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Thus, as we did with the contempt specifications in <em>Seale, </em>we have carefully examined those against the attorney appellants and have determined that some do not, as a matter of law, charge conduct which rises to the level of an \u201cobstruction] [of] the administration of justice.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 (1). Again, it bears repeating that those specifications which are remanded for trial are not thereby found to be obstructions, nor do they necessarily show misbehavior or the requisite intent. The jury will determine the issues of misbehavior, obstruction, and intent for all specifications not found insufficient as a matter of law. Those specifications deemed legally insufficient are (by appellant and number): Weinglass, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8; Kunstler, Nos. 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, the first part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>17, 18 and 19. However, the jury may consider the conduct described therein in connection with the factual questions to be resolved with respect to the valid specifications. See United States v. Seale, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">As we made clear in United States v. Seale, impropriety on the part of the trial judge cannot justify or excuse contemptuous conduct. However, judicial (or prosecutorial) provocation is to be considered by the new hearing judge in extenuation of the offense and in mitigation of any penalty to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">B. <em>Non-lawyers. </em>With respect to the non-lawyer defendants who were cited for contumacious conduct, it is manifest that the standards regarding the essential elements of the offense set forth in United States v. Seale, shall apply to the trial upon remand. It is equally clear that litigants not even making a pretense of self-representation are not to be afforded the same latitude of speech and action as an attorney. Judge Breitel stated in Katz v. Murtagh, 28 N.Y.2d 234, 240, 321 N.Y.S.2d 104, 109, 269 N.E.2d 816, 820 (1971), \u201c[T]he court is not a public hall for the expression of views, nor is it a political arena or a street. It is a place for trial of defined issues in accordance with law and rules of evidence, with standards of demeanor for court, jurors, parties, witnesses and counsel.\u201d This Court pointed out in United States ex rel. Robson v. Malone, 412 F.2d 848, 850 (7th Cir. 1969), that in courtrooms \u201cthere must be silence, except as the orderly conduct of business calls for speech.\u201d Thus where there is legally adequate representation and no pressing need for the litigant to interject himself into the proceedings, this Court is hesitant to find as a matter of law that any such interjection did not rise to the level of an obstruction. We believe that question is better left for the jury in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Brief mention, however, must be made concerning those specifications which deal with the appellants\u2019 refusals to stand when court was convened and recessed. It is our opinion that such symbolic acts, when not coupled with further disturbance or disruption, sometimes might not rise to the level of an actual and material obstruction of the judicial process. In United States ex rel. Robson v. Malone, <em>supra, </em>we expressed \u201csome doubt about the power of the court' to require spectators to perform purely ceremonial or symbolic acts.\u201d While the <em>per curium </em>opinion in <em>Malone </em>concluded that a court \u201cmay require such rising\u201d and while we reaffirm that conclusion as to rising at the beginning of a session and end of a recess, we believe on remand some of the failures to rise here could be found nonobstruetive. Such symbolic acts as cited here, when tested by the actual and material standard, do not necessarily alone amount to obstructions punishable as criminal contempt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Of course, where such an act is accompanied by some disturbance, disorder or interruption, an obstruction may exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">It is decided, therefore, that all specifications against non-lawyer appellants be remanded for trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">After careful consideration of the arguments of appellants and <em>amici curiae, </em>in our judgment, except as to those legally insufficient, none of the charges merits dismissal \u201cin the interests of justice.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the words of Mr. Justice Cardozo, \u201cJustice, though due to the accused, is due to the accuser also.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, the contempt convictions' of appellants are reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Number of Contempt Specifications and Sentences Thereunder</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">DAVID T.

Judge Julius J. Hoffman</p>\n<p id=\"AEu\">vs.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">David T. Dellinger [et al.]</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">No. 69 CR 180</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">CERTIFICATE OF CONTEMPT<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">In conformity with Rule 42(a), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U. S.C., I hereby certify that the series of criminal contempts set forth below were committed in the actual presence of the court and were seen or heard by the court during the trial of the case of United States of America v. David T. Dellinger, et al., 69 CR 180, which commenced on September 24, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">This was a case marred by continual disruptive outbursts in . direct defiance of judicial authority by the defendants and defense counsel. I will specify here the instances of conduct of record which I consider to have been contemptuous, but I also make the entire record of the case of United States of America v. David T. Dellinger, et al., 69 CR 180, a part of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Much of the contemptuous conduct in this case does not show, of record. The constant murmurs and snickering emanating from the defense table were not captured on the printed page. No record, no matter how skillfully transcribed, can adequately portray the venom, sarcasm, and tone of voice employed by a speaker. No record, no matter how skillfully transcribed, can adequately reflect the applause, the guffaws, and other subtle tactics employed by these contemnors in an attempt to break up this trial. I have not focused on these cheap theatrics, histrionics, and affectations. I note them for the record lest my silence be construed as approval. But for the sake of the citations of contempt in this case, I limit myself to that conduct which is clearly and adequately portrayed in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">This was a long trial. The behavior of the defendants and defense counsel was prepared with direct and defiant contempt for the court and the federal judicial system as a whole. Here is a record of exceptional circumstances which were disruptive of the proceedings. It has been my considered judgment throughout this case that the behavior of the defendants was aimed at baiting the judge and inciting and harassing the U. S. Attorneys in an attempt to stop the trial. I would have been derelict in my duty as a Federal District Judge if I were to permit such base and unethical tactics to succeed. Consequently, I have waited until this trial was concluded before making a final determination of contempt. The exigencies of such a complex and difficult case compelled me to follow that course.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">DAVID T. DELLINGER</p>\n<p id=\"ALr\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">On October 15th when the Judge entered the courtroom, Mr. Dellinger was standing and the following colloquy occurred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-16\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: Mr. Hoffman, we are observing the moratorium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-17\">The Court: I am Judge Hoffman, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-18\">Mr. Dellinger: I believe in equality, sir, so I prefer to call people mister or by their first name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-19\">The Court: Sit down. The clerk is about to call my cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-20\">Mr. Dellinger: I wanted to explain to you we are reading the names of the war dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-21\">The Marshal: Sit down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Mr. Dellinger: We were just reading the names of the dead from both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Marshal: Sit down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Official Transcript Page 2425A.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar2\">Subsequently the jury was brought into the room. When the jury was seated, the defendant Dellinger once more rose and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcG\">\u201cDefendant Dellinger: Before the witness resumes the stand, we would like to propose\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">Mr. Schultz: If the Court please\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acv-dedup-0\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor. If the Court please, may the marshal take that man into custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">Defendant Dellinger: A moment of silence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">Mr. Schultz: Your Honor, this man\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, take out the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">(The following proceedings were had in open court, out of the presence and hearing of the jury:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqo\">\u201cDefendant Dellinger: We only wanted a moment of silence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, this man has announced this on the elevator coming up here that he was intending to do this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-15\">Defendant Dellinger: I did not. It doesn\u2019t matter, I would have been glad to, but I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-16\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, I object to this man speaking out in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-17\">The Court: You needn\u2019t object. I forbid him to disrupt the proceedings. I note for the record that his name is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-18\">Defendant Dellinger: David Dellin-ger is my name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-19\">The Court: You needn\u2019t interrupt my sentence for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-20\">Defendant Dellinger: You have been interrupting ours. I thought I might finish that sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-21\">The Court: The name of this man who has attempted to disrupt the proceedings in this court is David Del-linger and the record will clearly indicate that, Miss Reporter, and I direct him and all of the others not to repeat such occurrences.\u201d Official Transcript Pages 2429-30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-23\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-24\">When the witness Salzberg left the witness box in order to identify the defendant Hayden, the defendant Dellinger said to him, in a voice loud enough for the jury to hear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-25\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: Quite a let down. I am really disappointed in you.\u201d Page 3770.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-26\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-27\">On October 22nd, after the defendant Seale had defied a judicial order by speaking out again and again, after being told to stop, the defendant Dellinger rose and addressed the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-28\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: I think you should understand we support Bobby Seale in this \u2014 at least I do.\u201d Page 3642.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-29\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-30\">On October 27th, during the testimony of the witness Frapolly, the defendant Dellinger made the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayu-dedup-0\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: Mr. Foran, do you believe one word of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-31\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, may the record show the comment from the defendant Dellinger, your Honor ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-32\">The Court: Yes. Mr. Dellinger has made several comments from time to time. The record may indeed show\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlTq\">Did you get the comment of Mr. Dellinger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-33\">Mr. Dellinger: Yes. I asked Mr. Foran if he could possibly believe one word of that. I don\u2019t believe the witness believes it. I don\u2019t believe Mr. Foran believes it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-34\">The Court: And continue to take his words, and I admonish you, sir, not to interrupt this trial by your conversation or your remarks. You have a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>very competent lawyer representing you. You are not permitted to speak while he represents you.\u201d Page 4372.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">On October 28th, the following occurred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: Your Honor, the defendants, with whom I have consulted, every one except Mr. Seale, have requested me to just make one question \u2014ask one question of your Honor before they give me their decision, and the question would be: Is the price of my doing the compromising or waiving by Mr. Seale of his constitutional assertion that I am not his lawyer and he wants to defend himself ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">The Court: You don\u2019t expect me to answer a question put to me that way, do you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">Mr. Dellinger: Why not? You expect us to answer a question.\u201d Page 4395.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">At the close of the court session on October 28th, 1969, the defendant Del-linger refused to rise in the customary manner when the court left the room. Pages 4618-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">On October 28th in the afternoon session, after the court had engaged in a colloquy with Mr. Seale concerning his right to cross examine witnesses, Mr. Dellinger rose and stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-13\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: And all the defendants support Bobby Seale\u2019s right to have a counsel of his choice here and affirm that he has been denied that right.\u201d Page 4638.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">On October 29th, Mr. Dellinger engaged in a physical struggle with one of the marshals who was attempting to restrain the defendant Bobby Seale, and when the court called a recess, Mr. Del-linger refused to rise in the customary manner. Pages 4724-4729.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-17\">On October 29th, in the afternoon session, when the court was compelled to call a recess, the defendant Dellinger again refused to rise in the customary manner. Page 4763.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-18\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-19\">On October 30th, at the beginning of the court session, the defendant Dellinger again refused to rise in the customary manner. Page 4801.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-20\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-21\">On October 30th, after the defendant Hayden had engaged in a colloquy with the court, the defendant Dellinger commented aloud from the defense table:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap_\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: What about the motion? There was a motion. The motion was for voir dire of the jury. He hasn\u2019t ruled.\u201d Page 4844.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-22\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-23\">On October 30th, when the court again called a recess, Mr. Dellinger once more refused to rise in the customary manner. Page 4849.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-24\">XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-25\">On November 12th, during the direct examination of the witness Bock, the defendant Dellinger laughed at the court as the court made an observation and Mr. Dellinger said aloud so that the jury could hear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-26\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: We are not ashamed to laugh.\u201d Page 6258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-27\">The conduct was repeated a few moments later during the testimony of Mr. Bock and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-28\">\u201cMr. Schultz: Mr. Kunstler is laughing so he can influence the jury with the impression that this is absurd. That is why he is laughing aloud because he \u2014 if Mr. Dellinger would stop talking when we are addressing the court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-29\">Mr. Dellinger: I am trying to tell something to my lawyer. It is absurd. It is \u2014 he is a vaudeville actor.\u201d Pages 6288-89.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">On November 19th, during the cross examination of the witness Bock, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\u201cMr. Schultz: Objection. That has no bearing, no probative \u2014 if Mr. Del-linger will stop talking to me when I am trying to address the court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">Mr. Dellinger: I don\u2019t talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">Mr. Schultz: And mumble to me every time I am trying to make an objection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">Mr. Dellinger: Don\u2019t go making up things, Richard Schultz. I didn\u2019t talk to you. I don\u2019t mind your making all of these phony objections, but when you start lying about me, too, I think that is disgusting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">The Court: Mr. Dellinger\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\">Mr. Dellinger: I didn\u2019t say a word to him, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">The Court: You just said enough to make me admonish you not to make any more remarks like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-14\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, you ought to admonish the U. S. Attorney not to make remarks\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-16\">The Court: He may not speak out here. He has a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-17\">Mr. Dellinger: He just lied about me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-18\">Mr. Schultz: I am sitting next to Mr. Dellinger and he is mumbling under his breath to me. He has been doing this for the last\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-19\">Mr. Dellinger: I said \u2018Ah\u2019 when he asked a bad question. I didn\u2019t say a word\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-20\">The Court: You have competent lawyers to speak for you, sir, and I shall not permit you to speak for yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-22\">Mr. Kunstler: Then your Honor, I would ask your Honor to direct the U. S. Attorney not to take comments that are made here at the table to me or any other member of this table as remarks always addressed to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-23\">Mr. Poran: Your Honor, I was sitting here, too. I overheard the remark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-24\">Mr. Dellinger: You\u2019re adding a lie to his lie, and I say that on my word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-25\">The Court: I see that you are not accepting my admonition, sir, and I ask the reporter to make note of that.\u201d Pages 7341-43.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-26\">XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-27\">On November 20, after the Court had made a ruling refusing to grant a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-28\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: Aw Jesus \u2014 fascist\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-29\">The Court: Who is that man talking Mr. Marshal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-30\">Mr. Dellinger: That is Mr. David Dellinger and he is saying that that is an arbitrary denial when you say who is key to our defense. We know who is key to our defense and we want to put on our key defense witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-31\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, ask that man to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-32\">The Marshal:. Sit down, Mr. Del-linger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-33\">Mr. Dellinger: I think that is acting like a fascist court like Mr. Seale said when you make decisions of that kind and deprive us of our witnesses. Because he has already been persecuted in one court, now you are persecuting him and us in another court.\u201d Page . 8078.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-34\">XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-35\">On November 26th, the day before Thanksgiving, after the Court determined that it would be unable to permit the sequestered jury to return home for the Thanksgiving Holiday, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-36\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: We move\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-37\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, we move\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-39\">Mr. Weinglass: It\u2019s true. It\u2019s a true comment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-40\">The Court: Who was that man who said he moved that is not a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Mr. Dellinger: I am telling our lawyers we move the jury not have to be sequestered so they can be home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, will you have that man\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">Mr. Dellinger: You asked about it, and I am telling you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">The Court: Let him sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">Mr. Dellinger: I was telling the lawyer before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">The Court: He has a lawyer.\u201d Page 8610.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">XVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">During the testimony of the witness Meyerding, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-14\">\u201cThe Court: I note for the record that certain of the defendants, Del-linger particularly\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-15\">Mr. Dellinger: I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-16\">The Court: \u2014made noises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-17\">Mr. Dellinger: I beg your pardon, I did not utter a single noise.

If so, you are a liar. I did not utter a single noise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-22\">The Court: And make a note of that last statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-23\">Mr. Dellinger: I have called this a fascist court before and I think he is trying to prove it. It is absolutely irresponsible on your part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-24\">The Court: Make a note of that last statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-25\">Mr. Dellinger: Absolutely irresponsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-26\">The Marshal: Sit down, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-27\">Mr. Dellinger: And dishonest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akq\">The Court: Make a note of that last statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-29\">Miss Reporter, have you all of Mr. Dellinger\u2019s comments?

Mr. Del-linger has done that sort of thing before and I merely wanted to identify the person, that is all, for the record.\u201d Pages 10,628-29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-44\">XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-45\">On December 15, when /the Court was compelled to request the /marshal to remove Mr. Stuart Ball, Jr'., the following occurred: ^</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-46\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Marshal, take Mr. Ball out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-47\">Mr. Dellinger: That is an injustice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-48\">Mr. Kunstler: That is a lawyer who is part of our defense team.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-49\">The Court: He is not a lawyer admitted to practice in this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-50\">Mr. Kunstler: You are removing a lawyer from the defense table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The Court: No, he is not a lawyer admitted to practice here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">Mr. Kunstler: That doesn\u2019t matter, your Honor.

I will go back and ask him another question.\u201d Official Transcript, Page 16,-201.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">XXVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">On January 23, during the direct examination of the witness Davis, the court indicated that argument on a mistrial motion had been completed, and ordered Mr. Kunstler to sit down. After Mr. Kunstler flaunted the court\u2019s orders and continued to argue, the defendant Dellinger rose from his place at the defense table, and the following incident ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: You haven\u2019t even heard the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-13\">Mr. Rubin: You haven\u2019t heard it yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">The Court: For a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-15\">Mr. Kunstler: Yes, but I would like to argue it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-16\">The Court: Oh, there is no ground for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-17\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor knows you have referred to the question of defendants taking the stand.

I said before the judge was the chief prosecutor, and he\u2019s proved the point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-27\">The Court: Will you remain quiet. Will you remain quiet, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-28\">Mr. Dellinger: You let Foran give a foreign policy speech, but when he tries to answer it, you interrupt him and won\u2019t let him speak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-29\">There\u2019s no pretense of fairness in this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-30\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, will you go to that man and ask him to remain quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-31\">Mr. Dellinger: No pretense of fairness.

You\u2019re accusing me. I\u2019m a pacifist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-34\">Marshal Joneson: Sit down, please, and be quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-35\">Mr. Dellinger: I employ nonviolence, and you\u2019re accusing me of violence, and you have a man right here, backed up by guns, jails, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>force and violence. That is the difference between us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">Marshal Joneson: Will you sit down. (Applause.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">The Court: Will you continue, please, with the direct examination of this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">Mr. Dellinger: There goes the violence right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">Mr. Kunstler: That\u2019s the government in operation, your Honor, as it has been throughout this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">The Witness: Your Honor, that's my sister they are taking out of the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">The Court: Even your sister\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">Mr. Kunstler: Nobody but the government has employed violence in this courtroom \u2014 with Bobby Seale, with spectators.\u201d Official Transcript, Pages 17,371-17,373.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">At this point, the marshals found it necessary to remove several of the spectators from the courtroom for disorderly conduct. Mr. Kunstler made some remarks about the removal of the spectators, and Mr. Poran rose to defend the way the trial was being conducted. This precipitated the following outburst from Mr. Dellinger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-16\">\u201cMr. Foran: Your Honor, traditionally in American law, cases are tried in a courtroom by the participants in the trial, not the audience, not spectators, not relatives of the defendants, but by witnesses and by the court and by the jury, not by shouting and screaming and voluntary statements from counsel, or from the defendants shouting out in courtrooms, because that is the American judicial system, and it\u2019s worked very well for two hundred years, and it\u2019s not going to change now for these people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-17\">Mr. Dellinger: Yes, kept the black people in slavery for two hundred years and wiped out the Indians and kept the poor people in problems and started the war in Viet Nam which is killing off at least a hundred Americans and a thousand Vietnamese every week, and we are trying to stop it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-18\">Marshal Joneson: Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-19\">Mr. Dellinger: And you call that ranting and raving and screaming because we speak the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-20\">Marshal Joneson: Mr. Dellinger, sit down, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-21\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, in the American\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-22\">Mr. Dellinger: And that judge won\u2019t let that issue come into the trial, that\u2019s why we are here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-23\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, in the American system there is a proper way to raise such issues and to correct them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-24\">Mr. Dellinger: That was the proper way with Fred Hampton, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asz\">Mr. Kunstler made several more remarks, and Mr. Schultz rose to answer him, and Mr. Dellinger interjected a comment again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-25\">\u201cMr. Schultz: We complied with the rules of this court. We have made no statements to the press, to any press, since this case was indicted. Mr. Kunstler, on a regular basis, has been falsifying to the press, violating the rules of the court prohibiting every attorney in this case from making press conferences, and he has been doing it and he stands before this court and says the Government has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-26\">Mr. Dellinger: And they have rules like that in Nazi Germany.\u201d Official Transcript, Pages 17,374 through 375.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-27\">XXVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-28\">On January 24, once more the testimony of the defendant Davis was interrupted. Mr. Foran was responding to an argument by Mr. Kunstler, when Mr. Dellinger interjected his remarks once more:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-29\">\u201cMr. Foran: In this case, your Honor, we have heard these people adopt or attempt to adopt Dr. King, attempt to adopt Senator McCarthy, Robert Kennedy, both of whom were better friends of mine than they ever were of theirs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-31\">Mr. Dellinger: Oh, my God.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Mr. Foran: Mr. Kennedy appointed Mr. Schultz, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">Mr. Kunstler: Oh, your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">Mr. Dellinger: Reverend Abernathy was the co-chairman of the Mobilization and I worked intimately with Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">Mr. Foran: Robert Kennedy appointed this young man as an Assistant United States Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">The Court: Mr. \u2014 young man, will you have Mr. Dellinger sit down, and, Miss Reporter, did you get Mr. Dellinger\u2019s remarks?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Mr. Dellinger did not sit down at the direction of the marshal and very slightly later the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Marshal, ask that man to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">Mr. Dellinger: There has to be some way of speaking the truth. We have to speak the truth some way. If you won\u2019t allow it to come in other ways, we have to stand up and tell it because it is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">The Court: Mr. Marshal\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">Mr. Dellinger: Ralph Abernathy was the co-chairman and close worker\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-17\">The Court: Have that man sit down, Mr. Marshal, or do we have to have three marshals?\u201d Official Transcript, Pages 17,808-17,811.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">XXVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-19\">At the end of the court session on January 24, while the court was attempting to instruct the jury prior to recess, Mr. Dellinger made several loud remarks at the defense table, which were easily overheard throughout the courtroom. The incident is reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-20\">\u201cThe Court: With that, Mr. Foran, I think we will recess tonight until Monday morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-21\">Ladies and gentlemen\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-22\">The Marshal: Will you please keep quiet? Sit down. Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-23\">The Court: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we are about to recess until tomorrow morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-24\">Mr. Dellinger: \u2014hear a pig talk about civil disobedience\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-25\">The Marshal: Mr. Dellinger\u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-26\">Mr. Dellinger: I was just talking to my friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-27\">The Court: I will wait.\u201d Official Transcript, Page 17,860.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-28\">XXIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-29\">On January 30, the court was required to instruct the marshals concerning the behavior of disorderly spectators. Mr. Dellinger made the following sarcastic comment after that instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-30\">\u201cThe Court: I direct the jury to disregard the applause of each and every person who participated in it and the marshals will exclude from the courtroom any spectators who applauded after the witness left the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-31\">Mr. Dellinger: Thanks a lot. Thanks, fellows.\u201d Official Transcript, Page 19,032.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-33\">XXX.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-34\">On February 4, the incident occurred which finally led the court to revoke Mr. Dellinger\u2019s bail. During the testimony of the witness Riordan, Mr. Dellinger rose from his place at the defense table and interjected the following remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-35\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: Oh, bull shit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-36\">The Court: Did you get that, Miss Reporter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-37\">Mr. Dellinger: That is an absolute lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-38\">The Court: Did you get that, Miss Reporter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-39\">Mr. Dellinger: Let\u2019s argue about what I stand for and what you stand for, but let\u2019s not make up things like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-40\">The Court: All those remarks were made in the presence of the court and jury by Mr. Dellinger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>After a brief argument about the propriety of these remarks, the court determined to excuse the jury momentarily, and the following incident occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\"The Court: I will have to excuse you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, with my usual orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">Mr. Dellinger: You\u2019re a snake. We have to try to put you in jail for ten years for telling lies about us, Dick Schultz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">Marshal Joneson: Be quiet, Mr. Dellinger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">Mr. Dellinger: When it\u2019s all over, the judge will go to Florida, but if he has his way, we\u2019ll go to jail. That is what we\u2019re fighting for, not just for us, but for all the rest of the people in the country who are being oppressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">A Spectator: Damn right. Assert ourselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">Voices: Right on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">The Court: Take that man into custody.

At the close of the court session he made the following sarcastic remarks about the ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-39\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: That wins respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-40\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, the court will be in recess until Monday morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-41\">Marshal Dobrowski: Everyone please rise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-43\">Mr. Dellinger: You now have my respect, Judge, I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d Official Transcript, Pages 20,282-83.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aac\">Accordingly, I adjudge the defendant David T. Dellinger guilty of the several individual specifications of direct criminal contempt enumerated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-44\">RENNARD C. DAVIS</p>\n<p id=\"AW6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-45\">On October 22, the defendant Davis arrived in the courtroom 18 minutes after the start of the court session. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Court had denied a motion to permit the defendant to bring a cake into the courtroom. Upon arrival the defendant Davis announced in a loud voice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201cMr. Davis: They arrested the cake, Bobby. They arrested it.\u201d (Tr. p. 3,640)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">At the close of the court session on October 28, the defendant Davis refused to rise when the Court left the bench at the end of the session. (Tr. pp. 4,618-19)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">On October 29, at the conclusion of the morning session, the defendant Davis refused to rise when the Court left the bench. (Tr. pp. 4,728-29)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">On October 29, when a recess was called during the afternoon session, the defendant Davis refused to rise when the Court left the bench. (Tr. p. 4,763)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">At the beginning of the morning court session on October 30, the defendant Davis refused to rise at the direction of the marshal when the Court entered the chamber. (Tr. p. 4,801)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">On October 30, when the jury returned to the courtroom, the defendant Davis rose from his seat at the defense table and made the following speech to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-16\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, I am trying to say he was being tortured while you were out of this room by these marshals. They came and tortured him while you are out of the room. It is terrible what is happening. It is terrible what is happening.\u201d (Tr. p. 4,845)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-17\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-18\">On October 30, when the Court called a recess, the defendant Davis refused to rise as the Court left the bench. (Tr. pp. 4,849-50)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-19\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-20\">On October 30, at the beginning of the afternoon session the defendant Davis refused to rise in response to the marshal\u2019s directions when the Court entered the room. (Tr. p. 4,853)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-21\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-22\">On November 26, when the Court requested Mr. Dellinger to sit down, the defendant Davis commented in a loud voice from his place at the table:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-23\">\u201cMr. Davis: Why don\u2019t you gag all of us, Judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-24\">The Court: Who said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-25\">Mr. Davis: Bobby Seale said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-26\">Mr. Schultz: The defendant Davis said that, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-27\">The Court: The defendant Davis. Did you get that, Miss Reporter ? \u201d (Tr. p. 8,078)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-29\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-30\">On December 15, Mr. Davis and other defendants laughed out loud at the Court while the Court was making a ruling on a motion. The defendant Davis acknowledged his laughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-31\">\u201cMr. Davis: It was me that was laughing, your Honor.\u201d (Tr. p. 11,-179)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-32\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-33\">On January 9, the defendant Davis commented out loud from the defense table:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-34\">\u201cMr. Davis: Guilty until proven innocent.\u201d (Tr. p. 14,716)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-35\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-36\">On January 12, the Court refused to permit one of the attorneys to leave the room during the proceedings. Mr. Davis interrupted the orderly proceeding by rising and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-37\">\u201cMr. Davis: Your Honor, my rights are being jeopardized by Mr. Wein-glass not being able to leave the courtroom to interview witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-38\">The Court: Will you sit down, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Mr. Davis: If you want to protect my rights, I would kindly ask you to allow him to interview witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">This outburst came in front of the jury. (Tr. p. 15,074)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">On January 13, during the direct examination of the witness Bond, the defendant Davis stated from the defense table in a voice loud enough for the jury to hear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201cMr. Davis: This is a joke.\u201d (Tr. p. 15,364)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">On January 23, while the defendant Davis was on the stand as a witness on direct testimony, the Judge was required to make an evidentiary ruling. After the Court had considered a document and ruled that it could not come into evidence, Davis accused the Court of having ruled without reading the document.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">\u201cThe Court: I shall not take it in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">In the presence of the jury I will sustain the objection of the Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor has read the document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-14\">The Court: I have looked it over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-15\">The Witness: You never read it. I was watching you. You read two pages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-16\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, will you instruct that witness on the stand that he is not to address me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-17\">You, Mr. Marshal, you are closest to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-18\">The Marshal: Face this way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-19\">The Witness: I will look at the Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-20\">The Court: Do you have what the witness said, Miss Reporter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-21\">The Reporter: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-22\">Mr. Weinglass: I didn\u2019t hear that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-23\">The Witness: I said he didn\u2019t read the document. I watched him. He never looked at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-24\">The Court: He said \u2018You never read it,\u2019 looking at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-25\">The Witness: I meant the Judge did not read the document.\u201d (Tr. pp. 17,-443-44)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-26\">XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-27\">On January 23, the witness Davis falsely accused the Judge of sleeping during the proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-28\">\u201cA. You are making me memorize them. If I can read them \u2014 is that admissible? The Judge is asleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-29\">The Court: What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-30\">The Witness: I am sorry. I thought you had gone to sleep. I am sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-31\">The Court: Oh, no. I am listening very carefully. I just wanted you to repeat. I wanted to be sure I heard what you said.\u201d (Tr. p. 17,542)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-32\">XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-33\">During the time the witness Davis was being cross-examined by the Government Attorney, which is reported in the transcript, Davis continually volunteered remarks and observations. He did not restrict his answer to the scope of the question posed. The Court was required to instruct him no less than 43 times to restrict his answers to the scope of the question posed. No sooner were these orders given than they were violated over and over and over again. This violation of 43 Court orders in the period of three days must be considered contemptuous. (Tr. pp. 17,820 through 18,245)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-34\">XVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-35\">On January 28, the defendant Davis interrupted Mr. Schultz, the Assistant United States Attorney, to make the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-36\">\u201cMr. Schultz: I wish Davis, who was such a gentle boy on the stand for the last couple .of days,- smiling at the jury and pretending he was just a little boy next door, would stop whispering and talking to me while I am talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Mr. Davis: You are a disgrace, sir. I say you are a disgrace. I really say you are a disgrace.\u201d (Tr. p. 18,397)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">XVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">On February 2, after an extended speech by Mr. Kunstler, there was an outburst of applause in the courtroom. Mr. Davis participated in that applause and admitted having done so. It is reported in the record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201cThe Court: Every one of those applauders\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">Voices: Right on. Right on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">The Court: Out with those applauders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">Mr. Davis: I applauded, too, your Honor. Throw me out.\u201d \u2022 (Tr. p. 19,-113)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">On February 2, during the testimony of the witness Lynskey, Mr. Kunstler brought the Reverend Abernathy into the courtroom. The Court admonished him for this disruptive tactic and the following comment was made by the defendant Davis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: If it is disrupting to put a witness on the stand, I never heard of disrupting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">Mr. Davis: I never heard of a case where you couldn\u2019t put a witness on the stand.\u201d (Tr. p. 19,160)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">On February 4, during the testimony of the witness Riordan, Mr. Dellinger spoke out. In the ensuing disturbance, Mr. Davis inserted the following remarks :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-17\">\u201cThe Court: Take that man into custody. Mr. Marshal, take that man into custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-18\">Voices: Right on, right on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-19\">Mr. Schultz: Into custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-20\">The Court: Into custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-21\">Voices: Right on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-22\">Mr. Davis: Go ahead, Dick Schultz, put everybody in jail.\u201d (Tr. p. 19,671)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-23\">XXI.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-24\">On February 4, when the Court announced that it had determined to revoke the defendant Dellinger\u2019s bail, there was an outburst in the courtroom. Mr. Davis inserted the following remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-25\">\u201cThe Court: This isn\u2019t the first word, and I won\u2019t argue this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-26\">Mr. Davis: This Court is bull shit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A07\">The Court: There he is saying the same words again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-27\">Mr. Davis: No, I say it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXm\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-28\">\u201cMr. Rubin: Everything in this court is bull shit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-30\">Mr. Davis: I associate myself with Dave Dellinger completely 100 per cent. This is the most obscene court I have ever seen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-31\">* * * -* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-32\">\u201cMr. Davis. Mr. Rubin\u2019s wife they are now taking\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-33\">Mr. Rubin: Keep your hands off her. You see them taking away my wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-34\">Mr. Davis: Why don\u2019t you gag the press, too, and the attorneys, gag them.\u201d (Tr. pp. 19, 778-79)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-35\">XXII.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-36\">On February 5, after the Court had determined that it had heard sufficient argument it ordered Mr. Weinglass to discontinue arguing. The Court ruled. Mr. Davis then rose with the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-37\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: Your Honor will not permit me to continue a legal argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-38\">The Court: You heard what I said. I deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-39\">Mr. Davis: May we defend ourselves if our lawyers can\u2019t?\u201d (Tr. pp. 19,800-01)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-41\">And slightly later, during the same argument :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-42\">\u201cThe Court: Have that man sit down. I will hear no further argument on this motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Mr. Davis: Could I make a motion to defend myself since you won\u2019t let my lawyer represent me?\u201d Official Transcript, Page 19,814.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">XXIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On February 7th, at the conclusion of the government\u2019s rebuttal case, the defense moved for an early recess of the Saturday session. The purpose of this recess purportedly was to permit them to secure two additional witnesses and a certified copy of an Illinois court record. While the court was discussing this request with Mr. Kunstler, there was a loud laugh from the defense table. The court determined that there was no point in granting courtesies to parties unable to conduct themselves with a modicum of respect for the court. Mr. Davis then made several comments to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cMr. Davis: Is it not possible to put on our defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cMr. Davis: We can\u2019t put on our witnesses.\u201d (Tr. p. 20,270)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">The jury returned, and the argument resumed in their presence. Mr. Davis, before the jury, interjected the following remark when Mr. Foran spoke in favor of the court\u2019s ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201cMr. Davis: Save the Judge.\u201d (Tr. p. 20,276)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Shortly thereafter the court ruled adversely to Mr. Dellinger on a special application concerning his confinement. Mr. Davis greeted this ruling with the following sarcastic comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">\u201cMr. Davis: That\u2019s fair. That\u2019s fair,\u201d (Tr. p. 20,282)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">\u201cMr. Davis: Have a good week-end, Judge.\u201d (Tr. p. 20,283)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">Accordingly, I adjudge the defendant Rennard C. Davis guilty of the several individual specifications of direct criminal contempt enumerated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-16\">THOMAS E. HAYDEN</p>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">On September 26th, during the opening remarks by Mr. Schultz, the defendant Hayden rose and shook his fist in the direction of the jurors. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-20\">\u201cThe Court: This will be but a minute, Mr. Marshal. Who is the last defendant you named ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-21\">Mr. Schultz: Mr. Hayden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-22\">The Court: Hayden. Who was the one before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-23\">Mr. Schultz: Davis, and prior to that was Dellinger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-24\">The Court: The one that shook his fist in the direction of the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-25\">Mr. Hayden: That is my customary greeting, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-26\">The Court: It may be your customary greeting, but we do not allow shaking of fists in this courtroom. I made that clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-27\">Mr. Hayden: It implied no disrespect for the jury; it is my customary greeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-28\">The Court: Regardless of what it implies, sir, there will be no fist shaking, and I caution you not to repeat it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-29\">Mr. Hayden: May I use that gesture to my fellow defendants, my attorneys ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-30\">The Court: That applies to all of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-31\">Mr. Marshal, bring the jury back.\u201d (Tr. 5)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-32\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-33\">At the end of the afternoon session on October 28th, the defendant Hayden refused to rise in the customary manner when directed to do so by the Marshal.

You have a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">Mr. Hayden: Just as he ordered them to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, bring in the jury.\u201d (Tr. 4,635)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">On October 29, at the close of the morning session, the defendant Hayden refused to rise in the customary manner when instructed to do so by the marshals.

That\u2019s what you are. You are lying. You know exactly what you are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-37\">Mr. Hayden: Now they are going to beat him, they are going to beat him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-38\">Mr. Hoffman: You may as well kill him if you are going to gag him. It seems that way, doesn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-39\">The Court: You are not permitted to address the court, Mr. Hoffman. You have a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-40\">Mr. Hoffman: This isn\u2019t a court. This is a neon oven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-41\">Mr. Poran: That was the defendant Hoffman who spoke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-42\">The Court: Let the record show that the defendant Hoffman spoke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-43\">Mr. Schultz: Prior to that it was Mr. Hayden who was addressing the jury while they were walking out of here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-44\">Mr. Hayden: I was not addressing the jury. I was trying to protect Ms. (sic.) Seale. The man is supposed to be silent when he sees another man\u2019s nose being smashed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Mr. Hoffman: The disruption started when these guys got into overkill. It is the same exact thing as last year in Chicago, the same exact thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">The Court: Mr. Hoffman, you are directed to refrain from speaking you are ordered to refrain from speaking. It is clear that after this morning that I think we cannot go ahead. I would be glad to entertain first suggestions from the government and then from the defense as to whether or not this trial shouldn\u2019t be recessed until two o\u2019clock. I am perfectly willing to try to continue and do my best to discharge the obligations of my office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, I would like to see if we couldn\u2019t continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">The Court: What do you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">Mr. Foran: I would like to see if we could continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">The Court: All right. It will take some time to \u2014 then we will take a brief recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">Mr. Hayden: I thought you were going to ask the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">Mr. Weinglass: Are we part\u2014 weren\u2019t we being invited to participate in the dialogue between then\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-13\">Mr. Schultz: It is they who are disrupting this trial and now they want to make the decision as to whether or not we should proceed. It is incredible. It is they who are fostering this and they want to advise the court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a3p-dedup-0\">.The Court: I have ordered a recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-14\">Mr. Weinglass: The court invited it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-15\">The Court: Let the record show that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-16\">Mr. Hayden: Stand up. Stand up. Don\u2019t let them have any pretext.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-17\">The Court: Let the record show that Mr. Hayden asked people\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-18\">Mr. Hayden: I ask the people there to do what they were told and they did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-19\">The Court: Mr. Hayden, do not try to fill my sentences out for me and you are not permitted to speak except as you may come to be a witness in this ease. You are not permitted to speak out loud. You may, of course, consult with your lawyer.\u201d (Tr. 4,-846-49)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-21\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-22\">On January 9, the defendant Hayden openly and blatantly laughed at the court while the court was attempting to make a ruling. (Tr. 14,824)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-23\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-24\">On January 28, while the Assistant United States Attorney was making a statement to the court, Mr. Hayden rose and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-25\">\u201cMr. Hayden: That is not true.\u201d (Tr. 18,439)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-27\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-28\">On January 28 the court ruled that the defendants would not be permitted to call former United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark to the stand as a witness. The court entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-29\">\u201cThe Court: I therefore sustain the objection of the government to having the defense call this witness, Attorney General Clark, before the jury, and I also order both counsel for the government and the defense not to refer to this hearing or the subject matter thereof before the jury after the jury is brought in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-30\">Mr. Schultz: Does that include the defendants also, your Honor? They speak more than their attorneys sometimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-31\">The Court: Yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-32\">Mr. Schultz: Would you direct them also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-33\">The Court: I would order the defendants not to discuss that matter in the presence of the jury. It would not be fair to either side.\u201d (Tr. 18,524-25)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-34\">The very next day Mr. Hayden directly and defiantly violated that order in the presence of the jury. The'following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-35\">\u201cMr. Foran: Your Honor, the the-atre is beginning again. May we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the jury excused, your Honor, since the government is unable to respond, since the government is bound to proper conduct in a courtroom ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">Mr. Hayden: Proper conduct? You wouldn\u2019t let the former Attorney General of the United States testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">The Court: Ladies and gentlemen, I direct you to disregard the statement of Mr. Kunstler and I will have to excuse you with my usual orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">Mr. Kunstler: I think the jury should hear the whole thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">The Court: There are a lot of thoughts you have had here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, you will note, of course that Mr. Hayden shouted out in the courtroom about the Attorney General not testifying before the jury after a direct and clear direction from the court after the Attorney General had testified extensively on voir dire that it should not be mentioned before the jury. Mr. Hayden jumped to his feet, shouted that out while the jury was filing out of the room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">Mr. Weinglass: That statement is as accurate as other statements made by Mr. Foran. This time it was done right in the presence of the court. Your Honor must \u2014 your Honor does not have to be reminded that if there is a shout in the courtroom and I think the fact that Mr. Foran had to state it is proof of the fact that it didn\u2019t occur. The court has never failed to note for the record when there was a disturbance in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-13\">Mr. Foran: Mr. Weinglass, honor and honesty are clearly demonstrated to the court, I\u2019m sure. Your Honor saw Mr. Hayden make that statement. It was very loudly said, clearly said for purposes of influencing the jury improperly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-14\">Mr. Weinglass: All right. Let\u2019s put it to the test of honesty. Did your Honor see Mr. Hayden jump up to his feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-15\">Mr. Schultz: It didn\u2019t jump up to his feet, but Mr. Hayden made the statement, Mr. Weinglass. Didn\u2019t Mr. Hayden make the statement, Mr. Wein-glass? Did Mr. Hyaden (sic.) make the statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-16\">Mr. Dellinger: Save him, Dick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-17\">The Court: The marshals will exclude from the courtroom anyone who is disorderly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-18\">Mr. Schultz: Your Honor, would inquire of Mr. Weinglass whether or not he heard Mr. Hayden make the statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-19\">The Court: No. I will let the record determine that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-20\">Mr. Hayden: Your Honor, I did make the statement. I did not intend to, as the government said. It came out because I lost my temper after listening to what Mr. Foran said. I am sorry that I did it. I did not intend it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-21\">The Court: You got the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-22\">Mr. Hayden: I did not understand\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-23\">Mr. Weinglass: He did not jump to his feet. He did not shout.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-24\">The Court: That rather convicts you, doesn\u2019t it, by your own client?\u201d (Tr. 18,827-30)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-26\">Accordingly, I hereby adjudge the defendant Thomas Hayden guilty of the several individual contempts specified above.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-27\">ABBOTT H. HOFFMAN</p>\n<p id=\"b489-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-29\">On September 26, during the opening statement by the Government, defendant Hoffman rose and blew a kiss to the jurors. (Tr. 9)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-30\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-31\">On October 23, well after the date of the Court\u2019s order sequestering the jury and ordering the jury that they may see no newspapers, the defendant Hoffman held up a newspaper so the jurors might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>see the headline in the courtroom. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">\u201cMr. Schultz: If the Court please\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Mr. Kunstler: I would rather be directed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">Mr. Schultz: Before you direct him, if you are going to direct Mr. Kunst-ler, I would like to make one observation for the record. At 12:30 this morning or 12:30 early this afternoon, when the jury was adjourned, after the jury stood up, defendant Hoffman \u2014 in fact, he had the same article that he has in front of him there\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">Mr. Hoffman: Yes, I was going to show it to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">Mr. Schultz: He held up the newspaper for them to see and- \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">Mr. Hoffman: It ain\u2019t a newspaper. It is the Berkeley Tribe and doesn\u2019t tell lies, so it isn\u2019t a newspaper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">The Court: I wonder if you would ask your client \u2014 you know, when I was out there trying cases, if my clients started to talk when another lawyer was speaking, Mr. Kunstler, I told him to remain quiet. Now, I can direct him to remain quiet. The United States Attorney was speaking to the Court. He is entitled to be heard just as you are entitled to be heard. We are not running a circus. This happens to be a court \u2014 even though there are those who don\u2019t share views.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">Mr. Kunstler: I would suggest, your Honor, then, that Mr. Hoffman be permitted to respond and not be interrupted\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">The Court: I will not hear from your clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">Mr. (sic.) Mr. Hoffman: I was just trying to be helpful, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-14\">The Court: I will not hear from your client. I will let Mr. Schultz finish his observation.\u201d (Tr. 3,866-67)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">On October 28, at the close of the session, the defendant Hoffman refused to rise in the customary manner when directed to do so by the marshal. (Tr. 4,-618-19)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-19\">On October 29, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-20\">\u201cThe Court: I will ask you to sit down, sir. You have a lawyer to speak for you. I haven\u2019t been told that you represent all of these defendants, either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-21\">Mr. Hoffman: We have been told that they are defendants too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-22\">Mr. Foran: May the record show that that was the defendant Hoffman who made that \u2014 -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-23\">The Court: Yes; yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-24\">Mr. Foran: The previous statement was made by the defendant Dellinger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-25\">The Court: The last statement was made by the defendant Abbie Hoffman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-26\">Mr. Hoffman: I don\u2019t use that last name anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-27\">The Court-: Will you remain quiet.\u201d (Tr. 4,639)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-28\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-29\">At the close of the morning session on October 29, the defendant Hoffman refused to rise in the customary manner.

I was trying to protect Mr. Seale. The man is supposed to be silent when he sees another man\u2019s nose being smashed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">Mr. Hoffman: The disruption started when these guys got into overkill. It is the same thing as last year in Chicago, the same exact thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-15\">The Court: Mr. Hoffman, you are directed to refrain from speaking. You are ordered to refrain from speaking.\u201d (Tr. 4,847)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">After this interchange the Court determined that a recess would be appropriate. When the Court left the bench the defendant Hoffman refused to rise in the customary manner. (Tr. 4,849)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">On October 30, after a brief recess the Judge returned to the bench in the afternoon and the defendant Hoffman again refused to rise in the customary manner.

The following colloquy occurred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-21\">\u201cThe Court: That observation will remain on the record and this loud laughter has got to cease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-22\">Mr. Hoffman: Mr. Weinglass, how many years do you have to laugh at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-23\">Mr. Weinglass: I would further want to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-25\">Mr. Hoffman: I am talking to my lawyer.\u201d (Tr. 6,257-59)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-26\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-27\">On November 26, after the Court made a ruling the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-28\">\u201cThe Court: I decide each motion on its own papers, sir, and I am not aware of any witnesses that the Government has srought (sic.) to bring here.

I laughed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-24\">The Court: That was Mr. Dellinger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-25\">Mr. Kunstler: That was not Mr. Dellinger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-26\">Mr. Schultz: Your Honor, that was Mr. Hoffman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-27\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor- \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-28\">Mr. Schultz: That was the defendant Hoffman speaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-29\">Mr. Hoffman: I was him.\u201d (Tr. 15,587)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-30\">XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-31\">Withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-32\">XVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-33\">On January 21st, the defendants were conducting a conference with one of their staff \u201cmembers\u201d at the defense table, while Mr. Foran was attempting to speak. The conference was loud enough to cause the following disturbance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-34\">\u201cThe Marshal: Excuse me, Mr. Foran.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-36\">Will you take your seat at the table, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-37\">Mr. Hoffman: We\u2019re organizing the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-38\">The Marshal: Take your seat. Now, come on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-39\">Mr. Hoffman: She\u2019s on the staff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-40\">The Marshal: Mr. Kunstler, talking is not \u2014 I\u2019m asking him to take his seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-41\">Mr. Kunstler: I don\u2019t know what he was doing. He said he was talking to his wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-42\">Mr. Hoffman: We are talking in a low voice. He didn\u2019t even hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-43\">The Court: The defendant\u2019s place at the trial is at the defendants\u2019 table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-44\">Mr. Hoffman: We were talking\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-45\">A Defendant: Let our staff sit at the table, everything would be all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-46\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, he was sitting, just talking quietly with his wife, who is part of our staff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The Court: I know. I know what he\u2019s doing. I require \u2014 the rule of this court is that the defendants sit at the defendants\u2019 table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">Mr. Hoffman: How do we organize the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">The Court: I order Mr. Hoffman to sit at the defendants\u2019 table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">Mr. Hoffman: OK. We can just talk from here. Why don\u2019t you go out and talk to Paul Krassner and get the defense together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">I don\u2019t see how we can prepare the defense. We have to sit here seven days \u2014 \u201d (Tr. 16,791-92)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">XVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">On January 23, while Mr. Foran and Mr. Dellinger were engaged in a colloquy, Mr. Hoffman inserted the following remarks :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">\u201cMr. Foran: Your Honor, in the American system there is a proper way to raise such issues and to correct them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">Mr. Dellinger: That was the proper way with Fred Hampton, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">Mr. Foran: And correct them, your Honor by the proper governmental system, and there is a proper way to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-14\">Mr. Hoffman: Correction the way you handled the war in Viet Nam, the same proper \u2014 \u201d (Tr. 17,376)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">Shortly thereafter during the same incident a discussion ensued concerning the propriety of Mr. Kunstler\u2019s press conferences. Mr. Hoffman again interjected his comments. It\u2019s reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-16\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, there is a law against a lawyer participating\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-17\">Mr. Kunstler: No, there isn\u2019t. The rule is quite clear, and we know what it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-18\">The Court: There is a law against\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-19\">Mr. Hoffman: The Judge had an interview in Time Magazine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-20\">The Court: A lawyer on television discussing the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-21\">Mr. Kunstler: Let\u2019s have what I said that was false. That was the accusation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-22\">The Court: I will ask you both to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-23\">Mr. Hoffman: The Judge gave an interview to Time Magazine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-24\">The Court: And I will instruct Mr. Weinglass to continue with the direct examination of this witness.\u201d (Tr. 17,379)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-25\">XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-26\">On January 30, at the conclusion of the court\u2019s session, the Court asked the parties and attorneys to stay after the jury had been.excused. The Court then broached the subject of the propriety of the public speeches given by the defendants. While this discussion was going on Mr. Hoffman again inserted his remarks gratuitously. The incident is reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-27\">\u201cThe Court: I am not going to be put on the griddle about it. Now you are the lawyer. You are one of the lawyers for the defendants. And I think it is wholly inappropriate for defendants in a criminal case to make the kind of speech that was made and the matter of bail goes beyond mere protection for the Government that the defendant appear. Read the book.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-28\">Mr. Weinglass: But I do not think the matter of bail should be held over their heads in order to reduce the amount of public speaking they are doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-29\">The Court: Oh, I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-30\">Mr. Hoffman: I will be in Miami on Sunday afternoon with the same speech.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-31\">The Court: That expression \u2014 did you hear that? I haven\u2019t heaed (sic.) lawyr (sic.) for the defendants try to quiet their clients during this trial when they spoke out, not once in four and a half months, not once.\u201d (Tr. 19,094-19,095)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">On February 2, the Court had determined that argument on a particular question had been completed. The Court admonished Mr. Kunstler several times to .sit down and desist arguing. The Court had previously ordered the defendants and their attorneys not to mention the fact that the former Attorney General of the United States, Ramsey Clark, had been excluded, by order of the Court. Mr. Hoffman made several comments after the Court had indicated argument was completed, and he violated the Court\u2019s order concerning the Attorney General. The record states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">\u201cThe Court: You sit down, sir, or we will arrange to have you put down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">Mr. Hoffman: Are you going to gag the lawyers, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">A Voice: Chained to the chair\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3I\">Mr. Hoffman: You don\u2019t have to gag the jury, because they haven\u2019t been able to see our witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">The Court: That was Mr. Hoffman that made that remark, Miss Reporter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">Mr. Hoffman: The past Attorney General of the United States, Ramsey Clark \u2014 \u201d (Tr. 19,159)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Later in the day, the defendant Hoffman interrupted the Court to make the following sarcastic remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">\u201cThe'Court: All I have to repeat to you, Mr. Kunstler, is that I know you practice in the Southern District of New York. I have practiced there a lot as a lawyer before all of the then District Judges. I never saw\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">Mr. Hoffman: When it was under British control.\u201d (Tr. 19,199-200)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">XXI.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">On February 4, during the cross examination of the witness Phillips, Mr. Kunstler was examining the witness considering the witness\u2019 concept of how hippies dress. During that incident, Mr. Hoffman got up and danced around, lifting his shirt and baring his body to the jury, and engaged in antics designed to make light of the testimony of the witness. The incident is reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-16\">\u201cQ. You are the first one that hasn\u2019t identified him. (Hoffman) This is Mr. Hoffman over here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APR\">(There was laughter in the courtroom.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-17\">The Court: Let the record show that Mr, Hoffman stood up, lifted his shirt up, and bared his body in the presence of the jury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-18\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, that is Mr. Hoffman\u2019s way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-19\">The Court: \u2014dancing around.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkI\">(There was laughter in the courtroom.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-20\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, that is Mr. Hoffman\u2019s way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-21\">The Court: It is a bad way in a courtroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-22\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-23\">\u201cQ. Mr. Phillips, my question before we had the little colloquy had to do with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-24\">The Court: It was not a little colloquy, that was taking Mr. Hoffman to task for improper conduct in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-25\">By Mr. Kunstler:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-26\">Q. Before Mr. Hoffman was taken to task for improper conduct in the eourtroo, (sic.) I asked you whether he was in hippie dress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-27\">Mr. Hoffman: Thatwould (sic.) make it hippie dress, naked.\u201d (Tr. 19,622-24)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-29\">XXII.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-30\">On February 4, at the end of the session, the Court indicated that it had determined to revoke the bail of the defendant Dellinger. In the uproar which followed this decision Mr. Hoffman made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-31\">\u201cMr. Hoffman: You are a disgrace to the Jews. You would have served Hitler better. Dig it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-32\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-33\">\u201cMr. Hoffman: I heard you haven\u2019t let anybody free in four years.

You schtunk! Vo den! Shanda fur de goyem!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">Obviously it was a provocation. That\u2019s why it has gone on here today because you threatened him with the cutting of his freedom of speech in the speech he gave in Milwaukee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, will you ask the defendant Hoffman to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">Mr. Hoffman: This ain\u2019t the Standard Club.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-15\">The Marshal: Mr. Hoffman\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-16\">Mr. Hoffman: Oh, tell him to stick it up his bowling ball.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-17\">How is your war stock doing, Julie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-18\">You don\u2019t have any power.

How many own stock in the Brunswick Corporation?\u201d (Tr. 19,816-17)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-35\">And later in the day Mr. Hoffman, at the end of the session, made the additional comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-36\">\u201cMr. Hoffman: It was every man. We\u2019ll see you at the Standard Club, Julie.\u201d (Tr. 19,877)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-37\">XXIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-38\">On February 6th, in the presence of the jury, the defendant Hoffman attempted to hold the court up to ridicule by entering the courtroom in judicial robes (Tr. 19,888) which he later removed, threw to the floor and used to wipe his feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-39\">Accordingly, I hereby adjudge the defendant Abbott H. Hoffman guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the several individual specifications of direct criminal contempt enumerated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">JERRY C.

One of those spectators was Jerry Rubin\u2019s wife. As she was being removed, Mr. Rubin protested loudly and violently. The incident is reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-12\">\u201cThe Court: Since you refer to Bobby Seale, your client, I recall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-14\">Mr. Kunstler: Not my client, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-15\">The Court: \u2014I recall being called various kinds of pigs by that man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-16\">Mr. Rubin: Bill, they are taking out my wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-17\">Mr. Kunstler: Well, your Honor would not let him defend himself.

You interrupted my attorney right in the middle of his argument. He was right in the middle of his argument and you interrupted him. You are not being very patient at all.

Just describing what I see.\u201d (Tr. 19,818-19,819)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">At the close of that morning session on February 5, the defendant Rubin once more exclaimed in a loud voice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACW\">\u201cMr. Rubin: Tryant.\u201d (Tr. 19,877)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">On February 6, at 10:28 a. m., in presence of the jury, after the courtroom had been filled by the press and spectators and all participants, except the defendants Rubin and Hoffman, were prepared to begin the proceedings, the defendant Rubin entered the courtroom wearing judicial robes. This conduct was a deliberate and wilful attempt to ridicule the court. (Tr. 19,888)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">On February 6th, as the witness Irv Bock was leaving the stand and passing the defense table, the defendant Rubin commented to him, in a voice loud enough to be heard by the jurors and the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab9\">\u201cMr. Rubin: Tough luck, Irv.\u201d (Tr. 20,019)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">On February 7th, while the Court was hearing argument on a motion for a continuance at the close of the Government\u2019s rebuttal case, the defendant Rubin interjected the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-19\">\u201cMr. Rubin: Refuse to rest.\u201d (Tr. 20,270)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-21\">Accordingly, I hereby adjudge the defendant Jerry C.

(Tr. 4,618-4,619)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-26\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-27\">On October 29th, when Court called a recess, the defendant Weiner once more refused to rise in the traditional manner. (Tr. 4,728-4,729)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-28\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-29\">On October 29th, when the Court was compelled to call a recess because of the conduct of the defendant Seale, the defendant Weiner once more refused to rise in the customary manner when the Court left the bench. (Tr. 4,763)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-30\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-31\">On October 30th, at the beginning of the court session, the defendant Weiner refused to rise in the customary manner when the Judge entered the courtroom. (Tr. 4,801)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-32\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-33\">On December 1st, while the witness Rochford was on the stand, the defendant Weiner made the following comment in a voice loud enough to be heard by the Court and others present, including the jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-34\">\u201cDefendant Weiner: Bill, the executioner is mumbling and I can\u2019t hear him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-35\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, is it possible to tell the witness to keep his voice up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-36\">The Court: I think it is possible. I have demonstrated that because I have asked him two or three times already.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-37\">Mr. Foran: May the record show the comment? Did you get that comment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-38\">Defendant Dellinger: He was speaking to his lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-39\">Mr. Foran: The comment was: \u2018The executioner is mumbling and I can\u2019t hear him.\u2019 I would like the record to show that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, it is just like a school marm that has to every time point out\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">The Court: Yes, I heard it. I heard that. It is in the record.\u201d (Tr. 8,610)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On January 14th, during the redirect examination of the witness Edmundson, the defendant Dellinger rose and made a speech. After that speech, the Defendant Weiner sat at the table and openly applauded him. (Tr. 15,591)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">On January 28th, in front of the jury, the defendant Weiner engaged in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">\u201cMr. Schultz: I wish Davis who was such a gentle boy on the stand the last couple of days, smiling at the jury and pretending he was just a little boy next door, would stop whispering and talking to me while I am talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">Mr. Davis: You are a disgrace, sir. I say you are a disgrace. I really say you are a disgrace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">Voices: Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">Mr. Schultz: I think he has a split personality, like a schizophrenic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">Mr. Weiner: Now he is a psychological student.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-14\">Mr. Schultz: So, your Honor, I would ask that you do follow proper procedure considering the representation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-16\">The Court: Will you excuse me, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-17\">Mr. Marshal, if you can\u2019t do it alone, have another marshal assist you, and stand at that table there so that I can listen to the United States Attorney make his presentation as I expect to try to listen to counsel for the defense when I call on them to reply. This thing has been going on all through this trial, but very little can be done about it at the moment.\u201d (Tr. 18,397-18,398)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">Accordingly, I hereby adjudge the defendant Lee Weiner guilty of the several individual and separate direct criminal contempts of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-20\">JOHN R. FROINES</p>\n<p id=\"b500-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-22\">The record reveals that on October 28 the defendant <em>Froines </em>laughed openly and subsequently commented on his laughter by making the following remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-23\">\u201cWe laughed \u2014 we laughed because it was a stupid answer.\u201d (Tr. 4,544)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-24\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-25\">At the close of the session on October 28th, the defendant <em>Froines </em>refused to rise in the traditional manner, despite being instructed to do so by the United States Marshal. (Tr. 4,618-4,619)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-26\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-27\">When the Court was required to call a recess on October 29th because of the conduct of Mr. Seale, the defendant <em>Fro-ines </em>refused to rise in the traditional manner when the Court left the bench. (Tr. 4,763)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-28\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-29\">At the beginning of the session on October 30th when the Court entered the room, the defendant <em>Froines </em>once more refused to rise in the traditional manner. (Tr. 4,801)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-30\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-31\">On December 17th while the lawyers were engaged in an argument, <em>Mr. Fro-ines </em>made the following comment, in a voice loud enough to be heard by all in the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-32\">\u201cMr. Froines: That is a lie. That was not the testimony.\u201d (Tr. 11,549)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-33\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-34\">On December 30th Mr. Dellinger was engaged in a colloquy with the Court. In the course of that discussion <em>Mr. Froines </em>interjected a comment. That is recorded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-35\">\u201cMr. Dellinger: Decorum is more important than justice, I suppose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The Court: I have never sat <em>m </em>a trial, over the many years, where a defendant has spoken upon his own when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">Mr. Froines: Perhaps you can give him four years like you gave Bobby Seale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">Mr. Dellinger: We just walk politely into jail.\u201d (Tr. 12,915)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">On February 2nd, the Court ruled that the defendants had rested their case-in-chief in that they were not prepared to put another witness on the stand, and they made representations concerning their intentions to rest. The Court further ordered the defendants to make no reference before the jury of the fact that they had wanted Dr. Ralph Abernathy to testify. (Tr. 19,140)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Subsequently that morning before the jury, during the direct examination of the witness Lynskey, <em>Mr. Froines </em>made the following comment from the defense table :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201cMr. Foran: Your Honor, the interruption in the midst of the questioning of a witness in the presence of the jury is unheard of, Your Honor. I wish he would\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">Mr. Froines: So is not putting on a witness.\u201d\u2019 (Tr. 19,156)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">On February 2nd, the Court objected to Mr. Kunstler\u2019s demonstration of affection for Dr. Abernathy in front of the jury. The following colloquy took place between the Court and Mr. Kunst-ler in which <em>Mr. Froines </em>interjected a comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-14\">\u201cThe Court: I have never seen that in a courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-15\">Mr. Kunstler: But you have never seen us before, your Honor, and the movement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-16\">The Court: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-17\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2014and the movement has a physically touching quality to it which is sort of irrepressible sometimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-18\">The Court: There are certain kinds of conduct one engages in in a courtroom and in other places.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-19\">Mr. Kunstler: Well, there is, because there are different life styles in this courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-20\">Mr. Froines: We will change that.\u201d (Tr. 19,194)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-22\">On February 2, when the witness Murray left the stand, the defendants mockingly said\u2019, \u201cThanks a lot. Thanks a lot\u201d, and the defendant Rubin stood and mockingly offered to shake hands with the witness. <em>Mr. Froines </em>interjected the \u2022following remark, along with others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-23\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: Your Honor, we wanted to thank him. We thought that testimony was helpful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-25\">Mr. Froines: I beg your pardon. That man wants to put us away for ten years by lying and we think this proves it and we have a right\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-26\">The Court: Make a note that that man is <em>Mr. Froines.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-27\">A Voice: Froines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-28\">Mr. Froines: Disgusting.\u201d (Tr. 19,444)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-30\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-31\">On February 5, a loud conference was taking place at the defense table. The Court instructed the marshal to quiet the conference down and <em>Mr. Froines </em>interjected a comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-32\">\u201cMr. Foran: Your Honor, it is very difficult to present a witness who has got a soft voice when there is agitation at the defense table, whispering and motion over there. It is extremely difficult for the jury to hear what is going in. I wish we could have the defense table sit quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-33\">The Court: The marshal will try to maintain quiet at the table while examination of the witness is going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-34\">Mr. Froines: I am sorry, there was no agitation. They were simply discussing the revocation of David Del-linger\u2019s bond.\u201d (Tr. 19,847)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Accordingly, I hereby adjudge the defendant John Froines guilty of the several individual and separate direct criminal contempts of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">WILLIAM M. KUNSTLER</p>\n<p id=\"A-s\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">On October 9, the Court made an evi-dentiary ruling and ordered, with reference to Defendants\u2019 Exhibit D-23, that Mr. Kunstler on cross-examination of the witness Pierson could only have the document identified but could not go into the substance of the document, if and until the document had been admitted into evidence. After this order was entered, Mr. Kunstler repeatedly, before the jury, asked questions designed to delve into the substance of the document. He ignored the Court\u2019s continued admonitions and proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201cQuestion: I show you D-23 for identification and ask you whether this is not the story which Mr. Judge wrote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">Mr. Schultz: Well, I object to the question, your Honor. If the witness knows what Mr. Judge wrote, that is one thing, but if he can\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">The Court: All you may do at this time, Mr. Kunstler, under the law, is to have this document identified by the witness. You may not go into its substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">By Mr. Kunstler:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">Q. All right. I will ask you, is that the story which you say appeared in the Chicago Tribune on August 31, 1968?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">A. Yes, sir, I believe it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">Q. Now, in the interview did you tell Mr. Judge that the diary of Jerry Rubin had been given to you on Monday, August 25, instead of August 27 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">A. No, sir, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">Q. Would you look on Page 2 of that story? Does that story indicate that the diary was given on August 25?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-15\">The Court: I don\u2019t think you understand me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-16\">Mr. Schultz: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-17\">The Court: I had always thought I talked so clearly. I said you may not question the witness about the substance or contents of the document until it is in evidence. This exhibit is not in evidence. It has been, in a way, identified as Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 23 for identification. I sustain the objection to the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-18\">By Mr. Kunstler:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-19\">Q. I will ask you just to look, then, at the portion which refers to the incident which you have described in the book being given to you by Mr. Rubin. Do you see that in there? I have marked it, it should be easy to find.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-20\">A. I see a marking here and reference made to a diary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-21\">Q. Is that statement there correct or incorrect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-22\">Mr. Schultz: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-23\">The Court: I sustain the objection and I must admonish you, Mr. Kunst-ler, you are disregarding the Court\u2019s direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-24\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, I would like the jury excused so we may discuss and argue this question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-25\">The Court: I shall not discuss\u2014 dismiss the jury at this time, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-26\">Mr. Kunstler: Well, then, I would like to argue it, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-27\">The Court: I don\u2019t want to argue that one. I won\u2019t permit you to argue it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-28\">Mr. Schultz: Your Honor, if I may explain, the proper way is to ask the witness a question, a question which is in substance what Mr. Kunstler thinks he told somebody else, and if the witness denies the truth of that question, then he can impeach him by saying, \u2018Didn\u2019t you say, the following to such and such a person ?\u2019 and then if he denies it, that person will testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-29\">The Court: Oh, I have been trying to point out what the proper procedure is, but that is not the way that counsel has been doing it. All I can do is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>rule on objections if they are made and I shall continue to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">By Mr. Kunstler:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">Q. Did you tell Mr. Judge in your interview that a diary had been taken from Jerry Rubin or given by Jerry Rubin to you on Augsut 25, a Monday evening, 1968? Did you tell him that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">A. No, sir, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">Q. I will ask you whether this statement which appears in the article was what you told Mr. Judge or not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">Mr. Schultz: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">The Court: I sustain the objection and now I will excuse the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are excused. Before you return to the jury room, I must, of course, order you not to talk with anybody about this case, not to let anybody speak with you about it, and do not discuss the case among yourselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">I order you not to read the newspapers or any other journals, not to look at radio or television, or listen to television. I direct you that if anybody attempts to communicate with you in any manner about this case, you notify the United States Marshal who will, in turn, lay the matter before me. You are excused for a few minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">I excused the jury, Mr. Kunstler, to say on the record that your persistent disregard of the Court\u2019s directions in asking questions, objections to which have been repeatedly sustained, I regard as unprofessional conduct, and I want that statement on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-14\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, may we argue this point now? I brought the law in, I think I have a right \u2014 you called me unprofessional and I have a right to say what I think my authority is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-15\">The Court: When I tell you that you may not inquire about a document that is not in evidence, which is elementary, I don\u2019t want you to persist in asking about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-16\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, I want to do what is right and I have brought in Judge Holtzoff\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-17\">The Court: You are not doing what is right. I don\u2019t want to argue it. It is elementary. I have taken the trouble to give you the citations early in this trial and I will give them to you again. I have them right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-18\">Mr. Kunstler: I have got McCormick on evidence, I have got Judge Holtzoff, Learned Hand\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-19\">The Court: We have the United States Supreme Court up here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-20\">Mr. Kunstler: I have the Supreme Court as well, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-21\">The Court: I don\u2019t want you to do it and that is the reason why I excused the jury. Mr. Marshal, you may now bring in the jury.\u201d (Tr. 1,644-50)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-23\">On October 15, following the incident of the Vietnam Moratorium demonstration alluded to in the citations of contempt by the defendant Dellinger, the following colloquy took place with Mr. Kunstler:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-24\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: Are you turning down my request after this disgraceful episode. You are not going to say anything ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-26\">The Court: I not only turn it down, I ignore it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-27\">Mr. Kunstler: That speaks louder than words, too, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-28\">The Court: And let that appear of record, the last words of Mr. Kunstler, and, Miss Reporter, be very careful to have them on the record.\u201d (Tr. p. 2,-435)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-29\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-30\">On October 30th, as the Court was attempting to maintain order by restraining the defendant Bobby Seale, Mr. Kunstler not only made no attempt to aid the Court in maintaining order, but engaged in the following colloquy as well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-31\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: Your Honor, are we going to stop this medieval torture that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>is going on in this courtroom ? I think this is a disgrace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">Mr. Rubin: This guy is putting his elbow in Bobby\u2019s mouth and it wasn\u2019t necessary at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">Mr. Kunstler: This is no longer a court of order, your Honor; this is a medieval torture chamber. It is a disgrace. They are assaulting the other defendants also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">Mr. Rubin: Don\u2019t hit me in the balls, m.....f......</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">Mr. Seale: This m..... f..... is tight and it is stopping my blood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, this is an unholy disgrace to the law that is going on in this courtroom and I as an American lawyer feel a disgrace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">Mr. Foran: Created by Mr. Kunst-ler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">Mr. Kunstler: Created by nothing other than what you have done to this man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">Mr. Hoffman: \u2014being a defendant \u2022 \u2014 You come down here and watch it, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">Mr. Foran: May the record show that the outbursts are the defendant Rubin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">Mr. Seale: You fascist dogs, you rotten, low-life son of a bitch. I am glad I said it about Washington used to have slaves, the first President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-15\">Mr. Dellinger: Somebody protect him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-17\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, may the record show that it is Mr. Dellinger saying \u2018Someone go to protect him\u2019 and the other comment is by Mr. Rubin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-18\">Mr. Rubin: And my statement, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-19\">The Court: Everything you say will be taken down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-20\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, we would like the names of the marshals. We are going to ask for a judicial investigation of the entire condition and the entire treatment of Bobby Seale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-22\">The Court: You ask for anything that you want. When you begin to keep your word around here that you gave the Court, perhaps things can be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-24\">Mr. Kunstler: If we are going to talk about words, I am prepared to give you back your word about Mr. Ball yesterday and what he said you said to him. We have the transcript now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-25\">The Court: Don\u2019t point at me, sir, in that manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-26\">Mr. Kunstler: If we are going to talk about words, I\u2019d like to exchange some.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-27\">The Court: Don\u2019t point at me in that manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-28\">Mr. Kunstler: I just feel utterly ashamed to be an American lawyer at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-29\">The Court: You should be ashamed of your conduct in this case, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-30\">Mr. Kunstler: What conduct, when a client is treated in this manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-31\">The Court: We will take a brief recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-32\">Mr. Kunstler: Can we have somebody with Mr. Seale? We don\u2019t trust \u2014 \u201d (Tr. pp. 4,815-17)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-33\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-34\">Mr. Kunstler continually defied the Court\u2019s orders to sit down when the Court had determined that the argument was completed. One such occasion occurred on October 30 and is set forth in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-35\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: Mr. Kunstler is his attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-36\">Mr. Schultz: Mr. Kunstler is his attorney and Mr. Weinglass who just spoke have both encouraged Mr. Seale to proceed in violation of the Court\u2019s order when he has an appellate process of review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-37\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, just to compare hearsay with the right of a black man to defend himself\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-38\">The Court: I will not hear you any longer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-39\">Mr. Kunstler: \u25a0 \u2014 after three hundred years of slavery\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-40\">The Court: I will hear you no longer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Mr. Kunstler: But, your Honor, he said \u2014 he is comparing it to hearsay. This is a sovereign right which is a right black men fought and died for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">The Court: Will you ask that man to sit down, Mr. Marshal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">Mr. Kunstler: I may no longer continue in answer to Mr. Schultz ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">The Court: No, no. We will go on forever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">Mr. Kunstler: Not forever, your Honor, just long enough to make a point.\u201d (Tr. pp. 4,842-43)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">On December 9th the Court refused to permit Mr. Kunstler to leave the room during the proceedings. His absence would have three of the remaining seven defendants unrepresented. The following remarks and insults were then made.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">\u201cThe Court: You will remain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-13\">Mr. Kunstler: We don\u2019t have\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-14\">The Court: You will remain here at this trial, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-15\">Mr. Kunstler: All right. Then, your Honor is interfering with the defense of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-17\">The Court: All right. Your motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-18\">Mr. Kunstler: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-19\">Then, your Honor, I am going to have the witness come to the counsel table and sit with the attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-20\">The Court: You are not going to have witnesses at the counsel table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-21\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, how can you be so inhumane as to not permit the lawyers to sit with the witnesses? I just don\u2019t understand it. It is with the consent of the defendants.\u201d (Tr. p. 9,887)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-22\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-23\">On December 12, during the direct examination of the witness Ginsberg, the Court determined that a recess was appropriate. Mr. Kunstler opposed that recess in a shouting and disrespectful manner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-24\">\u201cMr. Foran: I think at least several minutes, your Honor, ten, fifteen minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-25\">The Court: Are you suggesting we recess ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-26\">Mr. Foran: I would think possibly yes, your Honor, because I would just get back up here and get started.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-27\">The Court: You mean recess until the afternoon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-28\">Mr. Foran: After lunch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-29\">The Court: All right. We will go until 2:00 o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-30\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-31\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, we have witnesses who are leaving the country this afternoon who are presently here. I don\u2019t think there should be any delay in the cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-32\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, after each\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-34\">Mr. Weinglass: Wait\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-35\">Mr. Kunstler: Mr. Foran,. may I finish my statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-36\">Mr. Foran: Excuse me, Mr. Kunst-ler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-37\">Mr. Kunstler: We have two witnesses in the witness room now waiting around here for two days. One is leaving the country tomorrow morning and must testify or we lose him forever, and the other has to return to the West Coast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-38\">The Court: I have granted the request of the defendant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-39\">Mr. Kunstler: We asked for five minutes two days ago in front of this jury and you refused to give it to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-40\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, on every\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-41\">The Court: You will have to cease that disrespectful tone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-42\">Mr. Kunstler: That is not disrespectful; that is an angry tone, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-43\">The Court: Yes, it is. Yes, it is. I will grant the motion of the Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-44\">Mr. Kunstler: You refused us five minutes the other day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Mr. Foran: Your Honor, on every- \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">The Court: You are going to have to learn\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">Mr. Kunstler: I am trying to learn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">The Court: I have given up trying to point it out to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">Mr. Kunstler: Why the different treatment ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">The Court: I will not sit here and have you assume a disrespectful tone to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">Mr. Kunstler: This is not disrespect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">The Court: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">Mr. Kunstler: I am asking you to explain to the defense which claims it is getting different treatment, why a simple request of five minutes was not granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, may I comment that after the direct examination of every single Government witness in this case, the defense had a recess to prepare their cross-examination. That was after 54 witnesses. Every one had a recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-13\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, this is the grossest statement I have ever heard in a courtroom. This jury doesn\u2019t know that after every Government witness \u2014 we might as well tell them \u2014 there is a series of documents that are given to the defense and the defense must read, and that is the only reason the request was granted. They have no documents\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-14\">Mr. Foran: That is right, your Hon- or. That is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-15\">Mr. Kunstler: They must go on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-16\">Mr. Foran: We don\u2019t \u2014 it is a two-way street \u2014 it is a one-way street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-17\">Mr. Kunstler: They have no documents to read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-18\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-19\">Mr. Kunstler: It is a one-way street, your Honor. That is what we are on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-20\">Mr. Foran: From the Government to the defense, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-21\">The Court: Now, sir\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-22\">Mr. Kunstler: We are on a one-way street, your Honor. Five minutes we requested from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-23\">The Court: Mr. Kunstler\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-24\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, what else can I think?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-25\">The Court: I have admonished you time and again to be respectful to the Court. I have been respectful to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-26\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, this is not disrespect for anybody but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-27\">The Court: You are shouting at the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-28\">Mr. Kunstler: Oh, your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-29\">The Court: Shouting at the Court, the way you do\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-30\">Mr. Kunstler: Everyone has shouted from time to time, including your Hon- or. This is not a situation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-31\">The Court: Make a note of that, please. I have never\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-32\">Mr. Kunstler: Voices have been raised\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-34\">The Court: I never shouted at you during this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-35\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, your voice has been raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-36\">The Court: You have been disrespectful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-37\">Mr. Kunstler: It is not disrespectful, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-38\">The Court: And sometimes worse than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-39\">The Witness: o-o-m-m-m-m-.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-40\">The Court: Will you step off the witness stand, please, and I direct you not to talk with anybody about this case or let anybody speak with you about it until you resume the stand at 2:00 o\u2019clock, at which time you are directed to return for further examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-41\">Mr. Kunstler: He was trying to calm us both down, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-43\">The Court: Oh, no. I needed no calming down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor has\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">The Court: I am pointing out to a lawyer that we will not tolerate disrespect in this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, how\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">The Court: That will be all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">Mr. Kunstler: What about our witnesses who have to leave the country ? Are you depriving us of these witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">The Court: We will recess, Mr. Marshal, until 2:00 o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">Mr. Kunstler: Oh, that is unfair.\u201d (Tr. pp. 10,783-788)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">On December 23, Mr. Kunstler indicated that he had some information concerning a possible challenge by the Government to one of the jurors. Mr. Schultz raised an objection indicating that this matter should be discussed outside the presence of the jury. The Court then excused the jury. As the jury was walking out Mr. Kunstler repeated those charges in a loud voice so that the jury could hear him as they were exiting. This incident is set out in the record as appearing in the following summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-14\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: Your Honor, the defendants and Mr. Kunstler will be in the courtroom momentarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-15\">The Court: Will you please call your next witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-16\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, before calling next witness the defense has an inquiry to make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-17\">Your Honor will recall that I asked certain questions about the half-hour delay\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-18\">Mr. Schultz: If the Court please, I think that the matter that Mr. Kunst-ler made inquiry about out of the presence of the jury, if he wants to make inquiry now, we should have it with the Court solely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-19\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, I am not going into that but I want to indicate this, that we are prepared to call another witness but since this witness is a defendant, we have an inquiry to make. We have heard from people outside the courtroom here, reporters and others\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-23\">Mr. Schultz: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-24\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2014that the Government is planning to launch an attack on the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-25\">Mr. Schultz: I don\u2019t know what it is Mr. Kunstler is going into, but I know that it is improper for him to say what it is in the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-26\">The Court: I will excuse you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-27\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, it is an attack on the jury, and that is why I am mentioning it with the jury here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-28\">Mr. Schultz: Mr. Kunstler has just heard the Court\u2019s ruling and he knows that the Court has ordered the jury excused for the purpose of this argument, but that doesn\u2019t stop him. He wants to continue. We are bound by Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-29\">The Court: Now I will hear you.\u201d (Tr. pp. 12,391-12,392)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-30\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-31\">On January 6 the defendants called Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago to the stand as their witness. In a colloquy prior to the witness\u2019 taking the stand Mr. Kunstler clearly indicated his understanding of the limitations on interrogating one\u2019s own witness. Furthermore, the Court ordered that any motions to declare the witness Daley a \u201chostile witness\u201d be made outside the presence of the jury. In the course of the direct examination of this witness which runs from page 13,900 to 14,024 of the official transcript, Mr. Kunstler asked no less than 83 questions which were objectionable, mostly leading and suggestive. Furthermore, he directly violated the Court\u2019s order by moving to have the witness Daley declared a \u201chostile witness\u201d in the presence of the jury (Tr. p. 13,944).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-32\">After this motion was denied, Mr. Kunstler continued asking leading and suggestive questions which he knew to be improper. His conduct was repeated so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>many times that it must be considered contemptuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On January 12 Mr. Kunstler refused to be seated and discontinue his argument despite admonitions and directions to do so by the Court. This incident occurred when the Court was interrupted by the loud laughter of the defendant Dellinger.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014I wonder if you, Mr. Marshal, can keep that man quiet while I am speaking. I am trying to decide his lawyer\u2019s motion. Please go to him and tell him to keep quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">The Marshal: Mr. Dellinger-\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">The Court: Let the record show that after I requested the marshal to keep Mr. Dellinger quiet he laughed right out again, out loud. The record may so indicate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">Mr. Dellinger: And he is laughing now, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">The Marshal: And the defendant Hayden, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">The Court: Mr. Hayden also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">Mr. Kunstler: Oh, your Honor, there is a certain amount of humor when talking about a bathroom\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-13\">The Court: Oh, I know that is your favorite reply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-14\">Mr. Hoffman: I laughed, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-15\">Mr. Kunstler: But people can\u2019t help it sometimes, your Honor. You have laughed yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-16\">The Court: I really have come to believe you can\u2019t help yourself. I have come to believe it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-17\">Mr. Kunstler: But that is true. A whole courtrom full of people laugh when I say something and when you say something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-18\">The Court: What I am saying is not very funny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-19\">Mr. Kunstler: I know, but you are so ultrasensitive to laughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-20\">The Court: Will you sit down and not interrupt the Court when a decision is being made ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-21\">All I ask from you, sir, is simple manners. I don\u2019t reach the question of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-22\">Mr. Kunstler: A laugh is not bad manners. Really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-23\">The Court: I have never been in a case where I have seen such bad manners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-24\">Mr. Kunstler: I know, but your Honor, when you make a joke and the courtroom laughs, nobody is' thrown out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-26\">The Court: Just sit down. I have not made any jokes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-27\">Mr. Kunstler: I know, but you do from time to time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-28\">The Court: I ask you to sit down during the rendering of this decision, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-29\">Let the record show that the defendants \u2014 rather the defendants\u2019 counsel, Mr. Kunstler, on two occasions here refused to sit down when the Court directed him to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-30\">Mr. Kunstler: Oh, that\u2019s not fair, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-31\">Mr. Weinglass: He sat down on both occasions, your Honor. I must object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-33\">Mr. Kunstler: I sat down on both occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-34\">The Court: I mean right now, in this decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-35\">Mr. Kunstler: I sat down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-36\">The Court: You did finally after I urged you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-37\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor, that is not a fair characterization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-38\">The Court: Will you sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-39\">Mr. Weinglass: Mr. Kunstler did sit down both times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-40\">The Court: I didn\u2019t ask you to stand. I am giving a decision, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-41\">Mr. Weinglass: I think it should be on the record\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-42\">The Court: I am giving a decision, and if you don\u2019t sit down \u2014 he has sat down now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Mr. Marshal see that Mr. Weinglass remains in his chair while the Court is rendering a decision on this motion made by Mr. Weinglass.\u201d (Tr. pp. 14,824-27)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">On January 13 Mr. Kunstler again argued and refused to desist when the Court ordered him to do so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: Your Honor, I move to strike your Honor\u2019s last remarks from the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">The Court: I deny your motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">Mr. Kunstler: I think they are derogatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">The Court: I deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">Mr. Kunstler: And prejudice these defendants in front of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-13\">The Court: Did you hear me, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-14\">Mr. Kunstler: I am ready to argue it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-15\">The Court: I am not ready to hear you. It is so clearly ill founded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-16\">Mr. Kunstler: It is not. I read to your Honor yesterday a decision of another court, a Federal Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-17\">The Court: I denied your motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-18\">Mr. Kunstler: The derogatory comments to counsel\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-19\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, will you have that man sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-21\">Mr. Weinglass: Mr. Kunstler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-22\">Mr. Kunstler: I just want the record to show I am sitting down because I don\u2019t want to have a marshal come and throw me into my seat, but I am sitting down under protest.\u201d (Tr. pp. 15,309-310)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-23\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-24\">On January 4, Mr. Kunstler engaged in the following colloquy, twice more refusing to sit down when the Court ordered him to do so, and continuing his argument until the marshal approached him. The incident is set forth in the following excerpt from the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-25\">\u201cThe Marshal: Mr. Dellinger, also, will you refrain from laughing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-26\">Mr. Dellinger: That is a lie. And it wasn\u2019t Mr. Rubin. We laugh enough and you can catch us when we do but you just happened to get that one wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-27\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, I don\u2019t think the record should constantly have these references to chuckles\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-28\">The Court: I think the record should show that and I see that the record does. I don\u2019t share your view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-30\">Mr. Kunstler: The Court has made a sally before and the room laughed and you didn\u2019t say put that on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-31\">The Court: I will not sit here \u2014 and you must know it by now, certainly\u2014 and have defendants laugh at my rulings, sir. And I will not hear you on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-32\">Mr. Kunstler: You don\u2019t mind if they laugh at me or if they laugh at someone else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-33\">The Court: I will ask you to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-34\">Mr. Kunstler: I don\u2019t think your Honor\u2019s ultrasensitivity should make a difference in rulings in this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-35\">The Court: It isn\u2019t ultrasensitivity. It is a proper understanding of the conduct of a trial in the Federal District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-36\">Mr. Kunstler: When you interpret it as a laugh as you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-37\">The Court: Some people here don\u2019t seem to know about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-38\">Mr. Kunstler: No, but, your Honor, when you try to interpret a laugh as meaning you are the butt of a joke, then you react\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-39\">The Court: I will ask you to sit down. Did you hear me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-40\">Mr. Kunstler: I just don\u2019t want to get thrown in my chair by the marshal, so I will have to sit down, but I just don\u2019t think it is fair to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-41\">Mr. Hoffman: I laughed anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-42\">The Court: Will you be quiet, Mr.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-43\">Mr. Hoffman: I laughed. It wasn\u2019t Jerry. It was me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The Court: Did you get that, Miss Reporter ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">Mr. Hoffman: \u2014at that ruling. I laughed. He didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">The Court: That was Mr. Dellinger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">Mr. Kunstler: That was not Mr. Dellinger.\u201d (Tr. pp. 15,585-87)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">On January 16, in his direct examination of the witness Goodwin, Mr. Kunst-ler blatantly ignored the directions of the Court on evidentiary rulings. After a question was held to be objectionable, rather than move to the next question, he deliberately asked it again. This conduct continued with Mr. Kunstler making highly improper statements in front of the jury. The incident is reflected in the following excerpt from the transcript :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">\u201cBy Mr. Kunstler:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">Q. Mr. Goodwin, I call your attention to approximately three weeks before the opening of the Democratic National Convention. At that time you were campaign director, were you not, for Eugene McCarthy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">Q. At that time did you make any recommendations to Senator McCarthy ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">Mr. Foran: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-14\">The Court: I sustain the objection. By Mr. Kunstler:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-15\">Q. Did you have a conversation at that time with Senator McCarthy about whether he should or should not urge his supporters to come to Chicago ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-17\">Mr. Foran: Objection, your Honor, as immaterial and irrelevant. Neither Senator McCarthy nor Mr. Goodwin are in this charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-18\">Mr. Kunstler: No, your Honor, but what is at issue is the atmosphere in the city of Chicago created by Mayor Daley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-19\">The Court: I have ruled \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-20\">Mr. Foran: I object to Mr. Kunstler constantly attempting to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-21\">The Court: I have ruled. Ask another question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-22\">Mr. Kunstler: If Mayor Daley was preventing anybody from \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-23\">Mr. Foran: I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-24\">The Court: Will you ask another question, please? Mayor Daley is not in this one. He has come and gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-25\">Mr. Kunstler: Yes, your Honor, but he is in this case. He is the chief and only defendant here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-26\">Mr. Foran: I object to that comment and ask that it be stricken and that the jury be directed \u2014 I ask that it be stricken from the jury\u2019s hearing and also that your Honor admonish counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-27\">The Court: I do so and I direct the jury to disregard it and anything like that, Mr. Kunstler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-28\">Mr. Kunstler: But that is part of our defense, your Honor. We are trying to show who \u2014 if you had a simple robbery case, you could show who the true robber was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-29\">The Court: Don\u2019t make another statement like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-31\">By Mr. Kunstler:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-32\">Q. Did there come a time when Senator McCarthy did tell his supporters not to come to Chicago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-33\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-34\">Mr. Foran: I object to that form of the question and ask that the jury be directed to disregard the statement of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-35\">The Court: Yes. I sustain the objection. I do strike it and direct the jury to disregard it.\u201d (Tr. pp. 16,-129-31)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-36\">XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-37\">On January 20, after a colloquy between the Court and Mr. Weinglass, Mr. Kunstler rose to join the argument. He again resisted the admonitions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Court to desist. The event is set forth in the transcript as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">\u201cMr. Schultz: Your Honor, I ask that that statement be stricken from this record and Mr. Weinglass admonished to conduct himself in a professional manner in this courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, that was highly professional. Mr. Schultz opened the door\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">Mr. Schultz: And the same goes for Mr. Kunstler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2014for that document to be offered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">The Court: Mr. Weinglass is taking care of this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">Mr. Kunstler: I am not going to stand by and have him \u2014 a colleague of mine \u2014 called anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">The Court: Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">Mr. Kunstler: I am not going to sit down unless I am directed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">The Court: I direct you to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-14\">Mr. Kunstler: Am I to be thrown in the chair by the marshal if I don\u2019t sit down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-15\">The Court: I haven\u2019t asked the marshal to throw anybody in the chair. I have asked the marshal on occasion, sir, to direct you to sit down, and you have always followed his word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-18\">Mr. Kunstler: I have followed. I am just indicating, your Honor, I don\u2019t think that kind of conduct should be permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-19\">The Court: I will permit only one defense counsel to participate in the examination of this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-20\">Mr. Kunstler: I am not participating in the examination. I am only defending Mr. Weinglass.\u201d (Tr. pp. 16,-663-64)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-21\">XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">On January 22 the Court was again engaged in a colloquy with Mr. Wein-glass when Mr. Kunstler rose to interject himself into the argument. Again Mr. Kunstler refused to desist when the Court told him to sit down. The incident is reflected in the record thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-25\">\u201cThe Court: I direct the jury to disregard the last statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-26\">Mr. Foran: That is the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-27\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor- \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-28\">The Court: I will not hear from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-29\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2014he said that I said something that is improper. It is not improper, I have heard this in court after court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-30\">The Court: I will not hear from you while your associate is examining this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-31\">Mr. Kunstler: It has nothing to do with this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-32\">Mr. Foran: The reference was to Mr. Weinglass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-33\">Mr. Kunstler: He said I said some-ing that was improper. It was not improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-34\">The Court: I ask you to sit down. Sir, you may continue your examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-35\">Mr. Marshal, have that man sit down.\u201d (Tr. pp. 17,088-89)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-36\">XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-37\">On January 22, after a ruling by the Court, there were loud groans from the defense table. Instead of attempting to aid the Court in keeping order, Mr. Kunstler indicated that he encouraged and approved of such behavior by the defendants. The incident is reported in the record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-38\">\u201c(Groans)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-39\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, I wish you\u2019d take care of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-40\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, those groans are highly appropriate. I get no help from you, so a groan of a client once in a while at least keeps my spirit up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-42\">The Court: I note that you approve of the groans of the client in open court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-43\">Mr. Kunstler: I approve of those groans, your Honor, when your Honor does not admonish Mr. Schultz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The Court: I note them. I note them, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">Mr. Kunstler: What can I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">The Court: You may continue with your argument.\u201d (Tr. p. 17,195)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">On January 22, the Court was again engaged in a colloquy with Mr. Wein-glass. After making a ruling and after indicating directly that the Court did not wish to hear any more argument on that point, Mr. Kunstler then rose and engaged the Court in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t want to hear anything further. I have overruled the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">Mr. Kunstler: He makes it appear like some startling singular fact, which isn\u2019t true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">The Court: Did you hear me, sir? Did you hear me or must I again have the marshal order you to sit down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">Mr. Kunstler: The marshal has never ordered me to sit down. I have sat down when you .said so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-14\">The Court: The other marshal. We have a new marshal sitting right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-15\">Mr. Kunstler: There was no marshal when I sat down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-16\">The Court: Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-17\">The Kunstler: He only approached me and I have sat down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-18\">The Court: That is an order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-19\">Mr. Schultz: May I restate\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-20\">Mr. Kunstler: I\u2019m down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-21\">The Court: Yes. Please remain there.\u201d (Tr. pp. 17,307-08)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-23\">XVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-24\">On Jahuary 23 the Court denied the motion for a mistrial. After the denial Mr. Kunstler continued to attempt to argue the motion. The record appears as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-25\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: You haven\u2019t even heard the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-27\">Mr. Rubin: You haven\u2019t heard it yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-29\">The Court: For a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-30\">Mr. Kunstler: Yes, but I would like to argue it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-31\">The Court: Oh, there is no grounds for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-32\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor knows you have referred to the question of the defendants taking the stand. You have committed the cardinal error of a court with reference\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-33\">The Court: I ask you to sit down, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-34\">Mr. Kunstler: But your Honors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-35\">The Court: I direct the marshal to have this man sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-36\">Mr. Kunstler: Every time I make a motion am I going to be thrown in my seat when I argue it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-38\">The Court: You may sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-39\">Mr. Dellinger: Force and violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-40\">Mr. Kunstler: If that is the ruling of the Court that we cannot argue without being thrown in our seats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-41\">Mr. Dellinger: The Judge is inciting a riot by asking the marshal to have him sit down.\u201d (Tr. p. 17,371)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-42\">After this incident there was a loud burst of applause from the spectators\u2019 galleries and the marshal determined that several spectators would have to be removed. During the removal and disorder, instead of helping the Court to maintain order in the courtroom, Mr. Kunstler issued the following running commentary from the lectern, which had the effect of encouraging disorder among the spectators.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-43\">\u201cMarshal Johnson: Will you sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-45\">(Applause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-46\">The Court: Will you continue, please, with the direct examination of this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-48\">Mr. Dellinger: There goes the violence right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-49\">Mr. Kunstler: That\u2019s the Government in operation, your Honor, as it has been throughout this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The Witness: Your Honor, that\u2019s my sister they\u2019re taking out of the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">The Court: Even your sister\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">Mr. Kunstler: Nobody but the Government has employed violence in this courtroom \u2014 with Bobby Seale, with spectators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">The Court: Since you refer to Bobby Seale, your client, I recall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">Mr. Kunstler: Not my client, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">The Court: \u2014I recall being called various kinds of pigs by that man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">Mr. Rubin: Bill, they are taking out my wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">Mr. Kunstler: Well, your Honor would not let him defend himself, everybody knows that now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\">(Cries of \u2018Hey, stop it.\u2019)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, must we always have this, the force and power of the Government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-17\">Mr. Rubin: They are dragging out my wife \u2014 will you please\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-18\">The Court: We must have order in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-20\">Mr. Kunstler: They like to strike women, your Honor, we\u2019ve seen that constantly here.\u201d (Tr. pp. 17.373-74)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-22\">XVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-23\">On January 23 when the Court determined that it was time to recess the afternoon session, Mr. Kunstler made the following argument and insulting remarks to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-24\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: I realize that, but as long as we are going on six days a week now\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-26\">The Court: 9:30 tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-27\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2014I just don\u2019t understand the half hour difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-28\">The Court: I am not obligated to explain to you, sir, the time for the arrival of the jurors and the parties\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-30\">Mr. Kunstler: No, but since we are going to work the extra day\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-31\">The Court: \u2014and the parties to a lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-32\">Mr. Kunstler: Why, shouldn\u2019t that be at 10:00 o\u2019clock like any other day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-33\">The Court: Because it is at 9:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-34\">Mr. Kunstler: That is like a child saying, \u2018Because, because.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that when we are going an extra day\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-35\">The Court: Let the record show that, in the presence of the jury, Mr. Kunstler compared me to a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-37\">Mr. Kunstler: Oh, your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-38\">The Court: Now, we will have no more of that, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-39\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, I don\u2019t think we can come down to the absurd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-40\">The Court: We have had enough of your remarks in this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-41\">Mr. Kunstler: That is \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-42\">The Court: 9:30 tomorrow morning, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-44\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2014absurd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-45\">The Marshal: Mr. Hoffman, will you keep quiet, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-47\">Defendant Hoffman: It is funny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-48\">The Court: If the marshals can keep those defendants quiet, I will direct the jury when to return.\u201d (Tr. pp. 17,597-98)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-50\">XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-51\">On January 28, when Mr. Schultz was making his argument concerning the exclusion of Ramsey Clark from the witness stand, Mr. Kunstler engaged in the following disrespectful colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-52\">\u201cMr. Schultz: Mr. Murrill, will you tell the Court, please, what the Attorney General said about the admissibility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-53\">Mr. Murrill: May I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-54\">Mr. Kunstler: May Mr. Murrill be sworn as a witness and take the witness stand, because I was there, and I heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-55\">Mr. Schultz: But Mr. Kunstler can\u2019t represent anything in its proper perspective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Mr. Kunstler: Have him sworn, your Honor, and then I will question him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">The Court: Oh, don\u2019t assume that attitude here, Mr. Kunstler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">Mr. Kunstler: I am going to assume it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">The Court: You ought to know that that makes no impression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, that you could sit there and hear a lawyer say\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-12\">The Court: \u2018I\u2019ll examine him,\u2019 I don\u2019t like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-13\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, he has made a representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-14\">The Court: I don\u2019t like that attitude. I never saw that man in my life before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-16\">Mr. Kunstler: I ask you to put him on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-17\">The Court: Right now I will do as I think should be done. Please don\u2019t order me around, Mr. Kunstler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-18\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, a representation has been made. Mr. Mur-rill is in the courtroom. Let him take the stand and say under oath\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-20\">The Court: You assume a respectful attitude toward the Court. I have been respectful to you. I have tried awfully hard throughout this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-21\">Mr. Kunstler: I won\u2019t even go into that, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-22\">The Court: Even though when I say a thing like that, I get the guffaws out there.\u201d (Tr. 18,439-41)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-24\">XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-25\">On February 2, after the Court ruled that Mr. Kunstler would have to abide by his representation the previous Friday, and therefore would not be able to call the Reverend Ralph Abernathy to the stand, Mr. Kunstler made the following speech at the conclusion of his argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-26\">\u201cThe Court: . . . There have been several witnesses called here during this trial \u2014 I need not mention their names \u2014 whose testimony the Court ruled could not even be presented to the jury: singers, performers, and former office holders. I think in the light of the representations made by you unequivocally, sir, with no reference to Dr. Abernathy, I will deny your motion that we hold\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-29\">Mr. Kunstler: I want to comment on this, your Honor, because I think what you have just said is about the most outrageous statement I have ever heard from a bench, and I am going to say my piece right now, and you can hold me in contempt right now if you wish to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-31\">You have violated every principle of fair play when you excluded Ramsey Clark from the witness stand. The New York Times, among others, has called it the ultimate outrage in American justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-32\">Voices: Right on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-33\">Mr. Kunstler: I am outraged to be in this court before you. Now because I made a statement on Friday that I had only a cameraman, and I discovered on Saturday that Ralph Abernathy, who is the chairman of the Mobilization, is in town, and can be here, and because you took a whole day from us on Thursday by listening to this ridiculous argument about whether Ramsey Clark could take that stand in front of the jury, I am trembling because I am so outraged. I haven\u2019t been able to get this out before, and I am saying it now, and then I want you to put me in jail if you want to. You can do anything you want with me, if you want to; because I feel disgraced to be here, to say to us on the technicality of my representation that we can\u2019t put Ralph Abernathy on the stand. He is the co-chairman of the MOBE. He has relevant testimony. I know that doesn\u2019t mean much in this Court when the Attorney General of the United States walked out of here with his lips so tight he could hardly breathe, and if you could see the expression on his face, you would know, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>and his wife informed me he never felt such anger at the United States, Government as at not being able to testify on that stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">Voices: Right on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">Mr. Kunstler: You can\u2019t tell me that Ralph Abernathy cannot take the stand today because of the technicality of whether I made a representation. That representation was made in perfect good faith with your Honor. I did not know that Reverend Abernathy was back in the country. We have been trying to get him for a week and a half to be the last witness for the defense in this case. And now to tell me that we are going ahead, the Government is ready, after you took Thursday from us to have this argument over whether a man could be presented to a jury, I told your Honor then, and I am telling you now, no American court has ever done what your Honor did\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">Voices: Right on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2014basing it on a case which was inapplicable to the situation.

If that is what their liberty depends upon, your Honor saying I represented to you that I had a cameraman, and that was our only witness, a cameraman, whom we can\u2019t get, incidentally, then I think there is nothing really more for me to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-17\">The Court: There is not much more you could say, Mr. Kunstler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-19\">Mr. Kunstler: I am going to turn back to my seat with the realization that everything I have learned throughout my life has come to naught, that there is no meaning in this court, and there is no law in this court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-20\">Voices: Right on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-21\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2022 \u2014 and these men are going to jail by virtue of a legal lynching\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-22\">Voices: Right on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-23\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2014and that your Hon- or is wholly responsible for that, and if this is what your career is going to end on, if this is what your pride is going to be built on, I can only say to your Honor, \u2018Good luck to you.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-24\">(There were shouts of \u2018Right On,\u2019 and there was applause in the courtroom.)\u201d Official Transcript, Pages 19,108-112.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-25\">XXI.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-26\">After the Court ruled, on February 2, that the Reverend Abernathy would not be permitted to take the stand, the Court ordered that Mr. Kunstler and the other attorneys and defendants not mention the name of the Reverend Abernathy in front of the jury. Mr. Kunstler not only defiantly indicated that he fully intended to violate that order, but in the middle of the direct testimony of the witness Lynskey, Mr. Kunstler actually brought the Reverend Abernathy into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the courtroom and made a statement to the jury and physically embraced the Reverend Abernathy in front of the jury. This flagrant violation of the Court\u2019s order is reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">\u201cMr. Schultz: Your Honor, may the defendants and their counsel then not make any reference in front of the jury that they wanted Doctor Abernathy to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">Mr. Kunstler: No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">The Court: I order you not to make such a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">Mr. Kunstler: We are not going to abide by any such comment as that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">Doctor Ralph Abernathy is going to come into this courtroom, and I am going to repeat my motion before that. jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">The Court: I order you not to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">Mr. Kunstler: Then you will have to send me to jail, I am sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-14\">Mr. Schultz: Your Honor, it is our position we are ready to go ahead now.

It was essential that marshals forcibly clear people from the courtroom in order a maintain order. When disorder broke out in the spectator benches, Mr. Kunst-ler blamed the disorder on the Court, fanning the flames of the disorder with these inciting comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-22\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: You brought this on, your Honor. This is your fault. This is what happened in Chicago. You made the power move. You exerted the power, and I would like to argue the point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-23\">The Court: You won\u2019t argue the point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-24\">Mr. Kunstler: I will argue, your Honor, that your Honor\u2019s action is completely and utterly vindictive, and there is no authority that says because a defendant blurts out a word in court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-26\">The Court: This isn\u2019t the first word, and I won\u2019t argue this.\u201d Official Transcript, Pages 19,777-78.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-28\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: No, you know that if you did that, you would add to reversible error in this case. Why not take them all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-29\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, there is no need for your action.\u201d Official Transcript, Page 19,779.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-30\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: Your Honor, is there no decency left here? Can\u2019t we just argue the point?\u201d Official Transcript, Page 19,780.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-31\">XXIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-32\">On February 5, after the Court had denied the defendants\u2019 motion to reinstate the defendant Dellinger\u2019s bond, the Court determined that argument was complete. Once more Mr. Kunstler defied the Court\u2019s order to desist arguing and sit down. The incident is reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-33\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: The United States Attorney is trying to get the stenographer to add words to the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-34\">The Court: And that order to sit down\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-35\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor, I ask the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-36\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, please have that lawyer sit down \u2014 both of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-38\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor will not permit me to continue legal argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-39\">The Court: You heard what I said. I deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-40\">Mr. Davis: May we defend ourselves if our lawyers can\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-41\">Mr. Kunstler: I think the marshal is going to have this time to put me in my seat.

The Court had occasion to take him to task, and he insulted the Court in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u201cThe Court: I want to read what you said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">Mr. Kunstler: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">The Court: I will wait.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">\u2018But do you\u2019 \u2014 and I am addressing you \u2014 \u2018do you give me your assurance, sir \u2014 \u2019 \u2014I am reading from the transcript of evidence, Page 20278, \u2018in the presence of this jury and all those assembled here, the lawyers, the parties, that you will not attempt or offer any additional \u2014 or offer any additional witnesses on Monday? We are conditioning this continuance or I propose to condition it on your representation that will not be the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\">May I have just a moment to consult?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">Now it takes a witness to identify a document, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-14\">Mr. Kunstler: No, no. The witness has testified already, your Honor. Your Honor is now proved wrong. I said \u2018witnesses,\u2019 and I stand by that. There are no additional witnesses. I did \u2014 I think your Honor has read the transcript to show that I was right in this instance. Now, your Honor, you are not going to find it, I don\u2019t think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-15\">Your Honor, why don\u2019t you just agree for once that perhaps I am right, and I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-16\">The Court: I will strike the remark of Mr. Kunstler, insulting as it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-17\">Mr. Kunstler: It is not insulting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-18\">The Court: And I direct the jury to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-19\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-20\">The Court: I sat here patiently for five months, sir, pretty nearly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-21\">Mr. Kunstler: I have been here patiently for five months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-22\">The Court: I want to tell you that for you to say \u2018Why don\u2019t you agree for once\u2019 is about as rotten a thing as I have ever had said to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-23\">Mr. Kunstler: With rare exceptions you have not agreed with me on anything throughout this trial. It is not meant to be insulting, your Honor. You are poring through the transcript\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-24\">The Court: I take it as an insult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-25\">Mr. Kunstler: Because you want to find that I am wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-26\">The Court: I have given all my judicial time to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-27\">Mr. Kunstler: I have devoted all my legal time. We have all devoted our time. The jury devotes its time and you do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-28\">The Court: I will not hear you further in connection with that exhibit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-29\">Mr. Kunstler: Will you then just for the record admit that you were wrong, that I did not say documents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-30\">The Court: No, I will not admit that I was wrong because I am not wrong. If you will read the transcript \u2014and I don\u2019t propose to take the time\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-31\">Mr. Kunstler: You have read it to us, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-32\">The Court: Not all of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-33\">Mr. Kunstler: It is quite clear.\u201d Official Transcript, Pages 20,324-26.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-34\">Mr. Schultz then spoke. He cited explicit sections of the transcript which conclusively demonstrated that the Court had been correct in its understanding of Mr. Kunstler\u2019s representations. Mr. Kunstler\u2019s accusations were demonstrated to be erroneous. Even Mr. Kunstler recognized that he had erred, and he apologized.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201cMr. Kunstler: In the light of that, your Honor, I will make the admission and be quite candid and frank that then I was wrong and I will not offer 109 although I think it ought to go in. When I am wrong, I think it is proper to admit it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">The Court: You were pretty sure, though, when you said that I was mistaken. You didn\u2019t use the charitable word that you just used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, I admit when a man is wrong, I think he has an obligation to say it and I am saying it.\u201d Official Transcript, Page 20,327.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a5q-dedup-0\">One minute later Mr. Kunstler directly violated an explicit order of the Court by mentioning once more the name of the Reverend Abernathy before the jury. When the Court challenged him to justify his conduct, he attempted to do so by citing previous violations of that order, as if past misconduct by defendants and their attorneys could some way justify this violation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201cMr. Kunstler: I only do it, your Honor, because it has been discussed ten times in front of them (the jurors).\u201d Official Transcript, Page 20,-329.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Accordingly, I hereby adjudge William M. Kunstler guilty of the several individual and separate specifications of direct criminal contempt of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">LEONARD I. WEINGLASS</p>\n<p id=\"apu-dedup-0\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Mr. Weinglass has consistently ignored the orders of the court to discontinue argument or to sit down. The first occasion upon which this occurred was on September 24, during motions made pri- or to the voir dire of the jury panel. The incident is thus reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: Mr. Birnbaum and Mr. Bass have withdrawn from the case as trial counsel. Mr. Seale is not represented here in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">The Court: Mr. Weinglass, I direct you to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">Mr. Weinglass: If the Court please, I would like to know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">The Court: I would like you to sit down, or I will ask the marshal to escort you to your chair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">Mr. Weinglass: I will sit down, but I do so under protest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">The Court: Then do so.\u201d Voir Dire Transcript, Page 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-17\">On October 1, during the cross examination of the witness Stahl, Mr. Wein-glass continually asked questions that were beyond the scope of the direct examination. The court sustained the objections but he persisted in asking the questions, over objection, again and again. In an effort to enlighten him, the court sent out the jury and directed some remarks concerning the cases on contempt to Mr. Weinglass who virtually ignored the court while the court was addressing him. The incident is reported in Pages 555 through 565 of the official transcript as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-18\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: The last document should be marked identification No. 7, Defendants\u2019 Exhibit, and we can mark this Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-20\">(Said documents were thereupon marked Defendants\u2019 Exhibits 7 and 8 for identification.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-21\">By Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-22\">Q. I show you your handwritten notes of the August 12 meeting marked Defendants\u2019 No. 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-23\">Is that your handwritten note, a copy of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-24\">A. Yes, these are a copy of my notes of the meeting August 12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-25\">Q. August 12. Directing your attention to the first page, did you state right at the beginning that the National Mobilization Committee made it clear to you at the outset that they wanted to avoid unnecessary tensions, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-26\">A. Mr. Dellinger made that statement and immediately followed with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>statement that he believed in civil disobedience, that he just returned from Paris where he studied street riots. I think that he would say violence and then say non-violence and then say\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">Q. Is that correct? Well, does that statement appear in your notes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">A. Yes, the statement about civil disobedience does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">Q. Yes. Would you read to the jury, after having said that, what your notes reflect Mr. Dellinger said about civil disobedience?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Mr. Foran: Object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">The Court: I sustain the objection. By Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">Q. Is it not a fact that Mr. Del-linger said, according to your notes, that he believes in civil disobedience, but that he does not intend to disrupt delegates at the convention ? Isn\u2019t that what he said, Mr. Stahl? Isn\u2019t that what your notes reflect him saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">The Court: I sustain the objection. By Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\">Q. I ask you to look over that entire first page, and I ask you whether or not there are any notations indicating that Mr. Dellinger had been to Paris or that he had studied riot techniques on that first page?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-13\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, I object to this. There is a clearly proper way to establish that if it is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-14\">The Court: Of course. I sustain your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-15\">Mr. Foran: The same type of objection, your Honor, has been sustained a number of times, and I wish counsel would be directed that there is a proper way to go into those matters if he would use it, and it is not this way. By Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-16\">Q. Do you further recall Mr. Del-linger saying to you in the course of that meeting that he didn\u2019t want to interfere with the police, business, or traffic? I am referring to page 2 of your notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-17\">A. Yes, he made that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-18\">Q. He made that statement. Did he also make the statement to you that he wanted to meet with the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-19\">A. He said he may want to meet with the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-20\">Q. I refer you to the middle of the page. That was the second recquest to meet with the police. His first request appears in the middle of the page. Does it qualify \u2014 does he say he wants to meet with the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-21\">A. My notes say, \u2018Want to meet with police.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-22\">Q. Yes. Did Mr. Dellinger also make known to 'you, as reflected in your notes, that denying of the permits is a denial of the rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-24\">Q. At the August 12 meeting who appeared there on behalf of the City besides yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-25\">A. Assistant Corporation Counsel, Richard Elrod, was there. I believe that\u2019s all.' There may have been others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-26\">Q. Was there any understanding between you and Mr. Simon or someone else on behalf of National Mobilization that you were to have other department heads there so that this matter could be resolved in one meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-27\">A. No, there was no such understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-28\">Mr. Foran: I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-29\">By Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-30\">Q. There was no such under\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-31\">The Court: Do you persist in your objection, or do you let the answer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-32\">Mr. Foran: I will withdraw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-33\">The Court: Let the answer stand. By Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-34\">Q. Did you ever have an understanding with Mr. Dellinger or Mr. Davis that you would bring before them at one meeting heads of the Park District and the Department of Sanitation and Streets for resolution of the problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-35\">Mr. Foran: I object to that now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The Court: I sustain it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">By Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">Q.

By Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Q. Were you ever able to bring together in a single meeting Rennie Davis and Mr. Dellinger and the head of the Park District or the head of the Department of Streets and Sanitation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoA\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afb\">The Court: I sustain the objection.

Were you ever requested to bring together \u2014 were yon ever requested by Mr. Davis and Mr. Dellinger to bring together in a meeting himself and other persons from City Government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afu-dedup-0\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ-\">The Court: I sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">Mr. Foran: May I ask that the jury be excused for a moment ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">The Court: On request of the United States Attorney, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I will excuse you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">Before you go into the jury room, my usual orders that you are not to read the newspapers, not to listen to television or radio, not to talk about this case with anyone or let anybody speak with you about it. Do not discuss the case among yourselves. I think I omitted to say, don\u2019t look at television, although I don\u2019t think our great Government has provided a television in the jury room in any event. But I am obligated to make that order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">You are excused for a few moments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">(The following proceedings were had in open court, out of the presence and hearing of the jury:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, I find it a little unusual to conduct or attempt to conduct a class in basic legal procedure, but where counsel constantly asks questions that are outside the scope of the direct examination, I cannot expect that it is for any reason except to generate some erroneous impression in the jury because it generates objections from counsel. There is a perfectly proper way to put in matters other than those covered on direct examination. It is not by trying to put facts into questions that if they are denied sound as if they are in the record. That is the reason that Wigmore, that common law since the beginning of time designated a trial technique, and I ask your Honor to direct counsel to comply with what is the proper conduct of examination of a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">The Court: Since the jury is out, I do direct counsel to confine his cross examination to matters brought out on direct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">The objections of the government are valid, and they have all been sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">And by the way, Mr. Weinglass, this morning I referred Mr. Kunstler to two cases \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-18\">Mr. Weinglass: Am I being addressed on this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-19\">The Court: What did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-20\">Mr. Weinglass: Am I being addressed or Mr. Kunstler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-22\">The Court: No, I said, \u2018By the way.\u2019 I am addressing you. I do mention his name because I referred to two cases this morning, the Sacher case in the 343 Supreme, Sacher and Others against the United States, and 343, page 1, and the case of United States of America v. Schiffer, reported in 351 F.2d 91 (1965).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-24\">Mr. Kunstler said he was familiar with those cases, but I fear that he misunderstood the names because when he said he understood them, he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-25\">I do want to call your attention to those cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-26\">I will wait until you get through reading your papers. Have you finished ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Mr. Weinglass: Am I being questioned on what my co-counsel\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">The Court: I am telling you something. I am trying to enlighten you. I am trying to do something for you. Haven\u2019t you been listening to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">Mr. Weinglass: I frankly thought these remarks were addressed to counsel who cited the cases, not to myself. I had no part of this dialogue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">The Court: Well, then I tell you sir, and I am addressing you now\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">Mr. Weinglass: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">The Court: I am not accustomed to having lawyers turn pages while I address them. I don\u2019t turn pages up here when you address me, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">I commend to you for your examination the case of Sacher and Others against the United States, 343 U.S., page 1 [72 S.Ct. 451, 96 L.Ed. 717], and United States of America v. Schif-fer, 351 F.2d page 91.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">I shall not take the time to read those cases to you, but they are quite apposite, I think, when a lawyer persists in asking questions that are beyond the scope of the direct examination after repeated objections have been sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">Mr. Marshall, will you please bring in the jury.\u201d Tr. 555-65.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">On October 30 when the court was making an evidentiary ruling, Mr. Wein-glass engaged in the following colloquy with the court indicating his belief that the court had been prejudicial in its rulings on evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">\u201cThe Court: What do the lawyers say about that, they open the door? Is that what you lawyers all say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">Mr. Weinglass: We do not open the door to a prejudicial question. I very carefully avoided any mention of any section of a code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-16\">The Court: That is the reason for the open-the-door rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-17\">Mr. Weinglass: Well, the door has been\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-18\">The Court: Very often it kicks back in your face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-19\">Mr. Weinglass: The door in this courtroom seems to swing in one direction. Many times I have attempted to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-20\">The Court: Miss Reporter, please make note of that. The court admonishes counsel to be cautious in his observations, in the observations he makes such as he just completed.\u201d Tr. 4925.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-21\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">On November 26, during the cross examination of the witness Schaller, Mr. Weinglass engaged the court in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-23\">\u201cThe Court: In justice to my own position here, I must reveal, sir, that prior to the jury coming in, you said you would need the tape recorders\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-24\">Mr. Weinglass: Because the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-25\">The Court: \u2014on your motion, and I made it of record \u2014 I gave leave to the gentlemen of the government who had those devices in charge to take them out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-26\">Now, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-27\">Mr. Weinglass: That is correct, because your Honor \u2014 your Honor must give me a chance to answer that. That\u2019s most unfair. That is most unfair, and I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-28\">The Court: That is not unfair, sir, and please be careful about your language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-29\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-30\">Mr. Kunstler: We couldn\u2019t play those \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-32\">Mr. Weinglass: I couldn\u2019t play 40 because it was not in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-33\">The Court: I can\u2019t listen to two shouting lawyers at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-34\">Mr. Weinglass: Because it\u2019s the only way we can be heard at times. Those documents were not in evidence. The government excluded\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-36\">The Court: Please read that last statement of Mr. Weinglass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Mr. Weinglass: It was, because there are times we can\u2019t be heard unless we shout.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">Mr. Weinglass: And that is what I said. I will stand by that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">The Court: I just wanted to be sure I heard that statement.\u201d Tr. 8,286-87.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">On January 13 Mr. Weinglass engaged the court in the following colloquy, when the court made the reasonable request that Mr. Weinglass stop repeating his argument after an extensive statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: Your Honor, Wigmore, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, McCormick on Evidence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">The Court: Don\u2019t repeat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">Mr. Weinglass: \u25a0 \u2014 Judge Learned Hand\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">The Court: Don\u2019t repeat. I have listened very carefully to you. You are repeating the judges and the authors and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">Mr. Weinglass: I am summarizing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">The Court: If you have anything additional to say, I will hear you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">Mr. Weinglass: I am exercising an attorney\u2019s right to summarize in argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">The Court: Not in the middle of a trial. I don\u2019t think you have that right where the court has already made a ruling and I have listened to you most attentively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-19\">If you have anything additional, I will be glad to let you put it into the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-20\">Mr. Weinglass: Well, all of the authorities I have cited, all of the legal writers who have written on the subject, Judge Learned Hand and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, all agree\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-21\">The Court: You are doing precisely what I asked you not to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-22\">Mr. Weinglass: I am doing what I feel I am permitted to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-23\">The Court: I forbid your repeating right in the middle of a trial here. And you haven\u2019t even stated your motion. You haven\u2019t even stated your motion. That is how carefully I have been listening to you, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-24\">Mr. Weinglass: I will state my motion after my summary conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-25\">The Court: Most lawyers when they address the court announce what their motion is. You haven\u2019t told me what your motion is yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-26\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor, I don\u2019t think it is very much in doubt that I am moving to put these documents in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-28\">The Court: It should not be in doubt at all. A lawyer standing at the lectern to make a motion should state his motion. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-29\">Mr. Weinglass: Well, your Honor, this has happened time and again in the course of the case, the substance of a legal argument has been compromised by your Honor\u2019s insistence of pure form.\u201d Tr. 15,233 to 15,234.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-30\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-31\">On January 13 during the redirect examination of the witness Simon Mr. Weinglass again in front of the jury attempted to make an invidious comparison between the treatment the court afforded the witnesses called by the defendant as opposed to the treatment afforded witnesses called by the government. This event is recorded at Pages 15,308 and 15,309 of the transcript as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-32\">\u201cThe Court: Oh, wait at least until he gets through law school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-33\">Mr. Weinglass: But Mr. Foran\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-34\">The Court: Mr. Weinglass\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-35\">Mr. Weinglass: I didn\u2019t go into it. Mr. Foran asked that. I did not go into this on direct examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-36\">The Court: Did I hear an objection to the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-37\">Mr. Foran: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-38\">The Court: I think you stood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-39\">I sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor, he was asked his opinion about ordinances, laws, what is a responsible act of a public official on cross examination, so it was opened by the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">The Court: Continue with your redirect examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">Mr. Weinglass: Is only one side able to use this witness\u2019 expertise and not the other? The Government has asked\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">The Court: There will be no more of that type of observation. I have tried to make that clear to you all through this trial, Mr. Weinglass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">Mr. Weinglass: Well, I make that observation reluctantly but I make it only when I think it is based in fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">The Court: You should not succumb to your desire to make that kind of observation, sir, and I can understand why you make it reluctantly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">Mr. Kunstler: I didn\u2019t hear the last remark, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">Mr. Weinglass: If your Honor means something derogatory in that reference, I make that observation because I think it is based in fact and I think as a matter of fact it is incorrect. I say that respectfully to the court. And I don\u2019t understand your Honor\u2019s observation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">The Court: Continue with the redirect examination of this witness, please.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">On January 13 during the direct examination of the witness Misner, the attorney Weinglass made the following sarcastic comments about the court\u2019s rule on an evidentiary matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-16\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: Oh, if your Honor please, an expert is called to court by a party to assist the jury in interpreting evidence that has been put before the jury. An expert is needed to assist the jury in that role in order to help the jury draw conclusions, and you can only do that with an expert from testimony or facts already related.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-19\">Now your Honor knows that doctors are regularly called as expert witnesses. A jury cannot from hearing a temperature chart or the symptoms of illness draw conclusions as to what is wrong with the patient; that is why you call a doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-20\">The Court: Oh, this is an eye witness. He has testified that he got hit on the back and even he disagreed with the diagnosis of the doctor. His diagnosis as a criminologist differed from that of the medical man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-21\">So I will sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-22\">Mr. Weinglass: No, your Honor. That is evading the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-23\">Mr. Schultz: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-24\">The Court: Oh, please, sir. I am not evading the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-25\">Mr. Weinglass: It is just evading it. It is getting us off into a little diversion about medical testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-26\">The Court: Don\u2019t say so a third time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-27\">Mr. Weinglass: I say it most respectfully. This man came here as an expert criminologist. He talked to Chief Nolan\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-28\">The Court: Ask another question. I sustain the objection.\u201d Tr. 15,441-42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-29\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-30\">On January 16 Mr. Weinglass once more continued an argument after the court had ruled and after the court had directed him to desist in his argument. The incident is reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-31\">\u201cBy Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-32\">Q. Who did you speak with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-33\">A. I called the office to talk to both Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-34\">Q. Did you speak to either or both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-35\">A. I talked to Tom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-36\">Q. Do you recall that conversation at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>A. Yes. I told Tom that I had just been in a meeting called the Coalition for an Open Convention at which a number of people who were supporters of Bobby Kennedy, which was what I was, were supporters of Gene McCarthy, who were \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">Mr. Schultz: Your Honor, I object. This conversation is wholly irrelevant, and simply because it\u2019s a conversation with the defendant does not make it admissible, and I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">The Court: I sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">Mr.-Weinglass: Your Honor, it is another telephone conversation with Mr. Schultz apparently has some information on, and I would like again\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">The Court: Which candidate this witness was supporting whether it was the late Senator Kennedy or anybody else, is immaterial and irrelevant here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">Mr. Weinglass: No, your Honor will recall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">The Court: I direct that jury to disregard the last statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor will recall during the cross-examination \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">The Court: Ask another question, sir, or if the witness will answer the question without referring to these irrelevant matters \u2014 perhaps he can \u2014 I will let him answer, but there will be none of this stuff about whom he campaigned for, who his candidate was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor will recall that during the cross examination of the witness Mark Simons by Mr. Foran, Mr. Foran on cross examination indicated in his questions that perhaps the people who were coming here were irresponsible people who should not be given permits. The fact of the matter is that a sizable number of McCarthy delegates and Kennedy delegates who were elected and certified representatives to the convention had joined with the National Mobilization in an effort to seek permits in the city.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\">The Court: I will hear no further argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-14\">Mr. Weinglass: And that is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-15\">The Court: I will let my ruling stand, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-16\">Mr. Weinglass: That is why it is relevant, your Honor, and that is why I am trying to get into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-17\">The Court: No, it is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-18\">Mr. Weinglass: These persons are cast as being persons who wanted to create an irresponsible situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-19\">The Court: Will you discontinue your argument, because I have ruled, sir.\u201d Tr. 16,063-64.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-20\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-21\">On January 17 Mr. Weinglass once more continued an argument after the court had ruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-22\">\u201cThe Court: It is not relevant or material, and there is so much in that that has nothing to do with this case that I just couldn\u2019t take it in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-23\">Mr. Weinglass: Well, the document encompasses Miami and Chicago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-24\">The Court: I have heard the argument. I have looked at the document, read it carefully, and that is my ruling, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-25\">Mr. Weinglass: Well, then, I re-offer as Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 310 Page 7 of that document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-26\">The Court: I remember Page 7. I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-27\">Mr. Weinglass: Page 7 deals exclusively with Chicago and the status of negotiation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-28\">The Court: Do you want to look at Page 7?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-29\">Mr. Schultz: No, I have read Page 7. I prefer, your Honor, the witness testifies to what occurs rather than introduce a document. Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-30\">The Court: It is not proper to take that page in, any more than it is to talk about other things to which I shall not here refer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-31\">In order that the record is complete, I sustain the objection of the government to defendants\u2019 Exhibit 310 for identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Mr. Weinglass: Well, your Honor, this document contains an assessment\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">The Court: I have ruled, sir. You must learn \u2014 you mustn\u2019t keep on arguing after I rule. I have tried to make you understand that, that I have never had so much difficulty. That is good trial practice, and I have tried to make you understand it, but I haven\u2019t been able to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">By Mr. Weinglass:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">Q.

This document has been ruled inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">The Court: I sustain the objection.\u201d Tr. 16,298-99.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Shortly later on January 17, also during the testimony of the witness Pomeroy, Mr. Weinglass repeated his conduct. He once more argued after the court had made a ruling. This came within minutes of the court\u2019s admonition just quoted, not to argue after rulings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">\u201cThe Court: I sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, he just said to ask Mr. Weinglass to say what he saw.

No further argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-17\">Mr. Weinglass: He was liaison officer for the Attorney General of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-18\">The Court: Did you hear me, sir? You continue day after day to persist in arguing after ruling has been made.\u201d Tr. 16,332.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-19\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-20\">On January 20 the court specifically directed Mr. Weinglass not to refer to a document, objection to which had been sustained. Mr. Weinglass continued to argue after this relatively simple ruling had been made. He continued to argue after told to desist. He was insulting to the court and indicated that the court had acted dishonestly. The incident is sel; forth in the record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-21\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: After Mr. Schultz says that, Mr. Wilkins went back to Washington and told the Attorney General\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-22\">Mr. Schultz: Now, Mr. Weinglass\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-23\">The Court: Just a minute, Mr. Schultz. I direct you, sir, not to refer to a document objection to which has been sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-25\">Mr. Weinglass: He wouldn\u2019t have if Mr. Schultz didn\u2019t object\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-26\">The Court: I order you not to refer to that document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-27\">Mr. Weinglass: But he replied that this witness\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-28\">The Court: There will be no \u2018but\u2019 about it.

You must see that. You have read the document yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-32\">The Court: I order you to refrain from further discussion of a document where objection has been sustained out of the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-33\">Mr. Weinglass: But how can you permit this dishonesty ?

I think they are improper.\u201d Tr. 16,662-666.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">On January 22, during the direct examination of the witness Buff, Mr. Weinglass continued to make statements from the lectern rather than question the witness. He was directly ordered to continue the examination and was forbidden to make such statements. He defied that order, and the incident is set forth in the record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-15\">\u201cThe Court: I direct you, sir\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-16\">Mr. Foran: You are supposed to ask a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-17\">The Court: I direct you, sir, to proceed with the direct examination of this witness, and forbid the making of a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-18\">Mr. Weinglass: In order to protect Mr. Rubin\u2019s rights in the state court prosecution\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-19\">Mr. Foran: There is no necessity of arguing legal questions that are not the obligation of a jury to decide. That is what he is attempting to do, to try to get the jury to violate its obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-21\">The Court: I forbid you to make any statement during this direct examination other than to ask questions. You may ask any questions you like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-22\">Mr. Weinglass: These questions are being asked, your Honor, under protest in light of Mr. Rubin\u2019s state court prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-23\">The Court: I strike that statement because you did it, you made the statement after I gave you my direction not to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-24\">Mr. Weinglass: I can\u2019t compromise the man\u2019s rights in this courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-25\">Mr. Foran: There is no compromise of rights. The jury is a factual finding body. It has nothing to do with the legal questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-26\">The Court: I direct the jury to disregard the last statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-27\">Mr. Foran: That is the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-28\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-29\">The Court: I will not hear from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-30\">Mr. Kunstler: \u2014he said I said something that is improper. It is not improper. I have heard this in court after court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-31\">The Court: I will not hear from you while your associate is examining this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-32\">Mr. Kunstler: It has nothing to do with this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-33\">Mr. Foran: The reference was to Mr. Weinglass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-34\">Mr. Kunstler: He said I said something that was improper. It was not improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-35\">The Court: I ask you to sit down, sir.

I have an obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">The Court: You made it in derogation of the court\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">Mr. Weinglass: There was nothing improper about the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">The Court: It is improper if the court ordered you not to make it. I wish you could continue with the examination now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">Mr. Weinglass: The effect of the order is to compromise the rights of Mr. Rubin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">The Court: Will you continue with the direct examination of the witness. Otherwise, I will ask the witness to leave the stand.\u201d Tr. 17,087-89.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">On January 24, during the direct examination of the witness Davis, Mr. Weinglass continued to argue after a ruling had been made and he had been directed to complete his argument. He openly defied the order of the court and refused to continue with the examination when told to do so. The incident is set forth in the transcript as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-13\">\u201cThe Court: I will let my ruling stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-14\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-15\">The Court: I said I\u2019d let my ruling stand, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-16\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor must permit us the opportunity of responding to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-17\">The Court: I have permitted you. I have permitted Mr. Kunstler to speak, and now you may ask another question of this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-18\">Mr. Weinglass: Reverend Abernathy was mentioned as an officer of the National Mobilization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-19\">The Court: Mr. Weinglass\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-20\">Mr. Dellinger: He was co-chairman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-21\">The Court: I direct you not to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-22\">Mr. Weinglass: He was national co-chairman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-23\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, there were seven individuals who are still in this case as part of this indictment. There is no national\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-24\">The Court: Will you continue with the examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-25\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor, I would like to ask Mr. Foran what relationship the unidentified speaker had with the National Mobilization. His speech was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-27\">The Court: I order you to continue with his examination, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-28\">Mr. Weinglass: I understand your Honor\u2019s sensitivity to what Reverend Abernathy said at that particular time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-29\">The Court: And I direct that that remark go out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-30\">Mr. Weinglass: And Senator McCarthy also spoke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-31\">The Court: And I direct the jury to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-32\">Mr. Weinglass: Two witnesses referred to what Senator McCarthy had to say, and he is not a defendant here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-34\">Mr. Foran: On cross examination, your Honor. On cross examination by these men, not on direct examination by the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-35\">Mr. Weinglass: On direct examination\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-36\">The Court: Will you comply with my order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-37\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, I am going to answer the second part of the argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-38\">Mr. Weinglass: Richard Goodwin, when he was called as a witness by us, referred to the exact words by Senator McCarthy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-39\">The Court: Will you comply with my order ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-40\">Mr. Kunstler: What about the second part of the argument that the mule train was mentioned on direct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-42\">The Court: I will ask you to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, but that is not \u2014 your Honor ruled that was irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">The Court: I cannot let two lawyers conduct an examination and handle the objections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">Mr. Kunstler: I am not conducting the examination. I raised the second argument and that was not answered, that the SCLC Mule Train, if the mule train was afraid of the demonstrators, why did Ralph Abernathy speak to them the next day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">The Court: Will you comply with my order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">Mr. Weinglass: If your Honor will not permit the jury to hear what Reverend Abernathy said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Mr. Foran: Listen to that, Your Honor. Just listen to that. Isn\u2019t that classical ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">The Court: I will strike that last remark, and don\u2019t make it again. I direct the jury to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">Mr. Marshal, anyone who laughs aloud at the rulings of the court will please \u2014 other than the defendants \u2014 be asked to leave the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">Mr. Kunstler: Your Honor, am I entitled to an answer to my objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">The Court: I have heard you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-14\">Mr. Kunstler: Well, the prosecutor has not responded. He has ignored it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-15\">The Court: I have heard you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-16\">Mr. Weinglass: I just want the record to show that Reverend Abernathy was an officer of the National Mobilization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-18\">The Court: Oh, Mr. Weinglass. Mr. Weinglass. I am sorry \u2014 \u201d Tr. 17,-805-806.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-19\">XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-20\">On January 26, during the cross examination of the witness Davis, Mr. Weinglass made an objection. When his objection was overruled he again argued the question, and made a citation to the Canon of Judicial Ethics. He was instructed not to make such a statement again during the trial, and he defiantly immediately thereafter made the statement again. The incident is reported as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-22\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: Your Honor, I object to that because they are two different conversations. Mr. Froines made a presentation at which the defendant Davis indicated he said that. Mr. Bock was referring to a later time, he said. We are talking, again, about confusion in Mr. Foran\u2019s question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-24\">Mr. Foran: When did you structure that, Mr. Weinglass? It wasn\u2019t testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-25\">The Court: I will overrule the objection and let the witness answer if he can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-26\">Mr. Weinglass: If the court please, will the court indicate some admonition to Mr. Foran to my objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-27\">The Court: If it has offended you, I strike it, I direct the jury to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-28\">Mr. Weinglass: It didn\u2019t offend me. It violated the rules of evidence and Canon of Ethics 47 which prohibits such conduct which they have been engaging in all through this trial and which the court has countenanced. That is why I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-29\">Mr. Foran: Your Honor, the hyprocrisy of Mr. Weinglass\u2019 statement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-31\">The Court: I do strike the last statement or comment of Mr. Weinglass, and I direct the jury to disregard it, and direct you not to make such a statement again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-32\">Mr. Weinglass: I have read that Canon of Ethics, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-33\">Mr. Foran: \u2014is monumental.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-34\">Mr. Weinglass: I refer to the Canon of Ethics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-35\">The Court: Don\u2019t make that statement during this trial again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-36\">Mr. Weinglass: Well, it is true, and I stand by it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-37\">The Court: You did it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-38\">Mr. Weinglass: It involves the Canon of Judicial Ethics which indicates the court must admonish counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>when he refers personally to his adversary, and that hasn\u2019t been done on the Government\u2019s side.\u201d (Tr. 18,-056-18,057).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">On February 5, Mr. Weinglass once more defied openly the court\u2019s order to discontinue argument and be seated. The incident is reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\u201cMr. Weinglass: Your Honor, while Mr. Kunstler is examining the 3500 material, I would want at this time because I sincerely and honestly feel that the court realizes that its position with respect to the jailing of Dave Dellinger is indefensible in law\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">The Court: Don\u2019t speak for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">Mr. Weinglass: That is why I was cut off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">The Court: I will not hear you further on that motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">Mr. Weinglass: Well, your Honor, you are keeping a man in custody, and you are not permitting a lawyer to make an argument for his freedom. That is unheard of. That is unprecedented in law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">The Court: I have considered the matter carefully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">Mr. Weinglass: You have not considered it because you did not hear the argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-15\">The Court: I ask you to sit down, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-16\">Mr. Weinglass: Your Honor knows \u2014you cited cases \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-17\">The Court: I ask you to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-18\">Mr. Weinglass: \u2014that you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-19\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, will you ask that man to sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-20\">Mr. Weinglass: You have no authority for taking that man\u2019s freedom away, and you will not let me make a legal argument in his behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-21\">Mr. Schultz: That is disgraceful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-22\">Mr. Weinglass: That is disgraceful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-24\">Mr. Schultz: Because Mr. Wein-glass\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-27\">Mr. Weinglass: Because I was cut off in the middle of a legal argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-28\">Mr. Schultz: Because Mr. Wein-glass would not order his client to be quiet during the argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-30\">Mr. Weinglass: Because I wouldn\u2019t order Jerry Rubin to be quiet. If Dave Dellinger remains in jail, that is Mr. Schultz\u2019 concept of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-31\">The Court: Will you sit down, sir. Will you have him sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-32\">Mr. Weinglass: If that is the way it is going to apply in this courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-33\">The Court: Mr. Marshal, will you have him sit down.\u201d Tr. 19,811-13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adx\">Accordingly, I hereby adjudge Leonard I.

United States, 267 U.S. 517, 45 S.Ct. 390, 69 L.Ed. 767. <em>Cooke </em>was concerned with an indirect contempt by an attorney consisting of a prima facie contumacious letter requesting the judge to recuse himself in further cases involving the attorney\u2019s client. The Supreme Court unanimously held summary contempt procedure unwarranted in the case of this indirect contempt. (The decision antedated the advent of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.) However, the Court went further and directed that another judge be assigned to hear the contempt adjudication on remand since the attorney\u2019s conduct consisted of a personal attack on the trial judge. Significantly the <em>Sacher </em>majority did not discuss <em>Cooke, </em>ostensibly because it was pre-Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
