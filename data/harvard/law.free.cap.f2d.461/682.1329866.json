In granting the writ, the district court held: (1) the state judge who presided at Jackson\u2019s 1959 murder trial should have ordered, w <em>sponte, </em>that a hearing be held concerning Jackson\u2019s competency to stand trial; and (2) in this habeas proceeding Georgia failed to establish that Jackson was competent to stand trial on or near his trial date, July 30, 1959. Review of the record leads us to conclude that the court below was in error in its first holding. We reverse the judgment of the district court on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">I. <em>FACTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">In about mid-May, 1959, the petitioner-appellee, Wilburn Jackson, a black, thirty-two year old rural resident of near Temple, Haralson County, Georgia, following an argument with his wife, Louise Jackson, beat her severely with a claw hammer and a rifle butt. She died later the same day. Jackson buried his wife\u2019s body in a field together with linens stained with her blood.- A few days thereafter he ploughed the field where the body was and sowed it to field peas. Almost three weeks later, Jackson took a bottle of deodorizer and sprinkled its contents on the ground over his wife\u2019s body to prevent odor. The body was discovered and reported to authorities June 5, 1959. He gave Sheriff Allen of Haralson County a long statement that day. The statement, largely self-inculpatory was coherent and calm in tone, if not in content.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">The grand jury of Haralson County indicted Jackson for murder in the first degree, a capital offense. Two local attorneys, Robert A. Edwards and E. B. Jones, were appointed to represent him. His jury trial for murder began July 30, 1959, in the Haralson Superior Court before the Honorable W. A. Foster, Jr. The principal defense interposed in Jackson\u2019s behalf was that of temporary insanity at the time the alleged murder took place. The jury found Jackson guilty as charged with a recommendation of mercy. Because of the recommendation the trial judge imposed a life sentence. Following the imposition of sentence, Jackson\u2019s counsel moved for a new trial. This motion was withdrawn the next day. According to counsel, Jackson\u2019s avoidance of the death penalty constituted a victory which should not be jeopardized in a second trial. No appeal was taken from the judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-15\">It should be emphasized that never during the murder trial did counsel for Jackson claim that the accused was incompetent to stand trial. All the testimony introduced by the defense bearing upon Jackson\u2019s emotional and mental health was in support of a claim that Jackson was temporarily insane when he killed his wife. Because that testimony is crucially significant to our decision, in the light of Pate v. Robinson, 1966, 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815, and this Court\u2019s en banc ruling in Lee v. State of Alabama, 5 Cir. 1967, 386 F.2d 97, cert. denied 1969, 395 U.S. 927, 89 S.Ct. 1787, 23 L.Ed.2d 246, we set out pertinent excerpts verbatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">Mr. William Baskin, Jackson\u2019s brother-in-law called as a State witness in the murder trial, testified as follows on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-17\">\u201cQ Based on what you know from your observation of this boy over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the years, based on your knowledge of his actions and so forth, do you think he is sane or insane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">A I really don\u2019t hardly know how to answer that. I know he didn\u2019t act like average people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">Q Repeat your answer to the last question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">THE COURT: Ask the question again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">\u201cQ Based on your experience with Wilburn Jackson and your observation of him over the years, his actions, do you think he is sane or insane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">A Well, my answer was that I know he doesn\u2019t act normal, as normal people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">Q Can you testify whether he is sane or insane, do you have an opinion whether he is sane or insane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">Q What is your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-13\">A I would say he is insane.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">On re-direct examination Mr. Baskin testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-15\">\u201cQ From your observation of Wilburn Jackson over a period of years, tell this jury what your opinion is as to whether or not he knows right from wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-16\">A Yes, he knows right from wrong until at times when those spells come on him, then he doesn\u2019t seem to regard himself or anyone else, just plainly speaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-17\">Q Those spells, what do they appear to be, fits of temper or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-18\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-19\">Q From your observation is he a person with a violent temper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-20\">A At times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-21\">Q What kind of actions were there when you have seen him manifest that temper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-22\">A Well, probably he would be talking to his father or something, and something goes wrong, he is all to pieces, and the next time he would be just as fine as he could be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-24\">Q Tell us whether or not he just manifested those fits of temper when what was said was something he didn\u2019t like or what was done was something that didn\u2019t suit him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-25\">A Well, there wasn\u2019t too many of these spells when I was around, but I would just hear them talk, probably I would be in my room and wouldn\u2019t be paying any attention and I would hear him blow up all over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-26\">Q When he would blow up what would he do, argue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-27\">A Yes, arguing and walking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADJ\">Sheriff L. P. Allen, a witness for the State, testified on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKb\">\u201cQ Sheriff Allen, how long have you known the defendant, Wilburn Jackson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-28\">A I don\u2019t know just exactly, several years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-29\">Q Did you know him when he ran a cafe down there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-30\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-31\">Q Had you seen him on many occasions ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-32\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-33\">Q Between that time and the time that this occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-34\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-35\">Q Did you talk to him on those occasions ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-36\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-37\">Q Did you observe his conversation and actions on those occasions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-38\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-39\">Q How long were you with him and when did you first see him after the body of Louise Jackson was found ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-40\">A I don\u2019t know exactly, it must have been around 10 o\u2019clock, it was some time that morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Q And how long were you with him that day? Just tell us the number of occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">A I was with him a short time at that time, then later on in the day I came back out here to the jail and then I was with him until at least 10 o\u2019clock that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">Q During those times was that when the written statement that you read this morning was taken ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">A Yes, and afterwards, I was with him several hours after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">Q Did you go to his father\u2019s house when he finally signed the statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">A I was present when he signed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">Q During all of that time, and during the time that you knew him, prior to this, did you form any opinion as to whether he was sane or insane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">A He was sane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">Q Did you form an opinion, or is there no doubt in your mind that he knew right from wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-13\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-14\">Q In your opinion did he positively know right from wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-15\">A i am sure he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">On cross-examination Sheriff Allen testified :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-17\">\u201cQ You haven\u2019t been around this man a great deal, have you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-18\">A I have been around him several times, E.B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-19\">Q Mr. Allen, if someone wouldn\u2019t eat food until they had someone to taste it, would that be out of the ordinary, in your opinion, every time I sat down to the table I wouldn\u2019t eat until it was tasted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-20\">A That would be a little out of the ordinary for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-21\">Q If someone continuously lived in his past instead of looking at the present and the future, would you consider that out of the ordinary ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-22\">A I guess it would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adq\">Q If someone flies into what we call a rage, and started beating on the walls with his hand and fist without any apparent reason, would that be out of the ordinary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-24\">A You want my opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-25\">Q Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-26\">A It would be just mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-27\">Q Even though he had no reason to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-28\">A That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-29\">The following testimony was given by Sheriff Allen on re-direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajn-dedup-0\">\u201cQ Sheriff, in arriving at your conclusion that he knew right from wrong, was there any statement made to you after the giving of this written statement by Wilburn Jackson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-30\">A Yes, when we left the house we came back by Temple and stopped there a while and went from there to Carrollton to the undertaker\u2019s, and Wilburn told me he was proud it was over with, proud that we found it out, he hadn\u2019t slept three hours at a time, he was glad it was over with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-31\">Q He seemed to be relieved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-32\">A Yes, he seemed more alive after he signed the statement and all. We went to the undertaking parlor at Carrollton and then back to the jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-33\">The principal witness at the trial on the question of Jackson\u2019s mental condition was Dr. Thomas Leland, who testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY9\">\u201cQ You are Dr. Thomas Leland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-34\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-35\">Q Where do you live, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-36\">A Atlanta, Georgia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-37\">Q Are you an M.D.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-38\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-39\">Q Are you also what we commonly call a psychiatrist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-40\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Q Doctor, will you tell the jury where you received your medical and psychiatric training?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\">A I graduated from Emory University School of Medicine in 1953. After my internship I spent two years in psychiatry at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Washington, D. C., and one year after that at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. I spent two years in psychiatry at the Naval Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, and entered private practice in psychiatry in July of this year, in Atlanta, Georgia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">Q What is the name of the place in which you are now practicing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">A I am now practicing at the Atlanta Psychiatric Clinic on 2905 Peachtree Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">Q Doctor, were you called in the case of The State versus Wilburn Jackson, who is charged with the offense of murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">Q Have you had occasion to examine Wilburn Jackson, the defendant in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">Q When did you first examine him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">A I examined him on three occasions, the first being last Friday, the 24th of this month. I saw him again on Monday and on Wednesday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">Q How long were you able to examine him on each occasion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">A On the first occasion I examined him approximately three and a half hours, the second time, very privately, thirty minutes and again yesterday fifteen or twenty minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-14\">Q Now, Doctor, is this an ideal period of time to examine a patient for the purpose of determining his mental condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\">A In most instances, yes, on borderline cases, where there is some evidence of abnormality we usually spend quite a variable amount of time. Usually an hour is the time allotted to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-17\">Q In other words, if it is just a matter of black and white, whether he is sane or insane, one hour would be sufficient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-18\">A That is the clinical time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-19\">Q What did you find in this case, was this a case of black and white ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-20\">A No, this was not a case of out- and-out psychosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-21\">Q Now, Doctor, in this case, it being what you call a border-line case, did you also have to take other matters into consideration besides your own examination of the patient suffer illness or circumstances surrounding him ? (sic)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-22\">A I had to talk to his family and other features involved in the case for his history, and also examine documents as to his past medical history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-23\">Q Did you find any documents or documents having any bearing on his past medical history ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-24\">A Yes, I saw a photostat of his medical discharge, a letter accompanying his medical discharge from the army in 1946, that he suffered from a mental illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-25\">Q I will ask you, if I may interrupt, I hand you an original letter and a photostat and ask you if that photostat is the one you examined and if that is a photostat of the original letter which I have just handed to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-26\">A Yes, both are the documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-27\">Q Is that the letter that you have referred to from the army?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-28\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-29\">Q What did you discover from that letter, regarding his mental condition at that time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-30\">A This is essentially a letter concerning the accused, dated March 1946, and of interest to me was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the statement that he had been admitted to the hospital while in the army, and- was diagnosed as having a pyschosis, schizophrenic reaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">Q What is schizophrenic reaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">A It is a psychiatric condition due to some mental illness, typically suffering from disease and hallucinations, which is usually hearing voices and seeing imaginary visions or delusions, delusions meaning false beliefs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">Q Now, Dr. Leland, I will ask you if a patient or a person was concerned about someone poisoning him, or poisoning his food, would that be a symptom of schizophrenia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">A If it is a false belief, if it was persistent, for instance if he talked about it repeatedly, if it was a persistent belief, a false belief, to the extent that it affected his behaviour, for example if he refused to eat food unless it was tested, that would be an example of delusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">Q Now, Doctor, if a person were suffering from psychosis, schizophrenic reaction, in 1956, (sic) could that condition persist on indefinitely ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-11\">A It could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-12\">Q Could that patient have periods of lucid intervals in which his mind seemed fairly clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-13\">A Yes, frequently he could seem almost normal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-14\">Q Could he carry on normal activities, the activities of a normal person ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-15\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-16\">Q Now, Dr. Leland, I will ask you if you, in conjunction with myself, made any effort to secure the army or the Veterans Administration papers of this man ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-17\">A Yes, an effort has been made to locate the records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\">Q Do you know whether we have been able to secure those records or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-18\">A We have not, I have not seen his records except the photostat here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-19\">Q I believe you testified that you first came into this case just last Friday, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-20\">A That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-21\">Q Does this give you a fair opportunity to thoroughly evaluate a patient of this sort?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-22\">A Yes, I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-23\">Q Now, Doctor, from your examination of this man, is he mentally well or ill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-24\">A At the present time he is mentally ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-25\">Q And do you think that his condition will get any better or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-26\">A I don\u2019t know for sure. However, I expect that his condition will get worse instead of better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-27\">Q Does that mean that he might eventually have to be committed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-28\">SOL.-GEN.: I object to that, if the court please\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-29\">THE COURT: Let him state it without leading, if that\u2019s what you are objecting to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-30\">SOL.-GEN.: I object further to the speculation about his future mental condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-31\">THE COURT: I think the doctor is qualified to go into that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-32\">Q Will you answer the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-33\">A I feel that there is a likelihood that this defendant will continue to show mental symptoms which will get worse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-34\">Q I will ask you, Doctor, if a person might know the difference between right and wrong and at the same time suffer a delusional insanity I believe the law calls it, as to one particular act or subject?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-35\">A Yes, that is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Q Will you describe to the jury how that works?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">A I can give you an example. For instance, a patient who has a religious fanaticism, who greets you on the street corner with the evils of murder, or who preaches right and wrong, under a delusion that someone was following him which would be false, an incorrect belief, he might turn around and shoot him. This would be an example of a person who knew technical right from wrong but who, because of his illness, might go against those beliefs temporarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">Q Now, Doctor, I will ask you a hypothetical question. Suppose that a man\u2019s wife had gone away for some two or three months, and left him with a small baby which was ill, and he had heard during that time that she was running around or had been with other men, and if he were mentally ill, could that fact brood on his mind or dwell on his mind until he would become a victim of delusional insanity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">A Not unless he were mentally ill, and then he might be unpredictable. I could not predict whether this would become a delusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">Q I say, it could happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">A It could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">Q And he could then culminate that brooding and so forth by becoming unmanageable and doing harm to the person that he felt had wronged him, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">A Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">The State\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Leland proceeded in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-12\">\u201cQ Doctor in arriving at your conclusion about this defendant, Wilburn Jackson, you told Mr. Edwards I believe that it was necessary for you to obtain information and talk to other people, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-15\">Q It really was absolutely necessary, in analyzing the man, was it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-16\">A Yes, it was more than helpful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-17\">Q You talked to William Baskin, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-18\">A Yes, that\u2019s the brother-in-law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-19\">Q You also talked to Will Jackson, his father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-20\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-21\">Q And you also talked to Sallie Kate Baskin, Wilburn\u2019s sister?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-22\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-23\">Q Now, did you go into detail with them about his past history, or ask them to tell you everything significant about his past conduct generally, all those three?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-24\">A Only to a limited extent, I probed only about his procedure in recent months prior to the alleged murder, and also general questions about what sort of mental condition he might have had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-25\">Q In other words, you were only asking them about things which you felt would be helpful in determining his sanity at the time of the crime, and also his sanity at the present time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-26\">A Yes, that\u2019s what I was looking for, and in a sense he volunteered what other things I got.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-27\">Q You didn\u2019t stop them from telling you, try to stop them from telling you anything that they wanted to about his past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-28\">A That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-29\">Q Now, I would like to ask you if a man who was having trouble with his wife or actually had information that his wife had been with some other man, or men, had actual information of that, that would not be a delusion, would it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-30\">A No, that would be a fact, of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Q And if he was mad at her because of that, he would be mad at her because of something she had done, wouldn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">Q And he would not be mad at her because of something that he thought she had done, is that right ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">Q So, if as the basis for killing her he used the fact that she had run around with a man, and that was a fact that he knew, he would not be killing her because of any delusion, would he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-9\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">Q Now, an individual, speaking generally, a person who did not know right from wrong would not ordinarily try to conceal or hide a crime, would they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-11\">A That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-12\">Q They would not try to get away with it, hide the body, would they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-13\">A That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-14\">Q Now, it boils down to the present condition of this man, after studying him, I want to ask you simply this, you did reach the conclution that he was able to stand trial, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-15\">A Yes, at this time I think he is able to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-16\">Q Now, I will ask you this question. Based upon everything which you used in forming any opinion about Wilburn Jackson, any of the facts which his relatives gave you about his condition at the time of the killing, based on anything that he told you, did you form an opinion as to whether or not he knew right from wrong at the time of the killing ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-17\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-18\">Q And in your opinion did he know right from wrong at the time of the killing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-19\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-3\">Q He did know right from wrong, is that your answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-20\">A Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-21\">Defense counsel elicited the following responses from the witness on re-direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-22\">\u201cQ Now, Doctor, if a man as I described before, his wife has been gone for some period of time against his will, left him with a small baby, he had heard that she was going around with other men, could he not brood over that, if he was mentally ill, and blow that thing up all out of proportion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-23\">A Yes, that is quite true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-24\">Q And commit a crime as a result, is that so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-25\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-26\">Q I will ask you further, is it normal for a man, when he has committed a crime, even though he does bury the body, to bury it in a very shallow grave ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-27\">A First of all, it is not normal for a man to commit a crime, but as to your specific question I don\u2019t know whether the depth of the grave tells me anything about his mental condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-28\">Q I will ask you would it indicate a normal mind to take a bottle of Arrowick and sprinkle it over a grave to try to cover up the odor of the body ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-29\">A It would depend on whether the odor was a delusion or a fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-30\">Q. What do you mean by that answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-31\">A In other words, if there was an odor it would not be irrational. If there wasn\u2019t an odor, then of course it would be a delusion. I don\u2019t know which was the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-32\">Q I will ask you further is it rational or normal for a man, after he has buried the body, to take some person and show them where the body is buried and threaten them not to tell it, or threaten them if they do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>tell it, would that be a normal reaction of a man to do that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\">A I don\u2019t know, it would depend entirely on the relationship of the person to the other, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The Solicitor-General again cross-examined Dr. Leland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\u201cQ In connection with that last question, tied in with the fact that a person knew right from wrong, if he tried to conceal the crime and conceal the body would that be consistent with his knowing right from wrong if he threatened anyone else that told about the crime ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">A That would seem consistent with his knowledge of right and wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Jackson\u2019s counsel, on re-direct examination, inquired into the defendant\u2019s ability to stand trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">\u201cQ You testified a while ago that you felt that the defendant was able to stand trial at this time. I will ask you in your opinion is he fully able to cooperate in his own defense ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">A. No, he isn\u2019t, he is able to stand trial at this time, but he is still suffering from some mental illness. I feel this, I feel that he is able to understand the nature of the charges against him, and he is able to understand the proceedings that are going on at this time; however, he has shown to me repeatedly that he has some difficulty in relation to certain circumstances of the crime, in remembering minute details of the crime, in cooperating fully in the ease, also some of the tests that I gave him show some evidence of mental retardation, his intelligence seems low. This of course is permanent, it will never change, and to that extent he is also unable to cooperate fully, he doesn\u2019t have full mental capacity at this time, but sufficient to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\">Q Was he ever able to relate to you or did he ever relate to you the crime with which he is charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">A No, only in response to detailed questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-13\">Q Did you ever get a thorough picture of the crime in talking to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-14\">A Absolutely not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">The examination of Dr. Leland concluded with the following questions from the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-16\">\u201cQ You did say that he had a low I.Q., is that more or less the substance of what you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-17\">A Yes, I didn\u2019t actually say his I.Q., but generally yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-18\">Q Would the fact that he has been in jail for some time affect this finding and would it affect his mental condition leading up to this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-19\">A Confinement of any duration would not affect his intelligence at all, but it would affect his mental condition, his cooperativeness and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-20\">Q In your opinion has that affected his mental condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-21\">A To some extent, not just being in jail, but standing trial, knowing the trial was coming, all those factors had some influence on his mental condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-22\">Q In his reluctance to talk to you and in his accounts to you, is there a possibility that he is what we call malingering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-23\">A Malingering or faking is a possibility here; however, malingering is usually of a higher intelligence than believe this man is, and usually has had some experience in mental illness previously. Most malingerers state their symptoms and over-do it. It is usually quite simple to detect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-24\">Q You have not ruled out the possibility of malingering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-25\">A Not completely, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-26\">Q Is there any question in your mind or did you receive any information that would put any real doubt in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>your mind that he knew right from wrong at the time of the killing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">A I have no evidence, hearsay or oth-wise, that would make me believe that he was unable to distinguish right from wrong at the time. I believe he was in a lucid interval at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Following the receipt of this testimony, the state trial judge did not, <em>sna sponte, </em>convene a separate proceeding designed to inquire into the competency of the defendant to stand trial. No request, not even a suggestion was made that such a proceeding was necessary or desirable. Almost twelve years later, the court below ruled in this proceeding that the trial judge\u2019s failure to order such a proceeding constituted a deprivation of Due Process of Law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">\u201cIn the instant case, the testimony of lay witnesses at the state trial indicated petitioner was not normal. The psychiatrist who examined petitioner testified in contradictory terms. However, the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony at the very least indicates petitioner was not able to recall some of the details surrounding the commission of the alleged crime. The argument of petitioner\u2019s defense attorney relating to the introduction into evidence of a letter from the United States Army suggested petitioner might have been suffering some disability. Clearly, under all of these circumstances, <em>Pate </em>requires that the state trial judge conduct a hearing on petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The lower court afforded the State an opportunity to establish that Jackson was competent to stand trial for murder on or about July 30, 1959. At the conclusion of additional hearings, during which Dr. Leland was called to testify for the State, the court below found that the State had failed to prove that Jackson was competent to stand trial in 1959. Consequently, the district court ordered Jackson delivered to the authorities of Haralson County, Georgia, to be retried within four months if found to be competent. It was directed that if found to be incompetent, Jackson should be retried when he regained sufficient competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">The test for determining a criminal defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial was succinctly set forth in Dusky v. United States, 1960, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824, reversing 271 F.2d 385, 8 Cir. 1959. Dusky was convicted of the unlawful transportation in interstate commerce of a girl who had been kidnapped. Title 18, U.S.C., Section 1201. The Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and agreed with the Solicitor General\u2019s suggestion of error that the record insufficiently supported the trial judge\u2019s finding of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. The Court directed the Court of Appeals to remand the case to the district court for a further competency hearing, continuing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-12\">\u201cWe also agree with the suggestion of the Solicitor General that it is not enough for the district judge to find that \u2018the defendant [is] oriented to time and place and [has] some recollection of events,\u2019 but that the \u2018test must be whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding- \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019\u201d 362 U.S. at 402, 80 S.Ct. at 788, 4 L.Ed.2d at 825.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">1966 brought the landmark decision of Pate v. Robinson, supra. In 1959 Robinson had been convicted in Illinois state courts of the murder of his common-law wife and had been sentenced to imprisonment for life. Throughout the state proceedings, Robinson\u2019s counsel insisted that his client\u2019s sanity was very much in issue. Evidence was introduced at trial bearing upon Robinson\u2019s long history of disturbed behavior, including his previous commitment to a mental institution and his service of four years in prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>for the killing of his eighteen month old son. In a subsequent federal habeas corpus proceeding, the district court denied relief, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. United States ex rel. Robinson v. Pate, 345 F.2d 691 (1965). The Supreme Court granted certiorari and held: that Robinson had not waived his defense of incompetency to stand trial, that the evidence introduced at the state trial entitled him to a separate hearing on the competency issue, and that the state trial court\u2019s failure to make such an inquiry deprived Robinson of his constitutional right to a fair trial. The Court\u2019s language was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\">\u201cWe believe that the evidence introduced on Robinson\u2019s behalf entitled him to a hearing on this issue. The court's failure to make such inquiry thus deprived Robinson of his constitutional right to a fair trial. . Illinois jealously guards this right. Where the evidence raises a <em>\u2018bona fide </em>doubt\u2019 as to a defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, the judge on his own motion must impanel a jury and conduct a sanity hearing pursuant to III. Rev.Stat., c. 38, \u00a7 104-2 (1963) . ..\u201d 383 U.S. at 385, 86 S.Ct. at 842, 15 L.Ed.2d at 822.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The Court declined to permit Illinois the opportunity to prove in a further proceeding that Robinson had been competent to stand trial in 1959:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">\u201cIt has been pressed upon us that it would be sufficient for the state court to hold a limited hearing as to Robinson\u2019s mental competence at the time he was tried in 1959. If he were found competent, the judgment against him would stand. But we have previously emphasized the difficulty of retrospectively determining an accused\u2019s competence to stand trial. Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960). The jury would not be able to observe the subject of their inquiry, and expert witnesses would have to testify solely from information contained in the printed record. That Robinson\u2019s hearing would be held six years after the fact aggravates these difficulties. ...\u201d 383 U.S. at 387, 86 S.Ct. at 843, 15 L.Ed.2d at 823.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Illinois was given the option of retrying Robinson within a reasonable time or releasing him from custody. In the event of a retrial, Robinson would be entitled to raise the defense of incompetency to stand trial and to have a hearing on that issue should \u201ca sufficient doubt\u201d exist as to his present competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">We had occasion, sitting en banc, to implement Pate v. Robinson in Lee v. State of Alabama, supra. Lee was arrested and charged with the murder of his father on July 6, 1942. On July 20, 1942, a sanity jury found him sane and he was indicted on October 20, 1942. The defendant was hospitalized in a mental institution from October 24, 1942, until August 3, 1943. On October 1, 1943, Lee pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the murder indictment. He was tried on October 27, 1943, found guilty,i and sentenced to life imprisonment. His direct appeal from the judgment and sentence was unsuccessful. It did not raise the issue of competency to stand trial. After numerous unsuccessful habeas and coram nobis petitions and appeals raising the question of his competency to stand trial as well as other grounds, addressed to both the state and the federal courts, over a period of more than twenty years, Lee still persisted. The issue of his mental competency to stand trial was again presented to a panel of this Court by appeal from an adverse ruling of the district court in 1966. That panel affirmed, Lee v. State of Alabama, 5 Cir. 1966, 364 F.2d 945. Motion for rehearing was denied per curiam, Lee v. State of Alabama, 5 Cir. 1967, 373 F.2d 82, with Judge Thornberry dissenting by separate opinion, 373 F.2d at page 84. The thrust of Judge Thornberry\u2019s dissent was that Pate v. Robinson, supra, had not been given its proper weight in the panel decision. Lee then sought rehearing' en banc which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>This Court en banc decided that Lee\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated by reason of the Alabama trial court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing at the time of trial, in addition to the hearing 15 months earlier, concerning Lee\u2019s competency to stand trial. We remanded with directions to the district court to afford Alabama an opportunity to demonstrate that there had been an actual determination of Lee\u2019s mental capacity at or about the time of trial and, in default of such a showing, to determine whether the district court could then conduct an adequate hearing on the question of Lee\u2019s competency. It was directed that if the district court found it could not adequately hold such a hearing, it should remand to the state court with directions to set aside the conviction and grant a new trial, which would include an adequate hearing on Lee\u2019s then mental capacity to stand trial. The following passage from our <em>Lee </em>opinion is worthy of note here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">\u201cWe, therefore, must now come to the second basis of the earlier denial of relief, that is the issue of whether the hearing authorized and held under Section 428, of Title 15, of the Alabama Code of 1940, fifteen months before Lee was actually put on trial for his life, at which the jury made a finding that Lee was \u2018sane\u2019, without more, sufficiently meets <em>the requirement that when a prisoner, either state or federal, seeking post-conviction relief, asserts, with substantial facts to back up his allegation, that at the time of the trial he was not mentally competent to stand trial, and that there was no resolution of that precise issue before he was tried, convicted and sentenced, the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution requires that such conviction and sentence be set aside unless upon adequate hearing it is shown that he was mentally competent to stand trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied) 386 F.2d at 105. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Following our decision in <em>Lee, </em>supra, we have several times considered claims by state prisoners that their convictions had been obtained in violation of Pate v. Robinson. The essential nature of the issue presented has required us to decide each case on its own facts and circumstances. See, e. g., Tyler v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 993, cert. denied 1969, 393 U.S. 1030, 89 S.Ct. 642, 21 L.Ed.2d 574; Clark v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1969, 415 F.2d 71, and Carroll v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1970, 421 F.2d 1065. We undertake such an individualized analysis in the ease now at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">As already noted, the state trial judge heard testimony from three witnesses bearing upon the mental condition of Wilburn Jackson. Mr. Baskin, Jackson\u2019s brother-in-law, related that Jackson was subject to fits of anger, particularly when confronted with disagreeable situations, but behaved normally between such episodes. Sheriff Allen, who obtained a confession from Jackson, told of Jackson\u2019s apparent sense of relief upon the discovery of his wife\u2019s body and the giving of the written inculpatory statement to the authorities. Despite Dr. Leland\u2019s trial testimony that Jackson was mentally ill, he stated at several points in his testimony that Jackson was competent to stand trial for the murder of his wife. According to Dr. Leland, the difficulties which Jackson was experiencing in communicating the detailed facts of his wife\u2019s murder were probably attributable to mental retardation, an irreversible condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">In order to keep our inquiry in focus, we repeat that Jackson\u2019s counsel did not raise any question of competency to stand trial. Mental condition at the time of the offense was their sole concern. We are unwilling to hold under the facts as they came out in the 1959 trial for murder that the state trial judge violated Jackson\u2019s constitutional rights by failing to order, <em>sua sponte, </em>that a separate proceeding be initiated to inquire into the accused\u2019s competency to stand trial. The evidence presented to the state judge did not raise a <em>\u201cbona fide </em>doubt\u201d as to Jackson\u2019s competency to stand trial, as the concept of competency was articulated in <em>Dusky, </em>supra, and implemented in Pate v. Robinson, supra, and our en banc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>decision in Lee v. State of Alabama, supra. The district court misunderstood and misapplied the controlling precedents in deciding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Because we determine that the district court erred in ruling that the state judge who presided at Jackson\u2019s 1959 murder trial should have ordered, <em>sua sponte, </em>that a hearing be held concerning Jackson\u2019s competency to stand trial, we find it unnecessary to decide the further issue presented: whether the State of Georgia in this habeas corpus proceeding failed to establish that Jackson was competent to stand trial on or about July 30, 1959, the date of his murder trial. The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the petition for the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
