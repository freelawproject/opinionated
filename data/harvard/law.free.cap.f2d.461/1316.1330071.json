Wood with directions to make findings of fact and recommendation for conclusions of law under the order of reference and Rule 134(h). The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on October 29, 1970. Exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s opinion, findings of fact and recommended conclusion of law were filed by plaintiffs, defendant moved that the court adopt the commissioner\u2019s report and the case has been submitted to the court on oral argument of counsel and the briefs of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">Since the court agrees with the commissioner\u2019s opinion, findings of fact and recommended conclusion of law, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby adopts the same as the basis for its judgment in these cases. Therefore, plaintiffs are not entitled to recover and their petitions are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-13\">OPINION OF COMMISSIONER</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-14\">WOOD, Commissioner:</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">Plaintiffs in these cases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> were, throughout all or part of the period here material,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ungraded vessel employees of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, Department of the Interior, employed as engineers aboard the <em>Delaware </em>or <em>Albatross IV,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>with home ports of Gloucester and Woods Hole, Massachusetts, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-16\">Both vessels were employed in aid of the commercial fishing industry, primarily in New England waters, during the relevant period. The <em>Delaware, </em>a converted fishing vessel built in 1938, was an exploratory fishing and gear research vessel employed, <em>inter alia, </em>in testing experimental fishing gear and in fishing for research purposes; fishing was the main activity aboard the vessel during a cruise. The <em>Albatross IV, </em>built in 1962, was specially designed to, and did, conduct fisheries and oceanographic research. See findings 7, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-17\">Section 202(8) of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 954, 955, as amended, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1082(8) (1964),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provided in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-18\">This Act [Classification Act of 1949] * * * shall not apply to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY7\">* <em>* </em>* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-20\">(8) officers and members of crews of vessels, whose compensation shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>fixed and adjusted from time to time as nearly as is consistent with the public interest in accordance with prevailing rates and practices in the maritime industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">That plaintiffs were within the purview of Section 202(8) is admitted; at issue is defendant\u2019s treatment of them under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">Throughout the period here relevant, authority to approve wage rates for plaintiffs was vested in the Regional Director, Region 3, Bureau of Commercial Fisheries; the determination of such wage rates in the first instance (subject to approval) was made by the \u201cRegion 3 Wage Board\u201d, composed of a chairman, two members, and two alternate members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">In findings 16-23, Wage Board practices and procedures in setting wage rates for plaintiffs prior to and throughout the period here material are detailed at some length. With some variants in formula from year to year, plaintiffs\u2019 compensation for hours worked at sea was essentially derived from the average hourly earnings of commercial fishermen in the large (17-man) otter trawler fleet operating out of Boston, Massachusetts, applied to the number of days estimated to be worked at sea by plaintiffs, utilizing a 12-hour workday for each such day. Other factors, noted in the findings, were utilized to adjust the \u201cbasic fisherman\u2019s sea pay\u201d in order to arrive at annual compensation for plaintiffs\u2019 work at sea.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">At least during the 1960-1965 period, there was no such thing as overtime in the commercial fishing industry. Engineers employed aboard a large Boston otter trawler were compensated on the basis of a \u201cshare\u201d of a percentage of the proceeds of the catch<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plus a \u201cbonus\u201d for each fishing trip, and were paid no \u201covertime\u201d compensation for any hours worked at sea. Finding 25(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-15\">Since, insofar as hours at sea are concerned, wage rate schedules for plaintiffs were derived from earnings of Boston otter trawler crew members, these wage rate schedules in turn reflected no element of overtime compensation for work at sea in excess of 8 hours per weekday or 40 hours a week, nor for hours worked on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cnormal\u201d workday at sea was not less than 8 nor more than 12 hours, and they in fact worked at sea up to 12 hours per day prior to December 17, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-16\">Generally speaking, during part or all of the period here material, engineers serving at sea aboard commercial dry cargo and tanker vessels, at least some oceanographic research vessels operated by private industry, and vessels operated by the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), Department of the Navy, were paid premium or overtime compensation for work in excess of 8 hours per weekday or 40 hours per week, or for work on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-17\">In the circumstances noted hereinabove, plaintiffs were not. The essence of their complaint is that in utilizing the commercial fishing industry, and in failing to select \u201cthe commercial offshore, dry cargo and tanker industry,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as \u201cthe maritime industry\u201d for Section 202(8) purposes, defendant acted unlawfully, arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably. Accordingly, they assert, they are entitled to recover overtime compensation for all hours of work performed at sea in excess of 8 hours per weekday or 40 hours per week, and for all hours worked on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>For reasons hereinafter set forth, it is concluded that plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">One of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions is that defendant \u201cviolated [Section] 202(8) * * * in setting the marine engineer plaintiffs\u2019 wages in accordance with a hybrid standard pay formula based on the earnings on the 17-man fishing trawler industry sailing out of Boston, Massachusetts harbor.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs assert that, under Ayres v. United States, 186 Ct.Cl. 350 (1968), a \u201cshowing of prevailing maritime industry practices in situations comparable to their own\u201d will entitle them to prevail. And, they urge, a comparison of the elements of plaintiffs\u2019 employment with (a) the commercial fishing industry, and (b) the \u201ccommercial dry cargo and tanker industry as well as the private oceanographic research industry and with other [vessel-operating government] agencies\u201d, proves clearly a violation of Section 202(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-8\">In Daniels v. United States, 407 F.2d 1345, 187 Ct.Cl. 38 (1969), involving a' similar claim, the court reaffirmed that Section 202(8) embodies a broad congressional grant of administrative discretion, with a concomitant limited scope of judicial review. \u201cOur concern\u201d, the court held, \u201cis simply to determine whether plaintiffs have met their heavy burden of proving that the Secretary\u2019s action in this instance was so arbitrary as to be clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>407 F.2d at 1347, 187 Ct.Cl. at 42. It is unnecessary to consider whether or not, in light of <em>Daniels, </em>plaintiffs read <em>Ayers </em>rightly. That they have failed to make the evi-dentiary showing they avow is disposi-tive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-9\">Plaintiffs allege great differences between engineers aboard the <em>Albatross IV </em>and the <em>Delaware </em>and engineers aboard a Boston otter trawler; conversely, they would substantially equate engineers aboard the vessels in suit with those in the commercial dry cargo and tanker industry (and, to a lesser degree, the private oceanographic research industry and other vessel-operating government agencies). The \u201cnumerous comparisons\u201d proffered include duties, equipment responsibilities, nature of missions, education and training experience, \u201cwages, hours and compensation\u201d and \u201cprevailing rates and practices regarding payment of overtime or premium pay\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1386-14\">To the extent permitted by the record, each of these factors is treated in the findings; what there appears will not be repeated here. For present purposes, it suffices to hold there is an absence of proof that in terms of duties, responsibilities, working conditions, character of work, or otherwise, plaintiffs were in any significant manner \u201ccomparable\u201d to engineers aboard commercial dry cargo or tanker vessels, oceanographic research vessels operated by private industry, or vessels operated by other government agencies. Ayres v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1386-15\">Research vessels operated in aid of the commercial fishing industry are obviously not commercial fishing vessels.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Manifestly, there were some differences, in terms of duties, responsibilities, working conditions, character of work, and the like, between engineers aboard the <em>Albatross IV </em>at sea and engineers aboard large Boston otter trawlers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On this record, however, it cannot be concluded that in determining that plaintiffs\u2019 wages should be fixed in accordance with prevailing rates and practices in the commercial fishing industry, the Secretary violated Section 202(8). Daniels v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Ayres v. United States, supra; Abbott v. United States, 151 F.Supp. 929, 932, 138 Ct.Cl. 459, 463 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>In so holding, due consideration has been given to two subsidiary contentions: an asserted admission by defendant that the practices employed throughout the period here material were unlawful,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that \u201cthe maritime industry\u201d, for Section 202(8) purposes, is the \u201ccommercial off-shore, dry cargo and tanker industry * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">Following December 17, 1965, plaintiffs have been compensated on the basis of wage rates negotiated with their \u201cexclusive representative\u201d under Executive Order No. 10988, Employee-Management Cooperation in the Federal Service, January 17, 1962, 27 Fed.Reg. 551.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the first such agreement, in 1965, the practice of no overtime for work at sea, regardless of hours actually worked, was in essence continued. Finding 24(c). There was no waiver of any legal rights or actions, all such rights and actions being specifically reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 admission argument flows, not from the 1965 agreement, but from one by which plaintiffs assert defendant \u201cagreed [in 1968] that the prevailing rates and practices of the maritime industry <em>did not </em>include the fishing industry * * *, but were to be based on the prevailing rates and practices in the commercial dry cargo and tanker industry * * <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The absence of proof that there was an adoption of prevailing rates and practices of the dry cargo and tanker industry aside, the 1968 agreement would no more amount to an \u201cadmission\u201d by defendant of the illegality of pre-1965 practices than the 1965 one would amount to recognition by plaintiffs of their legality. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on a post-1965 admission is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention respecting the meaning of \u201cthe maritime industry\u201d has as its foundation language in House Report No. 2200, 89th Congress, 2d Session,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to accompany the bill which ultimately became Public Law No. 89-747, 80 Stat. 1179, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6305 (Supp. V, 1965-69).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-13\">Public Law No. 89-747 accords government officers or crew members aboard any \u201coceangoing vessel on an extended voyage\u201d, including plaintiffs, leave of absence without regard to other leave authorized by \u201cthis subchapter.\u201d Findings 37(a), (b). That an allusion, in House Report No. 2200, to \u201cthe maritime industry\u201d means the \u201ccommercial off-shore, dry cargo and tanker industry\u201d, as plaintiffs assert, is far from clear. In any event, however, plaintiffs\u2019 assumption that \u201cthe maritime industry\u201d, for Section 202(8) purposes, could have only that same meaning is not a tenable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-14\">Section 202(8) and Public Law No. 89-747 were enacted at different times, and deal with different matters: the one compensation for officers and members of crews of vessels, to be fixed \u201cas nearly as is consistent with the public interest in accordance with prevailing rates and practices in the maritime industry,\u201d and the other leave benefits for officers and crew members aboard oceangoing vessels on an extended voyage. Nothing in the cited legislative history of Public Law No. 89-747 justifies adding to Section 202(8) words not included therein by Congress when it wrote the law in 1949, or thereafter. United States v. An Article of Drug Bacto-Unidisk, 394 U.S. 784, 800-801, 89 S.Ct. 1410, 22 L.Ed.2d 726 (1969); 62 Cases of Jam v. United States, 340 U.S. 593, 600-601, 71 S.Ct. 515, 95 L.Ed. 566 (1951). And, plaintiffs proffer no leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>islative history of Section 202(8) itself to buttress their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">It is to be remembered, in assaying this aspect of the matter, that the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one. Waterman Steamship Corp. v. United States, 381 U.S. 252, 269, 85 S.Ct. 1389, 14 L.Ed.2d 370 (1965); United States v. Wise, 370 U.S. 405, 82 S.Ct. 1354, 8 L.Ed.2d 590 (1962); <em>compare </em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 395 U.S. 367, 380-381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969). Nothing in the record or plaintiffs\u2019 briefs supports the view that, in utilizing the commercial fishing industry for Section 202(8) purposes defendant thereby exceeded the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-6\">Plaintiffs also contend vigorously that \u201cthe Wage Board set their wages in an arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable manner in violation of [Section] 202(8) * <em>* </em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This contention has two main facets: the essence of the first is that because of inadequate knowledge and experience, the chairman of the Wage Board throughout the period here material was unable to, and did not, \u201ccompare\u201d plaintiffs with reasonably comparable services in the maritime field; of the second, that the Wage Board itself \u201cmade no attempt to compare.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-8\">It is perhaps a complete answer that the record does not justify plaintiffs\u2019 view of comparable services. Section II, <em>supra. </em>There is a failure of proof that any reasonably comparable services in the maritime industry were not considered by the Wage Board. Thus, the argument that plaintiffs\u2019 pay was fixed and adjusted without examination of the \u201cfunctions, duties, and pay structures of <em>all pertinent classes </em>* * * in Government service and outside it\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> would seem to be blunted. There are, however, other flaws in plaintiffs\u2019 position in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-17\">Because Section 202(8) contains a broad congressional grant of administrative discretion, it imposes heavy administrative duties and responsibilities. In committing to the Secretary the task of wage-fixing for vessel employees Congress conferred upon him \u201cthe duty of setting a fair and competitive wage.\u201d See Abbott v. United States, <em>supra, </em>151 F.Supp. at 932, 138 Ct.Cl. at 463. Discharge of that duty, by a determination of compensation \u201cas nearly as is consistent with the public interest in accordance with prevailing rates and practices in the maritime industry,\u201d presupposes appropriate knowledge and consideration. See Daniels v. United States, <em>supra, </em>407 F.2d at 1347-1349, 187 Ct.Cl. at 42-44, Abbott v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-18\">Within what is now the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, there is a history of the utilization of wage rate data from the commercial fishing industry for Section 202(8) purposes nearly as old as Section 202(8) itself. Within Region 3, the practice was in existence prior to 1958. In 1958, with the advent of a new Wage Board chairman, a thorough reevaluation of prior Wage Board practices toward vessel employees was undertaken. Consideration was given to setting wage rates for vessel employees aboard the <em>Delaware </em>based on earnings of oceanographic research vessel employees of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, but it was subsequently concluded that the prior procedure should continue to be followed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>In 1959, the Regional Director, Region 3, appointed to the Wage Board a new chairman. The two members and the two alternate members who had been a part of the prior Wage Board continued to serve on the Wage Board. One of the two members, and one of the two alternate members, remained on the Wage Board throughout the period here material, as did the chairman appointed in 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">The approval of the Regional Director, Region 3, of any wage rate schedule determinations of the Wage Board was a prerequisite to effectuation of wage rate schedules affecting plaintiffs throughout the period here material. Plaintiffs have neither offered evidence nor requested any findings of fact concerning the Regional Director\u2019s knowledge, experience, bases for decision, or actions. The evidence relevant to the actions and knowledge of the Wage Board and the Wage Board chairman appointed in 1959 is summarized in findings 16-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">At the outset of his tenure in 1959, the chairman of the Wage Board was clearly not as knowledgeable as he might have been; even to time of trial in 1968, he had never been aboard either the <em>Delaware </em>or the <em>Albatross IV </em>during a scientific operation, nor had he even been aboard a commercial fishing vessel. He relied, at least to some extent, on verbal advice from other Wage Board members, first in looking to the commercial fishing industry for wage rate schedule purposes, and later in an understanding of plaintiffs\u2019 duties and responsibilities as compared to those of personnel aboard commercial fishing vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">The record also shows, however, that all Wage Board members were of the opinion that plaintiffs were engaged in \u201cfishing operations\u201d; that the Wage Board considered all the duties and responsibilities of vessel employees aboard the <em>Albatross IV </em>and the <em>Delaware </em>and compared them with duties and responsibilities of employees in the commercial fishing industry; that, in 1959 and thereafter throughout the period here material, the Wage Board included at least one member and one alternate member who had participated in the 1958 reevaluation of Wage Board practices; that the Wage Board considered the commercial fishing industry part of the maritime industry; and that the Wage Board\u2019s determinations were unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-9\">There was, in substance, a considered determination that plaintiffs\u2019 duties and responsibilities most closely approximated those of personnel in the commercial fishing industry. And, it is not established that in reaching that determination, any reasonably comparable services in the maritime industry were ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-10\">Whether, and under what circumstances, a lack of knowledge on the part of a Section 202(8) wage-fixing body, or any of its members, vitiate its actions need not be reached. On this record, it cannot be concluded that the Wage Board or the Regional Director, Region 3, acted arbitrarily or capriciously in utilizing a formula based on average hourly earnings of commercial fishermen in the large otter trawler fleet operating out of Boston in setting plaintiffs\u2019 wage rates for work at sea. Daniels v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Abbott v. United States, <em>supra; cf. </em>Amell v. United States, 390 F.2d 880, 885, 182 Ct.Cl. 604, 614 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 852, 89 S.Ct. 88, 21 L.Ed.2d 122 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-12\">Finally, plaintiffs contend that defendant has departed from a congressional mandate and requirement in the public interest that plaintiffs be paid overtime for all work in excess of 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week, and for all work performed on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. The theory seems to be that Section 23, Act of March 28, 1934, 48 Stat. 522, as amended, 5 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>\u00a7 673c (1964) <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> is \u201cspecifically made applicable\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to plaintiffs by Sections 102(c) and 203 of the Federal Employees\u2019 Pay Act of 1945, 59 Stat. 295, as amended, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 902(c), 913 (1964).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">Briefly, Section 102(c), as amended, provided that the Federal Employees\u2019 Pay Act of 1945, \u201cexcept sections 203 and 607\u201d (the latter section here irrelevant) should not apply to employees whose basic compensation was fixed and adjusted from time to time in accordance with prevailing rates by wage boards or similar administrative authority serving the same purpose. Section 203, as amended, provided that such employees should be entitled to overtime \u201cin accordance with the provisions of section 23 of the Act of March 28, 1934 * * * <em>&gt;&gt;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">In the Federal Employees\u2019 Pay Act of 1945, Congress drew a distinction between those employees covered by Section 102(c) and \u201cvessel employees of the Department of Interior\u201d. Section 102(d), Fedez\u2019al Employees\u2019 Pay Act of 1945, 59 Stat. 295, 296, as amended, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(d) (1964). The 1945 Act, \u201cexcept <em>sections 606 </em>and 607\u201d, does not apply to such vessel employees (emphasis supplied). Section 606, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 946 (1964), provided that such employees \u201cmay be compensated in accordance with the wage practices of the maritime industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">As the recent revision and codification of Title 5 and other acts of Congress in this area make clear, the distinction has been perpetuated. <em>E. g., </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5102(c) (7), (8), 5541(2) (xi), (xii) (Supp. V, 1965-69). Upon a careful review of the statutory scheme, it is concluded that plaintiffs, vessel employees of the Department of the Interi- or, can claim no benefits under Sections 102(c) and 203 of the 1945 Act. <em>Compare </em>Panama Canal Co. v. Anderson, 312 F.2d 98 (5th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 832, 84 S.Ct. 43, 11 L.Ed.2d 63 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-13\">Defendant's arguments that plaintiffs az'e estopped from asserting the claims sued upon by \u201ctheir acquiescence and active participation in setting the very wage rates which they now attack\u201d,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that the claims are barred by laches, need not be reached. <em>Cf. </em>Albright v.
