Ritter, 461 F.2d 1100 (10th Cir. 1972). The instant cause was also one of Judge Christensen\u2019s cases which Chief Judge Ritter assigned to himself following Judge Christensen\u2019s taking senior status. The Judicial Council\u2019s December order required Chief Judge Ritter to vacate this assignment pursuant to its command that Judge Christensen\u2019s cases go to Judge Anderson. Meanwhile, the cases which had been Judge Christensen\u2019s prior to his retirement, and many of which were assigned to Chief Judge Ritter in his unilateral order, have been, with the exception of the present case and the <em>Utah-Idaho Sugar </em>case, assigned to either Judge Anderson or Senior Judge Christensen. However, Chief Judge Ritter and Judge Anderson have not, to date at least, agreed on court rules with respect to routine assignment of eases. Furthermore, Chief Judge Ritter has not vacated his assignment orders made unilaterally. Thus, the problem is the same, namely, inability of the two judges mutually to agree on rules for assignment of cases; it is not a condition involving isolated incidents of disagreement. Hence we determine that the petitioners are entitled to the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-15\">We conclude that in accordance with our decision in <em>Utah-Idaho Sugar, </em>that mandamus must issue directing Chief Judge Ritter to refrain from proceeding further in the above case and directing Chief Judge Ritter to transfer the cause to Judge Anderson in accordance with the Judicial Council\u2019s orders of January 20, 1958 and December 20, 1971. Chief Judge Ritter\u2019s orders of October 4, 1971 and November 24, 1971, we hold to be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-16\">Let the writ of mandamus issue. The peremptory writ is made absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-17\">LEWIS, C. J., not participating, having voluntarily disqualified himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-18\">HILL and HOLLOWAY, JJ., not participating.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
