See, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5010(d) ; United States v. Waters, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 437 F.2d 722 (1970). If we were to adopt such a rule, we would be obliged to afford the district court the opportunity to make such a finding and thereafter to resentence. The circumstances and gravity of the crime of which defendant was convicted, related crimes of which he has been found guilty or of which his guilt is not contested, and the record of previous unsuccessful attempts at rehabilitation are such that it is inconceivable to us that defendant could be found to be a fit candidate for treatment under the Act. Thus, this case is not a proper vehicle to determine if we should follow <em>Waters, </em>or even if, as the government contends, we impliedly rejected <em>Waters </em>in United States v. Wilson, 450 F.2d 495 (4 Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
