The board considered it, and appellee does not question that it is properly before us. Hence, the issue on appeal is whether the contemporaneous use of FLURA-GEL and ORA-JEL on the respective preparations described would be likely to cause confusion, mistake, or to deceive. See \u00a7 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d). We agree with the board that there is no likelihood of confusion and accordingly affirmed its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-17\">The record indicates that ORA-JEL has been extensively advertised, and sales during the 1960-67 period exceeded $5,000,000. However, the board held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-18\">The marks \u201cFLURA-GEL\u201d and \u201cORA-JEL\u201d do not look alike nor engender a similar commercial impression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-19\">Responding to appellant\u2019s contention that \u201canyone familiar with * * * \u2018ORA-JEL\u2019 * * * and seeing or hearing of a product called \u2018FLURA-GEL\u2019 will inevitably believe that it is petitioner\u2019s product containing a fluoride,\u201d the board concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-22\">We are not persuaded that the public would pronounce the mark \u201cFLUR-A-GEL\u201d as petitioner suggests for the basic reason that \u201cFLURA\u201d is not \u201cfluoride\u201d notwithstanding that it does suggest the latter. Nor do we perceive that the public would consider that \u201cFLURA-GEL\u201d is petitioner\u2019s product containing a fluoride since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>that mark does not in any manner incorporate petitioner\u2019s mark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Appellant makes the same argument here. In addition, appellant asserts that ORA-JEL is a strong mark, indeed one which has acquired secondary meaning as evidenced by the large volume of sales and the widespread advertising to which the public has been exposed. Ap-pellee counters with the position that ORA-JEL is in fact a weak mark as demonstrated by the many third-party registrations employing either the term \u201cORA\u201d or the term \u201cJEL\u201d and by the descriptiveness of the combination of these terms as used to identify a gel intended for oral application.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">We think it unnecessary to determine the strength of the mark ORA-JEL in this case for we are convinced that there would be no likelihood of confusion arising from the concurrent use of the several marks here involved on the respective products. We agree with the board that \u201cFLURA\u201c neither looks nor sounds like \u201cORA,\u201d and while FLURA-GEL does suggest a fluoride-containing gel, we cannot agree with appellant that the average purchaser would assume that it is a fluoridated form of ORA-JEL. \u201cFLURA\u201d by itself would suggest the fluoride content, but that is quite different from suggesting both a fluoride content and a relationship to ORA-JEL. Compare Mead Johnson &amp; Co. v. American Home Products Corp., Cust. &amp; Pat. App., 461 F.2d 1381, Patent Appeal No. 8730, decided June 29, 1972, wherein TEMPURETS was held to suggest a modified or related form of TEMPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">While ORA-JEL is sold over the counter, without prescription, for application to the teeth by \u2022 the consumer, the description of the goods in the FLURA-GEL registration calls for <em>\u201cprofessional </em>application to teeth.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This difference in the mode of use of the respective products militates against a likelihood of confusion and supports our conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Appellant contends that FLURA-GEL could be sold through the same channels of trade as ORA-JEL and relies on the statement of one of its witnesses to the effect that appellant first became aware of appellee\u2019s trademark through \u201can announcement in a trade paper that the product FLURA-GEL was going to be put into national distribution.\u201d Not only is this inconclusive evidence of ap-pellee\u2019s supposed intention to distribute FLURA-GEL nationally, but in addition, \u201cnational distribution\u201d is not inconsistent with the limitation to professional application. Even if appellee does eventually sell FLURA-GEL on the same basis on which ORA-JEL is marketed, this cancellation proceeding must be resolved on the basis of the goods as described in the registration. See In re Allen Electric and Equipment Co., 458 F.2d 1404, 59 CCPA (1972). Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, J. C. Hall Co. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 340 F.2d 960, 52 CCPA 981 (1965), does not hold that the description of the goods in an application or registration may never limit the channels of trade. Rather, the fact in that case was simply that the application involved in that appeal did not limit the mode of distribution or channels of trade. In the present case, we think that the limitation on FLURA-GEL of \u201cprofessional application to teeth\u201d is relevant and when considered along with the dissimilarity of the respective marks, supports the conclusion that confusion is unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">For the reasons set forth, the decision of the board denying appellant\u2019s petition to cancel appellee\u2019s registration is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-12\">.
