In our previous disposition, on a jurisdictional question, the court did not reach the merits of the validity of the Board\u2019s order issued on June 2, 1968, pursuant to \u00a7 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-20\">On consideration of the briefs, and argument previously heard, the court is of the view that the Board\u2019s determination in the Section 10 (k) proceeding that employees represented by Tile Setters Local No. 20 are entitled to the disputed work, is neither arbitrary nor capricious, nor unsupported by substantial evidence, and is therefore valid. This determination is not undercut by the circumstance that a contrary determination would also have been reasonable. Substantial evidence on the whole record supports the Board\u2019s finding that petitioner conducted picketing with an object of forcing or requiring the employer to change the assignment of the disputed work from persons represented by Tile Setters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>Local No. 20 to persons represented by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">The petition to review is denied.
