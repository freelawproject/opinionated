Count 1, against all four defendants, charged a conspiracy to violate the Dyer Act, and the remaining ten counts charged substantive violations of that Act. Prior to trial, Mahanna\u2019s co-defendants entered guilty pleas to single-count violations and each of them received a suspended sentence and probation. Thereupon, the conspiracy charge and those substantive charges not involving Mahan-na were dismissed (Counts 7-11), leaving Counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 which involved Mahanna either singly (Counts 2 and 3) or with others (Counts 4, 5 and 6) to be determined. After an eight-day jury trial, Mahanna was found guilty on all five counts that had charged him with knowingly receiving and concealing stolen motor vehicles moving as interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2313. He was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment on each count, the sentences to be served consecutively, for a total of twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-25\">On this appeal, Mahanna asks that his conviction on Counts 4 and 5 be reversed because of insufficient evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>that the charges set forth therein be dismissed. Additionally, Mahanna alleges that errors relating to the trial of all five counts necessitate a new trial. We turn first to a consideration of the alleged errors that touch upon all five counts of appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">Mahanna\u2019s first contention is that Government Exhibits Nos. 8, 9 and 10 were erroneously admitted into evidence, having been seized by the arresting officers from the trunk of the appellant\u2019s car without a warrant in violation of appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. No motion to suppress was made. The facts with reference to the seizure were developed piecemeal during the trial. Exhibit No. 8 was an \u201cIdenta-Card\u201d with Ma-hanna\u2019s picture thereon but stating a false name and address \u2014 \u201cPhilip F. Gholson, Rt. 2, Palamor Park, Freeburg, Illinois\u201d. Government\u2019s Exhibit No. 9 was a fictitious Missouri driver\u2019s license in the name of \u201cNorman J. Turk, Jr.\u201d Government\u2019s Exhibit No. 10 was a fictitious Illinois driver\u2019s license made out to \u201cPhilip Fred Gholson\u201d. These three exhibits were found in an attache case which had been in the trunk of the car the appellant was driving when he was arrested on May 6, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Prior to appellant\u2019s arrest, Missouri State Highway Patrolmen, in cooperation with United States Postal Inspectors, had placed appellant under surveillance on suspicion of automobile theft. On- the day in question, appellant was observed driving a vehicle with an expired Washington, D. C., license plate. He was stopped for this reason. Upon being stopped, appellant was asked to produce his operator\u2019s license. He replied that it was in his wallet in the trunk of the car. Appellant then unlocked the trunk and withdrew therefrom an attache case which he began to open. The officers stopped him, obviously fearing that he might be reaching for a weapon. They opened the attache case and handed appellant his wallet, which was in plain view. The inference created from the testimony is that in doing so the officers also observed and removed Exhibits 8, 9 and 10 from the attache case which were subsequently identified, offered and received over objection at trial. The court, by its rulings on objections, clearly indicated that the opening of the trunk and the attempted removal of the attache case therefrom were purely voluntary on the appellant\u2019s part and further that the seizure of exhibits in question was incidental to appellant\u2019s arrest and that its rulings would have been the same had a motion to suppress been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">Appellant was next asked for the ownership papers for the automobile he was driving. These he could not produce. Appellant was formally placed under arrest, both for driving with an expired license plate and for suspicion of automobile theft. We believe appellant\u2019s contention that his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure to be without merit in light of the facts adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">Appellant was driving on a Missouri public highway and was under a duty to produce his driver\u2019s license at an officer\u2019s request. R.S.Mo.1959 \u00a7 302.-181(2), V.A.M.S. See Rodgers v. United States, 8 Cir., 1966, 362 F.2d 358, 361, cert. denied, 1966, 385 U.S. 993, 87 S.Ct. 608, 17 L.Ed.2d 454, wherein this court said at page 361:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-9\">\u201cWe note that Missouri statutes make it unlawful for any person to drive a motor vehicle upon a Missouri highway unless he has a valid operator\u2019s license, V.A.M.S. \u00a7 302.020(2); that such a license \u2018shall be carried at all times by the holder thereof while driving a motor vehicle and shall be displayed upon demand of any officer of the highway patrol * * *. Failure of any * * * operator of a motor vehicle to exhibit his license to any of the aforesaid officers * * * shall be presumptive evidence that such person is not a duly licensed * * * motor vehicle operator\u2019, \u00a7 302.181, par. 2; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">In <em>Rodgers, </em>the patrolmen had information to the effect that a car answer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>ing the description of the vehicle driven by the defendant was stolen. They had sound and substantial reasons for stopping the defendant and initiating the investigation which turned up incriminating evidence. In the instant case, the appellant was arrested for driving a vehicle with an expired license and also for suspicion of auto theft. Exhibits 8, 9 and 10 were apparently in plain view in the attache case when it was opened to obtain appellant\u2019s wallet and license therefrom. We have then this situation: (1) the officers had the right to stop the appellant under the suspicious circumstances existing and thereafter require the production of a driver\u2019s license. (2) Appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license or a substitute therefor was in his wallet in an attache case in the car\u2019s trunk. (3) Appellant either voluntarily opened the trunk himself or one of the officers did so with his consent. (4) Appellant reached into the trunk for the attache case, which was closed. (5) Appellant attempted to open the attache case but was prevented from doing so by the officers, who opened it themselves and handed appellant\u2019s wallet to him. In doing so, the officers observed and removed from the attache case Exhibits 8, 9 and 10 in question. (6) The officers had a right to be where they were and to do what they did when they observed Exhibits 8, 9 and 10. (7) The officers were not engaged in an exploratory search, but in a situation calling for the application of the plain view doctrine. (8) The seizure of the exhibits was incidental to the arrest of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">In Harris v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 234, 236, 88 S.Ct. 992, 993, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067, 1069, the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-7\">\u201cIt has long been settled that objects falling in the plain view of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">See United States v. Cecil, 8 Cir., 1972, 457 F.2d 1178; United States v. Jones, 8 Cir., 1971, 452 F.2d 884; United States v. Briddle, 8 Cir., 1971, 436 F.2d 4, cert. denied, 1971, 401 U.S. 921, 91 S.Ct. 910, 27 L.Ed.2d 24; Searles v. State of Minnesota, 8 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 1188, cert. denied, 1970, 400 U.S. 907, 91 S.Ct. 150, 27 L.Ed.2d 145; Fagundes v. United States, 1 Cir., 1965, 340 F.2d 673. Cf. Chimel v. California, 1969, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685; Brinegar v. United States, 1949, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879; United States v. Parham, 8 Cir., 1972, 458 F.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">We hold that the facts and circumstances surrounding the seizure of Exhibits 8, 9 and 10 fully justified their admission as evidence against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">As his next contention, appellant complains that the trial court made prejudicial comments during the course of the trial and in its charge to the jury concerning appellant\u2019s failure to testify. Early in the trial, which, as we have noted, lasted some eight days, appellant apparently had some disagreement with his personally retained counsel with reference to the questioning of witnesses. Appellant sought the permission of the trial court to personally participate in the trial and to cross-examine witnesses when he chose to do so. The request was granted. Shortly thereafter the trial court became convinced that the appellant was attempting to testify by introducing statements of fact into his questions. Appellant was called to the bench and admonished as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-15\">\u201cThe Court: You can ask him whose name was on there first, but if you\u2019re going to testify, you\u2019re going to have to take the stand. Now, that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, in effect, and that\u2019s where you may be \u2014 the point I\u2019m trying to tell you is you can be sworn and this Court\u2019s not trying to walk you into a situation where other evidence may be introduced, but if you persist in \u2014 the way to ask this question, Mr. Mahanna- \u2014 just a minute. The way to ask him is say \u2014 just mention this Janice Laberta\u2019s name appears there and then hand him the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>hibit and ask him to inspect that line and see \u2014 ask him: did your name ever appear there. That\u2019s the way to do it, and you may do that, but if you go any further in cross-examination and make any statement like you did</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-5\">\u201cMr. Mahanna: I\u2019ll stop here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-6\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m going to stop you. I\u2019m going to administer the oath to you and then you\u2019re going to be in a little different situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">The foregoing was <em>in the presence of, but out of the hearing of the jury. </em>Thereafter, the cross-examination of the witness was continued by the appellant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-8\">\u201cBy Mr. Mahanna</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-9\">\u201cQ. Mr. Klingel, the night that I discovered the automobile \u2014 I believe it was on May the 19th ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-10\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-11\">\u201cQ. I called you where? At home ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-12\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-13\">\u201cQ. And I told you what had happened and asked you what ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-14\">\u201cMr. Strachan: Well, Your Honor, the witness is testifying \u2014 rather the counsel is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-15\">\u201cThe Court: If you want to interrogate this witness, Mr. Mahanna, you may interrogate him. The Court has granted you that right. However, if you propose to offer testimony, I suggest that you take the oath and the witness stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-16\">\u201cMr. Mahanna: I\u2019m sorry, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-17\">The foregoing <em>was in the presence and the hearing of the jury. </em>Thereafter, appellant continued to exercise the privilege granted him by the trial court. Subsequently, the court still found it necessary to admonish the appellant, but such admonitions were issued at the bench out of the hearing of the jury. We get the impression from an examination of the entire transcript that the trial judge was truly trying to be helpful to appellant and sought to explain to him what he could and could not do while interrogating a witness. In fairness, we must say that the appellant indicated an appreciation of the trial court\u2019s helpfulness to him in what was to him the strange and difficult position of personally trying at least part of his own case with retained counsel sitting by him. If, however, under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s statement made to appellant in the presence and hearing of the jury that \u201cif you propose to offer testimony I suggest that you take the oath and witness stand\u201d be error, we deem it to be minor and inconsequential error without prejudice to the appellant, particularly in light of the trial court\u2019s instructions referred to below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-19\">The situation here is not unlike that presented to this court in United States v. Warner, 8 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 730, cert. denied, 1970, 400 U.S. 930, 91 S.Ct. 194, 27 L.Ed.2d 191. In <em>Warner, </em>after an improper argument by appellant, who was acting pro se, the trial judge said, \u201cI think you should ask questions. If you want to testify later on you may.\u201d Additionally, after an improper closing argument by Warner, the prosecuting attorney said, \u201cMost of what you heard in the closing argument on behalf of Mr. Warner and by Mr. Warner, did you hear it from the witness stand?\u201d True, as Judge Gibson noted in his opinion, 428 F.2d at 738:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-20\">\u201cAdverse comments by judge or prosecutor upon a defendant's failure to take the stand is a violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-21\">We agree, however, with the Fifth Circuit wherein it said in Davis v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 357 F.2d 438, 441, cert. denied, 1966, 385 U.S. 927, 87 S.Ct. 284, 17 L.Ed.2d 210:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-22\">\u201cThe facts and circumstances of each case must be carefully analyzed to determine \u2018whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u2019 Knowles v. United States, 224 F.2d 168, 170 (10th Cir. 1955); see United States [ex rel. D\u2019Ambrosio] v. Fay, 349 F.2d 957 (2d Cir. 1965).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">See United States v. Porter, 8 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 1204, 1216, cert. denied United States v. Harrison, 1971, 404 U.S. 911, 92 S.Ct. 38, 30 L.Ed.2d 184; United States v. Lepiscopo, 5 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 258, cert. denied, 1970, 400 U.S. 948, 91 S.Ct. 255, 27 L.Ed.2d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">In <em>Warner, </em>Judge Gibson additionally noted, at page 740 of 428 F.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-8\">\u201cIn light of <em>Griffin </em>[1965, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106] and <em>Curtiss </em>[United States v. Curtiss, 2 Cir., 1964, 330 F.2d 278] some error has probably been committed in this case by the comments of the judge and prosecutor. But the judge did advise the jury in his charge that no adverse inference should be drawn from defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand, and the prosecutor\u2019s remarks would have been proper if applied to trained counsel not defending himself. And in any event the remarks made were mild and innocuous. Although we believe the judge and prosecutor must use, in the lawyer\u2019s phrase, an excess of caution, in pro se defense cases, we think the statements here were sufficiently unprejudieial and noninflammatory and the evidence was so overwhelming that such error as was committed was harmless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">In the instant case, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-10\">\u201cIn considering whether possession of recently stolen property has been satisfactorily explained, the Jury will bear in mind that in the exercise of Constitutional right, <em>the accused need not take the witness stand and testify. </em>Possession may be satisfactorily explained through other circumstances, other evidence independent of any testimony of the accused.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-3\">The trial court also stated to the jury-in its charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-5\">\u201cThe Jury will always bear in mind that the law never imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">It further charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-12\">\u201cThis is a criminal case, as you know. The burden to make out the guilt of the Defendant on trial in this case is upon the Government. That burden the Government assumes in the beginning and carries throughout to the end, until it has met it by showing to you the guilt of the Defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>The law never imposes upon a Defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.\" </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">We have examined the trial court\u2019s entire charge to the jury and find it meticulously correct, particularly as to burden of proof, presumption of innocence and the lack of necessity of the accused to testify or produce witnesses. The complained-of statement in front of or within the hearing of the jury might best have been said in chambers or at the bench out of the hearing of the jury. Nevertheless, we do not find that it constituted prejudicial error in light of the standards enunciated in <em>Warner </em>and <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-14\">Appellant also challenges additional statements of the trial court in its charge to the jury, as well as the admission into evidence of various handwriting samples of the appellant and certain photographs of him. We have examined and considered these alleged errors and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-15\">Lastly we consider Mahanna\u2019s contention that his convictions on Counts 4 and 5 should be reversed because of insufficient evidence to support the charge that he received and concealed the vehicles described in those two counts. With this contention we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>Count No. 4 charged that Henry C. Midden, a co-defendant in the original indictment, and Mahanna did willfully and knowingly receive and conceal a certain 1969 Cadillac which was moving in interstate commerce from New York City, State of New York, to St. Louis, State of Missouri, and that they knew the motor vehicle to have been stolen. It should be remembered here that Count 4 was dismissed as to Midden, leaving Mahanna as the sole person charged in Count 4. Additionally, it should be pointed out that in the conspiracy count, which was also dismissed, it was charged that as part of the conspiracy Mahanna would provide bills of sale, former titles and title applications for the vehicles that were to be stolen for defendant Midden. During the trial an official of the office of the Illinois Secretary of State identified various documents relating to the vehicle described in Count 4. The documents were counterfeit Massachusetts title papers for this vehicle issued in the name of \u201cAlexander Rosen\u201d. Based on such documents, an Illinois title was issued to \u201cRosen\u201d. The vehicle was then sold by Midden to John W. McGraw. McGraw then obtained a Missouri title for the vehicle in the names of his sister and brother-in-law. From them title passed to Mr. and Mrs. Milford Potter, from whom the vehicle was recovered by the Missouri State Highway Patrol on September 11, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">The only evidence linking Mahanna to the various transactions involving the vehicle described in Count 4 is the testimony of expert witnesses indicating that Mahanna may have signed the name \u201cAlexander Rosen\u201d to the fraudulent title document, and that an insurance claims adjuster paid a claim relating to this vehicle to \u201cElias Mahanna and Alexander Rosen\u201d. The address of Mahan-na was shown to be the same as that of \u201cRosen\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Similarly in Count 5, a 1969 Cadillac automobile was stolen from its owner on October 1, 1969. A counterfeit New York registration certificate in the name of \u201cKenneth Bennett\u201d was used to obtain a fraudulent Illinois title in the same name. The vehicle was then transferred to Larry Ancell, who applied for a Missouri title. The vehicle in question was recovered from Ancell by the Missouri State Highway Patrol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">Here, again, the only evidence linking Mahanna with the Count 5 violation is through handwriting experts who testified that the bill of sale purportedly drawn and signed by \u201cBennett\u201d transferring the vehicle to Ancell was probably written by Mahanna. Additionally, Ancell, who was acquainted with Mahan-na, testified that he had purchased the vehicle after negotiating with Mahanna on the telephone, but that the vehicle was delivered to him by another. The check written by Ancell to cover the purchase price was drawn to the order of \u201cBennett\u201d and mailed to Mahanna.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">We realize, of course, that when sufficiency of the evidence is in issue on appeal,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-9\">\u201c* * * we must, as an appellate court, view that evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury verdict, and we accept as established all reasonable inferences that tend to support the jury\u2019s determination. United States v. Lodwick, 8 Cir., 1969, 410 F.2d 1202; Kayser v. United States, 8 Cir., 1968, 394 F.2d 601, cert. denied 393 U.S. 919, 89 S.Ct. 250, 21 L.Ed.2d 206.\u201d United States v. Briddle, supra, 430 F.2d 1335, at 1337-1338.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">The elements of proof required for conviction under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2313 were set out by this court in United States v. Brady, 8 Cir., 1970, 425 F.2d 309, at page 311, wherein Judge Heaney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-12\">\u201cTo obtain a conviction under \u00a7 2313, the government must prove that: (1) the motor vehicle involved was stolen; (2) the defendant knew that the motor vehicle had been stolen; (3) the defendant concealed the motor vehicle; (4) the motor vehicle involved was moving as or was a part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>of interstate traffic at the time of the defendant\u2019s activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">Cf. Kramer v. United States, 8 Cir., 1969, 408 F.2d 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">The government\u2019s proof as to Counts 4 and 5 fails to meet these standards and was insufficient to support the jury verdicts of guilty as to such counts. All that the government established is that Mahanna may have been guilty of procuring false title documents for the vehicles described in Counts 4 and 5. This falls far short of establishing either receiving or concealing, although there can be little question but that Mahanna\u2019s procuring and providing false title documents for the vehicles described in Counts 4 and 5 constituted a violation of the law of the State of Missouri punishable by a fine or imprisonment. See R.S.Mo.1959 \u00a7 301.420, V.A. M.S. Proof of a violation of such a state law is, however, insufficient to establish a viable nexus upon which a conviction for Dyer Act violation can be sustained. Actual or constructive possession is required to support the charge of receiving and concealing in Dyer Act cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">The evidence produced by the government in Counts 2, 3 and 6 highlights the deficiencies of proof in Counts 4 and 5. Count 2 involved a 1969 Cadillac which Mahanna was driving at the time of his arrest. Count 3 involved a 1968 Cadillac which Mahanna had personally traded in to a Cadillac Dealer in Clayton, Missouri, as part payment on a new Cadillac. In Count 6 the stolen 1968 Cadillac was traded back to one Robby A. Robinson, who had purchased the vehicle for cash from \u201cMorris Goldberg\u201d, who was accompanied by appellant and who accepted the cash payment. It is undisputed that appellant was in the vehicle at the time it was brought to Robinson for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">Thus in the other three counts, 2, 3 and 6, the evidence clearly established that Mahanna had actual or constructive possession of the vehicles which he was charged with receiving and concealing. No such connection exists as to Counts 4 and 5. It should be noted here also that as to Counts 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 Mahanna was not named as a defendant-participant, although such counts involved charges against Mahanna\u2019s co-defendants, involved Cadillac automobiles and separate violations of the Dyer Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">The deficiencies of the government\u2019s case are further highlighted by an analysis of the cases relied upon by it to support the proposition that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions as to Counts 4 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-11\">The prosecution places much reliance upon the definition of constructive possession espoused by the Sixth Circuit in United States v. Wolfenbarger, 6 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 992, 994-995, wherein the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-12\">\u201cA person who knowingly has direct physical control over a thing at a given time is then in actual possession of it. A person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and intention at any given time to exercise dominion and control over a thing is then in constructive possession of such property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1183-13\">The facts in <em>Wolfenbarger </em>are, however, inapposite. There, FBI agents had placed the stolen car in question under surveillance. Defendant was arrested next to the stolen vehicle and admitted possession of the key to the vehicle. Defendant contended that he had received the key from another and was about to move it at the other\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-14\">Indeed, all of the cases relied upon by the government contain a much greater showing of possession than is demonstrated by the proof relating to Counts 4 and 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>As we have already noted, the evidence was amply sufficient to sustain a conviction on each of Counts 2, 3 and 6. There, possession of the vehicles was convincingly linked to Mahanna. No such evidence was offered or received as to Counts 4 and 5. The government may not bootstrap the proof as to Counts 4 and 5 by use of the stronger evidence adduced with respect to the other counts of the indictment. Each count is a separate charge and a separate case and each count must stand on its own proof. Cf. United States v. Jensen, 8 Cir., 1972, 462 F.2d 763; United States v. Kelton, 8 Cir., 1971, 446 F.2d 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">The convictions on Counts 4 and 5 are reversed with directions to enter an order of acquittal. The convictions on Counts 2, 3 and 6 are in all things affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1183-15\">. See, United States v.
