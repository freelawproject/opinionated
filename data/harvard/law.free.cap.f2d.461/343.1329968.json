The constitutionality of the Act in this regard has recently been sustained by this Court. United States v. Amado Lopez and Thomas Llerena, 5 Cir. 1972, 459 F.2d 949. Accordingly, the judgments of the district court as to appellants Heyman, Regina Joly, Marek Joly, and Lieberman are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-20\">Jesse Lane was adjudged guilty at a non-jury trial of violations of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 173 and 174, for knowingly receiving, concealing, and transporting cocaine, knowing it to have been imported contrary to law, and guilty of 26 U. S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4704(a), 4705(a), and 7237, for selling and distributing cocaine not in or from its original package and without a written order as required. He contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment; that the conviction is invalid because there is no showing that the court in a non-jury trial did not apply the statutory presumption of importation under section 174 of Title 21, held to be unconstitutional with respect to cocaine in Turner v. United States, 1970, 396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610, and that the court should have but did not require the Government to bear the burden of proof of showing that the sale of cocaine to an undercover F.B.I. agent was not made pursuant to the required written order. We have carefully examined each of these contentions and find them to be without merit. Lane\u2019s conviction is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-16\">. Heyman and Marek Joly pled nolo contendere to a violation of \u00a7 841(a), Regina Joly pled nolo contendere to a violation of \u00a7 844(a), and Lieberman pled guilty to a violation of \u00a7 841(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
