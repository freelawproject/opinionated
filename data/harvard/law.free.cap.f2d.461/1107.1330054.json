In the alternative, the District Court found that it did not possess subject matter jurisdiction over the Title VII claims because Payne had not first obtained from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission a finding that there exists reasonable cause to believe that his charges of racial discrimination are true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-25\">Subsequent to the decision of the District Court, this court decided Brady v. Bristol-Meyers, Inc., 459 F.2d 621 (1972) and Green v. McDonnell Douglas Corporation, 463 F.2d 337 (1972), renewed petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>pending. <em>Brady </em>established for this circuit the proposition that \u00a7 1981 reaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>racially discriminatory practices that arise in the private sector. <em>Green, </em>noting with approval cases from other circuits holding that an EEOC finding of reasonable cause is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to litigation of a Title VII claim, held that a District Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Title VII claims with respect to which no such finding has been made. Application of these principles in the instant case serves completely to undercut the theories upon which the District Court relied in dismissing the complaint. Accordingly, the judgment appealed from must be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court for reconsideration in light of <em>Brady </em>and <em>Green.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">The District Court is directed to reinstate the complaint and to conduct further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1173-28\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-15 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1173-26\">.
