We hold that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-20\">The defendant was arrested in the vicinity of a store a few minutes after the storekeeper had called the police to give alarm concerning an attempt to negotiate counterfeit money. The defendant matched the storekeeper\u2019s description of the would-be negotiator, and a cruising officer stopped him in response to the alarm. The key exhibit fell out of defendant\u2019s clothing during a \u201cpat-down\u201d search for weapons. The arrest was based upon probable cause, and the incidental search was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
