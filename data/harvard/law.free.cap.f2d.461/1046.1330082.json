A jury found the defendants liable for allowing the property to deteriorate in breach of their obligations under the lease and sublease. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-15\">In 1950 Freight Terminals, Inc., as lessor, entered into a fifteen year lease agreement with T.S.C. Motor Freight Lines, Inc., as lessee. Freight Terminals had constructed a freight terminal building and yard in contemplation of the lease. With respect to the upkeep of the premises the pertinent parts of the lease provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-16\">YI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-17\">The Lessor covenants and agrees at its own cost and expense to keep in good condition and repair during the demised term, the roof of the demised premises, exterior walls, and to make such repairs as may be required by inherent structural defects, except those necessitated by the acts of the Lessee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-18\">* -x- -x- * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-19\">VIII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-20\">\u25a0X- * * # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-21\">Lessee further agrees to suffer no waste upon said premises and shall, at its own expense and costs, keep them in as good repair and condition as when received, including all plumbing, air-conditioning and heating equipment, and shall, at the expiration of this lease, and in whatever manner its termination may be brought about, deliver said premises to Lessor in as good order and condition as they were immediately upon the erection and construction of said building, ordinary wear and tear, and damage by fire, Acts of God and windstorm, alone excepted. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-22\">* -x- * \u2022\u00bb * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-23\">XIV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-24\">Lessee shall pay and discharge all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, that shall arise from or in connection with enforcing the covenants and agreements of this lease by Lessor, and all of the covenants and agreements herein de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>scribed shall extend to and be obligatory upon the successors, assigns or heirs of either and all the parties hereto, it being understood and argeed that the Lessor may at any time assign this lease and all its rights hereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-5\">\u2022* * -x- * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">In 1959 Ryder System, Inc. (System) acquired all of the capital stock of T.S. C., changed the name of T.S.C. to Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. (Truck) and guaranteed the performance of all the lease obligations. Truck continued to utilize the facilities in the operation of its motor freight business until July, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">Prior to Truck\u2019s vacating the premises, Freight Terminals became concerned about the condition of the freight yard and the air conditioning system. In early 1961 Freight Terminals learned that bulldozers were scraping and removing the yard\u2019s asphalt surface. Later when Freight Terminals became aware of Truck\u2019s abandonment of the facilities their concern for the maintenance of the premises increased. The property was located in an area of Houston where vandalism was rampant and unoccupied buildings were more susceptible to ravishment by vandals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">Ladin, president of Freight Terminals, made a physical inspection of the premises in November, 1962. He found the facilities in a deplorable condition. There were broken windows, holes and cracks in the building, loading docks were damaged, most of the electrical system was ripped out or not working, commodes were torn out and the air conditioning system was not operating properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-19\">In June, 1963, System employed Evans to repair the facilities. Evans found the property in great disrepair when he commenced his renovations. The air conditioning system was repaired, the electrical system restored, doors were fixed and holes in the yard were filled \u2014all for a total cost of approximately $10,000. Evans had estimated that a new asphalt yard surface would cost $9,500; however, System instructed him to simply fill the holes. Evans could have made further necessary repairs to the facilities but in fact did not. During the work Evans had to keep a man physically on the scene at all times because of the continuous threat of vandalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-20\">After the repairs were made in June the premises again remained vacant until November, 1963 when Mercury Fregiht Lines sub-leased the facilities from System at a reduced rent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mercury\u2019s operation was much smaller than Truck\u2019s. Only a portion of the yard and building were utilized. Mercury occupied the terminal facilities until the lease expired in December, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>In February 1965 System and International Utilities Corporation entered into a stock purchase agreement under which International acquired all of System\u2019s stock in Truck. In the agreement System represented to International that Truck had complied with the provisions of all outstanding leases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and warranted that there was no litigation, proceeding or investigation pending or threatened which could result in any material or adverse change in the business prospects of Truck.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> System agreed to indemnify International for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations made in the stock purchase agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">At the expiration of the lease Freight Terminals again inspected the property and found the doors damaged, windows broken and holes in the building. The interior of the building was not inspected at that time. In March, 1966 pictures were taken which reflected that the condition of the premises was the same as it had been in December, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Freight Terminals hired Thompson in the spring of 1966 to provide it with a cost estimate of the reparations necessary to restore the facilities to a usable condition. Thompson enumerated all of the damage he found and estimated the cost would be $36,000 to repair and refurbish the building and $36,000 to restore the surface of the yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">Suit was filed by Freight Terminals in state court in June, 1966 against System and Truck to recover damages as a result of their breach of the lease. System, a Florida corporation with no place of business or agent in the state, was served with process by service upon the Secretary of State pursuant to the Texas long arm statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Immediately upon removal System moved to dismiss on the ground that the allegations in the complaint were insufficient to support proper service under art. 2031b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-13\">Truck brought Mercury in as a third party defendant. The district court granted Freight Terminals leave to amend its complaint to correct the pleading error complained of by System in its motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss was then denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-14\">In answers to special interrogatories at the conclusion of the trial the jury found that both Truck and Mercury breached the condition in the lease in that the premises were damaged beyond ordinary wear and tear and the excepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>obligations of the lessor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They apportioned the amount of damages between Truck and Mercury <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to Freight Terminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">System and Truck were held jointly and severally liable for all damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. Truck was granted indemnity against System for all amounts owing to Freight Terminals, together with reimbursement to Truck for its attorneys\u2019 fees. Mercury was required to indemnify System for the damages which occurred during its occupancy and for a proportionate share of Freight Terminals\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">The following specifications of error are raised on this appeal: (1) System contends that the court erred in denying its motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds; (2) System, Truck and Mercury argue that the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support special interrogatories 4 and 6; (3) System, Truck and Mercury assert that the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to apportioning the amounts of damages between Truck and Mercury amounted to a compromise or quotient verdict; (4) System and Truck claim that the court erred in finding the sub-lease with Mercury ambiguous and insufficient to impose liability on Mercury for all damages under the sub-lease agreement; (5) System argues that the court erred in determining that under the stock purchase agreement it was required to indemnify Truck for all damages found in favor of Freight Terminals and further that System was liable for Truck\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees; and (6) Mercury contends that it was not liable contractually or otherwise to Freight Terminals for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">Immediately upon removal of the ease to the district court System filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that Freight Terminals\u2019 allegations failed to allege that System \u201cdoes not maintain a place of regular business in this State or a designated agent upon whom service may.be made.\u201d Tex.Civ. Stat.Ann. art. 2031b (1964). Texas strictly construes its long arm statute. Jurisdiction is not conferred unless the complaint alleges all of the jurisdictional facts set out in the statute. McKanna v. Edgar, Tex.1965, 388 S.W.2d 927; Woodcock, Cummings, Taylor &amp; French, Inc. v. Crosswell, 468 S.W.2d 864, 866 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Houston, 1st Dist.1971, no writ); <em>compare, </em>Eyerly Aircraft Co. v. Killian, 5 Cir. 1969, 414 F.2d 591, 602-604. Subsequently on motion, the trial court granted Freight Terminals leave to amend its complaint to allege the necessary jurisdictional facts. System argues that its motion to dismiss should nevertheless have been granted because the court had not acquired jurisdiction over System and could not obtain it by permitting Freight Terminals to amend. It contends, relying on Block v. Block, 7 Cir. 1952, 196 F.2d 930, that once it is determined that there was no jurisdiction in the state court from which the action was removed, the district court must dismiss upon a motion timely made. We regard <em>Block </em>as inapposite here. In that case there was no attempt to have the defendant served. Consequently, the motion to dismiss was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Although the district court must look to state law to ascertain whether service was properly made prior to removal, this does not foreclose service being effected in the district court. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1448.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See 4 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1082 (1969). System had notice of the suit and does not claim to have been prejudiced by Freight Terminals\u2019 failure to allege the Texas statutory requirements. It would have served no useful purpose for the district court to have dismissed the action as to System only to have Freight Terminals refile the suit with the necessary allegations. <em>See </em>Beecher v. Wallace, 9 Cir. 1967, 381 F.2d 372, 373; Barnes v. Irving Trust Co., S.D.Tex.1968, 290 F.Supp. 116, 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-10\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">All three appellants argue that the evidence was insufficient to show the amount of damage for which Truck was responsible and the amount of damage attributable to Mercury. In addition to the insufficiency of evidence upon which the jury could reasonably apportion the damages, appellants also argue that Freight Terminals\u2019 (Thompson\u2019s) cost of repair estimate was insufficient as a basis upon which to find damages because it was made several months after the expiration date of the lease and because it was a total and not an item by item estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-12\">The appellants have not attacked any of the jury findings that there was some damage for which they were liable. The controversy is with respect to the amount of such damage and who is liable for it. Three categories of damages were enumerated in the special interrogatories \u2014 the yard, the air conditioning system and the terminal building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-13\">An estimate was made by Thompson based upon the cost of repair to the yard to put it in a usable condition. The fact that the estimate was made several months after the termination of the lease does not invalidate it. As we have previously noted, Ladin in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>speeted the facilities in December, 1965 when the lease terminated. Pictures were taken of the premises in the spring of 1966 about the time Thompson made his estimate. Ladin confirmed that the pictures portrayed the premises as they were in December, 1965. This manner of assessing damages may not be as strong as an estimate made immediately after the premises are vacated by the lessee but it is sufficient and was properly considered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\"> We are also unimpressed with the argument that since the estimate by Thompson was not specified item by item it was insufficient. Mechanical and mathematical precision are not required to show the cost of repairs. The law only requires that the evidence be sufficient to enable the jury to estimate the loss or damages with reasonable certainty. See Daniels Towing Service, Inc. v. Nat Harrison Associates, Inc., 5 Cir. 1970, 432 F.2d 103, 105-106; Household Goods Carriers\u2019 Bureau v. Terrell, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 47, 53; <em>Accord, </em>Bildon Farms, Inc. v. Ward County Water Improvement District No. 2, Tex.1967, 415 S.W.2d 890; Donaldson v. Liberty Sign Co., 425 S.W.2d 901 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Fort Worth 1968, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">The contention of appellants that there was insufficient evidence upon which the jury could reasonably apportion damages gives us little pause. When considering the sufficiency of the evidence we accept the evidence in favor of the verdict as true and give to that evidence the benefit of all permissible inferences that help sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. Stockton v. Altman, 5 Cir. 1970, 432 F.2d 946, 950; cf. Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 365, 374-375. Upon review of the record we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">Compromise or Quotient Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-9\">The lease was for a term of fifteen years. Truck was in possession about 154 months and Mercury was in possession about 25 months or a ratio of 6 to 1. Each item of damage assessed by the jury against Truck and Mercury has the same ratio to one another, i. e., 6 to 1. It is argued that this phenomenon, when coupled with the lack of eviden-tiary support for the amount of damages awarded, proves that damages were apportioned according to the length of occupancy of Truck and Mercury. This, it is contended, amounts to a compromise or quotient verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">A quotient verdict is a chance verdict, that is, no juror knows what the verdict will be when he submits his vote on damages because the final amount is calculated by a pre-agreed formula. North Texas Producers Ass\u2019n v. Jenkins, 342 S.W.2d 192, 195 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Amarillo 1960, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.) The formula has historically taken the form of an averaged verdict. Each juror submits a figure and the foreman adds them and divides by twelve. Handley v. Leigh, 1852, 8 Tex. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">However, the mere use of a formula is not prohibited. In order to find jury misconduct there must be a preagreement by the jurors to abide by the results of the formula before it is actually computed. Texglass, Inc. v. Suhovy, 380 S.W.2d 904, 905-906 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Fort Worth 1964, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.); North Texas Producers Ass\u2019n v. Jenkins, <em>supra. </em>There is no evidence of any such agreement by the jury in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-13\">A compromise verdict is one where it is obvious that the jury compromised the issue of liability by awarding inadequate damages. National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Great Lakes Warehouse Corp., 7 Cir. 1958, 261 F.2d 35, 37-38. In a property damage suit, where the damages are virtually liquidated but the jury, nevertheless, awards a much smaller amount, the court may find inadequate damages. National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Great Lakes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>Warehouse Corp., <em>supra. </em>But this circumstance was not shown to exist <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">The Sub Lease Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">System and Truck assert that the sublease should be construed to mean that Mercury accepted the property \u201cas is\u201d in 1863 and contracted to return it in the same condition Truck (T.S.C.), not Mercury, received it in 1950. Accordingly, it is argued that Mercury obligated itself to bear the expense of any damage for which Truck would otherwise be responsible during its occupancy. Mercury counters that the agreement is ambiguous because this is obviously not what the parties had in mind. It interprets the sublease as meaning that it is responsible for returning the property at the end of the lease in the same condition in which it was received in 1963. The district court agreed with Mercury and limited its liability to the amount of damage which occurred during its occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">We are in complete agreement with the district court\u2019s clear analysis and disposition of this issue. Freight Terminals, Inc. v. Ryder System, Inc., S.D. Tex.1971, 326 F.Supp. 881, 887-890.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">The Stock Purchase Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">When System sold its interest in Truck to International in February, 1965, it represented that Truck was in compliance with all of its lease obligations and that it had no knowledge of any facts that might serve as the basis for litigation other than those in the usual and normal course of business.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It further agreed that these representations would survive the closing of the agreement and that it would indemnify International for any breach thereof.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">In March, 1970, International assigned all of its rights under the stock purchase agreement to Truck. The district court found that System breached its representations in that Truck was not in compliance with the terms of the lease with Freight Terminals and that System knew of this breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">We find no record support for System\u2019s argument that it had no knowledge that there were damages to the terminal facilities when the agreement was made in 1965. System admits that complaints about the condition of the yard were received prior to the signing of the agreement, and it was established that System knew that the repairs made by Evans did not fully restore the premises to their original condition less ordinary wear and tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-12\">System contends that even if it knew of the facts underlying the litigation at the time it entered into the agreement, the damages arose in the normal course of business and were expressly excepted from any warranties or representations made in the agreement. The district court properly held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">System further argues that it should not be liable under the agreement for any damages to the building or yard which occurred after the date of the agreement. Mercury was in possession of the premises at the time the agreement was executed and remained in possession until the lease expired. Although System was held liable to Freight Terminals for all damages and attorneys\u2019 fees under the lease, System is entitled to indemnification from Mercury for all damages that occurred during Mercury\u2019s occupancy and its proportionate amount of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">Under the agreement System assumed any and all costs relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>any breaches of its representations. Truck\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees are part of the costs involved resulting from System\u2019s breach of its representations. They were therefore properly considered and made part of the judgment. <em>See </em>Fisher Const. Co. v. Riggs, 320 S.W.2d 200 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Houston 1959) rev\u2019d on other grounds, 160 Tex. 23, 325 S.W.2d 126; B &amp; G Electric Co. v. G. E. Bass &amp; Co., Inc., 5 Cir. 1958, 252 F.2d 698, 700-701, cert. denied, 1958, 357 U.S. 931, 78 S.Ct. 1372, 2 L.Ed.2d 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">Mercury\u2019s Liability for Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Mercury assigns error in the district court\u2019s finding that it is liable for attorneys\u2019 fees to Freight Terminals. It reasons that there is no contractual basis for such an award because the district court found that the sublease agreement did not contain sufficient language to incorporate the original lease by reference. We agree that the district court found, and properly so, that liability under the original lease for all damages that occurred during the full term of the lease was not sufficiently incorporated into the sublease. The district court did not hold, however, that other obligations under the original lease could not be or were not incorporated into the sublease. Liability on Mercury\u2019s part for Truck\u2019s negligence and damage to the property was not incorporated into the sublease because that was not the intent of the parties. The court below found that \u201cthe only clear meaning that can be ascertained from the evidence presented in this case is that the parties intended that Mercury would assume the obligations of the \u2018repair\u2019 covenant from November 15, 1963, to the end of the lease period.\u201d The court necessarily also concluded, and we think properly, that the parties intended to incorporate the obligation to pay attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with enforcing the repair covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">.
