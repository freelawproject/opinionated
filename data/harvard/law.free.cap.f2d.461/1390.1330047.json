We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-9\">\n<em>The Subject Matter Claimed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-10\">Claims 11-13 and 15-21 are drawn to multiple emulsions in which the outermost phase is an aqueous solution, an intermediate phase consists of mineral or vegetable oil, and the innermost phase is an aqueous solution containing antigenic material. Claims 22-24 are drawn to a process for producing such multiple emulsions. We reproduce claims 11 and 22, with subparagraphing supplied, as illustrative :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-11\">11. An injectable antigen-containing multiple emulsion composition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-12\">which has prolonged stability upon storage,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-13\">which is mobile upon injection and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-14\">which has the outermost phase aqueous to give the composition a water-like viscosity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-15\">the said emulsion having its continuous phase aqueous and its primary disperse oil phase enclosing an aqueous phase containing antigenic material,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-16\">said oil being a therapeutically acceptable purified mineral oil or purified vegetable oil,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-17\">said composition being immunologically effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-18\">22. A process for the preparation of a stable, mobile, injectable antigen-containing composition in which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARb\">a water-in-oil emulsion having a continuous oil phase and a dispersed aqueous phase containing antigenic material is re-emulsified in an aqueous medium in the presence of a parenterally acceptable emulsifying agent of the type favoring the formation of oil-in-water emulsion</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6D\">whereby a multiple emulsion is obtained in which the continuous phase is aqueous and the primary disperse phase is an oil phase which encloses an aqueous phase containing antigenic material,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aup-dedup-0\">the oil being a therapeutically acceptable purified mineral oil or purified vegetable oil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-19\">The other claims add various limitations concerning particle size and specific antigens. While appellant\u2019s reply brief emphasized that his claims \u201care of varying scope and do not stand or fall together,\u201d he has failed to point out what relevance the additional limitations have to the patentability of the narrower claims, and we see no such relevance; accordingly, we agree with the solicitor that they do \u201cstand or fall together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Adex\">According to appellant\u2019s specification,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9e\">It is known to prepare vaccines in the form of water-in-oil emulsions in which the antigen is contained within the aqueous disperse phase and such adjuvant vaccines are used now both in the medical and veterinary fields. Adjuvant vaccines are frequently preferred to the simple vaccines in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>form of an aqueous solution or suspension of antigen because it is possible to achieve the desired immunological effect with a smaller amount of antigen. However, adjuvant vaccines in the form of water-in-oil emulsions are extremely viscous liquids and are not in practice packed in multi-dose containers because of the difficulty in extracting such emulsions from the container. Consequently, adjuvant vaccines in this form are usually distributed in disposable syringes or syringe inserts but the use of such disposable items is expensive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-4\">It has now been found that the viscosity problems associated with water-in-oil emulsion vaccines can be overcome and the need for disposable containers avoided if the adjuvant vaccine is prepared in the form of a multiple emulsion. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-5\">* * * -x- * -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-6\">Mineral oils are non-metabolisable and in the case of the known water-in-oil emulsion vaccines a depot of vaccine tends to remain at the site of the injection just below the skin and this often causes the subject some discomfort. In the case of the multiple emulsion compositions, however, the oil is dispersed in the continuous aqueous phase and becomes quite rapidly dispersed in the subject\u2019s body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">In compliance with the how-to-make requirement of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, appellant\u2019s specification states that \u201cAny of the well-known methods of preparing emulsions may be used to produce the compositions of the invention,\u201d and it then describes several.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-15\">\n<em>The Reference</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-16\">The sole reference is British patent No. 929,403, the specification of which was published June 19, 1963. It discloses water-in-oil emulsions encapsulated in gelling media. According to the specification,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-17\">-x- * -x- the novel products hereof are prepared by first forming a primary hydrophilic liquid-in-oil emulsion (the oil being a lipophilic liquid) containing an anti-inversion agent in the oil phase to prevent the inversion of the said emulsion. The said primary emulsion is then dispersed in an aqueous dispersion of at least two coacervating colloids,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at least one of which is gelable and at least one of' which is an isoelectric colloid, at a temperature above the gel point of the said gelable colloid. Dilution of the resulting double or secondary emulsion with water or adjustment of the pH causes the coac\u00e9rvate to deposit about the particles composed of the primary emulsion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1458-19\">It is on the secondary emulsion that the Patent Office relies here. Concerning it, the reference states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-20\">-x- * -x- the secondary emulsion exists during the interval between the first contact of all ingredients in the coacervating medium and the actual formation of the coac\u00e9rvate. The secondary emulsion is a double emulsion consisting of particles of the primary emulsion as the internal phase dispersed in the coacervating medium as the external phase. If the primary emulsion is added to the aqueous solution of the coacervating colloids, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>double or secondary emulsion will persist until dilution of the sol with water is carried to the point at which coacervation occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">It indicates that the two inner phases can contain a wide variety of active ingredients, the selection of which is limited \u201conly by the solubility, suspending characteristics' or compatibility of the active ingredients in both phases.\u201d Among the examples given are vitamins and pharmaceutical materials, and it is stated that \u201cSuch materials can be enclosed in coatings suitable for oral, topical or injectable use by regulation of the particle size and coating thickness, permeability and hardness or by selection of coacervating components.\u201d However, antigenic materials are not among the active ingredients expressly listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">\n<em>The Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-7\">The examiner rejected all of appellant's claims under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 as obvious in view of the British patent. The rejection was stated as follows in his answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-8\">This reference teaches injectable compositions comprising the active ingredient in water, which water is emulsified in oil with the aid of an emulsifying agent, and which water-in-oil emulsion is in term [sic; turn?] emulsified in an aqueous composition. To prepare an injectable composition comprising an active ingredient in water, which water is emulsified in oil, and which oil is emulsified in an aqueous composition, is doing that which is taught by the reference. The choice of antigens or particular antigens as the active ingredients to be employed is a matter well within the purview of those skilled in the art since it is conventional to administer antigens by injection. The selection of the optimum size of the dispersed phases is likewise seen to be a matter well within the purview of the artisan. Likewise, nothing patentable is seen in the claimed method of making the final eompo-sition since the reference teaches first preparing a water-in-oil composition in which the active ingredient is dispersed in the water phase and then dispersing this primary dispersion into an aqueous composition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-11\">The board treated the above as two separate rejections, one of all claims for obviousness, and one of claims 22-25 \u201cas being for the obvious method of preparing the final product.\u201d It sustained both. Concerning the first ground, it agreed with the examiner that the British patent\u2019s \u201ccoacervating colloids are not excluded from appellant\u2019s outermost aqueous phase as defined by the claims on appeal,\u201d and it rejected appellant\u2019s argument that the British patent does not disclose a \u201ctrue double emulsion.\u201d Appellant had based the latter contention on the argument that the double emulsion referred to in the reference has only a \u201ctransitory life,\u201d whereas appellant\u2019s claims all require stability, but the board noted that the British patent teaches that the double emulsion \u201cpersists,\u201d indicating that it would last indefinitely if not further treated. Concerning the second ground, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-12\">The only step specified by claim 22 (the only independent method claim) is the re-emulsification of the water-in-oil emulsion. There is nothing unobvious in such a step regardless of possible novelty in the final product hence the rejection is sustainable. In re Neugebauer et al., 51 CCPA 1138, 330 F.2d 353, 1964 CD 568, 806 OG 935, 141 USPQ 205.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-13\">\n<em>The Parties\u2019 Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-14\">Appellant argues that his product claims define water-in-oil <em>-in-water </em>emulsions and methods of making the same and thus do not read on the water-in-oil-in-coacervating-colloids emulsions and methods taught in the reference. He argues that \u201cThe coacervating medium of the British patent contains gelable material\u201d and that \u201cone would clearly never realistically conceive of injecting into a human or animal a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>which would gel either during the course of injection or thereafter.\u201d Appellant also again argues that the British patent is an inappropriate reference because the double emulsion which it discloses is \u201ctransitory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">Concerning the obvious-method rejection, appellant argues that it was improper because it cannot be obvious how to prepare a product which is itself non-obvious. He appears to admit that it would have been obvious how to make his products <em>given the products themselves </em>but urges that his products cannot be used as prior art against his process claims because they are disclosed in the same application. He also argues (1) that rejection on this basis is inconsistent with In re Tarczy-Hornoch, 397 F.2d 856, 55 CCPA 1441, (1968),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) that it is completely lacking in any statutory basis, and (3) that it is illogical because it leads to the anomalous result that the process claims are unpatentable if the product claims are presented, but are patentable if they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">The solicitor argues that \u201cthe instant claims do not limit the outermost aqueous phase solely to water\u201d and that they are therefore too broad in the sense of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. Additionally, he argues that this court rejected a \u201ctransitory intermediate\u201d argument very similar to the one appellant makes here in In re Fried, 329 F.2d 323, 327-328, 51 CCPA 1118, 1123 (1964), and that \u201cthere is nothing in this record which would establish that the secondary emulsion [disclosed in the reference] is not injectable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">According to the solicitor, the obvious-method rejection was \u201cunder \u00a7 112\u201d but he does not specify what language in \u00a7 112 he thinks supports such a rejection. However, it does not appear to make any difference to him whether there is any statutory support for the rejection because, according to him, the rejection was superfluous anyway:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-13\">Since the rationale upon which the \u00a7 112 rejection of claims 22-24 is based is the obviousness of the sole claimed step, both the \u00a7 103 and \u00a7 112 rejections of claims 22-24 stand or fall together. If the Court finds that the claimed subject is obvious under \u00a7 103, it becomes unnecessary to consider any rejection based on \u00a7 112. On the other hand, should the Court find that the claimed subject matter is not obvious under \u00a7 103, it is manifest that the claimed subject matter could not be drawn to an obvious method and therefore the rejection based on \u00a7 112 would fail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-14\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-15\">We agree with the solicitor that the fact that the double emulsions disclosed in the reference are only intermediates formed during the production of the products with which the reference is ultimately concerned does not detract from the efficacy of the British patent as a reference. In <em>Fried </em>we turned aside such an argument on the ground that Fried had produced no evidence \u201cto suggest that it is beyond the skill of a chemist to alter the reaction conditions and isolate the disclosed intermediate.\u201d See also, In re Sheppard, 339 F.2d 238, 241-242, 52 CCPA 859, 863-864 (1964). Here, the reference states unequivocally that \u201cthe secondary emulsion <em>exists </em>during the interval between the first contact of all ingredients in the coacervating medium and the actual formation of the coac\u00e9rvate\u201d and that \u201cthe double or secondary emulsion <em>will persist </em>until dilution of the sol with water is carried to the point at which coacervation occurs.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) Appellant has offered no proof that these statements are incorrect, so we must assume that they are correct. Hence, there is no isolation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>problem, and the result here follows a fortiori from <em>Fried </em>and <em>Sheppard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">We also agree with the solicitor that appellant\u2019s claims appear to read on the outermost aqueous phase of the secondary emulsion disclosed in the reference patent. Although appellant argues that \u201cClaims 11-13 and 15-21 define an injectable water-in-oil-in-water emulsion,\u201d all but one of these claims actually recite that \u201cthe outermost\u201d or \u201cthe continuous\u201d phase is <em>aqueous. </em>The single exception is claim 15, which recites that the claimed composition \u201cis in the form of a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion in which the continuous phase is aqueous * x While this language is somewhat ambiguous, we think that the express recitation that the continuous phase \u201cis aqueous\u201d outweighs the composite adjective indicating that the continuous phase is water and that claim 15 should accordingly be read no more narrowly than the others in this regard. Hackh\u2019s <em>Chemical Dictionary, </em>3d Ed., 1944, defines \u201caqueous\u201d simply as \u201cWatery\u201d and an aqueous solution as \u201cA solution prepared with water as the solvent.\u201d Dorland\u2019s <em>Medical Dictionary, </em>24th Ed. 1965, defines aqueous as \u201cWatery ; prepared with water.\u201d The reference refers to the continuous phase of the double emulsion which it discloses as \u201cthe aqueous solution of the coacervat-ing colloids,\u201d and we see no reason to read appellant\u2019s claims narrowly to exclude such aqueous solutions. Compare In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-1405, 56 CCPA 1381, 1396 (1969), and In re Finsterwalder, 436 F.2d 1028, 1032-1033, 58 CCPA 871, 876 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-7\">Appellant\u2019s best argument is that the recitation that his double emulsions are \u201cinjectable,\u201d which appears in every claim, excludes aqueous solutions of the type taught by the reference patent, since \u201cone would clearly never realistically conceive of injecting into a human or animal a material which would gel either during the course of injection or thereafter.\u201d He repeals this argument several times in various forms. However, the reference states that \u201cpharmaceutical materials * * * can be enclosed in coatings suitable for oral, topical or <em>injectable </em>use by regulation of the particle size and coating thickness, permeability and hardness or by selection of coacervating components.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) Granted, this disclosure refers to the coac\u00e9rvate itself, not to the secondary emulsion, as the examiner implied. However, if the coac\u00e9rvate itself is injectable (and appellant has not controverted this teaching), it would certainly seem that the secondary emulsion formed prior to coacervation would be. Accordingly, we hold that appellant has failed to prove on the present record that his recitation that his multiple emulsions are \u201cinjectable\u201d inherently excludes double emulsions of the type taught in the British reference. Cf. In re Mraz, 455 F.2d 1069, 1072-1073, 59 CCPA -, - (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we <em>affirm </em>the rejection of all claims as reading on obvious subject matter, and we therefore do not reach the additional rejection of claims 22-24 as drawn to the obvious method of making the product. The appeal is <em>dismissed </em>as to claim 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1457-20\">. Appellant also appealed from the rejection of claim 25 but withdrew this appeal prior to oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1458-8\">. The British patent states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-9\">The term \u201ccoacervating colloids\u201d refers to naturally occurring gelable and non-gelable hydrophilic colloids and examples of the coacervating colloids are gelatin, agar-agar, albumen, alginates, casein, pectins, acacia starch, fibrinogen starch acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate and amylose acetate phthalate and collagen, and that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-22\">* * * the term coacervation * * * relates to the process by which the liquid colloidal concentrate or coac\u00e9rvate is formed as a phase entity of the initial sol or solution. In its practical aspect, and as employed herein, coacervation relates to the process by which foreign materials present in the sol when the coac\u00e9r-vate is formed are enveloped or encapsulated by the coac\u00e9rvate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">. In In re Susi, 440 F.2d 442, 444, 58 CCPA 1074, 1076 n. 1 (1971), we noted that the parties had raised, but that we did not reach, \u201cthe interesting issue * * * of the continued vajidity of In re Larsen, 292 F.2d 531, 49 CCPA 711 (1961), in view of In re Tarczy-Hornoch * * Larsen was the basis of this court\u2019s holding in In re Neugebauer, cited by the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
