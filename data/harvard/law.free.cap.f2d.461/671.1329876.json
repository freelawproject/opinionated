The dispute arose in connection with the delivery of cars by the old Erie Railroad (Erie) to the D &amp; H\u2019s Liberty Street and Patch Yards at Binghamton, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">Under a May 6, 1946, agreement between the D &amp; H and the Union, certain designated Erie trains and \u201c[sjolid Erie trains of 40 cars or more\u201d were to be delivered directly to the Patch Yard of appellee by the Erie\u2019s own crews, while \u201c[a] 11 other cars coming in on Erie trains\u201d were to be left at the Liberty Street Yard and \u201cdelivered by D &amp; H yard crews\u201d to the Patch Yard. Since the 1960 merger between Erie and the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad (resulting in the Erie-Lacka-wanna Railroad), it has become increasingly difficult to apply the 1946 yard interchange agreement. Commingling of cars, consolidation of trains, and new schedules have complicated the task of identifying Erie cars and trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">In March 1967 the Union served upon the D &amp; H a \u201cSection 6 Notice,\u201d pursuant to 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 156, setting forth intended changes in the working agreement between the parties. As a counterproposal, elimination of the 1946 yard interchange agreement was put forth by the D &amp; H in its own Section 6 Notice. Following unproductive conferences between the parties the issues were submitted to the National Mediation Board (NMB), pursuant to 45 U.S. C. \u00a7 155. At this point, the issue was a \u201cmajor dispute\u201d within the Railway Labor Act, <em>see </em>Missouri-Illinois R. R. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Order of Ry. Conductors, 322 F.2d 793 (8th Cir. 1963), thus prohibiting the issuance of any injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">On September 11, 1970, the Union threatened the strike now enjoined, claiming that the D &amp; H had by its conduct eliminated the 1946 yard agreement, thereby unlawfully changing the status quo of a matter before the NMB. The D &amp; H thereupon immediately withdrew its counterproposal to eliminate the 1946 yard agreement, advised the Union accordingly, and promptly sought and obtained a temporary restraining order from the District Court for the Northern District of New York. A permanent injunction ultimately issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">This appeal was essentially briefed on the question whether the appellee was estopped from treating this dispute as a \u201cminor\u201d one, since elimination of the 1946 yard agreement was included by the D &amp; H in its Section 6 notice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Port held \u2014 quite properly, we think \u2014 that neither the filing nor the withdrawing of the D &amp; H\u2019s counterproposal to eliminate the 1946 yard agreement determined the nature of the dispute. In doing so he followed Judge Waterman\u2019s admonition, in Rutland Ry. Corp. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 307 F.2d 21, 33 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 954, 83 S.Ct. 949, 9 L.Ed.2d 978 (1963), that the label placed on a dispute by the contestants should not be given \u201cundue emphasis.\u201d <em>See also </em>In re Hudson &amp; Manhattan R. R., 172 F.Supp. 329 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom. </em>Stichman v. General Grievance Committee of the Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen, 267 F.2d 941 (2d Cir. 1959) (per curiam), cert. denied, 363 U. S. 843, 80 S.Ct. 1608, 4 L.Ed.2d 1727 (1960). Since the resolution of the dispute required interpretation of the 1946 yard agreement, the court below also quite properly held that the dispute was a \u201cminor\u201d one under the Act. In re Hudson &amp; Manhattan R.R., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">At oral argument the Union, apparently realizing that its legal position on the merits was derailed, made the main track of its argument a request for court permission allowing individual employees to file claims in respect to the alleged failure of the D &amp; H to abide by the 1946 yard agreement. Such permission is sought for a period running at least from April 24, 1969, the date on which the Union wrote the D &amp; H superintendent seeking the symbols of Erie-Laekawanna trains being delivered to the D &amp; H at Binghamton, to January 8, 1971, the date on which the D &amp; H informed the court below, after trial on the merits, that the issue had been submitted to the NRAB for the binding decision it may make (note 3 <em>supra). </em>The equity in the Union\u2019s position arises from the 30-day time limitation on the filing of claims for loss of work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Until the dispute was actually submitted to the NRAB, individual employees were mistakenly lulled into not filing claims, relying upon the D &amp; H\u2019s treatment of the dispute as a \u201cmajor\u201d one by having made its Section 6 counterproposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">Although an argument may be made for limiting the time within which claims may be filed to the date of September 11, 1970, when the D &amp; H withdrew its Section 6 notice, we believe there is substantial merit to the Union\u2019s equitable position. See L. Hand, J., in Albert v. Martin Custom Made Tires Corp., 116 F.2d 962, 965 (2d Cir. 1941) (\u201cMistake is one of the commonest grounds for equitable relief . . . . \u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>We are not in a position, as an appellate court, however, to determine and delineate the true equities in this situation on this record. We do not know, indeed, whether there are in fact claims which arose during this period. We do not wish, on a record insufficient for this purpose, to limit the district court\u2019s determination of appropriate dates within which accrued claims should be allowed, or the time within which they must now be filed or forever barred. All of these matters are entirely appropriate for the district court\u2019s exercise of its equitable jurisdiction to the end that justice may be wrought.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Order granting injunction affirmed, case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-13\">.
