J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A9n\">This is an appeal by William Sudol from convictions on two indictments tried together.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The first indictment charges him, his wife\u2019s sister Irene Museosky, and her husband Walter Muscosky with assisting Eva Muszynska in performing an abortion upon Sudol\u2019s wife, Elizabeth, contrary to the statute <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:87-l. Under the other indictment, Sudol, Mrs. Sudol, Irene and one Vincent Drongoski, the husband of another sister of Elizabeth, are charged with a conspiracy, as follows: to obtain back from Eva the $175 that had been paid her for the abortion; to secure an additional sum by pretending, contrary to the fact, that Mrs. Sudol was suffering from peritonitis in a hospital; to get Vincent to impersonate a police officer falsely; and not to report the commission of a crime. The jury found Sudol and Irene guilty on both indictments. The other defendants were acquitted \u2014 Eva by order of the court upon a basis that is not pertinent to the problems before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Sudol by his appeal raises three points. Eirst, he claims that the State failed to prove that Mrs. Sudol was pregnant, and hence that his motion for acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case should have been granted with respect to the indictment for abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Upon an indictment for abortion made under <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:87-l, it is incumbent on the State to establish that the woman is \u201cpregnant.\u201d <em>State v. Loomis, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>216, 217 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1917); <em>State v. Clifford, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>529, 530 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945), affirmed 133 <em>N. J. L. </em>312 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945); <em>State v. King, </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>480, 481, 482 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945), affirmed 135 <em>N. J. L. </em>286 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1946); <em>State v. Gedicke, </em>43 <em>N. J. L. </em>86, 91 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1881); <em>State v. Edwards, </em>9 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>34, 36 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1930). In this respect, the statute differs from the common law, for there an indictment did not lie unless the woman was quick with child. <em>State v. Siciliano, </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>249, 257 (1956). It differs, too, from the statutes in force in many jurisdictions today, including England, under which one other than the woman may bo held for the offense though the woman is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>fact not pregnant. Annot., 46 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1393, 1404-1408 (1956); 24 and 25 <em>Vict., c. </em>100, \u00a7 58 (1861); 10 <em>Hals. Laws </em>731 <em>(3d ed.); Reg. v. </em>Goodchild, 2 <em>Car. &amp; K. </em>293, 175 <em>Eng. Rep. </em>121 (1846).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"> On the motion for acquittal, the question presented by the New Jersey statute was whether evidence had been adduced from which a jury could legitimately draw, beyond a reasonable doubt, an inference of pregnancy. <em>State v. Kollarik, </em>22 <em>N. J. </em>558, 564 (1956). Under the practice, to which we adhere, that question must be resolved upon the evidence produced before the State\u2019s case had been closed. <em>State v. </em>Pearson, 39 <em>N. J. Super. </em>50, 56 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We turn then to the evidence of pregnancy. Except as otherwise noted, we shall rely upon the testimony of Eva who, after being acquitted, was called to the stand by the State. The Sudols had four children, of whom (according to the opening made by Sudol\u2019s attorney before the jury) three were in an institution (an orphanage) and the fourth lived with Sudol\u2019s mother. Mrs. Sudol (calling herself Mrs. Cervas) and her sister Irene came to Eva, telling her that Mrs. Sudol had missed a menstrual period and soliciting her to perform an abortion. When Eva said she might have her period in a few days, Mrs. Sudol replied she was sure she wouldn\u2019t, because she had been given a \u201crabbit test.\u201d Eva said that she did not perform abortions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Two days later the two women again called upon Eva, this time with Sudol. To Eva, Sudol said (we are, as we have mentioned, relying on Eva\u2019s testimony, and the language reflects her own rather broken English) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u201cI ask you be so kind and kelp my wife. She lost her menstruation; then we don\u2019t want to have any children. We got four. That is enough for us. I have to pay for one month for four children $160. Then I absolutely don\u2019t want any more. We can not have it. We work together, with wife. It is enough for take care of family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">it * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">If you don\u2019t want believe my wife is pregnant, you could examine her. Then you will be sure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Accordingly, Eva examined Mrs. Sudol manually and, after-wards, replied that she didn\u2019t appear to be pregnant. Eva <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>questioned Mrs. Sudol, asking whether she had had any signs of pregnancy, and Mrs. Sudol answered that she didn\u2019t expect signs until after the lapse of nearly three months of pregnancy. Sudol returned within a few days, again pleading with Eva to perform the abortion. Eva refused. He then offered her $175. Eva claims she turned that down, and that he then put something to her side, declaring that if she didn\u2019t help, she was \u201cgoing to drop dead right now.\u201d She professes that this so frightened her that she agreed to do as asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The next evening Sudol, his wife and Irene appeared once more at Eva\u2019s home. In answer to Eva\u2019s inquiry, Mrs. Sudol said she had not yet had any signs of pregnancy, other than gas pains, but these had bothered her so much that she could not work (she was then employed), whereupon Eva gave her an enema to relieve the pains. Later Mrs. Sudol paid her $175 for the alleged abortion, and arrangements were made to have Eva perform the operation at Irene\u2019s home the next day. In Sudol\u2019s presence Eva gave Irene a sterilized apron and a package of instruments, including a forceps, a vaginal speculum (an instrument used for the inspection of a uterus) and a scraper or sharp curette (used for the removal of debris or placental material from a uterus).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The following afternoon Sudol was in the living room of Irene\u2019s home, and Mrs. Sudol, Eva and Irene were in the bedroom. The doors, it is to be noted, were open. Eva undertook the abortion inserting the speculum and using the scraper in Mrs. Sudol\u2019s womb. She testified that she removed a \u201clump of blood, very dark, like liver,\u201d but found no fetus or placenta. Mrs. Sudol, however, in her confession to the police said that Eva showed her a piece of flesh about two inches long which had been taken from her uterus. Although this testimony is mentioned in the briefs on both sides, nevertheless a short time before it was adduced at the trial there was a general objection by Sudol\u2019s attorney to a prior question, on the ground that a wife could not testify against her husband and that hence (apparently) her confession to the police could not be used against him. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>court ruled that each witness was to testily to what he \u201cdid separately, not involving [his or her] spouse.\u201d The ruling is not entirely clear, but we shall assume that the court held that Mrs. Sudol\u2019s confession to the police was not to be taken as binding on her husband. We therefore have decided to disregard the testimony as to the piece of flesh.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In any event, despite Eva\u2019s denial of a fetus or any placenta, she herself testified she told Mrs. Sudol as she was finishing the scraping of the uterus, \u201cNow is clean. Nothing there except blood [as if to say that something had been there other than blood] * * * Now I am finished already.\u201d At that moment, as she removed the speculum from the vaginal canal, Sudol stood in the doorway and took a flashlight picture of Eva and the lower portion of his wife\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Sudol in his statement to the police puts it this way. He said he was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">\u201cnot in the room when the abortion * * * was performed while [Eva] was in there with [Mrs. Sudol]. He heard a remark made, \u2018there, honey, the pain will soon be over\u2019, and a little while later said again, \u2018there, honey, everything is over.\u2019 At this point * * * Sudol said he decided he thought it would be a good idea to snap a picture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">The picture was received in evidence, and Sudol\u2019s attorney admitted for the record that Sudol took it and that the body which appears in the picture is that of his wife (the picture is damaging evidence on the indictment for conspiracy to obtain money from Eva).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">We return to Eva\u2019s testimony. After the taking of the picture, Eva demanded of Sudol \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d He responded \u201cThat means you did abortion for my wife; that I got evidence.\u201d Sudol took her instruments and asked for $4,000, including a return of the $175. When Eva pleaded with Mrs. Sudol to intercede, the latter started crying saying, \u201che wouldn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d Sudol later turned upon his wife (we observe again that this is Eva\u2019s rather broken English), \u201cI don\u2019t want you any more; I don\u2019t need you any more; if I want woman I am going to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>anyone and any time. I am going to take divorce from you.\u201d Mrs. Sudol cried so loudly that Eva thought she was going to be terribly sick. Later he said to Eva, \u201cI have no pity for nobody. I want to make easy money if I get a chance.\u201d And further: \u201cI want just money. I am psychiatrist; I am mindreader; I know I am going to get money, as I want from you.\u201d We need not, for the purposes of this or the next point, relate more of this sordid story, as told by Eva. The defendants, when they took the stand, had a different tale to tell.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">It is argued on SudoTs behalf that his wife was pretending she was pregnant, merely playing a role in a conspiracy to extort money from Eva. But in the face of the testimony referred to, it was plainly open to the jury to find to the contrary. Besides, with Eva\u2019s testimony that a scraping of the womb \u201churts terrible,\u201d the jury could have doubted that she submitted to the operation merely for the purposes of extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">With this evidence in view, we turn to the question raised by Sudol\u2019s first point, namely, whether the County Court should have directed an acquittal on the ground that the State had not adduced sufficient proof that Mrs. Sudol was pregnant. Pregnancy is a condition beginning at the moment of conception and terminating with the delivery of the child. <em>State v. Loomis, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>216, 218 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The State relies on Mrs. Sudol\u2019s statements to Eva that she had missed her menstrual period and was sure she was pregnant. There are authorities that may be said to hold that the woman\u2019s admission of pregnancy, at least under some circumstances, is sufficient to raise a jury question as to the matter of pregnancy. <em>People v. Emery, </em>79 <em>Cal. App. 226, </em>179 <em>P. 2d </em>843, 846 <em>(App. Ct. </em>1947); <em>State v. Alcorn, </em>7 <em>Idaho </em>599, 64 <em>P. </em>1014, 1016 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1901); <em>State v. Keester, </em>134 <em>Kan. </em>64, 4 <em>P. 2d </em>679, 683, 684 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1931); 3 <em>Burdick, Crimes </em>(1946), 291, 292; <em>cf. State v. Gedicke, </em>43 <em>N. J. L. </em>86, 88, 94 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1881); <em>State v. Horwitz, </em>108 <em>Conn. </em>53, 142 <em>A. </em>470, 472 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>1928); <em>Com. v. Leger, </em>264 <em>Mass. </em>217, 162 <em>N. E. </em>337, 338 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1928); <em>State v. </em>Ryder, 80 <em>Vt. </em>422, 68 <em>A. </em>652, 653 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1908). But where a woman\u2019s declaration of pregnancy is based merely on the omission of one menstrual period, can we say that it alone constitutes sufficient proof of pregnancy, warranting a denial of a motion for acquittal? There was no medical proof on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We need not stop on that question. Here, in addition, we have Mrs. Sudol\u2019s assertion that she had had a rabbit test, and more than that, statements of hers indicating that the test was positive. Passing over the question whether we should take judicial notice of claims made by medical texts as to the accuracy of the test (see <em>Report of Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Evidence </em>166-167 (1955); <em>Report of Legislative Commission on Evidence </em>67 (1956); see <em>Gray\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 Textbook of Medicine (2d ed. </em>1940), 705, making certain assertions as to the accuracy of the rabbit test (the Friedman test) and stating that it or a variation of it \u201cis now * * * almost invariably used for the determination of pregnancy throughout the civilized world\u201d), we conclude in any event that we can take judicial notice that it is a widely known test. Indeed, the court below in a colloquy with counsel, and without any objection on their part, indirectly referred to the rabbit test as an \u201cabsolute\u201d test of pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">It is asserted in Sudol\u2019s brief that statements of Mrs. Sudol to Eva as to her pregnancy and as to the rabbit test cannot bind him; that as to him they are hearsay. But no objection was made on this score during Eva\u2019s testimony. Six days earlier in the trial, there had been an objection to which we have referred in connection with the two-inch piece of flesh. But when Eva was on the stand, Sudol\u2019s attorney at one point admitted that Eva could \u201ctestify as to what [Mrs. Sudol] told her, but not as to what [Mrs. Sudol] said her husband said * * *. Anything that [Mrs.] Sudol said is all right but not as to what she claimed her husband said.\u201d Indeed, when the State sought to elicit statements made by Eva to the police containing admissions made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Mrs. Sudol to Eva, Sudol\u2019s attorney objected, saying \u201clet Eva * * * take the stand\u201d and, at another point, \u201cthe best testimony is Eva * * * herself.\u201d The State, by putting Eva on the stand later, might be said to have been meeting this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">There are other circumstances here. Was there not a jury question whether Eva performed the abortion operation under duress? And if the jury could have found that she did it without any coercion, was there not a further jury question whether she (experienced as she was in these matters) had reason to believe that there was a pregnancy when she operated? Moreover, there is the <em>lump </em>of blood, very dark, like liver, and the question as to the size of an embryo six weeks or so of age. Furthermore, there are the so-called \u201cgas pains.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Bearing in mind these various things, we think there was sufficient to take the case to the jury on the issue of pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Sudol in his second point attacks the trial court\u2019s ruling that statements given to the police by each of the conspirators are binding on the others. Sudol\u2019s brief refers to six such rulings at the trial. But was there a sufficient objection? Preliminarily we should observe that it is by no means clear that the objection at the places cited in the brief had to do with the conspiracy indictment. Indeed, at one point relied upon in the brief, it appears that his attorney said expressly to the trial court that he did not dispute the ruling. However, passing that, it nevertheless definitely appears that the court\u2019s attention was not called to the point, now presented, namely, that statements of the conspirators made <em>after their </em>arrest, were not in furtherance of the conspiracy. An objection should be so stated as to apprise the court satisfactorily of the \u201cgrounds therefor.\u201d <em>R. R. </em>4:47.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">It is first to be observed that the point now advanced is supported by the authorities, that is to say, the rule is that statements of one of the conspirators made after their arrest had terminated the conspiracy, are not admissible as against a co-conspirator. <em>State v. </em>Costa, 11 <em>N. J. </em>239, 248 (1953); <em>State v. </em>Simon, 113 <em>N. J. L. </em>521, 529 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>1934), affirmed 115 <em>N. J. L. </em>207 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1935); <em>State v. Dougherty, </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>525, 539, 542, 543 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1915); <em>Fiswick v. United States, </em>329 <em>U. S. </em>211, 217, 67 <em>S. Ct. </em>224, 91 <em>L. Ed. </em>196, 201 (1946); <em>Krulewitch v. United States, </em>336 <em>U. S. </em>440, 442, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>716, 93 <em>L. Ed. </em>790, 793, 794 (1949); <em>Paoli v. United States, </em>77 <em>S. Ct. </em>294 (1957); <em>Morgan, \u201cRationale of Vicarious Admissions \u201d </em>42 <em>Han L. Rev. </em>461, 464 (1929). Indeed, the State practically concedes this, and the very case cited by it to the trial court in another connection, <em>State v. Herbert, </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>341, 359 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1918), may be said to sustain the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Furthermore, the trial court itself was quite aware of the principle. It charged the jury\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201c* * * Under the law, where a conspiracy is once established, and <em>until the completion and consummation of the objective in view, </em>if the conspiracy lasts that long, every act and declaration of one conspirator in pursuance of the original concerted plan, done and in furtherance of the common objective, even in the absence of the other conspirator or conspirators, is, in contemplation of the law, the act and declaration of the other conspirators, and is, therefore, evidence against each, and each are deemed to assent to or command what is said or done by any of them in furtherance of the common objective of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\"># * * s|s #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">But * * * whatever any of these defendants said about a co-defendant, whatever he may have said regarding his part in the conspiracy, after the perpetration of the overt act or acts and the completion and consummation of the objective, is not evidence against said co-conspirators. And that means, of course, after it has been all completed and their conspiracy is ended, they can not act or testify for each other, for their acts and deeds or words are not binding on each other after the conspiracy has ended.\u201d (Italics added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Thus, there is reason to say that if the point had been raised below, it probably would have been sustained. The question then is, should we reverse? The plain error rule is not adverted to. <em>R. R. </em>1:5-1 (a); State <em>v. Landeros, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>69, 73 (1955); <em>State v. D\u2019Ippolito, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>540, 548 (1955); <em>State v. Dunphy, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>531, 537 (1955); <em>State v. Haines, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>550, 565 (1955); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>204 <em>F. 2d </em>745, 748, 749 (7 <em>Cir. </em>1953), commenting on <em>Rule </em>52(b), <em>Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>However, should wo, of our own motion, invoke the plain error rule on a point that is fully argued? In connection with that rule (as well as with the harmless error rule) we attempt to assay the effect of the error, not upon our own minds, but upon the minds of the jury. Moreover, we have regard for the total picture produced by the evidence on both sides, including the testimony erroneously admitted. <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 <em>U. S. </em>750, 764, 66 <em>S. Ct. </em>1239, 90 <em>L. Ed. </em>1557, 1566 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In dealing with this whole point, we seem to be concerned only with statements to the police made by the three persons who are charged with having conspired with Sudol, namely, Mrs. Sudol, Irene and Yincent Drongoski. Yinceut\u2019s confession was the only one put into evidence. But portions of the other two confessions were brought out by a policewoman who typed them, and they were used also on cross-examination of Mrs. Sudol and Irene, who denied or failed to remember most statements contained therein. Resolving doubts in favor of the appellant on his first point, we assumed above, in connection with the State\u2019s proof as to the two-inch piece of flesh, that the court ruled that Mrs. Sudol\u2019s statement to the police was not to be regarded as binding on her husband. However, there seems to have been no such limitation put upon the statement at certain points of the case. Accordingly \u2014 and again in order to resolve doubts in favor of the appellant \u2014 we will assume for the purposes of this point that her statement to the police was brought into the case as against Sudol in violation of the rule now under consideration' \u2014 that is, notwithstanding that it was made after the conspiracy had come to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">This brings us to a consideration of all the evidence adduced by the State and the defense, including the statements of Mrs. Sudol, Irene and Yincent Drongoski. It must be borne in mind, incidentally, that the statements, which these persons made to Eva during the existence of the conspiracy and in furtherance of its objectives, are admissible as against Sudol. <em>State v. Yedwab, </em>43 <em>N. J. Super. </em>367 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>After surveying the entire record and analyzing with particularity the portions of Mrs. Sudol\u2019s, Irene\u2019s and Vincent\u2019s statements which were admitted into evidence, we are satisfied that it could not be said that the admission of the same worked, or may well have worked, an unjust result as to Sudol. Such evidence as was adduced thereby seems to have been a comparatively minor part of a strong case against Sudol. That being so, we should not invoke the plain error rule. <em>State v. Haines, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>550, 565 (1955); <em>State v. Picciotti, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>205, 211 (1953); <em>State v. Ferrell, </em>29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>183, 188 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Sudol\u2019s third and final point is that the trial court erroneously ruled that if Sudol\u2019s attorney wanted to inspect statements used to refresh the recollection of a witness, then the statements would go into evidence. However, it does not appear that Sudol\u2019s attorney did want to inspect these statements. The issue now raised was not really presented below.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
