A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Asv\">This matter comes to us on appeal from a judgment of the County Court where the following opinion was filed:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">\u201cThis is an appeal from a determination of facts and rule for judgment entered in the Few Jersey Department of Labor and Industry, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division, wherein the petitioner was awarded 100% of total permanent disability for an occupational disease involving both hands and known medically as a Dupuytrens Contracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">\u201cAccording to the medical testimony a Dupuytrens Contracture is a condition in which the structures of the palm of the hand become involved in a scar-like contracture, the skin and fat under it being bound down to the fascia, the fascia itself becoming thickened and shortened, the tendon sheaths and tendons themselves subsequently becoming thickened and shortened. It manifests itself by a curling up of the hand, first in the ring finger and then the little finger and middle finger. It keeps curling up as time goes on. There is no doubt that the petitioner suffers from this disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">\u201cAt the time of the hearing the petitioner testified he was 58 years of age and had been driving trucks for 40 years; that for the past 14 or 15 years he had been employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the respondent and had been driving 15-ton tank trailer trucks, sometimes 400-500 miles a day on long runs; that he was required to handle loading hoses weighing 60-70 pounds. In September of 1950 he began to notice the formation of callous on his hands and in September of 1951 because of swelling had to have a ring cut from the ring finger of his right hand. Thereafter the condition grew worse and it became necessary for him to start refusing long trips. His employment terminated in August of 1952 when the company moved to Port Heading, New Jersey, and he felt it was too great a distance for him to travel from his home each day.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u201cIn the case of <em>Soukup v. Friedman Marble &amp; Slate Works, </em>255 <em>App. Div. </em>249, 7 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>440 <em>(App. Div. </em>1938), leave to appeal denied, 280 <em>N. Y. </em>852, 19 <em>N. E. 2d </em>686 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1938), Dupuytrens Contracture was held to be an occupational disease. As early as 1938 the New Jersey Workmen^ Compensation Bureau recognized Dupuytrens Contracture as an occupational disease. <em>Mesko v. Overman Cushion Tire Co., </em>16 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>182 <em>(W. C. B. </em>1938). However, compensation was not allowed inasmuch as it was not a scheduled disease under the then existing occupational disease statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-31. The Legislature saw fit to amend this section in 1949 <em>(L. </em>1949, c. 29, \u00a7 2) and substituted all occupational diseases for the scheduled list of diseases theretofore set forth. The pertinent provision is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cCompensable occupational disease\u201d defined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">Dor the purposes of this article, the phrase \u201ccompensable occupational disease\u201d shall include all diseases arising out of and in the course of employment, which are due to causes and conditions which are or were characteristic of or peculiar to a particular trade, occupation, process or employment, or <em>tohish diseases are due to the ewposure of any employee to a cause thereof arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u2019 N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-31, as amended. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">See <em>Bondar v. Simmons Co., </em>23 <em>N. J. Super. </em>109 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952), affirmed on opinion below, 12 <em>N. J. </em>361 (1953), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>for an informative and comprehensive dissertation on the effect of this amendment; also <em>Giambattista v. Thomas A. Edison, Inc., 32 N. J. Super. </em>103 <em>(App. Dim. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u201cFrom the medical evidence adduced at the hearing below I am satisfied that the condition suffered by the petitioner is causally Telated to his employment as a truck driver. The medical expert who testified for the petitioner stated that the condition affecting petitioner\u2019s hands arose out of the \u25a0continued and repeated driving of heavy equipment and the handling of heavy apparatus. The medical expert for respondent stated that the cause of a Dupuytrens Contracture was unknown. The history of the onset of petitioner\u2019s condition and the weight of the medical evidence supports the Division\u2019s finding that the claw-like condition of petitioner\u2019s hand was traumatically induced by the rigors of his employment. The essential elements do not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt; it is sufficient if there is \u2018a probable or more probable hypothesis with reference to the possibility of other hypotheses.\u2019 <em>Lohndorf v. Peper Bros. Paint Co., </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>156, 159 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1946), affirmed 135 <em>N. J. L. 352 (E. &amp; A. </em>1947); <em>Carpenter v. Calco Chemical Div., Am. Cyanamid Co., </em>4 <em>N. J. Super. 53 (App. Div. </em>1949); <em>Mergel v. New Jersey Conveyors Corp., </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>609 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u201cWhile I did not consider it determinative, I was, nevertheless, impressed by the fact that the disability in question manifested itself in the particular members that the petitioner, who otherwise enjoyed good health, had for so many years used in the operation of the respondent\u2019s large trailer trucks and heavy hoses. It is not surprising that the human organism gives way at the point of the greatest strain and stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cRespondent further contends that the employer in this instance was not afforded timely notice in accordance with <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-33. By its terms this section of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act prescribes the methods whereby notice is deemed to have been given to the employer of an occupational disease, and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201c \u2018Notice to employer or insurance carrier of occupational disease</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac6\">Unless the employer during the continuance of the employment shall have actual knowledge that the employee has contracted a compensable occupational disease, or unless the employee or someone on his behalf, or some of his dependents, or someone on their behalf, shall give the employer written notice or claim that the employee has contracted a compensable occupational disease, which notice to be effective must be given within a period of five months after the date when the employee shall have ceased to be subject to exposure to the occupational disease, or within ninety days after the employee knew or ought to have known the nature of his disability and its relation to his employment, whichever period is later in duration, no compensation shall be payable on account of the death or disability by occupational disease of the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">Under this section, notice to or knowledge on the part of the-employer shall be deemed notice to or knowledge, as the case may be, on the part of the insurance carrier; and notice to or knowledge on the part of the insurance carrier shall be deemed notice to or knowledge, as the case may be, on the part of the employer.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u201cThe deputy director in his findings determined that the employer herein acquired actual knowledge of the condition when the petitioner exhibited his hands to Leon Kowalska, a brother of the president of the respondent company, stating at the same time, look at the way the hands are going.\u2019 However, the entire testimony discloses that Leon Kowalska was not employed by the company and such knowledge on his part was not chargeable to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u201cThe petitioner terminated his employment with the respondent on August 29, 1952. On November 24, 1952 the attorney for the petitioner served a written notice by registered mail upon the respondent and supplemented same by a further written notice on December 30, 1952. The respondent was notified by the latter letter that the petitioner had contracted an occupational disease while in its employ. Both letters were placed in evidence at the hearing below. I find that the notice of December 30, 1952, having been served within five months of August 29, 1952 and within five months after he had ceased to be subject to exposure to the occupational disease with this employer, was a sufficient compliance with the requirements of <em>B. 8. </em>34:15-33 both as to time and content.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201cThe final ground of appeal is as to the <em>quantum </em>of the award. The award of 100% of total permanent disability was apparently predicated on the testimony of petitioner\u2019s medical expert, Doctor Uhry, a New York practitioner, who admittedly was unfamiliar with the method of estimating disability under the New Jersey statute. Dr. Uhry based his estimate of 100% of total permanent disability on the relationship of the disability to petitioner\u2019s occupation as a truck driver. This method, however, does not meet the standards prescribed by our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u201cIt has long been established in this State that disability is measured by its effect on the efficiency of the workman\u2019s body or its member in the ordinary pursuits of life, rather than the immediate impairment of earning power derived from a particular occupation. <em>Everhart v. Newark Cleaning &amp; Dyeing Co., </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>108 <em>(E. &amp; A. 1937); Cooper v. Cities Service Oil Co., </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>181 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u201cMoreover, Dr. Uhry conceded that in that light he regarded the petitioner\u2019s disability as partial. There was undisputed evidence below that petitioner had been employed as a truck driver as late as a month prior to the hearing. It is true that he testified that his activities were restricted by reason of his disability. However, taking into consideration the testimony of Dr. Yisconti, the respondent\u2019s expert, that the petitioner\u2019s disability at the time of the hearing amounted to 50% of total permanent disability, and considering, also, all of the other circumstances of this case, I find the amount of petitioner\u2019s disability to be 60% of permanent total disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Subject to some comment set out herein which does not alter any matter of substance, the.judgment is affirmed for the reasons stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">It is patent from the language of both the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division and the County Court that Duncan was found to be suffering from a compensable disabling occupational disease. However, we note that in the course of discussion, the County Court said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u201cThe history of the onset of petitioner\u2019s condition and the weight of the medical evidence supports the Division\u2019s finding that the claw-like condition of petitioner\u2019s hand (sic) was traumatically induced by the rigors of his employment.\u201d (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"> In order to avoid any misapprehension that may possibly arise, attention is called to the word \u201ctraumatically.\u201d Trauma signifies injury or wound; traumatically connotes resulting from trauma, injury or wound. <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. </em>1934). In the context of the opinion, the word does not mean that a finding of accidental injury was intended, or even that the contracture was due to continuous minimal traumata as in <em>Bondar v. Simmons Co., supra. </em>It simply means that the multiple and varied pressures on the employee\u2019s hands that were regularly incidental to his employment activity, induced the disease. And \u201cinduced\u201d in the statutory sense <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-31) in -workmen\u2019s compensation cases of this typo, signifies that the disease is \u201cdue to the exposure\u201d of ihe employee \u201cto a cause thereof arising out of and in the course of [the] employment.\u201d Moreover, the right to recovery is not interfered with because the employee happens to be predisposed or unusually or peculiarly susceptible to the disease. <em>Giambattista v. Thomas A. Edison, Inc., </em>32 <em>N. J. Super. </em>103, 111 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954); <em>Stepnowski v. Specific Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>495 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>Griffin v. Griffin &amp; Webster, Inc., </em>283 <em>App. Div. </em>145, 126 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>672 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953); 1 <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>(1952), \u00a7 41.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The nature of our review of concordant factual determinations of the Division and the County Court has been reiterated recently by the Supreme Court. To warrant a reversal thereof, it must appear that the findings are \u201cpalpably erroneous\u201d and \u201cso plainly unjustified by the evidence that the interests of justice\u201d necessitate \u201ctheir nullification.\u201d <em>Mahoney v. Nitroform Co., </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>499 (1956). The record before us reveals substantial evidence in support of the findings and accordingly we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The action of the County Court in reducing the award from total permanent disability to 60% of total is made the subject of a cross-appeal by the employee. He argues that the allowance is inadequate, and the employer, as a separate ground on the main appeal, contends that it is excessive (even if recovery is proper). As to the admeasurement of disability, see in addition to the eases referred to, <em>Everhart v. Newark Cleaning &amp; Dyeing Co., </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>474, 476 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938); <em>Kalson v. Star Electric Motor Co., </em>15 <em>N. J. Super. </em>565 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1951), affirmed 21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>15 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The County Court appears to have been influenced largely by the undisputed testimony that Duncan had been employed as a truck driver as late as a month prior to the hearing. The probative force of that fact is impressive \u2014 even though the Deputy Director examined the condition of Duncan\u2019s hands. Eurther, at the oral argument, by consent we were permitted to inspect, \u201cfor what it is worth,\u201d an unsigned report dated October 6, 1955, which purported to show that he had worked regularly as a truck driver for another employer from January through September 30, 1955, and was still employed. His gross earnings per week for the six-week period between the week ending August 26 and September 30 were a minimum of $119.93 and maximum of $146.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The state of the proof as to incapacity (aside from the employment report referred to) is such as to lead us to the conclusion that the estimate of 60% of total is adequately sanctioned. It may be noted that in the event of either decrease or increase thereof, a revision may be ordered on proper application to the Division. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
