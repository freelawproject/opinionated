Ayers, deceased, alleging an indebtedness, in his life-time, to them; that he caused certain real estate paid for by him to be conveyed to his wife, Mary Francis Ayers, the defendant; that he conveyed certain other real estate, through a third,party, to his wife; that he improved such real estate at great cost, after such conveyances, at his own expense; that such conveyances were made and accepted for the purpose of hin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>dering, delaying and defrauding the creditors of said W. H. Ayers; that he afterward died insolvent; that defendant was appointed his administratrix, but has no personal assets to pay plaintiffs\u2019 debt of 81,900, or any part thereof, and that deceased left no other real estate than that described in the complaint. Relief was asked that such conveyances be set aside and that plaintiffs\u2019 debt be charged upon the said real estate, and paid therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-5\">The special term, upon demurrer to said complaint, as not stating a cause of action, overruled the same, and sustained the complaint.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b641-6\"><em>James Lansing, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtM2\">cited <em>McElwain </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>9 Wend. 548; <em>Brinkerhoff </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>4 Johns.

S. 747 <em>(of uses and trusts), </em>\u00a7\u00a7 51, 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">As to a portion of lands described in the complaint this statute applies, and hence the plaintiff\u2019s only remedy was in equity to establish the trust. <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Hatmaker, </em>15 N. Y. 475; <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Power, </em>10 Paige, <em>562; McCartney </em>v. <em>Bostwick, </em>32 N. Y. 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">In that view the demurrer was not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">But it is claimed by the defendant that a creditor at large can never bring an action in equity to enforce or procure the payment of his debt. That is most true of a creditor\u2019s bill under the statutes, 2 R. S. 173. That remedy is given by statute through equity in aid of courts of law. It presupposes proceedings at law which would afford an adequate remedy but for. some obstruction placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>in. the way. To remove such obstruction was the object of the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Besides these statutory creditors\u2019 suits, and before as well as since the passage of that statute, there has existed another class of creditors\u2019 suits not depending upon the statute, but upon principles inherent in equity jurisdiction, such as suits brought to administer assets, to reach property fraudulently transferred, to avoid circuity or multiplicity of actions, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Hnder such authority, I apprehend, this complaint can be sustained as a whole. There are all of the elements in this case that give jurisdiction to equity, inability to get any relief at law, fraud, collusion between the debtor, now dead, and the defendant who holds title to the property fraudulently, and at the same time is the administratrix of the deceased. There are many English cases where the representative of the deceased debtor and the third party holding the fraudulent title to property are joined as defendants. It is held they may be so sued by a creditor at large when the estate is insolvent or there is collusion between the administrator and third person. <em>Gedge </em>v. <em>Traill, </em>1 Russ. &amp; Myl. 281; <em>Burrough </em>v. <em>Elton, </em>11 Ves. 29. To the same effect is <em>Long </em>v. <em>Majestre, </em>1 Johns. ch. 306. The jurisdiction of equity in the class of cases spoken of is also recognized in <em>Chautauqua County Bank </em>v. <em>White, </em>6 N. Y. 236, 252; <em>McCartney </em>v. <em>Bostwick, </em>32 id. 53, 60, 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">By reference to the above authorities and to the cases of <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>2 Edw. Ch. 199; <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>14 How. (U. S.) 29, and <em>Loomis </em>v. <em>Tifft, </em>16 Barb. 541, it is quite evident this action may be maintained, and that a cause of action is set forth in the complaint. As the demurrer is pointed to the cause of action only, it cannot be made available in case of a defect of parties plaintiff or defendant. The plaintiffs being creditors entitled to prosecute such an action, and the defendant being the fraudulent owner of the title sought to be reached, enough appears. Any defect of parties apparent upon the record might be met by a demurrer. As it has not been done in this case it need not he considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">For the reasons stated the order of the special term overruling the demurrer should be affirmed with $10 costs of appeal to the plaintiff, with leave to the defendant, within twenty days after notice of this decision, to serve an answer upon payment of coats of demurrer and of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
