Judgment having been entered on the decision, the defendant appealed to the general term, where the judgment was reversed, with costs, to abide the event. From the judgment of reversal plaintiff appealed to the court of appeals, where the judgment of the general term was affirmed, with costs, and final judgment rendered for the defendant under the plaintiff\u2019s stipulation. Costs of \"the two appeals have been taxed, and the special term, on motion of the defendant, gave an additional allowance of $400. Judgment has been entered for the costs of the appeals and the allowance, but not for costs of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>It is insisted that the case was not one in which the additional allowance could be given, on the ground that the defendant does not recover general costs, but costs of the appeals only.
