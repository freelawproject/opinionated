Lyons, which was an action for a similar violation of the same ordinance, when it was before us at a former term, we examined and decided all the questions raised by this demurrer, except that raised by the demurrer to the third defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">This defense viewed as covering, both the claim of property in the defendants, in the raceway in which they deposited sawdust, and the claim of an adverse user of the race for more than twenty years does not fully meet the case, nor, so far as it does meet it, can it be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">It does not meet and cover the allegation in the complaint, that defendants did cast and deposit, and did procure, and cause to be cast and deposited <em>in the Oswegatchie river, </em>which forms one of the harbors in said city, certain sawdust, etc., which does fill up and obstruct the water channels and harbors of said city, but is confined in its allegations to the raceway leading from defendants\u2019 min to the said river. It is therefore an insufficient defense, and bad on demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">But so far as it meets the complaint by its allegations in respect tc the race, it is also in law insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"AUF\">As to the question of property in the race, that fact is no answer to the other admitted fact, that defendants deposited sawdust in their race leading to the Oswegatchie river, which had the effect to fill up and obstruct, and did fill up and obstruct the water channels and harbors of the city. The maxim, <em>sic utere tuo, ut alienmn non laedas, </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">Although \u201c a provision for compensation is a necessary attendant on the due and constitutional exercise of the power of the lawgiver to deprive an individual of his property without his consent, * * * it is still to be understood that the lawgiver has a right to prescribe the mode and manner of using it so far as may be .necessary to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>vent the abuse of the right, to the injury or annoyance of others, or the public.\u201d <em>2 </em>Kent\u2019s Com. (1st ed.) 275, 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">As to the question of an adverse user for twenty years, such defense is not applicable to such a case as this. As against the right of the legislature, or the common council, under its authority, to make provision for preventing the filling up of the public water channels and harbors, the fact that an owner of land adjacent to such channels' or harbors has, for twenty years or more, done acts upon his own land, the effect of which was to fill up such channels and harbors, is clearly no defense. The doing of such acts amounts to a public nuisance. The harbors are for the public use, and the obstructing and filling them up, it cannot be doubted, constitutes a common or public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201cNo length of time will legalize a nuisance. <em>Nullum tempus nccurrit </em>respullicae, applies with unmitigated force against a public nuisance.\u201d <em>Dygert </em>v. <em>Schenck, </em>23 Wend. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Such being our conclusion as to the question raised by the <em>third </em>defense, in both its branches, and the points of the other defenses being made by our former decision, <em>res adjudieata, </em>which we cannot here re-examine, it results-that we must affirm the judgment appealed from, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Miller, P. J., and P. Potter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
