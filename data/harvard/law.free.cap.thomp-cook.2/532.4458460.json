These words contain an imputation of ignorance and want of skill, and having been spoken of the plaintiff in his professional character, they are, within the well-settled rule, actionable in themselves. That they were spoken of the plaintiff in his professional character is clearly shown by the words themselves; and, where that appears to be the fact, an action of slander may be maintained. It \u201cis well-settled law that words published of a physician falsely imputing to him general ignorance or want of skill in his profession, are actionable in themselves, on the ground of presumed damage.\u201d <em>Secor v. Harris, </em>18 Barb. 425, 426; <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Redfield, </em>51 id. 484. The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Davis, P.
