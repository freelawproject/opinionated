Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 592A (a) provides that \"[t]he State\u2019s attorney may issue a summons for a witness for the purpose of obtaining evidence to prepare an information.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case we shall hold \u00a7 592A does not authorize a summons in order to investigate whether or not a crime has occurred. Rather, the statute, at a minimum, requires that the State\u2019s Attorney have probable cause to believe that a crime has taken place which he presently intends to charge by way of a criminal information.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">The issue presented here is precipitated by a summons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>duces tecum issued by the Attorney General, acting through an Assistant Attorney General assigned to the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Attorney General\u2019s Office. Pursuant to Md. Const., art. V, \u00a7 3, Acting Governor Blair Lee, III on December 20, 1978 and Governor Harry Hughes on November 21, 1979 had authorized and directed the Attorney General, \"acting with full powers, rights and privileges possessed by a State\u2019s Attorney, to investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute\u201d violations of criminal laws arising out of, or relating to, the State\u2019s Medicaid Program. The appellant in this case is a licensed optometrist. On March 12, 1981 the Attorney General issued a summons duces tecum to the appellant, under the recited authority of \u00a7 592A, requiring the production of appellant\u2019s records relating to 100 specifically named Medicaid patients. These records were produced. By a letter of April 9, 1981, which referred to the prior agreement of appellant\u2019s counsel, the Attorney General requested records relating to 200 additional, specifically named, Medicaid patients. These records were furnished. Then, by summons duces tecum of April 30,1981, the Attorney General directed the appellant to produce his records of 1733 additional, specifically named, Medicaid patients. Appellant moved to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">A summons under \u00a7 592A is initially issued directly by a State\u2019s Attorney and not by a court at the request of a State\u2019s Attorney. Appellant\u2019s motion to quash was filed in the Criminal Court of Baltimore and entered on the Miscellaneous Docket as a new filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In an opinion of July 24, 1981 the trial court distilled the positions taken before it by the parties. The State argued that \"the very fact that the summons is issued by the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit ... on its face, demonstrates the reasonable relationship between the records sought and the investigation.\u201d Appellant asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the summons should be quashed absent \"any showing that the State has any reasonable or probable cause to believe that a criminal violation has occurred...\u201d In the trial court\u2019s view determination of the reasonable basis for a \u00a7 592A summons was to be guided by the standards for investigative sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>poenas issued by administrative agencies, which were enunciated in <em>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, </em>327 U.S. 186, 208, 66 S. Ct. 494, 505, 90 L. Ed. 614, 629 (1946). This is a threefold test which this Court summarized in <em>Banach v. State Commission on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 502, 506, 356 A.2d 242, 246 (1976) to be: \"Whether the inquiry is authorized by statute, the information sought is relevant to the inquiry, and the demand is not too indefinite or overbroad.\u201d The trial court ordered the State to submit \"an affidavit making a minimal preliminary showing that the records sought. . . are relevant to an investigation being conducted by it and properly within its jurisdiction and are not sought primarily for another purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The State filed such an affidavit. It recited the history of the creation of the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit. It said the State had \"received information\u201d that the appellant \"was engaged in defrauding the Medical Assistance Program ... by falsifying information on invoices submitted to the Medical Assistance Program ... in order to justify payment for services allegedly rendered.\u201d The State\u2019s affidavit stated that the appellant had been advised at the time of the March 13,1981 summons that he was the subject of an investigation and that appellant had \"suggested that the investigation may have been prompted by former disgruntled employees whose names [appellant] provided at that time.\u201d A comparison of the records produced by the appellant with those of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene \"indicated\u201d to the State that \"discrepancies of the types suggested by the employees did indeed exist.\u201d The State\u2019s affidavit concluded that the records sought \"are relevant to the investigation now being conducted and that they are sought primarily for this purpose and none other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On September 3, 1981 the trial court ordered \"that the documents enumerated in the Summons Duces Tecum dated April 30, 1981 shall be produced forthwith.\u201d Appellant appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We issued the writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>of certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration of the matter by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The <em>Oklahoma Press </em>test for the validity of administrative investigative subpoenas rests in part on the Supreme Court having found a \"proper analogy to . .. the grand jury investigation ....\u201d <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. State Commission on Human Relations, </em>287 Md. 80, 92, 411 A.2d 86, 93 (1980) (referring to <em>Oklahoma Press, supra, </em>327 U.S. at 209, 66 S. Ct. at 505, 90 L. Ed. at 630). Indeed, in this Court, the State flatly asserts that \u00a7 592A \"when coupled with the present provisions of Article 27, \u00a7 592, 1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1 [was] intended to provide a means of investigating and charging suspects which paralleled the grand jury process.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>The circumstances under which a State\u2019s Attorney may issue a summons under \u00a7 592A are found in the terms of the statute itself. The summons is authorized \"for the purpose of obtaining evidence to prepare an information.\u201d In order for \u00a7 592A to operate, the purpose of the State\u2019s Attorney must be more specific than simply to obtain evidence. He may summons for evidence only in order to prepare an information. The statute requires that there be a then present purpose to file an information, and that the object of the summons be evidence that the prosecutor anticipates will enable him to prepare that charging document. Thus, the analogy or parallel to a grand jury summons falls.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">The grand jury may compel the production of evidence or the testimony of witnesses as it considers appropriate .... \"It is a grand inquest, a body with powers of investigation and inquisition, the scope of whose inquiries is not to be limited narrowly by . . . forecasts of the probable result of the investigation, or by doubts whether any particular individual will be found properly subject to an accusation of crime.\u201d <em>Blair v. United States, </em>250 U.S. 273, 282[ , 39 S. Ct. 468, 471, 63 L. Ed. 979, 983] (1919). <em>[United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343, 94 S. Ct. 613, 617, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561, 568-69 (1974).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">And <em>see Bartram v. State, </em>280 Md. 616, 630-31, 374 A.2d 1144, 1151 (1977). The State\u2019s reading of \u00a7 592A permits a purely investigatory use of the summons power. As the State would have it, the \u00a7 592A subpoena may be utilized whether or not the State\u2019s Attorney possesses information sufficient to support a reasonable belief that an offense has been committed at all. That interpretation either reads out of the statute the words, \"to prepare an information,\u201d or adds, in effect, the words, \"if facts might <em>thereby </em>be uncovered furnishing probable cause to believe a crime chargeable by information has been committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">We recognize that \u00a7 592A addresses a time prior to the actual filing of an information. We need not, in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>speculate on the various situations which might arise in which the State\u2019s Attorney would possess sufficient knowledge in order to have a present purpose to file an information, but would desire additional evidence in order to prepare that charging document. We hold only that, in order to utilize \u00a7 592A, the State\u2019s Attorney must have a then present purpose of filing an information based upon facts which, at a minimum, constitute probable cause to believe that an offense chargeable by information has occurred.* 123<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The history of \u00a7 592A supports our conclusion. By Ch. 562 of the Acts of 1933, provision was made for a State\u2019s Attorney to proceed by information in cases in which a person charged with a misdemeanor made known a desire to plead guilty. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1939), Art. 27, \u00a7 637. This statute was substantially amended by Ch. 788 of the Acts of 1945. Under that enactment, a person charged with a misdemeanor or felony, who wished to waive his right to indictment by the grand jury and to seek an immediate trial by the petit jury, could file a petition and suggestion to that effect with the court. Upon that filing the State\u2019s Attorney was required \"forthwith\u201d to file a criminal information against the accused. The procedure did not apply in Baltimore City or Baltimore County. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1951), Art. 27, \u00a7 679. Its apparent purpose was to enable an accused to obtain a disposition of the charges against him more promptly than by waiting for grand jury indictment in those counties where a grand jury was convened only at particular times of the year to consider such matters as had accumulated since the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>sitting of a grand jury. In connection with this procedure the statute provided that the \"State\u2019s Attorney shall have the same power to summons witnesses to his office on a day certain for the purposes of obtaining evidence to prepare said Information as he now possesses to summons witnesses to appear before the grand jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In the enlargement of Chapter 700 (Criminal Causes) of the Maryland Rules of Procedure proposed in the 20th Report of the Rules Committee, the 1945 enactment, which was then Code (1957), Art. 27, \u00a7 592, was used as the source for proposed new Rules 709 and 710. These rules were adopted September 15, 1961, effective January 1, 1962. Md. Rule 710 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">Summons for Witness in Aid of Information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">The State\u2019s attorney may issue a summons for a witness for the purpose of obtaining evidence to prepare an information. The State\u2019s attorney shall report to the court a refusal by a witness to obey such summons and the court may issue a bench warrant for such witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Rules 709 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 710 were of statewide application.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Article 27, \u00a7 592 was repealed by Ch. 558 of the Acts of 1963, entitled an Act \"to amend or repeal provisions of the Code ... inconsistent with or superseded by certain of the Maryland Rules of Procedure ...</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Rule 710, which had been in effect since January 1, 1962,' was deleted by Order of this Court of January 31, 1977, effective July 1,1977 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (4 Md. Reg. 235 (1977)). This deletion arose out of the recommendation contained in the 53rd Report of the Rules Committee (3 Md. Reg. 8-9 (1976)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">b. <em>Current Rule 710 </em>(Summons for Witness in Aid of Information).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">The Committee recommends that this Rule be deleted and it is not included in the attached proposed Rules in any form. This Rule grew out of the repeal of section 592, Article 27. That section dealt with a known defendant who, after languishing in jail, decided to ask for a speedy trial. After such a request had been made by a defendant, the statute allowed the prosecutor to subpoena a witness in order to prepare an information in lieu of an indictment, which had been waived by the defendant\u2019s request for a speedy trial. Upon repeal of the statute Rule 709 was adopted by t]ie Court of Appeals to allow a defendant to request an immediate trial and waive indictment, and Rule 710 was adopted to allow the prosecution to get information upon which to prepare an information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">The Committee fears that the Rule can be subverted by the prosecution to pursue investigations wherein there are no known defendants and individual rights could be ignored without there being any means of protection or defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">The issues involved in this Rule were fully debated before the whole Rules Committee by Mr. Andrew L. Sonner, representing the State\u2019s Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>neys, and the Honorable Alan H. Murrell, representing the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">The Committee resolved that if State\u2019s Attorneys were to have the authority conferred by the existing Rule, it should be done by the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The General Assembly immediately accepted the invitation to continue \"the authority conferred by the existing Rule.\u201d It enacted present \u00a7 592A by Ch. 708 of the Acts of 1977, effective July 1, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The first sentence of \u00a7 592A (a) continues, <em>in haec verba, </em>the first sentence of former Rule 710. This is the provision which defines the scope of the use of the summons power conferred on State\u2019s Attorneys. In the instant matter, the State argues that \u00a7 592A is an entirely new statute, the interpretation of which should be divorced from the history reviewed above. That argument is unconvincing. By utilizing in the statute which replaced Rule 710 the very words previously used in Rule 710, the General Assembly must have intended the words \"to prepare an information\u201d to have the same meaning in the statute as in the predecessor rule. That meaning did not embrace a purely investigatory summons. If the legislature intended so substantial a departure from the prior rule as to make the State\u2019s Attorney a one person grand jury, it would seem that language more clearly manifesting that purpose would have been used.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The State also asserts that a reading of \u00a7 592A in conjunction with \u00a7 592 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> makes the \u00a7 592A summons similar to a grand jury subpoena. Section 592 was enacted in its present form by Ch. 2, \u00a7 7A of the Acts of the 1st Special Session of 1973. It gives the State\u2019s Attorney an election to charge by information or indictment in a felony case that is not within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>District Court jurisdiction, when either the accused waives a preliminary hearing or probable cause has been found at a preliminary hearing. Simply because, in some cases falling within \u00a7 592, the preliminary hearing serves the probable cause determination function of grand jury indictment, it in no way follows that the 1977 enactment of \u00a7 592A created a purely investigatory subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Our conclusion that \u00a7 592A is not a counterpart of the grand jury subpoena is dispositive of the State\u2019s contentions in this case. One of these arguments is that the judgment below should be affirmed because the appellant failed to demonstrate that the requested records were not relevant to an authorized investigation, so that no affidavit should have been ordered at all. Even if we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>under our construction of \u00a7 592A, that a State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s summons carries a presumption of validity, and also that the burden is on the objecting party to make some preliminary demonstration of possible abuse, any such burden was met in this case. The fact that the State first sought 100, then 200, and then 1733 sets of records justifies an inference that that summons was for investigative purposes and not to prepare a criminal information. Further inquiry by the trial court was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Continuing to analogize \u00a7 592A to the grand jury subpoena, the State says that its affidavit, even if properly required, reveals relevancy to an authorized investigation and the absence of any improper purpose. But the affidavit filed by the State in this case does not aver that the summons was issued in order to prepare an information. The affidavit does not aver in even conclusory fashion the commission of an offense that the prosecutor proposed to charge by information. Without defining the threshold of a showing of the statutory predicate for the use of the \u00a7 592A subpoena power, we hold only that it has not been approached on the record in this case. Thus, the motion to quash should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Because we decide that \u00a7 592A did not authorize the process as used in this case, we do not reach the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>remaining contention that the records sought are \"required\u201d records and that, with respect to such records, appellant was due no <em>Fourth </em>Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">\n<em>Judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore reversed and matter remanded for the entry of an order quashing the summons of April 30, 1981.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-10\">.
