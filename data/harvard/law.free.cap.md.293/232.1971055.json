On 23 August 1979, privately retained counsel entered his appearance. After certain preliminary matters were disposed of, a trial date of 20 February 1980 was set.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On 30 January, privately retained counsel moved to strike his appearance because of nonpayment of the remainder of his fee and a potential ethical problem arising from the possibility that he might be required to testify at a suppression hearing and the trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the accused had been advised to waive his right to be tried within 180 days in order to secure adequately prepared counsel, he refused to waive that right. In addition, he stated that he wanted counsel to represent him and requested the appointment of a public defender. The motion to strike was granted without objection by the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">On 2 February the Office of the Public Defender found the accused eligible for its services. The Public Defender asserted that he could not adequately prepare by the trial date and refused to represent the accused unless he agreed to a postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">At a hearing held on 5 February, the accused was unrepresented by counsel. The trial court advised the accused that the Public Defender refused to represent him because he refused to agree to a postponement. The trial court told the accused that it could not appoint other counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>because of a lack of funds and that, in any event, counsel other than the Public Defender would similarly be unable to prepare adequately. The trial court then advised the accused that in order to secure adequately prepared counsel, a postponement would be required, that he had good cause for a postponement, and that a postponement would be granted. The accused expressly asserted that he wanted counsel to represent him, that he did not waive his right to counsel, that he wanted to be tried within 180 days, and that he did not waive that right. The trial court, recognizing the possibility of a new trial because of a potential claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or a dismissal because of a potential claim of a violation of the right to be tried within 180 days, repeatedly told the accused that he could not exercise both his right to counsel and his right to be tried within 180 days. Indeed, the trial court adamantly insisted that the accused make a choice between those two rights. Ultimately, the trial court told the accused that it would regard the accused\u2019s refusal to agree to a postponement as a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel. Illustrative is the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\"[THE COURT]: Now, do you want the Public Defender to represent you in this case or, and do you want to have, agree to a postponement beyond 180 days, as set forth in the rule, so you can have an attorney who can be well prepared to represent you, both at the hearing on the motion to suppress and on the trial of this case? I wanna know your answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\"MR. HOWELL: I would like to have counsel appointed from the Public Defender\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\"THE COURT: <em>Do you want a postponement of this case so you can have that? Let me tell you the alternative. The alternative of this case is, if you don\u2019t, and you can have every right to refuse it, but I\u2019m going to determine this as a waiver of your right to counsel in this case, which is a Constitutional right you have.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>\u2019\u2019But I will treat that your conduct in this case and your stubbornness in this case is a waiver, and an intelligent waiver of your </em>\u2014 <em>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too intelligent, but you are an intelligent person </em>\u2014 <em>of a waiver of your right to counsel in a serious case. And if you so waive it you will be tried here and you will represent yourself in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\"Now, you have that decision to make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\"MR. HOWELL: Well, Your Honor, I\u2019m not waiving my rights to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\"THE COURT: You say you\u2019re not. Well then, do you want a postponement in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\"MR. HOWELL: And I would like to have counsel appointed from the Public Defender\u2019s Office, but I still want to be tried within 180 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">\"THE COURT: All right. Then I will tell you, and that is a rule, if you do not tell me before you walk out of this courtroom and I understand exactly what you want and what you have, but you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it in this case. You can either have your trial in 120 days, 180 days or, without counsel, or you can have, wait a little while and have counsel appointed for you who will represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">\"You make the choice, not me. Just say it, tell it very clearly. You understand what I\u2019m telling you, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">\"MR. HOWELL: I, it appears, Your Honor, that you\u2019re giving me the choice to either waive my rights to counsel and be tried in 180 days, or not waive my rights to counsel and ask for a postponement. And I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a fair question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">\"THE COURT: All right. Are you gonna tell me that you want to go forward? What you want is your cake and eat it, too, is the way to say it, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\"MR HOWELL: What I want, simply, is I would like to have counsel appointed from the Public Defender\u2019s Office and I would like to be tried within 180 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\"THE COURT: Well, it can\u2019t be done....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\"><em>You have one alternative, to ask for an extension of time </em>in which you can be afforded adequate counsel to represent you, <em>or you can say you don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t, I treat it as a waiver and you will be tried without counsel, be that right or wrong as far as my rights and your Constitutional rights.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\"Do you want a postponement of this case so that you can get the Public Defender to represent you, yes or no, or do you want to be tried on, within the 180 days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\"MR HOWELL: I would like a Public Defender appointed to me to be tried within 180 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\"THE COURT: Well, it can\u2019t both \u2014 now, I\u2019ll tell you that both are not possible. Which do you elect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">\"MR. HOWELL: I don\u2019t elect one or the other....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">\"[THE COURT]: <em>You said you don\u2019t have to take an option. I\u2019m saying you do, because I can\u2019t make anybody defend you. If you want to be tried within 180 days, then you\u2019ll be tried that, and I f\u00ednd that you have intelligently waived, by your conduct here, waived your right to counsel.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">At a hearing held on 7 February 1980, the accused was again unrepresented by counsel. The accused indicated that he was having difficulty in preparing his defense. He repeatedly asserted that he wanted counsel and refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>waive his right to a prompt trial. The trial court refused to appoint counsel because there was insufficient time for adequate preparation and because there were no available funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">At a hearing held on 14 February 1980, the accused was unrepresented by counsel. After electing a jury trial, the accused again asserted that he wanted counsel and refused to waive his right to a prompt trial. The trial court stated that the accused could not have counsel unless he agreed to a postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">At a hearing held on 15 February 1980, on the accused\u2019s motion to suppress, the accused again asserted that he wanted counsel and refused to waive his right to a prompt trial. The trial court again stated that the accused could not have counsel unless he agreed to a postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Throughout a four-day jury trial that began on 20 February 1980, the accused was unrepresented by counsel. He repeatedly asserted that he wanted counsel and that he had not waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The accused was convicted of both conspiracy to commit murder and second degree murder. At a sentencing hearing, at which he was represented by counsel, the accused was sentenced to concurrent terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The accused appealed to the Court of Special Appeals that affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Howell v. State, </em>48 Md. App. 89, 425 A.2d 1361 (1981). The accused filed a petition for a writ of certiorari that we granted. We shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">In <em>State v. Renshaw, </em>276 Md. 259, 264-68, 347 A.2d 219, 224-26 (1975), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">\"The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that '[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u2019 The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the same right to the assistance of counsel, including the right to the appointment of coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sel in the case of the indigent defendant, in state criminal prosecutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">[Bjecause '[e]ssential fairness is lacking if an accused cannot put his case effectively in court,\u2019 and because it is unlikely that an accused will be able to present his case effectively without the assistance of counsel, <em>a conviction cannot be allowed to stand where the accused is not represented at trial by counsel unless it be determined that there was an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused. </em>To assure protection of so fundamental a right, courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver, and do not permit waiver to be presumed from a silent record. It <em>must appear affirmatively on the record that the accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\"To be sure, a criminal defendant does have a constitutional right to proceed without counsel if he intelligently and competently waives his right to counsel. But the standard for waiver of the right to counsel remains unchanged. <em>The record must show that the defendant is competent to waive the right to counsel, and that he knowingly and intelligently has done so </em>after being made aware of the advantages and disadvantages of self-representation. <em>Where the accused cannot waive the right to counsel, or has not effectively done so, the court must take steps to insure that the accused is represented by counsel </em>even if he professes his unwillingness to have a lawyer. So also in a case like the one at bar, where the accused fails to waive his right to counsel by making an unequivocal choice, but merely insists on a different lawyer, effective legal representation must be required by the court.\u201d (Emphasis added) (citations omitted) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Here the record shows that at all times throughout all stages of this proceeding the accused persistently, repeatedly, and without deviation explicitly asserted that he wanted to be represented by counsel. At no time did he indicate a desire or inclination to waive representation, nor did he express a desire to proceed pro se. Manifestly, there was no express waiver of the right to counsel here.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Under certain circumstances, the assertion of the right to counsel, if part of a strategy for delay, may be conduct that constitutes a waiver. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sperling, </em>506 F.2d 1323, 1337 n.19 (2d Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 962, 95 S.Ct. 1351 (1975); <em>United States v. Arlen, </em>252 F.2d 491, 496 (2d Cir. 1958). <em>See also United States </em>v. <em>Poulack, </em>556 F.2d 83, 96 (1st Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 986, 98 S.Ct. 613 (1977). No such circumstances were present here. Indeed, at all times throughout these proceedings, the accused insisted that trial not be delayed. The accused\u2019s assertion of the right to be tried within 180 days, provided by rule of this Court, cannot be regarded as conduct that constitutes a waiver of the accused\u2019s right to counsel. Thus, there was no waiver by conduct of the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Under the circumstances here, there were various alternatives available to the trial court. Privately retained counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on the ground that he might be required to testify on behalf of the accused could have been denied by the trial court. Md. Rule 725 c 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the trial court could have appointed other counsel. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Md. 113, 127-28, 394 A.2d 1190, 1197 (1978); Md. Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27A,\u00a7 6(f) and\u00a7 13 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, either the State or the trial court could have obtained a postponement of trial. <em>Goins v. State, </em>293 Md. 97, 112, 442 A.2d 550, 558 (1982). Thus, both the constitutional right to counsel and the right created by rule, to be tried within 180 days unless good cause for the postponement has been shown, could have been preserved. Instead, as a result of the trial court\u2019s preoccupation with a potential claim of \"ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d the trial court failed to provide any counsel at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Here the accused was unjustifiably denied the constitutional right to counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we. shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\"><em>Case remanded to that Court with </em>. <em>directions to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Cecil County and to remand the case to that Court for a new trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Cecil County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">.
