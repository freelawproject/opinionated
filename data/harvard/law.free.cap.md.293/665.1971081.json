J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Auea\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">This case involves a claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness allegedly resulting from the filing of additional criminal charges against the defendant after the original charging document had been dismissed on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">The pertinent facts are these. On September 24, 1979, William L. Adams was charged in the District Court of Maryland with having conspired with William Simpson at a designated place and during a designated time period \"to violate the gambling laws, to wit Lottery of the State of Md. ... in violation of the Common Law of Md.\u201d After Adams requested a trial by jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, he moved to dismiss the charging document on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>that it had not been signed by a judicial officer as required by Maryland District Rule 711 b 2. The motion was granted on January 16, 1980. The following day, a new charging document was filed against Adams in the District Court of Maryland. It contained three counts, each of which alleged that Adams, at the place and during the time period designated in the original charging document, conspired with William Simpson \"to violate the gambling (lottery) laws of the State of Maryland.\u201d Each count specified that the conspiracy violated a section of Art. 27 of the Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol.), <em>i.e., </em>respectively, \u00a7\u00a7 360, 361 and 362, as well as the common law of the State. Once again, Adams prayed a jury trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore where he moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the prosecutor had acted vindictively in filing three separate conspiracy counts against him after he had successfully moved to dismiss the earlier single count charging document. Adams asserted that the new charging document subjected him to a potential punishment three times as great as that under the original charging document \u2014 from a one-year term of imprisonment and a $1,000 fine to a three-year term and a $3,000 fine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Adams claimed that he had exercised a constitutional or procedural right in having the first charging document dismissed and that the institution of the new charging document, increasing the charges against him, gave rise to the appearance of vindictiveness, together with a realistic apprehension of such vindictiveness in contravention of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Adams relied primarily on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>637 F.2d 250 (4th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, Adams conceded that there was no evidence of actual vindictiveness on the part of the prosecutor. Nevertheless, he argued that under <em>Goodwin, </em>a presumption of vindictiveness exists in every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>case where new criminal charges are filed following the successful exercise by a defendant of a constitutional or other right in having earlier charges dismissed. Adams contended that even if the prosecutor was allowed to rebut the presumption, no adequate rebuttal evidence existed. The State responded that \"the mere [chronological] fact that additional charges are filed, at some [later] period in time\u201d does not automatically create prosecutorial vindictiveness. It maintained that the new charges were also obtained simultaneously against thirty-seven other codefendants of Adams, who were similarly recharged. The new charges were brought, the State argued, in response to another defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the original charging document for \"not charging a cognizable crime.\u201d The State explained that it was acting with an \"excess of caution\u201d in order to \"avoid duplicity,... to apprise the defendants] of the nature [of the crime charged] . . . and to protect the defendants] against double jeopardy.\u201d In addition, the State stipulated that if Adams were convicted on the charges, they would be merged, thereby negating any possibility of increased punishment. The State suggested that its explanation rebutted the presumption of a \"realistic apprehension of prosecutorial vindictiveness,\u201d if indeed one existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The trial judge (Thomas, J.) denied Adams\u2019 motion to dismiss. He ruled that \"there is [no] evidence of any realistic apprehension that the prosecutor ... retaliated because the defendant .. . exercised his right to question the legality of the original charging document.\u201d The court also stated that even if Adams\u2019 situation was one where \"the mere appearance of vindictiveness gives rise to a . . . presumption of vindictive motive ... it would be a rebuttable [one]. . . . [T]he burden would be shifted to the prosecutor to show that his decision was justified by independent reasons or intervening circumstances which dispel the appearance of vindictiveness.\u201d Applying this test, the court found that the prosecutor\u2019s actions were in the public interest \"and not calculated to deter or threaten the defendant for exercising his constitutional rights.\u201d Therefore, the court held that even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>a presumption did arise, it was refuted by the State\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed the lower court\u2019s judgment, basing its decision on the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Goodwin, supra. </em>In that case a United States park policeman had stopped defendant Goodwin for speeding on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. As the officer was questioning Goodwin, he suddenly placed the car in gear and sped away, knocking the officer to the ground. A high speed police chase thereafter ensued, but Goodwin successfully eluded capture. The next day the officer filed a complaint in the United States District Court, charging Goodwin with misdemeanor assault and several petty offenses. Subsequently, Goodwin was apprehended and a trial date was set. Goodwin, however, fled the jurisdiction before the trial. Three years later, he was apprehended in another jurisdiction and returned to Maryland for trial. The case was initially assigned to a federal prosecutor whose authority was limited to trying misdemeanor charges only. Plea negotiations failed and Goodwin requested a jury trial in the district court. Responsibility for the case was then transferred to a more experienced prosecutor who, having decided that Goodwin\u2019s conduct merited more severe charges, obtained a four-count indictment charging Goodwin with one felony count of forcibly assaulting a federal officer and three related counts. Goodwin was convicted on the felony count and on one misdemeanor count. Thereafter, he moved to set aside the verdict on the ground of prosecutorial vindictiveness. Emphasizing the Supreme Court\u2019s prohibition of judicial or prosecutorial vindictiveness as outlined in <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969), and <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 94 S. Ct. 2098, 40 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1974), respectively, Goodwin claimed that filing of the felony indictment on the heels of his request for a jury trial created an impermissible appearance of retaliation. The District Court denied the motion, finding that the prosecutor had dispelled any appearance of vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The Fourth Circuit, relying on <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blackledge, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>supra, </em>reversed, holding that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor from bringing increased charges against a defendant after he has exercised his right to a jury trial, unless the Government could show by objective evidence that the escalated charges could not have been brought before the defendant invoked his right. 637 F.2d at 253. Finding that the circumstances of Goodwin\u2019s felony indictment gave rise to a genuine risk of retaliation, the court adopted a virtually unrebuttable legal presumption to \"spare courts the unseemly task of probing the actual motives of the prosecutor where objective circumstances suggest a realistic possibility of vindictiveness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, applying the rationale of <em>Goodwin, </em>held that the \"objective circumstances\u201d of the case before it did indeed \"suggest a realistic possibility of vindictiveness.\u201d Thus, it refused to adopt the balancing test urged by the State, whereby the court would have had to weigh the State\u2019s explanation for its behavior against the defendant\u2019s claims of retaliation. 48 Md. App. 447, 452, 428 A.2d 476 (1981). Instead, since the prosecution could not show that the increased charges could not have been brought before Adams\u2019 motion to dismiss was filed, the court found that the <em>Goodwin </em>\"presumption of vindictiveness\u201d had not been rebutted. It reversed the judgment of the lower court, ordering in effect that the charging document filed against Adams be dismissed. We granted certiorari to resolve the important constitutional issues raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Goodwin, supra, </em>was recently reversed by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>U.S., 102 S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982). In rejecting the presumption of vindictiveness embraced by the Fourth Circuit, the Court completed the trilogy started with <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blackledge, supra. </em>In Pearce, the Court held that vindictiveness must play no part in a judicially imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>sentence received by a defendant who has successfully attacked his first conviction. Furthermore, appealing defendants must also \"be free | ] of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.\u201d 395 U.S. at 725. Therefore, the Court also ruled that following an appeal, a defendant may not be sentenced more severely unless based upon \"objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726. In essence, this holding created a presumption of vindictiveness, rebuttable only by \"objective information in the record justifying the increased sentence.\u201d <em>Goodwin, </em>at 4698.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><em>Blackledge </em>expanded the protection of the due process clause to post trial prosecutorial conduct. Blackledge, a prison inmate, was convicted of misdemeanor assault after an altercation with another prisoner. When he exercised his statutory right to a trial <em>de novo, </em>the prosecutor obtained a new indictment covering the same incident, but charging felony assault. Blackledge pleaded guilty to the felony and later sought habeas corpus relief. Initially, in reviewing Blackledge\u2019s case, the Supreme Court noted that although the \"Due Process Clause is not offended by all possibilities of increased punishment upon retrial after appeal,\u201d it is offended \"by those that pose a realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness.1 \u201d 417 U.S. at 27. Relying on <em>Pearce, supra, </em>the Court held that the case before it did \"pose a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness,\u201d explaining that due to the considerable incentive the State had in \"discouraging convicted misdemeanants from appealing,\u201d the threat of prosecutorial retaliation could insure that only the most hardy defendants would contest their convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28. Thus, as in <em>Pearce, </em>the Court found that the likelihood of vindictiveness warranted a presumption that would free defendants of apprehension concerning the retaliatory motives of prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In <em>Goodwin, </em>however, the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of its holdings in <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Blackledge. </em>The Court held that in the pretrial context presented by the case, nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ther a \"realistic likelihood\u201d nor a presumption of vindictiveness existed. Indeed, the Court accepted without reservation the Government\u2019s argument that a prosecutor\u2019s charging decision is presumptively lawful and therefore prosecutors are not required to sustain any burden of justification for an increase in charges. 50 U.S.L.W. at 4700, fn. 19. Implicit in this acceptance is the recognition that even if tendered evidence supports a finding of a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, the Government would have the opportunity to rebut any such finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In explaining why it refused to adopt the Fourth Circuit\u2019s inflexible presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness in a pretrial setting, the Court stated the following reasons, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">(1) In the course of preparing for trial, prosecutors may come to realize that information possessed by the State has a broader significance than originally attributed to it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">(2) At the pretrial stage, a prosecutor\u2019s \"assessment of the proper extent of prosecution may not have crystallized,\u201d whereas, once a trial begins it is far more likely that a prosecutor has been able to make a more informed determination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">(3) A defendant is expected, in a pretrial setting, to exercise procedural rights that necessarily create some additional work for the prosecutor, such as motions to suppress evidence and to challenge the sufficiency and form of an indictment; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">(4) It is unrealistic to assume that a prosecutor\u2019s inevitable reaction to such motions is to seek to penalize and deter. <em>Id. </em>at 4699-4700.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Furthermore, the Court stated that a prosecutor should have the freedom, at least in the pretrial stage, to exercise the broad discretion of his office to ascertain society\u2019s continuing interest in prosecution, i.e., \"[a]n initial decision should not freeze future conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4700 (footnote omitted). Moreover, in acknowledging that initial charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>filed by a prosecutor may not adequately reflect the degree to which an individual is \"legitimately subject to prosecution,\u201d the Court pointed out that in the case before it the prosecutor who obtained the increased charges submitted an affidavit setting forth several reasons for his action. These reasons included the defendant\u2019s lengthy history of violent crime, his failure to appear for trial as scheduled, the prosecutor\u2019s belief that the defendant had committed peijury at his preliminary hearing and the defendant\u2019s involvement in major narcotics transactions. <em>Id. </em>at 4697, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Additionally, the Court emphasized that a special presumption on the defendant\u2019s behalf was not created simply by invocation of the right to jury trial. The Court explained that unlike <em>Blackledge, </em>no duplicative expenditures were incurred as a result of the defendant\u2019s request, and as compared to <em>Pearce, </em>no judge was asked to do over what he thought he already had done correctly. Thus, the deep seated institutional bias against retrying previously decided issues, which might have created a favorable presumption for the defendant, was not offended. Finally, the Court conceded that in an appropriate case a defendant might be able to prove objectively that a prosecutor did act vindictively, but it made clear that, in the absence of a presumption, the \"mere opportunity for vindictiveness is insufficient to justify the imposition of a prophylactic rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4700.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Goodwin </em>is manifestly applicable to the case before us. Both cases involve rights asserted at the pretrial stage, and both contain either a finding or a concession negating actual vindictiveness. Indeed, the right invoked by Goodwin, that of a jury trial, is far more central to our concept of justice than Adams\u2019 motion to dismiss the charging document for lack of a judicial officer\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">It is true, of course, that a defendant\u2019s ability to exercise his constitutional rights must not be chilled by heavy-handled prosecutorial conduct. It is equally true, however, that good faith alterations in a prosecutor\u2019s approach to a case should not automatically abrogate the entire potential culpability of a defendant. In the instant case, the State indicated that the new charges were brought against Adams as a result of another defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the original charging document for failure to state an offense. Adams has not presented any objective evidence of bad faith on the part of the State. Adams\u2019 subjective fears, standing alone, are hardly sufficient in light of <em>Goodwin\u2019s </em>rejection of a pretrial presumption of vindictiveness. The trial court below went beyond the requirements of <em>Goodwin </em>and weighed both Adams\u2019 and the State\u2019s claims. That court expressly found that Adams had not made out a prima facie case of a \"realistic likelihood of vindictiveness.\u201d Nonetheless, exercising caution, the court further found on the record that even assuming that Adams had established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>a prima facie case, the prosecutor\u2019s explanation was sufficient to rebut it. Due process commands courts to imbue the criminal justice system with fairness \u2014 it does not mandate inappropriate and inflexible palliatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals vacated; case remanded to that Court with directions to affirm the judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore and to remand the case to that Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-5\">.
