State, </em>290 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Md. 114, 118, 428 A.2d 434, 437 (1981). In order that we might address two questions concerning the voucher rule, we granted certiorari in the case at bar after petitioner\u2019s conviction had been affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in an unreported opinion. The first question, which was included in the petition for certiorari, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">Did the trial judge err in failing to give a curative instruction requested by Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel that the State is bound by the testimony of its own witnesses when the prosecutor expressly disavowed a portion of the testimony of one of his own witnesses?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">To this issue we added, on our own initiative, the following further issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">Whether the voucher rule should be continued in Maryland?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Upon examination of the record we find that the issues embraced in the grant of certiorari, in which we are interested as a matter of public importance, are not presented on the facts of this case. Consequently, the writ will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">On March 4, 1980 the manager of a 7-Eleven Store in Prince George\u2019s County had been robbed by a lone bandit who was armed with a handgun. A description of the getaway car led to the arrest, shortly after the robbery, of the three occupants of that car. These were Gerald Andre Smith (Smith), Frederick Ricardo Germany (Germany), and the petitioner, James Gary Cooper (Cooper).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Smith entered a guilty plea and admitted that he was the gunman who had entered the store. Cooper and Germany were tried jointly. Their defense was that they did not know that Smith was going into the store in order to rob. As part of its case, the State called Smith as a witness. Smith testified the gun had been furnished to him by Cooper. The prosecutor then showed Smith a handgun but Smith said it did not look like, and was smaller than, the gun which he had used in the robbery. Later in the trial a police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>identified the gun previously shown to Smith as the gun recovered from the backseat of the getaway car.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In closing argument, counsel for both defendants emphasized Smith\u2019s failure to identify the gun that the prosecutor had obviously expected Smith to say was the weapon used in the robbery. In rebuttal the prosecutor stated that Smith had \"spun\u201d him. He cautioned the jury to follow the court\u2019s instruction on an accomplice\u2019s testimony and then said, \"I\u2019m not vouching for Smith\u2019s credibility, but I think there are some things that he brought out that are truthful.\u201d The State\u2019s Attorney then went on to argue that the real issue was whether Cooper and Germany knew in advance that Smith was going to commit robbery in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">At the conclusion of this rebuttal, defense counsel approached the bench. Petitioner\u2019s counsel stated that she wanted \"a curative instruction that the State is bound by the testimony of their own witnesses,\u201d and that the prosecutor cannot ask \"the jury to disregard and say that he disbelieves part of the testimony.\u201d The trial court said it was \"going to give an instruction\u201d that \"[e]ither side is bound by the uncontradicted and uncontroverted testimony of their witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">There then ensued a colloquy in which the trial judge suggested that he might be \"exacerbating\u201d the situation by giving the instruction and that the jury might take the instruction as meaning that the court was \"vouching\u201d for Smith\u2019s credibility. The bench conference concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">THE COURT: .... I think at this point to undo it would aggravate the situation. If you want me to, I will [give the instruction], but I would suggest it\u2019s probably better to let it go at this point. It\u2019s so insignificant in the totality \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">[GERMANY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well; I\u2019ll withdraw it, if the Court feels it\u2019s muddying up the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">THE COURT: I\u2019m worried about muddying up their feelings. To say that the State is bound by the uncontradicted testimony of their witness almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>sounds like it bolsters \u2014 if it were me, I\u2019d say, just let it go. If it were a significant point, I could see it, but \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">[GERMANY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. I think they got the picture anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">At this point the record reflects that counsel returned to the trial tables..</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Germany\u2019s attorney expressly withdrew the request for the instruction, which the trial court was prepared to grant if counsel still desired it. Petitioner\u2019s attorney clearly concurred in the tactical decision made by Germany\u2019s attorney. Petitioner\u2019s attorney returned to the trial table without in any way indicating that the instruction should nevertheless be granted at the petitioner\u2019s request, even if Germany had withdrawn his request. The matter then went to the jury, which convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Under these circumstances the request for an instruction based on the voucher rule was withdrawn by the petitioner as effectively as it was withdrawn by the codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\n<em>Writ of certiorari dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">\n<em>Costs are not reallocated.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
