The petition declares on the contract as evidenced by the bill of lading, and avers non-delivery and loss of the property by the negligence of appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-12\">Defendant pleaded general denial and loss of the property by the act of God, and without fault of appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-13\">On the trial it was shown that the buggy was shipped as alleged ; was placed on an open flat car and the wheels fastened by an iron strap across the felloe of each and nailed at each end. One witness said the buggy <em>\u201c </em>was poorly fastened ; that soon after it was placed on the car the wind changed from the south and a violent storm ensued, blowing down several houses in the village of Groesbeck, and blowing the buggy from the car and injuring it very much.\u201d It does not appear that the buggy was ever moved. The defendant offered to prove the damage was but $50 to $15, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>to prove a conversation between Harn and an agent of the railroad company, for the purpose of showing that Harn had released the railroad company from their contract to carry and deliver the buggy as'stipulated in the bill of lading. The testimony, being objected to, was excluded because not pleaded, and no delivery or tender of the buggy had been proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-4\">Verdict and judgment for the value of the buggy.

It is no doubt in general true, as urged by counsel for appellant, that where goods are merely damaged by casualty, for which the carrier is responsible, the owner cannot abandon them and go against the carrier as for a total loss, but is bound to receive the goods when tendered, and is only entitled to compensation to the extent of the injury done them. (2 Red. on R. W., 185; 13 Ind., 265.) But no proper predicate had been laid by appellant for the introduction of such testimony. It was not pretended that the buggy had been tendered to appellee, or that it had been carried by appellant to its place of delivery. And it was not alleged in the answer that appellee, by his acts or declarations, had discharged the contract of shipment and delivery at the point of destination, or waived a tender of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>damages actually sustained. Appellee charges a breach of the contract, and an entire loss of the property through neglect and failure of appellant to deliver as contracted for in the bill of lading. If appellant desired to show that the buggy was merely damaged and not totally destroyed or lost, and that appellant was released from tendering it at the place where by the bill of lading it was to have been delivered, it was certainly necessary to set up these matters in the answer. The defense to which the testimony would apply, with any pertinency, was in the nature of a confession and avoidance, and should have been specially pleaded. It was not admissible under the general denial or special answer that the buggy had been lost by act of God without fault or negligence of appellee, which were appellant\u2019s only pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">As the property was merely damaged and not lost or destroyed, evidently appellant was subject to an action for its non-delivery, even though the damage resulted from an \u201cact of God,\u201d for which appellant was not responsible. In view of these facts we could hardly reverse the judgment if it clearly appeared that the damage was occasioned by an act of this character, or if it clearly appeared that there was error in the instructions of the court in this particular. The defense, if appellant had delivered or proffered to dedeliver the buggy, would at most have only gone in mitigation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">But aside from this view of the matter, we perceive no valid reason why the verdict against appellant on its answer alleging that the buggy was lost and destroyed by act of God, and not by reason of its negligence, should have been set aside. It is urged that the court failed to instruct the jury as to the nature and character of an \u201c act of God,\u201d which relieves the carrier from responsibility, and without such instruction it is said the jury had no means of determining whether .the evidence was sufficient to excuse appellant or not. But it has been often held that the mere omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>sion of the court to properly instruct the jury in civil cases is no ground for a reversal of the judgment. It is the duty of the party who insist that a particular charge should have been given, to ask it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The appellant has no just ground to complain of the instructions given by the court, and that asked by appellant was not applicable to the issue presented by the pleading, or warranted by the evidence submitted to the jury, and was properly refused by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">On the question of negligence in securing the buggy on the car, the testimony, to state it most favorably for appellant, was conflicting. And it cannot he said that it is so clearly shown by the evidence that the damage to the buggy resulted from <em>\u201c </em>an act of God \u201d as to relieve appellant from responsibility as a common carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The court therefore did not err in refusing to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
