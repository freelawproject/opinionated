The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant for damages which he claimed he was entitled to by reason of the fraud and deceit practiced on him by the defendant\u2019s false representations, causing him to execute a written contract and his notes for $15,000, in the purchase of a half interest in a lumber company in Muskogee county, Okla., with the lumber plant at Heavener, Okla.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-23\">Plaintiff claimed that in September, 1920, the defendant misrepresented to him that he was the owner of the Potter Lumber &amp; Supply Company, and that he had assets in the sum of $30,000, consisting of an indebtedness due him from the Brown Manufacturing Company, in the sum of $13,600, and a timber lease from Charles F. J- and O, C. Buschow worth $3,500, and a lumber plant in LePlore county, consisting of buildings, improvements, and machinery, saw mills, planer, 'Office building, five cottages, one barn, a planing mill, shed and approaches, and all necessary equipment for a saw mill, located in the timber about 7 miles from Heavener, and an office at Heavener, and books and furniture located in a room in 401 Barnes Building, Muskogee, and \u201cother personal property\u201d worth $2,670.50; and ho represented that all 'of this property was worth $30,000, and proposed to the plaintiff that they would organize a company that would be known as the Louisiana Lumber Company; and the plaintiff to pay $15,000 for a half interest in the capital stock and the defendant was to have the other $15,000' of said stock, and that said company was organized and plaintiff entered into a written contract with the defendant in which these terms were agreed upon, and the plaintiff executed his notes, relying upon the representations as to the value of the property above stated, and that the defendant knowingly misrepresented the value of the indebtedness in the sum of $13,600 from the Brown Manufacturing Company, when he knew it was not worth that much, and as a matter of fact was only worth $7,583.51, and that the timber lease that the defendant represented to be worth $3,500 was worth nothing, and the \u201cother personal property\u201d, the items of which were not given, which the defendant stated was $2,670.50, was fictitious and represented no property and no value, and that he was thus induced to invest $15,-000 in the company, relying upon the representations of the defendant, and to his damage in the sum of $5,693.24. The defendant demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s second amended petition on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in favor of plaintiff and against the defendant, which being overruled by the court, the defendant filed his answer consisting, first, of a general denial, and, second, that the contract that plaintiff and defendant entered into was for the befiefit of the Potter Lumber &amp; Supply Company,- and that plaintiff bought his interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>in the Louisiana Lumber Company, a corporation, in a separate and distinct transaction from the one in which the contract mentioned by plaintiff was entered into, and even if the plaintiff was defrauded it was not in connection with his transaction in buying stock in the Louisiana Lumber Company, but he denies the allegations of false representations and fraud. Defendant pleads further that in making the written contract with the plaintiff that he was acting as agent for the Potter Lumber &amp; Supply Company, a corporation, and that that contract was between the plaintiff and the Potter Lumber &amp; Supply Company, so far as the transfer of the property upon account 'Of which plaintiff complains of being swindled is concerned. Defendant states, further, that the plaintiff expressed himself as being dissatisfied with the contract and transaction and to satisfy him, as the agent for the said Lumber &amp; Supply Company, he returned to the defendant one of his notes for $2,500, which had been given for the purchase price of said'property, and which was a part of the $15,000, and the plaintiff accepted the return of this note in full satisfaction of all claims upon account of which he is now prosecuting his action. Defendant further pleads that the plaintiff was a , banker, a lumber man, and a shrewd business man, and that he had ample opportunity to examine all the property and details entering into the transaction before he invested and entered into the written contract with the defendant, and if the property was not worth as much after the plaintiff\u2019s investment, it was because of the general depression that prevailed in the lumber business and every other sort of busines throughout the country. The plaintiff filed a reply which consisted of a general denial. The issues were tried to a jury December 7, 1921, and resulted in a verdict and judgment in. favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $1,000, and the defendant has appealed and states 10 assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">1. The principal errors complained of by the defendant relate to the sufficiency of the evidence and the instructions of the court. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony is the \u2022 principal evidence showing the issues in the case, the greater part of which is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cA.

I asked him of what it consisted and he said not anything, it would work out in the books, that\u2019s the reason he put it in merchandise account,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">It appears there were three items of value entering into the $30,000 worth of stock of the corporation, the Buschow timber contract valued at $3,500, the Brown Manufacturing Company\u2019s account, valued at $13,-600, and, \u201cthe other properties\u201d valued at $2,367.50, and which plaintiff claims the defendant misrepresented to him, and these three items are the items involved in the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The defendant complains of the following instruction relating to the timber contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201cYou-are instructed that although you may believe that the defendant, Potter, represented that the contract which had been introduced in evidence between Charles F. J. and O. C. Buschow and Mineral Belt Lumber Coompany was of the actual market value of $3,500, the plaintiff can recover nothing on this account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">This instruction is evidently based on the evidence which fails to show any damages suffered by reason of the contract. There are two good reasons why the defendant cannot be heard to complain of this instruction, one is because the instruction is in his favor, a\u2019nd the other is because be failed to except as the law requires. The record shows that plaintiff announced an exception but the defendant was silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The defendant further contends' that the court erred in its instruction as to the.indebtedness from the Brown Lumber Company. This instruction was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">\u201cYou are further instructed that it appears frpm the undisputed evidence in this case that the difference in the amount of the indebtedness from the Brown Lumber Company to the Potter Lumber &amp; Supply Company, and the damages which plaintiff has sustained by reason thereof has been agreed upon and adjudged between the parties with the exception of the sum of $70 which amount is now due and owing to the plaintiff and for which plaintiff is entitled to a verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">This instruction was based upon the .undisputed facts of a settlement between the parties as to those items. It was in accord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>with the defendant\u2019s testimony and in his favor and we cannot see where ho was injured by it but rather benefited. The exception to this paragraph of the instruction states, just after the language used, defendant excepts.\u201d This is not sufficient to bring the instruction complained of before the court for review. Bartlesville Interurban Ry. Co. v. Quaid, 51 Okla. 166, 151 Pac. 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u25a0 The third item involved in the controversy is the item of \u201cother personal property,\u201d of the value of .$2,637.50. Defendant contends that the testimony was not suffiicient to make out a case of fraud and damages for any of the items complained of by the plaintiff in his petition, and from the fact the court by the instructions above discussed left all out but this last item, we have examined the whole record, and we think the testimony was amply sufficient to go to' the jury as to whether or not-the defendant practiced fraud on the plaintiff in representing that there was \u201cother personal property,\u201d worth $2,037.50, turned into the assets of the $30,000 corporation and the instruction of the court on this issue was substantially correct, and the verdict of the jury is supported by the evidence. We think the demurrer to the evidence was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The defendant further contends that the court erred in permitting the plaintiff to introduce testimony as to the reputation of the defendant for truth and veracity. This contention is based on the fact that the defendant could not be impeached for truth and veracity except in the neighborhood of his permanent residence or domicile, and inasmuch as the defendant did not have his family residence or domicile in the neighborhood of Heavener, he could not be impeached by testimony as to his reputation in that neighborhood, citing 72 R. C. L. 28-217, and Richards v. State, 12 Okla. Cr. 224, 154 Pac. 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The rule as stated in these authorities is not in conflict with the general rule as laid down by Wigmore in section 930, which states that the testimony and inquiry is as to the place \u201cwhere he moves and exhibits his conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">This rule is broad enough to include temporary as 'well as permanent residence. An examination of the record discloses that the defendant failed to make proper objection to this testimony to save his point for review. ' It is not enough to object and to except. but the ground must be stated. McNally v. Harley, 68 Okla. 115, 172 Pac. 46; Bishop-Babcock-Baker Company v. Estes Drug Company, 63 Okla. 117, 163 Pac. 276; Fender, Administrator, et al. v. Segro, 41 Okla. 318, 137 Pac. 103; Bower-Venus Grain Company v. Smith, 84 Okla. 105, 204 Pac. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">We think the record shows the defendant had a fair trial and the same is sufficient to sustain the judgment, and the petition in error is not well taken, and we recommend that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">By the Court: It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
