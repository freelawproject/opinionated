That the verdict of the jury and the judgment of the court is error for the reason that the same is contrary to the law and not supported by the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-28\">\u201c2. That the said verdict of the jury and the said judgment of the court is error in said cause for the reason that the same is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u25a0contrary to and not supported by the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The facts in this case, as shown by the defendant, are that Wood &amp; Company operated branch houses as jobbers in several cities in Oklahoma and Texas; that it bought something over $37,000 worth of cigars from Parker-Gordon Cigar Company, which was engaged in the wholesale business hut not In the manufacturing of cigars; that the salesman for plaintiff made a contract to sell cigars to the defendant, allowing it ten per cent, trade discount and four per cent, cash discount, if paid within ten days; that the plaintiff was to take over all cigars sold by plaintiff to defendant undisposed of and the proof showed that several shipments of said cigars had been returned by defendant and received by the plaintiff, amounting to something over $4.000: that one item of $600. which was returned, had not been credited to defendant by plaintiff for cigars returned; that defendant had paid the plaintiff, by cheeks, over $13,000 and was entitled to over $1,700 trade discount, and there is evidence to show that the defendant was entitled to its ten per cent, trade discount, and the evidence is full upon the proposition that the defendant returned the items, claimed by it, 'and plaintiff admits $4,614.50 returned merchandise, and there is evidence that such was the agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s salesman and-agent at the time the defendant contracted to handle the goods of the plaintiff, and while the amount of goods sold to defendant by plaintiff and several other items are disputed by plaintiff in the evidence, introduced by the defendant, and the attorneys for both sides furnish the court with a start-I'ng array of figures, and if the figures of plaintiff\u2019s counsel are to be taken as conclusive, the plaintiff should prevail in this ease, and if the figures given by the attorney for defendant in his brief are to be taken as correct, the defendant was entitled to considerable more than the jury awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Under the evidence in this case, either of the two propositions might have been found by the jury, but the fact remains that the jury returned its verdict in favor of the defendant for the sum of $1,219.86, and found against the plaintiff, and in our view of the ease the verdict of the jury is conclusive upon this court as to the amount found by the jury. We are of the opinion the amount is clearly within the evidence and is supported by the evidence. The universal rule to be applied here is, that where there is any evidence reasonably tending to support the verdict of. the jury in a law action, that this court will not review, the verdict and findings of the court as to the weight and sufficiency of the evidence upon which the verdict is based.

Lewis, 61 Okla. 247, 161 Pac. 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">All differences and contradictions in the testimony were for the jury to settle and it did settle them by its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">After a careful examination of all the testimony in the case, the briefs of counsel and the figures in the briefs of counsel, we are clearly of the opinion that the amount found by the jury is within the evidence, and the jury, in our judgment, might have been justified in returning a greater amount than was found to be due the defendant. This being true, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the lower court, for the reasons heretofore given, should be and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">By the Court: It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
