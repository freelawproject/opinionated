It would appear that thereafter a demurrer was filed to the substituted motion to vacate, which demurrer was by the court sustained, and the motion to vacate the judgment was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-28\">The motion to vacate nor the demurrer thereto, or the judgment of the court thereon, are incorporated in any bill of exceptions, and as the cause is not brought to this court by case-made, but by transcript, the assignment of error presented by the plaintiff cannot be considered by this court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-29\">\u201cThis court has repeatedly held that only the petition, answer, reply, demurrers, process, orders, and judgments, are parts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the record, and in order to present motionSi affidavits, evidence, instructions, and other preliminary proceedings, the same must be brought into the record by bill of exceptions or case-made.\u201d Menten v.

Pixley, 7 Okla. 351, 54 Pac. 494; McHenry v. Spears, 82 Okla. 28, 202 Pac. 779</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">\u201cThe copying into the transcript of the record by the clerk of motions and the orders of the court thereon do'not mgke them a part of the record.\u201d Fisher v. United States, 1 Okla. 253, 31 Pac. 195.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cUnless an alleged error appears in the record proper, it cannot be considered on appeal.\u201d Homeland Realty Co. v. Robison, 39 Okla. 591, 136 Pac. 585.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">There being no assignment of error properly presented by the transeript&gt; there is nothing for the court to review, and for the reason herein stated, this appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">By the Court: It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
