The action was dismissed as to defendants Chauvet, and the other defendants answering denied all the averments of the complaint. The court found against the defendant Florindo Nieholini on the issues thus joined, and rendered judgment that plaintiff was \u201cthe owner of and entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>possession of the said promissory note.\u201d From such judgment and the order denying his motion for a new trial defendant Florindo Nicholini appeals upon a bill of exceptions specifying particulars in which the evidence is insufficient to support the findings and containing many assignments of error. After the cause had been submitted for decision, and on the same day the findings and judgment were filed, without notice to appellant or hi^s attorneys, the complaint was amended by inserting the following amendment: \u201cThat during all the times mentioned herein said plaintiff was of unsound mind and entirely without the capacity of understanding or comprehending the nature of said transaction and of the transactions in said complaint set forth, and that Florindo Nicholini knew and had knowledge of said facts and circumstances.\u201d The court found in accordance with such averment and after the judgment was entered the appellant in due time and form made his motion to strike out such amendment, and to set aside the finding and judgment on the grounds that said amendment was not served upon appellant or his attorneys, \u201cand that the said amendment was not made to meet the proofs in said cause and was not justified thereby. \u2019 \u2019 The motion was denied, and appellant appeals from the order denying said motion. This appeal is supported by a separate bill of exceptions, and we think that the vital questions involved should be considered first.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Section 469 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201cNo variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof is to be deemed material, unless it has actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits,\u201d and the next section provides that \u201cWhere the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found <em>according to the </em>evidence, or may order an <em>immediate </em>amendment, without costs.\u201d Under these sections there can be no doubt that when evidence pro and con has been admitted touching a fact-material to the cause of action stated in the complaint, the court may pursue either or both of the methods mentioned at any time before the rendition of judgment. And it is equally clear that the words \u201cimmediate amendment,\u201d by necessary implication, exclude the necessity for service and further hearing. \u201cThe law neither does nor requires an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>idle act,\u201d and it would be idle to require service or a trial <em>de novo </em>when the subject-matter of the amendment had been gone into upon the trial, and it is only in such contingency that amendments to <em>conform, to proof </em>can be allowed. <em>(Board of Directors </em>v. <em>Tregea, </em>88 Cal. 358, [26 Pac. 237] ; <em>Firebaugh </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>121 Cal. 186, [53 Pac. 560]; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>119 Cal. 364, [51 Pac. 549, 955] ; <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Hecht, </em>116 Cal. 559, [48 Pac. 611] ; <em>Duke </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>130 Cal. 274, [62 Pac. 510]; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>94 Cal. 462, [29 Pac. 957].) The objection that \u201cthe amendment was not made to meet the proofs, and was not justified thereby, \u201d is so intimately connected with the point that the findings based on such amendment are not sustained by the evidence, that both of these contentions should be considered together. Sections 38 and 39 of the Civil Code emphasize the difference between contracts made by persons of unsound mind who are <em>\u201centirely without understanding\u201d </em>and contracts by persons of unsound mind who are <em>\u201cnot </em>entirely without understanding,\u201d made before incapacity has been judicially determined. The plaintiff\u2019s incapacity was not judicially determined until March 12, 1904, nearly three years after the note was transferred, and this fact must be kept in mind in considering the question before us. A careful analysis of the averments of the complaint shows, beyond question, only a ease of action to rescind a voidable contract. <em>(More </em>v. <em>Calkins, </em>85 Cal. 188, [24 Pac. 729].) And a similar analysis of the amendment shows an averment rendering the contract absolutely void under said section 38. It is obvious that evidence that plaintiff was of unsound mind would be sufficient to support the allegations of the complaint, while something more, showing his entire want of understanding, would be essential to support the amendment. The importance of this distinction between averments and proof relating to <em>void </em>as distinguished from <em>voidable </em>contracts has been recognized in many well-considered cases, and such distinction cannot be ignored in reaching a correct' solution of the problem under consideration. <em>(More </em>v. <em>Calkins, </em>85 Cal. 190, [24 Pac. 729] ; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Geil, </em>110 Cal. 296, [52 Am. St. Rep. 84, 42 Pac. 804]: <em>More </em>v. <em>More, </em>133 Cal. 494, [65 Pac. 1044] ; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>140 Cal. 150, [73 Pac. 820].)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Actions to rescind a contract are necessarily based on the theory that there is a contract binding upon the parties un-</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>less rescission is had. (Civ. Code, secs. 1688, 1689, 1691, 3406, 3408.) And the mere statement of this proposition should suffice to show that an amendment alleging, in effect, that there was no contract could hardly be germane to the original cause of action. But waiving this, and viewing this as an action to set aside or cancel the indorsement and to recover the note, still the amendment and finding cannot be justified or' sustained. Granting the utmost weight to all evidence bearing on his mental capacity, it only shows that he was of unsound mind. There is not a scintilla of evidence showing that he was at any time entirely without understanding. He was called as a witness, and the examination to test his competency as such clearly indicates that he understood the questions and answered them quite as intelligently as could be expected of one whose knowledge of the English language was limited. The learned judge of the trial court believed him quite rational as to most subjects, and so stated. Indeed, his answers at that time, and even his self-serving declarations narrated by other witnesses, create a strong impression that he fully understood the transaction here assailed and only desired security for its faithful performance by Nicholirii. The witnesses as to his sanity seemed to agree that his condition at the time of the trial was, to say the least, no better than it was at the time the agreement was made, and, if so, it certainly cannot be said that he was entirely lacking in understanding. As his incapacity had not been judicially determined at the time the contract was made, it follows from the foregoing that the amendment was unauthorized and that the finding based thereon is not sustained by the evidence. With this finding eliminated, the judgment, which was evidently based on the assumption that the agreement and indorsement were absolutely void, is unsupported by the findings. Even if it could be considered as a judgment for rescission, however, there is no finding as to facts essential to support such a judgment. (Civ. Code, secs. 39, 1691, 3408; <em>More </em>v. <em>Calkins, </em>85 Cal. 190, [24 Pac. 729] ; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Sturgis, 71 </em>Cal. 229, [16 Pac. 772] ; <em>Marten </em>v. <em>Paul O. Burns Wine Co., </em>99 Cal. 357, [33 Pac. 1107] ; <em>Southern Pacific R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>132 Cal. 280, [64 Pac. 292]; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>120 Cal. 510, [47 Pac. 369, 52 Pac. 797].) And if there was such finding there is no evidence in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>to support it. It could serve no useful purpose to consider other specifications or assignments, inasmuch as the objections urged may be obviated upon a retrial of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The judgment and order are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Chipman, P. J., and Buckles, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on October 30, 1905, and the following opinion was then rendered:\u2014</p>\n<author id=\"b737-8\">McLAUGHLIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARz\">The earnestness and sincerity manifested by counsel for respondent in their petition for a rehearing herein has prompted a careful re-examination of all the evidence contained in the record. As counsel evidently misapprehend the decision rendered, we are admonished that perhaps it is not as clear as decisions of an appellate court should invariably be, and hence we deem it but just that an additional opinion be substituted for the terse formula usually adopted in passing upon such petitions. We did not intend to be understood as holding that there is no evidence to support a judgment of rescission. The evidence is entirely sufficient to do so. The judgment, however, is not that the contract be rescinded, the indorsements canceled, and the note restored, but \u201cthat the plaintiff is the owner of and entitled to the possession of\u201d the note. Such judgment could only be based on the amendment and resultant finding, that plaintiff\u2019s mental condition was such that, as a matter of law the transaction was an absolute nullity. If the judgment be considered as for rescission, however, it must fall because the court failed to find on issues pertinent to rescission tendered by the last three denials in the answer. <em>(More </em>v. <em>Calkins, </em>85 Cal. 190, [24 Pac. 729].)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The evidence is ample to show that plaintiff was of unsound mind, and hence to render the contract <em>voidable </em>and subject to rescission under section 39 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Our re-examination but strengthens the conviction that there is <em>no </em>evidence to show such want of understanding as would render it <em>void </em>under the preceding section. The utmost that can be said of the evidence touching his condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>at the time of the transaction is that he did not <em>fully </em>understand the agreement or mode of carrying it into effect. The evidence hardly shows as much as was pleaded in <em>More </em>v. <em>Calkins, </em>85 Cal. 182, [24 Pac. 729], or proven in <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Geil, </em>110 Cal. 295, [52 Am. St. Rep. 84, 42 Pac. 804], and yet the court there held that such facts did not show such want of understanding as would render the contract <em>void.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Buckles, J., and Chipman, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">A petition to have the cause heard by the supreme court after judgment in the district court of appeal was denied by the supreme court on December 1, 1905.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
