It is sufficient that as between herself and her attorney in fact she was not in equity bound by it, but he was, and acknowledged himself to be so bound by executing the agreement sued upon.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b644-10\">APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County.

L. Parsons in respect of certain property situate in Tulare County, being a ranch there claimed by her, and whereas said power of attorney authorized F. Silva to borrow certain money to carry on an appeal by said M. L. Parsons to the Supreme Court, and whereas Mrs. Parsons notified said Silva not to proceed further in respect of said appeal, and also notified one Burris therein acting as counsel and adviser; And whereas it now appears on record against said property a mortgage for $500.00, it is hereby declared by said Silva that no such sum was ever raised or paid to him either personally or as acting under said power of attorney or otherwise; and that if said mortgage exists, or is recorded as aforesaid, same is in fraud, and void for want of consideration and authority. Be it therefore witnessed, that we, the undersigned, do jointly and severally guarantee to said M. L. Parsons (in consideration that she is in no way responsible for same) to investigate and clear from the records said mortgage in order that she may be in the same position in respect of said property as when she granted said power of attorney to said Silva; and we will pay Mr. Mitchell all his charges for attorney fees and costs of clearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u201cWitness our hands and seal this 16th day of September,, 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">\u201cFrank Silva.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">\u201cLouisa Silva.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">That plaintiff relied upon defendants to carry out said contract and clear the records of said mortgage, all of which they failed to do, and by reason of said failure the said mortgage was foreclosed, and the said property sold and lost to' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>plaintiff without any fault on her part; that defendants have never redeemed said property, nor restored it to plaintiff, nor paid her its value or any sum or at all; that by reason of the said failure of defendants to keep the said contract and clear the records of said mortgage, as they agreed to do, plaintiff has lost her property and been damaged in the sum of six hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The demurrer was properly overruled. The consideration for the agreement was that plaintiff would forbear to institute legal proceedings in regard to an iniquitous transaction by Frank Silva, the husband of defendant Louisa Silva; and not only this, but the money which Frank Silva had received and appropriated to his own use was a consideration for the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The findings are supported by the evidence. It may be that Burris, who was associated with defendant Frank Silva in business, and who prepared the papers, appropriated the money and that Frank Silva did not receive any part of it, but as to this the evidence is squarely in conflict. Burris testified that he received the check, and \u201cthe money was immediately turned over to Mr. Silva.\u201d Taking the testimony of Burris in connection with the fact that defendants, by signing the written agreement, practically acknowledged the liability of defendant Frank Silva, the finding of the court is amply supported. The question as to whether or not plaintiff was responsible for the mortgage is immaterial. She had made herself responsible to the mortgage by executing the power of attorney. As between herself and defendant Frank Silva she was not responsible for it,\u2014that is, she was not in equity bound for it, but Silva was, and acknowledged himself to be so bound by executing the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Harrison, P. J., and Hall, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
