That plaintiff may be held to the ratification of an act, it is essential that he have knowledge, or the equivalent, of the facts concerning the transaction. A ratification supposes a knowledge of the thing ratified. <em>(Blen </em>v. <em>Bear River etc. Co., </em>20 Cal. 602, [81 Am. Dec. 132].) \u201cIt is an inherent element of ratification that the party to be charged with it must have fully known what he was doing.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Rouse, </em>104 Cal. 676, [38 Pac. 507].)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The fact of defendant Fette\u2019s withholding possession'was an issue. The whole testimony does not purport to appear in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the bill of exceptions, and we cannot say that the new trial was improperly granted as to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The court did not err in granting a new trial, and the order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Gray, P.
