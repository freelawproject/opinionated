The petition for the writ was filed March 6, 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">In the case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>141 Cal. 96, [74 Pac. 696], an action similar to the present, it was held that the cause of action was barred by subdivision 1 of section 338 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and also by section 343 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That ease was followed and approved by this court in <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>filed May 24, 1905, <em>ante, </em>p. 5, [81 Pac. 674].</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">Under the authority of these cases the judgment in this case is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">Harrison, P.
