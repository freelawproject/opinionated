But the instruction is taken, not from the instructions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>but from the opinion of the court on page 202; and in looking over the cases citing this case, as given in Palm\u2019s Citations, we have not been able to find any in which this instruction was involved, except the eases of <em>People </em>v. <em>Dole, 122 </em>Cal. 486, [68 Am. St. Rep. 511, 55 Pac. 581],\u2014where it is held to be erroneous,\u2014and in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rushing, </em>130 Cal. 453, 454, [80 Am. St. Rep. 141, 62 Pac. 742], where it is, in effect, so held. In the former case, indeed, it is said: \u201cThe vice of this instruction is generally corrected, as it was in this case, by special instructions to the effect <em>that every fact essential to sustain the hypothesis of guilt and to exclude the hypothesis of innocence must be fully proved\u201d; </em>and in the latter case this forms part of the instruction given. But in the case at bar there is no such qualifying instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">It is indeed urged by the attorney for the state that the qualifying instruction referred to in the cases cited \u201coffers but meager support if the main instruction is prejudicial.\u201d But in this we do not agree. The vice of the instruction here is not merely that the jury are instructed that in the case of circumstantial evidence they may convict upon evidence less \u201csatisfactory\u201d than in the case of direct evidence (as to which, see Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1835), but also, that if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201cevidence\u201d be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than the defendant\u2019s guilt, it is the duty of the jury to convict. But the law is, that the jury is the sole judge of the credibility of the evidence, and therefore, though the evidence be inconsistent with the theory of the defendant\u2019s innocence, yet they may acquit him. This defect is pointed out in the opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Dole, </em>where it is said: \u201cIn cases of circumstantial evidence, <em>facts </em>should be proved which are . . . inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence, and every single fact from which the deduction of guilt is to be drawn must be proved by evidence which satisfies the minds and consciences of the jury, \u2019 \u2019 etc. Or, as elsewhere expressed\u2014to justify the jury in finding the defendant guilty\u2014\u201cthe law requires that the <em>facts </em>(not merely the <em>evidence) </em>. . . be . . . inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>41 Cal. 67.) Having regard, therefore, to this vice in the instruction, \"it can readily be perceived that the error might be cured\u2014as it was in fact cured in the cases cited\u2014\u201cby special instructions to the effect . that every fact essential to sustain the hypothesis of guilt and to exclude the hypothesis of innocence must be fully proved. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Eckman, </em>72 Cal. 585, [14 Pac. 359], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Sansome, </em>84 Cal. 454, [24 Pac. 143], cited in the briefs, the instruction involved was: That \u201cto convict upon circumstantial evidence, it should be such as to produce nearly the same degree of certainty as that which arises from direct testimony.\u201d But this instruction is free from the principal vice to which the instruction now under consideration is <em>obnoxious; </em>the cases are, therefore, not similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">I have no doubt, therefore, that the instruction is erroneous, and that ordinarily the error would be material. But in the present case the circumstantial evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was, if not absolutely conclusive, at least <em>\u201csatisfactory,\u201d </em>in the sense of the term as defined by the code\u2014that is to say, it was such as \u201cordinarily produces moral certainty or conviction in an unprejudiced mind\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 1826, <em>1835); </em>and it stood entirely uncontradicted. Assuming, therefore,\u2014as we must,\u2014that the jury was composed of men at once unprejudiced and of average common sense and judgment, we are justified, under the authorities, in believ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>ing\u2014as we do\u2014that the result would not have been different had the instruction been omitted. (Code Civ. Proc., see. 475; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ophir Co., </em>45 Cal. 526, 527; <em>Estate of Briswalter, </em>72 Cal. 110, [13 Pac. 164]; <em>Estate of Spencer, </em>96 Cal. 449, 450, [31 Pac. 453].) The cases cited are indeed civil cases, but we see no reason why the same principle should not apply in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Nor are the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure cited to be disregarded. They have, indeed, as to certain matters, specifically indicated in the decision, been held unconstitutional <em>(San Jose Ranch Co. </em>v. <em>San Jose Land etc. Co., </em>126 Cal. 325, [58 Pac. 824]), but the question now before us does not seem to be affected by that decision. For here not only does it not appear that \u201ca different result would have been probable if [the] error . . . had not occurred,\u201d but the contrary ; and the improbability of a different result upon the omission of the instruction is so strong as to produce in us an abiding conviction to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We are of the opinion, therefore,\u2014having regard to the particular case,\u2014that, notwithstanding the error of the court below, the judgment and order should be affirmed; and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Gray, P. J., and Allen, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
