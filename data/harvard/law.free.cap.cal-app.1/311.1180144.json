No agreement of parties can be invoked to call for a decision of what to t\u00fcem, or either of them, is merely a moot question, and courts should not render judgments which cannot be enforced by any process known to the law. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Malley, </em>74 Cal. 432, [16 Pac. 228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">It appears that the parties to this litigation have no rights which can be affected by the reversal of the order; that the defendant possessed no right to make any levy for the fiscal year 1903 at the date of the appeal herein; and that the superior court has no authority to render any judgment in the premises. Any opinion that we might give upon the merits of plaintiff\u2019s application to the superior court would not, therefore, be followed by any action on the part of that court, and would not have any binding authority, or constitute any adjudication of the rights of the parties. <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>115 Cal. 613, [47 Pac. 591].)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Without determining any of the questions involved, for the reasons above suggested, and upon the authority of <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>115 Cal. 613, [47 Pac. 591], the appeal in this cas\u00e9is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Gray, P.
