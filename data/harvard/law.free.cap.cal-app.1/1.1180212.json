Any person who commits the acts, named in the section, upon or with the body of a child under the age of fourteen years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of such person or child is guilty of a crime under the section. If the acts prohibited were committed by defendant upon or with the body of a child of the-same sex as defendant, he would nevertheless be guilty. The legislature has not seen fit to make any reference to sex in the section, and it is not for this court to do so. It is sufficient that the information charges the offense substantially in the-language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Hall, J., and Harrison, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
