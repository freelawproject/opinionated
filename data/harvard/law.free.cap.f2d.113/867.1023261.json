Each count charged that, having devised a scheme to defraud and for obtaining money and property by means of false and fraudulent Pretenses, representations and prom-ises&gt; Waggoner and his codefendants, for the purpose of executing the scheme, placed a described letter in the United States post office at Los Angeles, California, to be sent and delivered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>post office establishment of the United States. Waggoner and seven of his co-defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were arraigned, pleaded not guilty and were brought to trial. Wag-goner was convicted and sentenced on counts 1, 3, 4 and S, and has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">There are twenty assignments of error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Assignments 1, 2 and 3 are that the court erred in refusing requests said to have been made by appellant for an instructed verdict. The bill of exceptions shows- no such request. We have nevertheless reviewed the evidence and find that it amply supports the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Assignments 4 to 8, inclusive, are to the admission of evidence. None of them quotes the grounds urged at the trial for the objection or the exception taken \u2014 if indeed there was any objection or exception \u2014 or the full substance of the evidence admitted, as required by Rule 2(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of our rules governing criminal appeals. Hence, these assignments will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Assignments 9 and 10 were not urged in this court and, therefore, are deemed to have been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Assignments 11 to 19, inclusive, are to the charge of the court. Assignments 13 to 17, inclusive, relate to instructions given. Assignments 11, 12, 18 and 19 relate to instructions not given. Appellant, so far as the record shows, did not except to the charge or to any instruction given or to the court\u2019s failure to give other instructions. Hence, these assignments can avail him nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Assignment 20 reads: \u201cThe court erred in other respects in giving and refusing instructions, more particularly as follows, and in admitting in evidence documentary evidence and oral testimony which was not then or at any time during the trial shown to have any connection with [appellant], and as to which [appellant] was not shown to have any knowledge guilty or otherwise, more particularly as follows: The Court erred in other respects in giving and refusing instructions.\u201d What instructions or what evidence the assignment refers to, we do not know. The asserted error is not set out with particularity, as required by Rule 2 (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of our rules governing criminal appeals. Hence, this assignment will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"AcKx\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-38\"> Paul B. Bonbay, J. <em>Clare </em>Thorp, H. es. Nelson, Paul H.
