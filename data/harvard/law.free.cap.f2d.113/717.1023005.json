We need only add that we see no basis for the defendant\u2019s contention that it is not liable for interest for the period during which the insolvent bank, of which the plaintiff is receiver, was trustee of the defendant estate. The stockholders\u2019 liability represented by the judgment recovered in this case was imposed for the benefit of the creditors of the bank, not of the bank itself. Dunn v. O\u2019Connor, 67 App.D.C. 76, 89 F.2d 820. Consequently the right of the latter to interest from the due date of the assessment (Casey v. Galli, 94 U.S. 673, 24 L.Ed. 168) could not be prejudiced by the alleged neglect of the plaintiff and his predecessor in office to pay the assessment during that oeriod.</p>\n<p id=\"A3S\">. , .
