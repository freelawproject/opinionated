The accident was covered by the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and thereunder it was provided that his surviving widow might elect to receive compensation or pursue her remedy against the third party wrongdoer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She elected the latter and received in a compromise settlement, two months after the death of her husband, considerably, more than she could have secured under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-19\">The Act provides that:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cEach employer shall pay $1,000 [into a special fund set up under \u00a7 44 for the rehabilitation of incapacitated workmen] as compensation for the death of an employee of such em-. ployer resulting from injury where the deputy commissioner determines that there is no person entitled under this Act [chapter] to compensation for such death.\u201d Section 44(c) (1). Pursuant to this provision the Deputy Commissioner made an investigation and on April 14, 1932, issued an order dispatched to the company, reciting in substance the above and concluding as follows: \u201cOrder 1. That the defendant, The International Mercantile Marine Company and Subsidiaries, pay to the United States Treasurer, the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) under the provisions of Section 44 of the Act, as there is no person entitled to compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-21\">On May 4, 1932, the company mailed a check for the $1,000 to the Compensation Commission, accompanied by a statement that it was paid under protest in the belief that the Deputy Commissioner was not authorized to issue a compensation order under \u00a7 44 where there was a person eligible for compensation at the time of the employee\u2019s death.' The widow was, of course, eligible for compensation (under the Act) at the time of the death and for some time thereafter. As the Deputy Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>missioner interpreted the Act, however, he was required to find whether there were eligible beneficiaries as of the time of his determination, rather than as of the time of the employee\u2019s death and, on his construction, the compensation order in the instant case was admittedly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Section 21 entitled \u201cReview of Compensation Orders\u201d provides in part as follows :<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cSec. 21(a) A compensation order shall become effective when filed in the office of the deputy commissioner * * *, and, unless proceedings for the suspension or setting aside of such order are instituted as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, shall become final at the expiration of the thirtieth day thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u201c(b) If not in accordance with law, a compensation order may be suspended or set aside, in whole or in part, through injunction proceedings, mandatory or otherwise, brought by any party in interest against the deputy commissioner making the order, and instituted in the Federal district court for the judicial district in which the injury occurred (or in the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia if the injury occurred in the District). The orders, writs, and processes of the court in such proceedings may run, be served, and be returnable anywhere in the United States. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u201c(d) Proceedings for suspending, setting aside, or enforcing a compensation order, whether rejecting a claim or making an award, shall not be instituted otherwise than as provided in this section * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">No appeal was taken from the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order of April 14, 1932. A case then pending in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Federal Mutual Liability Ins. Co. v. Locke, presented the question whether a compensation order could issue under \u00a7 41(c) (1) where there was an eligible beneficiary at the time of the employee\u2019s death. On August 4, 1932, the court handed down its decision, reported at 60 F.2d 895, rejecting the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s construction of the Act, and holding that no compensation order should issue under \u00a7 44(c) (1) in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">On January 6, 1939, the company filed a complaint in the District Court here praying for a mandatory injunction directing the Compensation Commission and the Treasurer of the United States to return the $1000 payment, characterized in the complaint as \u201cinvoluntary\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants answered and there being no fact in controversy the court entered a summary judgment on the pleadings \u2014 for the company (appellee herein). From that order the defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">We are of the opinion that the cause must be reversed \u2014 \u00a7 21 of the Act governing review of compensation orders precludes the maintenance of this action. It is clear from the Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and from judicial decisions interpreting it<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the order of the Deputy Commissioner ordering the company to pay the $1,000 was a \u201ccompensation order\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 21. Under subsection (b) of this latter section it is provided that \u201cIf not in accordance with law, a compensation order may be suspended or set aside, in whole or in part, through injunction proceedings, mandatory or otherwise, brought by any party in interest against the deputy commissioner making the order, and instituted in the Federal district court for the judicial district in which the injury occurred [with a right to further review in the appellate courts<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>].\u201d We think it clear that this review would embrace the question whether the Deputy Commissioner could order payment into the special fund on the ground that \u201cthere is no person entitled to compensation,\u201d when his findings indicated that the deceased left a widow, who elected to pursue her remedy against the third party wrongdoer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, in the event that the order requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>payment was finally reversed, that reversal would conclusively establish the right of the employer to recover the $1,000 payment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A return of the. $1,000 would follow as a matter of course. In the remote contingency that it did not, the employer\u2019s right could be enforced by the courts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXd\">The company did not, however, seek a review of the order and under subsection (a) of \u00a7 21 it became final 30 days after it was filed in the office of the Deputy Commissioner. It is settled that, when time for appeal has expired, a judgment entered by a tribunal with jurisdiction is binding even though erroneous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, a reversal in an appellate court redounds to the benefit of only those who have appealed. As to other parties the original judgment is valid and enforceable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is argued by the company, however, that the decision of . the Second Circuit Court of Appeals holding that it was improper to issue a compensation order under' \u00a7 44(c) (.1), when' there was an eligible beneficiary at the time of the death, means that the order of the Deputy Com-missioner was not within his jurisdiction, and hence, vulnerable to collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"A4u\">The Deputy Commissioner had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject mat-ter. It appears from the Act that he was authorized in the first instance to construe \u00a7 44(c) (l).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under these circumstances * is d\u00b0ubtfuJ his order is subject to collateral attack within the common-law ^le that judgments made without jurisdlct.lon are v\u00b0ld\u2018<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> W_f. \u00bbeed not base our decislon on thls \u00a3round\u2019 however,</p>\n<p id=\"ALr\">Section 21(d) provides that: \u201cProceedings for suspending, setting aside, or enforcing, a compensation order, whether rejecting a claim or'making an award, shall not b\u00e9 instituted otherwise than, as provided in this section, ' *' * * \u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By-this provision we think Congress' has clear-ly precluded collateral attack on' an order of the Deputy Commissioner, at least' where, the latter h\u00e1d jurisdiction over the claim for compensation, over the parties, and where the review provided by \u00a7 21(b) would have embraced the issues involved.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Having failed to avail itself of its statutory remedy the company is without any.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AaT\">The company asserts that it has a constitutional right to attack collaterally the order made by the Deputy ~ommissioner in the instant case. The Act provides that the Deputy Commissioner must notify the employer of proceedings which may result in a compensation order.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The employer upon request is entitled to a hearing on the prospective order<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> with a right to review the same in the District Court, within thirty days.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Where, as here, those safeguards are made available to the employer, contention that there is a constitutional right to attack the Deputy Commissioner's order collaterally is without foundation. Due process of law is not so arbitrary. Bonet v.

If the maintenance of this action depended on application of the principle that an equity court will take jurisdiction where the remedy at law is inadequate, it might be that the answer to that question would be decisive. The question whether the order of the Deputy Commissioner may be attacked collaterally does not depend on either a common law or equitable principle, however. Congress has expressly provided by \u00a7 21 (d) of the Act (see text of the opinion, infra, at page 182) that the order cannot be attacked collaterally. The adequacy of the remedy provided by the review provisions must be tested, therefore, not by a rule of equity practice 'but by the Constitution. Assuming, without deciding, that an action in addition to the review proceeding would be necessary to secure a return of the employer\u2019s $1,000, it is too clear for argument that the employer would not be deprived of due process because required to institute two actions in order to realize on his right. The remedy provided the employer by the review provisions of the Act is therefore adequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"AAR\"> In actions'under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act.
