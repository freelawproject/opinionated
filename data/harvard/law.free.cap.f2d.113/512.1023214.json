The stencil is cut to form the letters or figures desired. The engraver uses a gun which propels particles of sand against the surface, cutting out the design formed by the openings in the stencil and leaving the rest of the stone intact. As the trial court found, \u201cPrime requisites of sandblast stencil sheets are that they must be sufficiently strong and resilient to withstand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>abrasion by a stream of particles under an air pressure of 100 pounds and they must be sufficiently flexible to conform to uneven stone surfaces on which they may be applied. They must be tough enough to withstand abrasion and yet must be capable of being readily and accurately cut to form a stencil aperture of an intricate design. They must adhere to the surface to be inscribed firmly enough to prevent displacement during the sandblasting operation and yet not so strongly as to injure the stone surface or cause removal of any particles of the stone surface upon removal of the stencil sheet. The adhesive of the stencil sheet must not contain ingredients which will discolor or mar the stone surface.\u201d Earlier stencils had been made of vulcanized rubber,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rubber reinforced by wire,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a glue-glycerine (\u201csynthetic rubber\u201d) compound.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The latter stencil also employed a glue-glycerine adhesive which required moistening before use. This adhesive discolored the stone and was difficult to remove.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s stencil is strong, resilient, flexible and easily cut. The adhesive used is \u201cpressure-sensitive,\u201d requiring no moistening for use. It is readily removable and does not discolor the stone. The stencil is described in plaintiff\u2019s claim 38 as \u201csheeted material comprising a flexible mass containing as ingredients thereof bone glue siftings, rubber, whiting, solros, factice and a solvent and a normally pressure-sensitive rubber-base adhesive coating affixed to one surface thereof, said composite being inherently blasting resistant.\u201d The trial court found that this claim, together with claim 39, which specifies the proportions of ingredients used, described an invention, and authorized the 'Commissioner to issue a patent. Since the Commissioner has not appealed, the sole question here is whether plaintiffs other claims should have been allowed also. Claim 13 is the most specific of the rejected claims, and is fairly representative of the others: \u201ca sheeted material comprising a rubber-rosin glue inherently blasting resistant backing having a layer of normally pressure-sensitive blasting resistant adhesive material affixed to one surface thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">It is contended that claim 13 and the other disputed claims are invalid on their face.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It will be noted that the most specific phrase in claim 13 is \u201crubber-rosin glue.\u201d Otherwise the claim merely describes the qualities of the stencil and its functional characteristics. It has been held that a description by function does not comply with the statutory requirement that the inventor \u201cshall particularly point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement, or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The disputed claims seek to preempt in the field of sandblast stencils all \u201crubber compounds\u201d or \u201crubber-rosin glues\u201d of whatever composition all \u201cinherently blasting resistant hackings\u201d and all \u201cnormally pressure-sensitive blasting resistant adhesive materials.\u201d Such abstractions as \u201cflexibility,\u201d \u201ctoughness,\u201d \u201cresilience,\u201d \u201cpressure-sensitivity,\u201d \u201cblasting resistance,\u201d or even \u201crubber compounds\u201d would seem to be unpatentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">As thus indefinitely phrased, the claims in issue have been anticipated by the prior art.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The qualities described in the claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>had been in the public domain as well as in various patents. The use of rubber or rubber compounds was clearly indicated in previous' patents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A synthetic rubber compound containing glue is clearly suggested by Smith patent 1,882,526. The use of \u201cpressure-sensitive adhesive material\u201d is common in making stencils for painting automobiles,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in manufacturing insoles,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and elsewhere. It is also suggested in the Smith patent,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> where the adhesive required moistening. If plaintiff has an adhesive which is patentably different, it has failed to describe that difference by referring to it as \u201cpressure-sensitive.\u201d Insofar as plaintiff\u2019s description of the \u201crubber compound\u201d is sufficiently specific to distinguish the prior art, a patent has been authorized by the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The judgment of the trial court' is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-24\"> The action is pursuant to Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4915, 35 U.S.O.
