If they: do, appellant\u2019s petition for cancellation should have been sustained. If they do not, the tribunals of the Patent Office were not in error in dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">It is obvious from the record that, although the goods of the parties are sold at times in the same stores, they are not competitive, appellee\u2019s goods being articles of jewelry and appellant\u2019s goods being boots, shoes, and slippers of leather, fabric, or combinations thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-18\">Many cases are cited and reviewed in the brief of counsel for appellant in an effort to establish that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-19\">We have given careful consideration to all of the decisions cited as well as the arguments presented here by counsel for appellant, but are unable to hold that appellee\u2019s articles of. jewelry are goods of the same descriptive properties as appellant\u2019s boots, shoes, and slippers, although the goods of the parties are at times sold in the same stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-20\">We find nothing of record to indicate that the purchasing public would be likely to believe that appellant\u2019s boots, shoes, and slippers, on the one hand, and appellee\u2019s articles of jewelry, on the other, were manufactured by the same concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-21\">We are of opinion that the issues here involved are akin to those involved in the cases of Mohawk Milk Products Company, Inc. v. General Distilleries Corporation, 95 F.2d 334, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 990, and Carnation Co. v. California Growers Wineries, Inc., 97 F.2d 80, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1277, wherein it was held, in the Mohawk Milk Products Company, Inc. case, that gin and canned milk and cream, although beverages, were not goods possessing the same descriptive properties and, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Carnation Co. case, that condensed milk and other \u201cmilk products\u201d and wines and brandies were not goods of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Although it is now and always has been the policy of this court to give the language \u201cmerchandise of the same descriptive properties,\u201d used in section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85, a liberal interpretation in order to effectuate the purpose of the act, we are not prepared to hold that boots, shoes, and slippers, on the one hand, and articles of jewelry such as those herein-before enumerated, on the other, are goods possessing the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b185-7\">GARRETT, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AnZ\">took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
