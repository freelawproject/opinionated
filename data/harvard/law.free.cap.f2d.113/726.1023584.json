Plummer, Warden of the California State Prison at Folsom, denied appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The detention complained of was by virtue of process issued out of a California State court. People v. Schenk, 19 Cal.App.2d 503, 65 P.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">The District Court\u2019s decision was rendered on January 18, 1940. This appeal was taken on February 26, 1940. Thereafter appellant moved this court for an order appointing counsel to represent him on the appeal. We denied the motion on April 19, 1940, 113 F.2d 726. We there expressed doubt as to our jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, but did not pass on the question. The question is now squarely before us and must be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">Section 466, Title 28, U.S.C.A.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides: \u201cFrom a final decision by a court of the United States in a proceeding in habeas corpus where the detention complained of is by virtue of process issued out of a State court no appeal to the circuit court of appeals shall be allowed unless the United States court by which the final decision was rendered or a judge of the circuit court of appeals shall he of opinion that there exists probable cause for an appeal, in which event, on allowing the same, the said court or judge shall certify that there is probable cause for such allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-18\">Section 466 was not, as appellant seems to think, repealed by Rule 73 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following \u00a7 723c.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 73 (a) creates no new right of appeal. It merely prescribes the manner in which an appeal may be taken when \u201cpermitted by law.\u201d From a final decision by a court of the United States in a habeas corpus proceeding where, as here, the detention complained of is by virtue of process issued out of a State court, an appeal is \u201cpermitted by law\u201d when, and only when, a certificate of probable cause is obtained from the United States court which rendered .the decision or from a judge of the circuit court of appeals. Section 466, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-19\">Here, there is no certificate of probable cause. Hence, we have no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Genna v.
