The United States Attorney filed a libel in the court below seeking the con- . fiscation and destruction of the books. The court determined that, they were properly subject \u2019to libel and should be destroyed. The applicable statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> so far as pertinent, reads as follows: \u201cAll persons are prohibited from importing into the United States from any foreign country * * * any obscene book, pamphlet, paper, writing, advertisement, circular, print, picture, drawing, or other representation, figure, or image on or of paper or other material * * The lower court found as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">\u201c4. Upon examination of the book the Court finds nothing in the written text thereof which could be considered obscene or immoral. The case of the Government is predicated upon photographic illustrations which appear at various places in the book.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">\u201c5. The illustrations which are asserted to be obscene apparently have no relevancy to the written text at the place in which each of said photographic illustrations is set in the book. The said photographs or illustrations, upon examination, are obscene and within.the condemnation of the statute under the authority of which seizure was made and the libel filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-18\">On argument, it was conceded by the government that the text of the books and most of the photographs are unobjectionable. All that remains in dispute, therefore, is whether- the books are objectionable, within the meaning of the statute, because of the presence therein of three or four photographs in which appear full front views of nude female figures, and two photographs in which nude male and female figures appear together. The photographs complained of are uncolored and apparently unretouched and are approximately 2^ x 3% inches in size. The human figures which appear therein are approximately 1% inches in height.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-19\"> Our decision of the case requires no expression of opinion, judicial or other- ' wise, concerning the merits or demerits of nudity as it may be practiced or professed. The only question before us is whether the book \u201cNudism in Modern Life\u201d is obscene, in the light of the applicable standard intended to be established by the statute. But obscenity is not a technical term of the law and is not susceptible of exact definition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the word has been variously defined,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the test applied in many of the earlier cases was that laid down by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in Regina v. Hicklin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as follows: \u201c* * * whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And the rule was applied to those portions of the book charged to be obscene rather than to the book as a whole.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But more recently this standard has been repudiated, and for it has been substituted the test that a book must be considered as a whole, in its effect, not upon any particular class, but upon all those whom it is likely to reach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus considered, obscenity is,\u2018 as Judge Learned Hand has said, \u201ca function of many variables, and the verdict of the jury is not the conclusion of a syllogism of which they are to find only the minor premiss, but really a small bit of legislation ad hoc, like the standard of care.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But in every case it is a question of law for the court to determine, in the first instance, whether the challenged publication can have the tendency attributed to it by the government, and it is only when that determination has been made in the affirmative that the jury is called upon to decide whether it has such a tendency in fact.<footnotemark>8a</footnotemark> In our opinion, the book \u201cNudism in Modern Life\u201d cannot reasonably be said to fall within the prohibition of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">Probably the fundamental reason why the word obscene is not susceptible of exact definition is that such intangible moral concepts as it purports to connote, vary in meaning from one period to another.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>is customary to see, now, in the daily newspapers and in the magazines, pictures of modeled male and female underwear which might have been shocking to readers of an earlier era. An age accustomed to the elaborate bathing costumes of forty years ago might have considered obscene the present-day beach costume of halters and trunks. But it is also true that the present age might regard those of 1900 as even more obscene.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">With such considerations in mind, perhaps the most useful definition of obscene is that suggested in the case of United States v. Kennerley,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> i. e., that it indicates \u201cthe present critical point in the compromise between candor and shame at which the community may have arrived here and now.\u201d But when we attempt to locate that critical point in the situation of the present case, we find nothing in the record to guide us except the book itself. The question is a difficult one, as to which the expert opinions of psychologists and sociologists would seem to be helpful if not necessary. Assumptions to the contrary which appear in some of the earlier cases,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> reveal the profound ignorance of psychology and sociology<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which prevailed generally, when those opinions were written. More recently, in the cases and textbooks, the desirability and pertinence of such evidence has been suggested.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Lacking such assistance in the present case, we can compensate for it in some measure by noticing, judicially, evidence which is thus available to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">It cannot be assumed that nudity is obscene per se and under all circumstances. Even the application of the narrowest rule would not justify such an assumption. And, from the teachings of psychology<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and sociology,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we know that the contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>view is held by social scientists.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Nudity in art has'long been recognized as the reverse of obscene.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Art galleries and art catalogues contain many nudes, ancient and modern. Even such a conservative source book as Encyclopaedia Britannica, contains nudes, full front view, male and female, and nude males and females pictured together and in physical contact.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The use of nude figures and photographs in medical treatises and textbooks is also commonly practiced today. It was conceded on argument that this, also, constitutes an exception to the earlier prohibition. But this was not always true. In the earlier periods of medical history, censorship of scientific investigation was so restrictive that anatomical drawings alleged to represent the human body were made from studies of animals or upon a basis of pure hypothesis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Later, as indicated by such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>cases as Regina v. Hicklin (1868) <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and People v. Muller (1884),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the old censorship was relaxed to permit the use of such figures and photographs, provided the textbooks and treatises in which they appeared were restricted to use among practitioners and students.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> No reasonable person at the present, time would suggest even that limitation upon the circulation and use of medical texts, treatises and journals. In many homes such books can be found today ; in fact standard dictionaries, generally, contain anatomical illustrations. It is apparent, therefore, that civilization has advanced far enough, at last, to permit picturization of the human body for scientific and educational purposes. That fact is decisive of the present case. The picturization here challenged has been used in the libeled book to accompany an honest, sincere, scientific and educational study and exposition of a sociological phenomenon and is, in our opinion, clearly permitted by present-day concepts of propriety.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> There is, perhaps, as great or greater need for freedom of scientific research and exposition in this field as in any other.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> And, at this point, it may be well to repeat that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>question is not whether nudity in practice is justifiable or desirable. All would agree that cancer, leprosy, and syphilis are highly undesirable; still, it is recognized, generally, by normal, intelligent persons, that there is need for scientific study, exposition and picturization of their manifestations.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The statute involved in the present \u2022case was interpreted in United States v. One Book Entitled Ulysses,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and the decision in that case is equally applicable here. \u201cIt is settled,\u201d says the court in the Ulysses case, \u201cthat works of physiology, medicine, science, and sex instruction are not within the statute, though to some extent and among some persons they may tend to promote lustful thoughts.\u201d It-should be equally true of works of sociology, as of physiology, medicine and other sciences \u2014 to say nothing of general literature and the arts \u2014 that \u201cwhere the presentation, when viewed objectively, is sincere, and the erotic matter is not introduced to promote lust and does not furnish the dominant note of the publication\u201d, the same immunity should apply.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Cases relied upon by the government, in which publication and distribution were \u201cwholly for the purpose of profitably pandering to the lewd and lascivious\u201d have no relevancy to the present case.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\"> As it is conceded that the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>text of \u201cNudism in Modern Life\u201d is inoffensive, and that only a few of the twenty-three illustrations are questionable, it is obvious that the latter do not furnish the dominant note of the publication. The determining question is, in each case, whether a publication, taken as a whole, has a libidinous effect.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In the present case, as in the Ulysses case, the book as a whole is certainly not obscene; here, as there, the book has \u201csuch evident truthfulness in its depiction of certain types of humanity, and is so little erotic in its result, that it does not fall within the forbidden class.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The author has been known for many years as a well qualified writer in the field of sociology. His textbooks have been long known and used in the colleges and universities of this country. The photographs used in the book here involved have definite relevancy to the written text, even though there are no specific references therein by plate number; and it cannot fairly be said that they were introduced to promote lust or to produce libidinous thoughts. The author expresses his point of view in the preface to the book as follows: \u201cThe illustrations depict better than words can describe the natural and normal life, and the beautiful and healthful methods and activities of a gymnosophic society. They portray them as actually applied in several European countries by many thousands of men, women and children of all classes, occupations and conditions, while the text discusses its scientific, hygienic, cultural, aesthetic, ethical and humanitarian significance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In fact, it is only because social scientists are still working under conditions of enforced self-deception, similar to those which prevailed in the early days of the medical profession, that the propriety of the present book is questioned. Until phenomena such as those discussed in \u201cNudism in Modern Life\u201d can be studied on a realistic basis, it is reasonable to expect as great professional inadequacy in the solution of social problems as was true of attempts to solve problems affecting the health of the physical body, prior to the present-day development of medical science. There are still some unexplored areas of medical science, but there are many unexplored areas of social science. If anything, there is needed today greater patience and greater tolerance concerning research in sociology than in medicine; looking to the day when social scientists can advise not only courts, but the people generally; just as physicians, chemists and other physical scientists do today.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u201cDemocracy today needs the social scientists, both inside and outside the universities. It needs to free them to think with all possible penetration, wherever that thinking may lead. New ideas about human relations and institutional adjustment should be fully, honestly and hospitably analyzed. Society should he most deeply concerned not with ridiculing failures or condemning those whose findings it does not approve, but with aiding that small minority of pioneers whose work in the social studies is reaching up to new levels of scientific achievement. Such persons are to be found in universities, in government and in private life. No greater contribution to the disinterested comprehension of today\u2019s issues could be made than by affording these able men and women full opportunity to make their work genuinely effective.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It cannot reasonably be contended that the purpose of the pertinent statute is to prevent scientific research and education. To uphold the decision of the lower court would contribute to just that result. So to interpret it would be to abandon the field, in large measure, to the charlatan and the fakir.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u201cThe foolish judgments of Lord Eldon about one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>hundred years ago, proscribing the works of Byron and Southey, and the finding by the jury under a charge by Lord Denman that the publication of Shelley\u2019s \u2018Queen Mab\u2019 was an indictable offense are a warning to all who have to determine the limits of the field within which authors may exercise themselves.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXo\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-10\"> Section' 305(a), Title III of the Tariff Act of June 17, 1930, 46 Stat. 688, 19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1305(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AJ2\"> Timmons v.

A Moslem woman with her veil, a Spanish woman with her mantilla or fan, a Quakeress with her neckerchief, can be as indecent as a barbarian woman with her petticoat of dried grass. * * * It would be difficult to mention anything in Oriental mores which we regard with such horror as Orientals feel for low-necked dresses and round dances. Orientals use dress to conceal the contour of the form. The waist of a woman is made to disappear by a girdle. To an Oriental a corset, which increases the waist line and the plasticity. of the figure, is the extreme of indecency \u2014 far worse than nudity. It seems like an application of the art of the courtesan to appeal to sensuality.\u201d 438: \u201cAn elderly lady says that when the present queen of England brought in, at her marriage, the fashion of brushing up the hair so as to uncover the ears, which had long been covered, it seemed indecent.\u201d 430, 431: \u201cIn the Italian novel Niceolo dei Lapi it is said in honor of the heroine that she never saw herself nude. It was a custom observed by many to wear a garment which covered the whole body even when alone in the bath. Erasmus gives the reason for this. The angels would be shocked at nakedness. Ho made it a rule for men. One should never, he says, bare the body more than necessary, even when alone. The angels are everywhere and they like to see decency as the adjunct of modesty.\u201d 431: \u201cIt results from the study of the cases that nakedness is never shameful when it is unconscious (Genesis iii, 7).\u201d 434, 435: \u201cIt is very improper for a Chinese woman who has compressed feet to show them. Thomson gives a picture which shows the feet of a woman, but it was very difficult, he says, to persuade the woman to pose in that way. Chinese people would consider the picture obscene. No European would find the slightest suggestion of that kind in it. An Arab woman, in Egypt, cares more to cover her face than any other part of her body, and she is more careful to eover the top or back of her head than her face. It appears that if any part of the body is put under a concealment taboo for any reason whatever, a consequence is that the opinion grows up that it never ought to be exposed. Then interest may attach to it more than to exposed parts, and erotic suggestion may be connected with it.\u201d 436: \u201cThe natives of New Britain are naked, but modest and chaste. \u2018Nudity rather checks than stimulates.\u2019 The same is observed in English New Guinea. The men wear a bandage which does not conceal, hut they attach to this all the importance which wo attach to complete dress, and they speak of others who do not wear it as \u2018naked wild men.\u2019\u201d 437: \u201cOn the Uganda railroad, near Lake Victoria, coal-black people are to be seen, of whom both sexes are entirely naked, except ornaments. They are \u2018the most moral people in Uganda.\u2019 The Nile negroes and Masai are naked. In the midst of them live the Ba ganda wlm wear much clothing. The women are covered from the waist to the ankles; the men from the neck to the ankles, except porters and men working in the fields. * * * This character and their dress are accounted for by their long subjection to tyranny. They are \u2018profoundly immoral,\u2019 have indecent dances, and are dying out on account of the \u2018exhaustion of men and women by premature debauchery.\u2019 \u201d 440: \u201cThe Japanese do not consider nudity indecent. A Japanese woman pays no heed to the absence of clothing on workmen. European women in Japan are shocked at it, but themselves wear dinner and evening dress which greatly shock Orientals.\u201d 446: \u201cThere is no \u2018natural\u2019 and universal instinct, by coilision with which some things are recognized as obscene. We shall find that the things which we regard as obscene either were not, in other times and places, so regarded, any more than we so regard bared face and hands, or else that, from ancient usage, the exhibition was covered by a convention in protection of what is archaic or holy, or dramatic, or comical. In primitive times goblinism and magic covered especially the things which later became obscene. * * * As has been shown above, however, so soon as objects were attached to the body for any purpose whatever, the conventional view that bodies so distinguished were alone right and beautiful was started, and all the rest of the convention of ornament and dress followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Azx\">II Pareto, The Mind and Society (1935) \u00a7 1374, n. 1: \u201cThe Adamites imitated the nakedness of Adam in Paradise before the Fall. * * * They went naked to their meetings and listened to their sermons and took their sacraments naked, thinking of their church, in fact, as Paradise itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AhiN\">I Lea, History of the Inquisition (1888) 147, 148: \u201cIt was during the preaching of this crusade [against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Albigenses] that villages and towns in Germany were filled with women who, unable to expend their religious ardor in taking the cross, stripped themselves naked and ran silently through the roads and streets.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\"> See generally, Schroeder, \u201cObscene\u201d Literature and Constitutional Law (1911) c.

Hence, if obscene within the meaning of the statute, it clearly is subject<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>' to destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">In reviewing the District Court judgment we must first ascertain what connotation is to be given the term obscene as it appears in the statute prohibiting the importation of obscene books. It seems clear, contrary to implications in the majority opinion, that the purity of the author's motive and incidental claim the book may have to literary, scientific or educational value is not decisive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under an English statute prohibiting the sale of obscene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>literature, Cockburn, C. J., stated in Regina v. Hicklin, 3 Q. B. 360, 371 that: \u201cthe test of obscenity is this: Whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall\u201d. In this country we have several so-called federal obscenity statutes. In addition to the Tariff Act provision here invoked, Congress has provided criminal sanctions against importation, transportation by common carrier, or through the mails, of any \u201cobscene, lewd, or lascivious\u201d book.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With certain modifications the obscenity test of Regina v. Hicklin has been adopted by the Federal Courts in interpreting all of these statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As modified by these decisions the test might be stated as follows: A book is obscene when in the aggregate sense of the community<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the tendency of the objectionable matter, considered with the book as a whole,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is to arouse lustful thought.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That such a test of obscenity is required when the term' is associated in a criminal statute with lcwdness and lasciviousness does not, of course, mean that it is sufficiently broad for the term as it appears in the Tariff Act. Indeed, such a definition seems unduly restrictive of the normal meaning of the term and there is some judicial support for a broader, more inclusive definition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Assuming, however, that the stated definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>is applicable, can we say that the District Court erred in holding this book obscene within the meaning of the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Preliminarily it may be well to recall some of the fundamental principles respecting the function of an appellate court. First of all, it is settled that in ordinary actions an appeal is limited to matters of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In \u00a7 305 of the Tariff Act it is provided that \u201cIn any such proceeding [libel of an allegedly obscene book] any party in interest upon demand may have the facts at issue determined by a jury and any party may have an appeal or the right of review <em>as in the case of ordinary actions </em>or suits\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Italics supplied) These proceedings partake, therefore, of the nature of ordinary actions at law.- In such actions the verdict of the jury on questions of fact is final and conclusive.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Where a jury is waived the finding of the court on factual issues is given the same conclusive weight.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is in respect to every factual qu\u00e9stion, however, a preliminary legal question \u2014 could reasonable men differ on the factual issue in the light of the proof.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If so, the question is one for the fact trier. It is settled that whether a book is obscene presents a question of fact, if reasonable men could differ on that question.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> From this it follows that, where there has been a jury verdict (or a finding by the court where a jury is waived) that a book is obscene, an appellate court cannot disturb that determination unless it is prepared to say that no reasonable man could have found as did the jury (or court).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">We come then to the question, can it be said that no reasonable man could find the book in question obscene within the meaning of the statute? In this connection it is important to recall that under the decisions a book is obscene if in the aggregate sense of the community the tendency of the questionable matter, considered with the book as a whole, is to arouse lustful .thought. That is to say \u2014 the book must be judged by reference to the \u201cstandard of the community\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">\u201cLaws of this character 'ar\u00e9 made for society in the aggregate, and not in particular. So, while there may be individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>and societies of men and women of peculiar notions or idiosyncrasies, whose moral sense would neither be depraved nor offended by the publication now under consideration, yet the exceptional sensibility, or want of sensibility, of such cannot be allowed as a standard by which its obscenity or indecency is to be tested. Rather is the test, what is the judgment of the aggregate sense of the community reached by it? What is its probable, reasonable effect on the sense of decency, purity, and chastity of society, extending to the family, made up of men and women, young boys and girls,' \u2014 \u2022* * * Who is to deem, who is to judge, whether a given publication impinges upon the general sense of decency? * * * The answer to this is, that asserted violations of this statute, * * * must be left to the final arbiter under our system of government, \u2014 the courts. The jury, the legally constituted triers of the fact under the constitution, is to pass upon the question of fact. Under our institutions of government the panel of 12 are assumed to be the best and truest exponents of the public judgment of the common sense. Their selection and constitution proceed upon the theory that they most nearly .represent the average intelligence, the common experience and sense, of the vicinage; and these qualifications they are presumed to carry with them into the jury-box, and apply this average judgment to the law and the facts. Sitting as the court does in this case, in the stead of the jury, it may not apply to the facts its own method of analysis or process of reasoning as a judge, but should try to reflect in its findings the common experience, observation, and judgment of the jury of average intelligence.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The majority opinion recognizes that the book in question must be judged by the \u201ccommunity standard\u201d but it suggests in ascertaining \u201c* * * the present critical point in the compromise between candor and shame at which the community may have arrived here and now\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that \u201cthe expert opinions of psychologists and sociologists would seem to be helpful if not necessary\u201d. While such opinions might be helpful, none appear in the record. Furthermore, it must be remembered that social scientists do not alway reflect, or even intend to reflect, the sentiment of the community. Their opinions would seem relevant only if directed to the question of what the present community conscience is, in reference to a book of this character. It would seem clear that a sociologist\u2019s opinion on the standards of foreign communities (set forth at some length in note 16 of the majority opinion) would be almost entirely irrelevant to determination of what the standard of the community is in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">The District Court was of the' view that the book with the pictures in question, was obscene within the meaning of the statute, i. e., that it offended the present community standard. From their opinion it seems clear that the majority of this court would agree that just a few years ago a book of this character containing the pictures in question would unquestionably have been regarded as obscene. Undoubtedly, thought changes in respect to what is obscene. The \u201cjudgments of Lord Eldon about one hundred years ago, proscribing the works of Byron and Southey\u201d do not damn him as foolish so much as they support the thesis of the majority opinion that the content of the term \u201cobscene\u201d is geared to the clock. The majority have evidently concluded that the country-wide sense of decency has altered in the past few years to the extent that in the present day only a Rip Van Winkle could regard the book in question as obscene. That I cannot believe. Accepting the premise that \u201ctime marches on\u201d, I am nevertheless unable to agree that we have here and now \u201cprogressed\u201d to the point where a publication of this character is, beyond the possibility of reasonable difference of opinion, acceptable to the community. This publication, it must be repeated, is to be judged in the light of the present day standard, not that of the world of tomorrow. It is significant in this respect to note that when the governing provision was last re-enacted in 1930, Congress inserted for the first time a proviso indicating that it did not regard the \u201cso-called classics or books of recognized and established literary or scientific merit\u201d as ipso facto without the prohibition against the importation of obscene books.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">I think it important to emphasize that decision of this case calls, not for the individual judge\u2019s personal opinion, but, for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>gauging of the present community sentiment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It seems obvious to me that a court should rarely attempt that task as a matter of law. Certainly, it seems difficult to conclude that no reasonable man could say that this book offends the community standard and, with a District Court finding that the book with its pictures is obscene, I am unable to understand how my brethren can stand on that proposition. I not only think reasonable men might differ on that question which in itself requires an affirmance, I approve the result reached by the District Court that the matter in question is within the prohibition of the statute. I must therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-17\"> 46 Stat. 688, 19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AHXZ\"> The author\u2019s motive is of no consequence.

Likewise, it seems clear under the statute that incidental claim to literary, scientific or educational merit will not save a book otherwise, obscene. The statutory prohibition is absolute \u2014 forbidding importation of \u201cany\u201d obscene book. Moreover, there is a proviso that \u201cthe Secretary of the Treasury may, in his discretion, admit the so-called classics or books of recognized and established literary or scientific merit, but may, in his discretion, admit such classios or books only when imported for noncommercial purposes\u201d. Under elementary canons of statutory- construction, it seems clear that, apart from this exception not here involved, the prohibition of the statute against the importation of \u201cany obscene book\u201d is not subject to relaxation by reason of the latter\u2019s claim to literary, scientific or education<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>al merit.

It may be observed that permitting importation of this particular book can do little to advance the cause of science and education \u2014 it appears from the record that <em>a,domestic </em>edition of the same book is being freely sold.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\"> 35 Stat. 1138, amended 41 Stat. 1060, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 396 (importing and transporting obscene books); 36 Stat. 1339, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334 (mailing obscene matter).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\"> See Note 76 A.L.R. 1099.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b795-11\"> It is believed that the cases establish that the \u201cstandard of the community\u201d has been substituted for the \u201cstandard of the weak and susceptible\u201d, at least where there is no evidence of sales to the latter.

That is the meaning of the word in the concrete. But when used, as in the statute under which this indictment is framed, to describe the character of a book, pamphlet, or paper, it means a book, pamphlet, or paper containing immodest and indecent matter, the reading whereof would have a tendency to deprave and corrupt the minds of those into whose hands the publication might fall whose minds are open to such immoral influences\u201d. United States v. Clarke, D.C., E.D.Mo., 38 F. 732, 733. It seems settled that the term obscene as used in the statutes proscribing obscene books refers to lust rather than to immodesty or indelicacy.
