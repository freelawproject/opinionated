JONES, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b853-24\">Jeff Huber brought this action against his former employer, Lightforce USA, Inc. (\u201cLFUSA\u201d), for breach of contract and failure to pay wages. Huber\u2019s claims center on two agreements entered into during his employment with LFUSA: a Company Share Offer (\u201cCSO\u201d), and a Deed of Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition and Assignment (\u201cNDA\u201d). Huber claimed that upon his termination LFUSA was obligated to pay him the value of 30% of the goodwill of LFUSA under the CSO and twelve months\u2019 pay under the NDA. The parties agreed that the CSO was a deferred compensation plan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>was, therefore, governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). At a bench trial, Huber succeeded only on his breach of contract claim under the NDA. Huber timely appealed the district court\u2019s rulings on summary judgment: (1) holding that the amount owed under the NDA was not wages under the Idaho Wage Claims Act, (2) dismissing his wrongful termination claim, and (3) holding that the CSO was a \u201ctop hat\u201d plan under ERISA and, therefore, exempt from ERISA\u2019s vesting and anti-forfeiture provisions. Huber also appealed the district court\u2019s ruling at trial that Huber forfeited the benefit under the CSO, and the district court\u2019s rulings on post-trial motions: (1) denying his claim for equitable relief, (2) calculating Huber\u2019s award of prejudgment interest, and (3) awarding attorney fees and costs to LFUSA. Both Huber and LFUSA request attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Lightforce Australia (\u201cLFA\u201d) is an Australian company owned by Ray Dennis which manufactures spotlights for night hunting. In the early 1990s, Dennis expanded LFA into the United States and formed LFUSA, a Washington corporation. Jeff Huber began working for LFUSA in 1991 and was promoted to vice president in 1997. Huber was the person primarily responsible for LFUSA\u2019s daily operations and management as Dennis and the LFA Board of Advisors were located in Australia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">In 2000, LFUSA relocated from Washington to Orofino, Idaho. At that time, Huber and LFUSA entered into the CSO. The CSO provided that, beginning in 2000, Huber would receive 30% of the goodwill of LFUSA at a rate of 5% per year in exchange for his long-term employment and loyalty. As part of the CSO, LFUSA agreed to take out a $1,000,000 insurance policy on Huber to pay the value of the goodwill upon his illness, incapacitation, or death. Additionally, the CSO provided that Huber could exchange the goodwill for shares in the company if he retired at a reasonable age. However, any goodwill would be forfeited if Huber left LFUSA voluntarily or was terminated due to \u201cunsatisfactory performance.\u201d Huber was the only LFUSA employee ever offered the opportunity to participate in a CSO. In 2003, Huber, on behalf of LFUSA, purchased a $1,000,000 term life insurance policy on himself. The policy designated LFUSA as the owner and fifty-percent beneficiary and Huber\u2019s parents collectively as a fifty-percent beneficiary. In 2006, Huber amended the policy, reducing its value to $750,000. Huber then converted the remaining $250,000 into a whole life policy and designated himself and LFUSA as the owners of the policy and LFUSA and his wife each as fifty-percent beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">By 2010, LFUSA had grown significantly, but Huber\u2019s relationship with the company had begun deteriorating. In March 2010, Monika Leniger-Sherratt, LFA\u2019s group general manager, conducted a workforce planning review of LFUSA. After interviewing key individuals, Leniger-Sherratt concluded that LFUSA lacked communication and formal meeting procedures within management and there was confusion about Huber\u2019s direction for the company. Additionally, Huber was known to micromanage staff without consulting department heads. After the review, Huber met with the LFA board, which recommended that he hire a second-in-command to aid in his vice-president responsibilities. Huber did not follow that recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">In July 2010, LFUSA\u2019s financial officer, Hope Coleman, reported to Leniger-Sherratt that Huber had instructed her to falsify a backorder report that was to be presented at a LFA board meeting. At the meeting, Huber reported that the backorders for 2010 totaled $1:1 million. However, Coleman had given Leniger-Sherratt a report showing that the backorders for 2010 were actually around $2.4 million. In August, Huber again met with the LFA board. The board questioned Huber about the backorder report and he denied knowing that the backorders totaled $2.4 million for 2010. After the meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>ing, the LFA board restructured LFUSA\u2019s management, replacing Huber\u2019s role as vice president with a managing board referred to as the Organization Managing Group (\u201cOMG\u201d). At that time, Huber was made Director of Research &amp; Development and he retained a position on the OMG. Despite the management change, the LFA board received complaints that Huber continued to act as though he was vice president and make major business decisions without consulting the OMG. Additionally, the board received complaints that Huber was hostile toward staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">In February 2011, LFUSA requested that Huber sign the NDA. In the NDA, Huber agreed not to compete with LFUSA during his employment and for twelve months after employment. Huber also agreed not to disclose confidential information and to assign his rights in any intellectual property to LFUSA. The NDA also provided that if Huber was terminated he would receive twelve months\u2019 pay as long as he was not terminated for performance related issues or summarily dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In May 2011, due to continued complaints from LFUSA employees, the LFA board removed Huber from the OMG, but allowed him to retain his position as Director of Research &amp; Development. Huber was also encouraged to take a two-month vacation. While Huber was on leave, several LFUSA employees expressed concern about Huber returning to LFUSA and threatened to leave the company. On August 1, 2011, Dennis and Leniger-Sherratt informed Huber that he would be terminated effective August 1, 2012. Leniger-Sherratt, in a letter dated August 3, 2011, memorialized this conversation and documented performance issues which formed the basis for Huber\u2019s termination, including: not being transparent with the LFA board, being hostile toward LFUSA staff, and directing the financial officer to falsify the backorder report in 2010. Dennis and Huber agreed that from August 2011 to August 2012, Huber would receive his full salary and benefits, but Huber would not return to work at LFUSA. Instead, Huber was to explore future business opportunities for him and Dennis outside of LFUSA. Huber\u2019s termination became effective one year later on August 1, 2012, and Huber sought to collect the goodwill benefit under the CSO and twelve months\u2019 pay under the NDA. LFUSA refused to pay Huber.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">On August 27, 2012, Huber filed suit against LFUSA for breach of contract and unpaid wages under the Idaho Wage Claims Act (\u201cIWCA\u201d). Huber amended his complaint on May 29, 2013, to add claims for wrongful termination and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Additionally, Huber added a claim under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>alleging that the CSO was a deferred compensation plan under ERISA and LFUSA was in violation of ERISA for interfering with his rights therein. The parties agreed to proceed with a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">Prior to trial, both Huber and LFUSA moved for partial summary judgment. In July 2013, Huber asked the district court to summarily rule that: (1) the CSO was a pension plan subject to ERISA and, therefore, his rights had vested and were not subject to forfeiture; and (2) the amount owed under the NDA was wages under the IWCA and, therefore, subject to trebling under Idaho Code section 45-615. Prior to a ruling on Huber\u2019s motion, the parties stipulated that the CSO was a deferred compensation plan under ERISA. However, LFUSA argued that the CSO was a \u201ctop hat\u201d plan and, therefore, exempt from ERISA\u2019s vesting and anti-forfeiture provisions. The district court ruled that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the CSO was a top hat plan and subject to the anti-forfeiture provisions of ERISA, but held that the amount owed under the NDA was not wages and, therefore, not subject to trebling under Idaho Code section 45-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>In August 2013, LFUSA asked the district court to summarily rule that the CSO was a top hat plan under ERISA and to dismiss Huber\u2019s claim for wrongful termination of employment. The district court held that the CSO was a top hat plan and, therefore, was exempt from ERISA\u2019s vesting and anti-forfeiture provisions. The district court found that whether Huber would recover under the CSO depended on whether Huber had forfeited the benefit by being terminated for \u201cunsatisfactory performance.\u201d Additionally, the district court dismissed Huber\u2019s claim for wrongful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Trial was held from October 21 through October 30, 2013. As the issues had been significantly limited by the district court\u2019s rulings on summary judgment, the trial focused primarily on two issues: (1) whether Huber was terminated for unsatisfactory performance and, therefore, forfeited the goodwill benefit under the CSO and (2) whether Huber was terminated for performance issues or summarily dismissed and, therefore, was not owed any compensation under the NDA. The district court concluded that Huber was owed $180,000 (twelve months\u2019 pay) under the NDA because he was neither terminated for performance related issues nor summarily dismissed as defined in the NDA. However, the district court found that Huber forfeited the benefit under the CSO because he had been terminated for unsatisfactory performance, relying on the reasons documented in the August 3, 2011 letter from Leniger-Sherratt.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">During closing arguments, Huber argued that the court should grant him an equitable share of the goodwill even if he was not entitled to the full 30%. The court denied relief, stating that Huber had not pled equitable relief and, even if he had, Huber had received sufficient compensation for his past work. Huber later moved to amend his pleadings to incorporate the claim for equitable relief, which the district court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">After trial, both parties moved for an award of attorney fees and costs and Huber moved for an award of prejudgment interest. The district court awarded Huber prejudgment interest from August 2013 to December 2013, totaling $7,752.58. The court found that the amount owed under the NDA was not due and owing until twelve months after Huber was terminated because it was conditioned on Huber complying with the twelvemonth, non-competition period in the NDA. Both parties had moved for an award of attorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-120(3) and ERISA. The district court declined to awai'd either party attorney fees under ERISA. However, the district court held that LFUSA was the prevailing party and awarded LFUSA $264,000.00 in fees under Idaho Code section 12-120(3). The district court found that, although Huber prevailed on the NDA claim, LFUSA prevailed on the larger issues of whether the CSO was a top hat plan and whether Huber\u2019s rights under the CSO were forfeited because he was terminated for unsatisfactory performance. Additionally, the district court awarded LFUSA $15,584.51 in costs as a matter of right and $4,880.25 in discretionary costs. Huber filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees and costs to LFUSA, which was denied. Huber timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-10\">1.

The district court erred in ruling that the amount owed under the NDA was not wages under the Idaho Wage Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">At trial, the district court ruled that LFUSA owed Huber twelve months\u2019 pay under the terms of the NDA, totaling $180,000. That ruling is not on appeal. However, Huber contends that the district court erred in ruling on summary judgment that the twelve months\u2019 pay was not wages under the IWCA [I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 45-601 <em>et seq </em>]. On summary judgment, the district court concluded that the twelve months\u2019 pay was not wages because it was meant to compensate Huber for complying with the NDA\u2019s non-competition and nondisclosure clauses and not earned in increments as services were performed or in consideration for services rendered. On appeal, Huber contends that the pay was not expressly conditioned on Huber complying with the non-competition clause. Huber also argues that the twelve months\u2019 pay is analogous to severance pay which constitutes wages under the IWCA and, therefore, the $180,000 judgment should be trebled under Idaho Code section 45-615. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The disposition of this issue requires this Court to interpret the definition of \u201cwages\u201d under the IWCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which we exercise free review. This Court must construe a statute to give effect to the intent of the legislature. It must begin with the literal words of the statute; those words must be given their plain, usual, and ordinary meaning; and the statute must be construed as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-11\"><em>Paolini v. Albertson\u2019s Inc., </em>143 Idaho 547, 549, 149 P.3d 822, 824 (2006) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">Wage claims are governed by Chapter 6 of Title 45 of the Idaho Code. \u201cWage\u201d is defined broadly under Idaho Code section 45-601(7) as \u201ccompensation for labor or services rendered by an employee, whether the amount is determined on a time, task, piece or commission basis.\u201d In <em>Paolini, </em>this Court found that the statute \u201cis not limited to wages earned during a calendar month or to wages normally paid every calendar month\u201d but also applies to \u201c[w]ages earned over a longer period of time, such as an annual bonus based on net profits [which] will become due during a specific calendar month.\u201d 143 Idaho at 549, 149 P.3d at 824. In determining whether a particular item constitutes \u201cwages,\u201d this Court has considered whether the item is bargained-for compensation for employment services. <em>Johnson v. Allied Stores Corp., </em>106 Idaho 363, 367, 679 P.2d 640, 644 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">In <em>Johnson, </em>this Court held that severance pay is wages because it is \u201ca component of the compensation bargained for in the agreement of employment ... not a mere gratuity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Severance pay\u2019 has been defined as \u2018[a] sum of money usually based on length of employment for which an employee is eligible upon termination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker v. Underwriters Lab., Inc., </em>140 Idaho 517, 520, 96 P.3d 618, 621 (2004) (quoting American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed.2000)). \u201cThe purpose of a severance plan is to protect employees from economic hardship and to reward them for <em>past service </em>to the company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 27 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Emp\u2019t Relationship </em>\u00a7 70 (1996)) (emphasis added). Although in <em>Parker </em>this Court was defining \u201cseverance pay\u201d under an administrative provision unrelated to the IWCA, the Court\u2019s reasoning is nevertheless instructive on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">Under <em>Parker, </em>severance pay is a distinct form of compensation in that it is intended to compensate an employee for past service and protect an employee from economic hardship. This is consistent with <em>Johnson, </em>where this court held that severance pay was wages because it is part of the bargained-for compensation for employment services. <em>See Johnson, </em>106 Idaho at 367, 679 P.2d at 644. In <em>Parker, </em>this Court distinguished between severance pay and pay in consideration of a release of claims, focusing on the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>the agreement. 140 Idaho at 521, 96 P.3d at 622. We held that a payment made in exchange for a release of claims against an employer was not severance because it was entirely separate from services rendered during employment. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 96 P.3d at 623. Similarly, in <em>Moore v. Omnicare, </em>this Court held that compensation promised in an employment agreement is not wages where it is not in consideration for any services actually rendered during employment. 141 Idaho 809, 819-20, 118 P.3d 141, 151-52 (2005) (holding that damages under a liquidation clause were not wages because they were not compensation for services rendered).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Huber argues that the amount owed under the NDA is analogous to severance pay and that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Johnson, </em>106 Idaho 363, 679 P.2d 640, should control. Relying on <em>Moore, </em>141 Idaho 809, 118 P.3d 141, LFUSA argues that the twelve months\u2019 pay cannot be considered severance because it was consideration for compliance with the NDA\u2019s non-competition clause, not for any services rendered during employment. To resolve this issue, we must examine the terms of the NDA and determine whether the twelve months\u2019 pay was intended to compensate Huber for his past service as an employee, or if it was in consideration of Huber\u2019s compliance with the non-competition and non-disclosure clauses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">When the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous, its interpretation and legal effect are questions of law. An unambiguous contract will be given its plain meaning. The purpose of interpreting a contract is to determine the intent of the contracting parties at the time the contract was entered. In determining the intent of the parties, this Court must view the contract as a whole. If a contract is found ambiguous, its interpretation is a question of fact. Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-15\"><em>Shawver v. Huckleberry Estates, L.L.C., </em>140 Idaho 354, 361, 93 P.3d 685, 692 (2004) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">Section 3 of the NDA, titled \u201cNON COMPETITION,\u201d includes the clause providing for the twelve months\u2019 pay as well as several non-competition conditions. Section 3.1 provides that unless LFUSA provides written consent, Huber must not, during employment or for twelve months after, compete with LFUSA in the specific ways described in subsections 3.1.1 through 3.1.4<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 3.2 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-17\">In the event that the employee is terminated for any reason other than performance related issues (as defined) and/or summary dismissal (as defined), the employer will pay the employee an amount congruent with the base salary at the time of termination for the period as stipulated in 3.1 in accordance with the provisions outlined in 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-18\">Subsections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 provide that if Huber were to obtain employment in the twelve months after being terminated, LFU-SA would continue to pay him the difference between the compensation earned in his new employment and his base salary at the time of his termination. However, LFUSA would stop payments if Huber obtained employment that paid him as much or more than his base salary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Huber contends that that the twelve months\u2019 pay provided for in section 3.2 was not conditioned on compliance with the non-competition conditions in sections 3.1.1 through 3.1.4 because there is no express language tying the payment to the non-competition conditions. LFUSA argues that the twelve months\u2019 pay was intended to be conditioned on compliance with the non-competition conditions in section 3.1 because it was incorporated under Section 3 which is titled \u201cNON COMPETITION.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Although the payment and non-competition clauses are within the same section, no language in section 3.2 expressly conditions the twelve months\u2019 pay on compliance with the non-competition conditions. Additionally, the NDA specifies that headings do not affect interpretation, implying that the parties did not intend provisions within the same section to be interpreted together absent express language. The only term in section 3.1 expressly incorporated into section 3.2 is the twelve-month time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Presumably, if the parties had intended the twelve months\u2019 pay to be conditioned on non-competition, the NDA would have expressly incorporated such a condition. This is particularly true where the parties did include express conditions under section 3.2. Under the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusion alterius, </em>\u201cthe expression in a contract of one or more things of a class implies the exclusion of all not expressed.\u201d <em>Ace Realty, Inc. v. Anderson, </em>106 Idaho 742, 749, 682 P.2d 1289, 1296 (Ct.App.1984) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The NDA provides that Huber would not receive the twelve months\u2019 pay if he were terminated for performance issues or summarily dismissed. Additionally, sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 provide that the payments would end or be reduced if Huber obtained other employment within the twelve month period. The inclusion of these express conditions implies the exclusion of all other conditions not expressed. Accordingly, the express terms of the NDA do not evidence a mutual intent to condition the twelve months\u2019 pay on compliance with the non-competition conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Rather, section 3.2 seems intended to provide a severance payment. A severance payment is meant to \u201cprovide a salary substitute to secure the employee\u2019s economic well-being during [a] period of unemployment.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>140 Idaho at 520, 96 P.3d at 621 (internal citation omitted). Here, section 3.-2 specifically provides that, as long as Huber is not terminated for performance issues or summarily dismissed, Huber would receive comparable compensation to his base salary for twelve months, even if Huber obtained other employment during that period. This provision seems intended to secure Huber\u2019s economic well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Based on a plain reading of the terms of the NDA, the twelve months\u2019 pay is not conditioned on compliance with the non-competition conditions. Rather, it unambiguously provides for a severance payment that is intended to compensate Huber for his past service and secure his economic well-being. As this Court found in <em>Johnson, </em>severance pay constitutes wages under the IWCA because it is \u201ca component of the compensation bargained for in the agreement of employment.\u201d 106 Idaho at 367, 679 P.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">We reverse the district court ruling that the amount owed under the NDA was not wages under the IWCA, and remand for the district court to treble the $180,000 judgment under Idaho Code section 45-615. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the trebled amount of $540,000 from December 10, 2013, the date of entry of the judgment. <em>Whitlock v. Haney Seed Co., </em>114 Idaho 628, 635, 759 P.2d 919, 926 (CtApp.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">2. The district court abused its discretion by not awarding prejudgment interest prior to August 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">After the district court entered judgment in favor of Huber for $180,000, Huber moved to amend the judgment to include prejudgment interest. The district court awarded prejudgment interest from August 2013 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>through December 2013, totaling $7,752.58. The district court found that, although Huber should have received bi-monthly checks during the twelve months after his employment was terminated, the twelve months\u2019 pay was conditioned on compliance with the non-competition clause. The non-competition clause required that Huber not compete with LFU-SA for twelve months after employment. Therefore, the district court found that the amount owed under the NDA was not due and owing until August 2013-twelve months after Huber\u2019s termination became effective. On appeal, Huber contends that the payments were not conditioned on compliance with the non-competition clause and that the prejudgment interest should have been calculated from the date of Huber\u2019s termination or from the date each severance payment came due and went unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">As found above, the twelve months\u2019 pay was not conditioned on compliance with the non-competition clause. The district court, therefore, had no basis to conclude that the $180,000 did not become due until August 2013.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the district court found, Huber should have received bi-monthly payments during the twelve months after termination. The district court, therefore, abused its discretion by not awarding prejudgment interest prior to August 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">We vacate the district court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest and remand to the district court to award Huber prejudgment interest from the date when each bi-monthly payment came due and went unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">3. The district court did not err in ruling that the CSO was a \u201ctop hat\u201d plan under ERISA and, therefore, exempt from ERISA\u2019s vesting and anti-forfeiture provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">On summary judgment, the district court held that the CSO was a top hat plan and, therefore, exempt from ERISA\u2019s vesting and anti-forfeiture provisions. The parties disagree as to whether the determination that the CSO is a top hat plan is an issue of law subject to de novo review or a mixed issue of law and fact. No court has directly expressed the standard an appellate court applies when reviewing a district court\u2019s determination of whether a plan meets the definition of a top hat plan. However, the Sixth Circuit has implied that the issue is a question of law subject to de novo review. <em>Daft v. Advest, Inc., </em>658 F.3d 583, 594 (6th Cir.2011) (concluding that a district court reviews de novo \u201ca plan administrator\u2019s determination of questions of law, such as whether a plan meets the statutory definition of a top-hat plan.\u201d). Additionally, \u201cthe appropriate standard of review is not simply a consequence of the substance of the underlying dispute,\u201d but rather, \u201cthis Court must consider the procedural posture in which a case arrives for review to decide the standard of review.\u201d <em>Goodman v. Lothrop, </em>143 Idaho 622, 625, 151 P.3d 818, 821 (2007). Here, the district court ruled that the CSO was a top hat plan on summary judgment. Therefore, we review the district court\u2019s determination that the CSO is a top hat plan de novo, applying the standard for summary judgment. <em>Trotter v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, </em>152 Idaho 842, 845-46, 275 P.3d 857, 860-61 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">The parties agree that the CSO is a deferred compensation plan governed by ERISA. ERISA applies to any employee benefit plan not within certain enumerated exceptions. As relevant here, top hat plans are exempt from ERISA\u2019s vesting and anti-forfeiture provisions [29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1061], <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051(2). If the CSO is a top hat plan, the goodwill benefit was forfeitable if Huber were terminated for unsatisfactory performance. If the CSO is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>a top hat plan, the anti-forfeiture provisions of ERISA apply and the benefit became nonforfeitable after six years of service. <em>See </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1053(a)(2)(B). Top hat plans are defined as \u201cunfunded and ... maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051(2). Huber does not dispute that he was a highly compensated employee. The only issue on appeal is whether the plan was unfunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">ERISA does not specifically define the term \u201cunfunded\u201d and neither this Court nor the Ninth Circuit has addressed the issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Jurisdictions that have addressed this issue focused primarily on \u201cwhether the corporation has set aside funds, separate from its general assets, for payment of plan benefits and whether the beneficiaries have a legal right greater than that of a general, unsecured creditor to the corporation\u2019s assets.\u201d <em>In re IT Grp., Inc., </em>448 F.3d 661, 667 (3d Cir.2006) <em>as amended </em>(July 10, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The Eighth Circuit has held that death benefits financed by whole life insurance policies with cash value were funded under ERISA because the employee may look to res separate from the corporation when the contingency occurs that triggers the plan\u2019s liability. <em>Dependahl v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>653 F.2d 1208, 1214 <em>(8th </em>Cir.1981). Contrastingly, a benefit plan financed by an insurance policy was unfunded where the plan specified that the rights of the beneficiary were solely those of an unsecured creditor. <em>Belsky v. First Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., 818 </em>F.2d 661, 663-64 (8th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The Second Circuit has adopted a similar standard, holding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">the question a court must ask in determining whether a plan is unfunded is: can the beneficiary establish, through the plan documents, a legal right any greater than that of an unsecured creditor to a specific set of funds from which the employer is, under the terms of the plan, obligated to pay the deferred compensation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-9\"><em>Demery v. Extebank Deferred Comp. Plan (B), </em>216 F.3d 283, 287 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (adopting the standard set forth in <em>Miller v. Heller, </em>915 F.Supp. 651, 660 (S.D.N.Y.1996)). In <em>Demery, </em>the Second Circuit held that a plan was unfunded where the plan stated that the benefits should be paid out of the <em>employer\u2019s </em>general assets and that the employer\u2019s promise under the plan should be treated as unfunded and unsecured. <em>Id. </em>at 287. Even though the employer had taken life insurance policies out on participating employees and the funds were kept in a separate bank account, the court found that the terms of the plan plainly did not give the plaintiffs a greater legal right to the funds than that possessed by an unsecured creditor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">The Fifth Circuit drew from the tests articulated in the Eighth and Second Circuits, but also considered an advisory opinion from the Department of Labor stating that the determination of whether a plan is unfunded requires examination of the surrounding facts and circumstances including the tax consequences of the plan. <em>See Reliable Home Health Care, Inc. v. Union Cent. Ins. Co., </em>295 F.3d 505, 513 (5th Cir.2002) (citing Op. Dep\u2019t. Labor 92-13A (May 19, 1992)). Based on these considerations, the Fifth Circuit held that insurance policies did not fund a welfare benefit plan where the insurance policies were not owned by the participants, the participants were prohibited from making contributions to the plan, and the plan did not intend the participants to incur tax liability when insurance premiums were paid. <em>Id. </em>at 514-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">The foregoing cases demonstrate that \u201cthe mere fact that a plan is funded by an insurance policy is not dispositive of a plan\u2019s status as funded or unfunded for ERISA purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514. Benefit plans supposedly funded by insurance policies have consistently been found unfunded where the plan document expressly provides that the policy is a general asset of the employer and/or the beneficiary\u2019s interests in the policy are no more than that of an unsecured creditor. <em>See IT Group., Inc., </em>448 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>669; <em>Demery, </em>216 F.3d at 287; <em>Belsky, </em>818 F.2d at 663-64. Plans have also been found to be unfunded where the participant is not an owner of the policy, made no contributions, and did not incur tax liability for premiums paid. <em>Reliable Home Health Care, </em>295 F.3d at 514-15; <em>see also Crumley v. Stonhard, Inc., </em>920 F.Supp. 589, 593 (D.N.J. 1996) (holding a plan is unfunded where no contributions are made by the employee or any third party).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Additionally, at least one court has found that a plan is unfunded where a life insurance policy only funds the plan under certain conditions. In <em>Belka v. Rowe Furniture Corp., </em>the District Court for the District of Maryland held that a life insurance policy did not fund a plan where the benefit was payable to the employee upon his retirement, termination, or death, and the insurance policy would only cover the employer\u2019s liability when the participant died. 571 F.Supp. 1249, 1252 (D.Md.1983). The court in <em>Belka </em>distinguished these circumstances from the case in <em>Dependahl, </em>because in <em>Dependahl </em>the benefit was payable only on the death of the employee and, therefore, the life insurance policy provided an immediate source of funding. <em>Id. Belka </em>was different than <em>Dependahl, </em>in that, in the majority of circumstances \u201cthe benefits would have to be paid out of the company\u2019s general revenues, at least until the employee\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">In the present case, the district court held that the CSO was unfunded because there was no evidence that the cash value of the life insurance policies was sufficient to cover the goodwill benefit or that the insurance policies would not be available to general creditors. Huber argues that the benefit is funded because the CSO provided that LFU-SA would fund the plan through purchasing life insurance and, therefore, Huber could look to res separate from LFUSA\u2019s general assets. LFUSA contends that the plan is unfunded because Huber did not pay taxes on any of the premiums paid under the insurance policies and the insurance policies only funded the benefit in the case of death, illness, or incapacitation, not if Huber retired or was terminated for reasons besides unsatisfactory performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The CSO provides that, in exchange for Huber\u2019s long term employment and loyalty, he is to receive 30% (maximum) of company goodwill over a six year period commencing with 5% for the year 2000. The CSO also provides specific circumstances that will trigger Huber\u2019s right to collect the goodwill benefit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">a) Death, ill health or incapacitation of Jeff Huber \u2014 LFUSA take out insurance cover to the value of $1,000,000 on Jeff Huber. At the time Jeff Huber is paid via this insurance policy using his good-will Value, this is determined by two independent valuations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-8\">b) If Jeff Huber elects to leave voluntarily, or employment is terminated due to unsatisfactory performance, then all goodwill is lost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-9\">c) If Jeff Huber retires at a reasonable age and NO sale of business is pending he shall be given the option of exchanging the goodwill accumulated for shares in the company to the value calculated to be the equivalent to goodwill at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">In 2003, Huber, on behalf of LFUSA, did purchase a term life insurance policy on himself, naming LFUSA the owner and fifty-percent beneficiary of the policy and Huber\u2019s parents collectively as a fifty-percent beneficiary. In 2006, Huber modified the policy, reducing the term life policy to $750,000 and turning the remaining $250,000 into a whole life policy. The whole life policy names LFUSA and Huber as owners and LFUSA and Huber\u2019s wife each as fifty-percent beneficiaries. Huber argues that this case is most similar to <em>Dependahl </em>because the $250,000 policy was a whole life policy with a cash value and the insurance policies constitute separate res which Huber could look to, to fund the goodwill benefit. Additionally, Huber argues that, unlike other cases where a plan has been found to be unfunded, there is no express language in the CSO providing that the life insurance policies are general assets of LFUSA or that Huber\u2019s rights are the same as the rights of an unsecured creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Huber is identified as an owner in the whole life policy and would have rights in that policy more than an unsecured creditor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>However, much like <em>Belka, </em>the life insurance policies would only fund the CSO benefit in rare circumstances. The CSO expressly provides that the insurance policies will fund the benefit in the case of death, ill health or incapacitation. However, if Huber retired at a reasonable age or were terminated for reasons other than unsatisfactory performance he would receive the value of the benefit by trading in the value of the goodwill for shares in LFUSA. This case is similar to <em>Belka, </em>where, although the plan would be funded by an insurance policy in certain circumstances, \u201cin the ordinary case, the payment of the benefits to an employee ... would be made out of the employer\u2019s general assets.\u201d <em>See Belka, </em>571 F.Supp. at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Here, Huber does not contest that under the terms of the CSO the insurance policy would only fund the plan in certain circumstances. Rather, Huber contends that the Court should not follow <em>Belka </em>because a plan should not be considered \u201cunfunded\u201d under ERISA if it is partially funded. Alternatively, Huber argues that <em>Belka </em>is not on point because the plan in that case included language stating that the employee had no right to the insurance benefit. Huber provides no authority to support his position that if a benefit plan is partially funded it cannot be unfunded for the purposes of ERISA. The court in <em>Belka </em>did find that the plan expressly provided that employees had no rights in the policy. However, this finding in no way formed the basis of the court\u2019s holding that the plan was unfunded because, except in the event the participant died, the benefit would have to be paid out of the company\u2019s general assets. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">It is undisputed that the CSO provides that the insurance policy would only cover LFUSA\u2019s liability in the case of Huber\u2019s death, illness or incapacitation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under all other circumstances, Huber was to be paid out of the general assets of the company. Like in <em>Belka, </em>there was no res separate from the general assets of LFUSA to fund the benefit in the case of retirement or termination, and Huber\u2019s interest in those assets was no greater than that of an unsecured creditor. Therefore, we hold that the CSO was unfunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment that the CSO was a top hat plan under ERISA, and, therefore, exempt from ERISA\u2019s vesting and anti-forfeiture provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">4. The district court did not err in ruling that the CSO\u2019s forfeiture clause was enforceable and that Huber forfeited the benefit by being terminated for unsatisfactory performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">At trial, the parties litigated whether Huber had been terminated for \u201cunsatisfactory performance\u201d and, therefore, forfeited the goodwill benefit under the CSO. The district court held that Huber forfeited the goodwill benefit under the CSO because a reasonable person would find that Huber\u2019s failure to address production issues, management style, demeanor, and unprofessional treatment of LFUSA employees collectively amounted to unsatisfactory performance. On appeal, Huber argues that the CSO\u2019s forfeiture provision is unenforceable under federal common law. Additionally, Huber argues that the district court applied the wrong standard to determine whether Huber was fired for unsatisfactory performance and that its determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Lastly, Huber contends that, even if he was terminated for unsatisfactory performance, the district court erred in holding that the entire benefit was forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">\u201cTop hat plans are \u2018employee benefit plans\u2019 within the meaning of ERISA.\u201d <em>Carr v. First Nationwide Bank, </em>816 F.Supp. 1476, 1486 (N.D.Cal.1993). Although top hat plans are not subject to many of the substantive provisions of ERISA regarding forfeiture, vesting, funding and fiduciary duties, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>plans \u201cremain subject to the enforcement provisions of ERISA codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under \u00a7 1132(a), a participant in an ERISA plan may bring a civil action \u201cto recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">\u201cThe forfeitability of top hat plan benefits is governed by federal common law.\u201d <em>Tyco Int\u2019l, Ltd. v. Kozlowski, </em>756 F.Supp.2d 553, 565 (S.D.N.Y.2010). ERISA does not provide substantive guidance on interpreting and enforcing top hat benefit plans. \u201cInstead, Congress intended for the courts, borrowing from state law where appropriate, and guided by the policies expressed in ERISA and other federal labor laws, to fashion a body of federal common law to govern ERISA suits.\u201d <em>Scott v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>754 F.2d 1499, 1502 (9th Cir.1985). As discussed at length by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Menhom v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>\u201cCongress viewed ERISA as a grant of authority to the courts to develop principles governing areas of the law relating to employee benefit plans that had previously been the exclusive province of state law.\u201d 738 F.2d 1496, 1499 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">First, Huber argues that under federal common law the forfeiture provision in the CSO is unenforceable because federal courts subject forfeiture clauses to a rigorous reasonableness test whenever the substantive non-forfeiture provisions of ERISA are not applicable. According to Huber, the forfeiture clause is unenforceable because the triggering event, termination for unsatisfactory performance, does not provide objective criteria and is too broad. Huber relies on <em>Hollenbeck v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>where the Eastern District of Missouri considered whether to enforce a forfeiture, or \u201cbad boy,\u201d clause in a benefit plan that accrued after January 1, 1975, when ERISA became effective, but before January 1, 1976, when ERISA\u2019s anti-forfeiture provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053, became effective. 605 F.Supp. 421, 427-28 (E.D.Mo.1984) <em>aff'd, </em>780 F.2d 20 (8th Cir.1985). The court found that \u201c[i]n enacting ERISA, Congress was deeply concerned over the use of such \u2018bad boy clauses to forfeit an employee\u2019s vested ERISA benefits\u201d and \u201c[i]n accordance with Congress\u2019 strong policy ... courts have subjected bad boy clauses to a rigorous reasonableness test whenever the substantive non-forfeiture provisions of ERISA are not applicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428. Importantly, the court in <em>Hollenbeck </em>was not dealing with a top hat plan, but with a plan that accrued before the anti-forfeiture provisions of ERISA took effect. The court in <em>Hollenbeck </em>essentially found that, even though \u00a7 1053 was not applicable in that case, the policies underlying the provision should guide the application of federal common law. However, those same policy concerns are not present when dealing with a top hat plan, which is expressly exempt from ERISA\u2019s anti-forfeiture provisions. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Congress intentionally exempted top hat plans from the anti-forfeiture provisions of ERISA because such plans are for high-ranking employees and \u201cexecutives are assumed to have a strong enough bargaining position when negotiating these plans to obtain the inclusion of a nonforfeitability provision if they wish to do so.\u201d <em>Tyco, </em>756 F.Supp.2d at 565. In <em>Bigda v. Fischbach Corp., </em>the District Court for Southern District of New York held that federal common law may not be used to create nonforfeitability protection for top hat plans. 898 F.Supp. 1004, 1016 (S.D.N.Y.1995) <em>aff'd, </em>101 F.3d 108 (2d Cir.1996). The court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGPq\">Courts, use federal common law to fill in the interstices of ERISA\u2019s statutory scheme [in] deciding claims that are allowed by ERISA but where ERISA does not provide substantive law. The failure of ERISA to provide nonforfeitability coverage to top hat plans is not an \u201cinterstice\u201d because it is the result of a deliberate decision to let executives use their positions of power to negotiate such protection for their plans on their own. Federal common law must further the purposes of the statute under which it is used; it may not be used to re-write the federal statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqM\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted). Following the reasoning in <em>Bigda, </em>another federal district court also rejected an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>argument that a forfeiture clause in a top hat plan was \u201cunreasonably overbroad\u201d under federal common law. <em>Bryan v. Pep Boys-Manny, Moe &amp; Jack, </em>No. CIV.A. 00-1525, 2001 WL 752645, at *4 (E.D.Pa. June 29, 2001). Huber has not provided any authority to support the proposition that the holding in <em>Hollenbeck </em>is applicable to top hat plans. The application of federal common law to create non-forfeiture protection would be contrary to ERISA\u2019s express exemption of top hat plans from such protection. Therefore, we hold that the CSO\u2019s forfeiture provision is enforceable under federal common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Second, Huber argues that the district court applied the wrong standard to determine whether he was terminated for unsatisfactory performance and, alternatively, that there was not substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s holding. Whether Huber forfeited the goodwill benefit under the CSO is governed by contract principles, applied as a matter of federal common law. <em>See Kemmerer v. ICI Americas, Inc., </em>70 F.3d 281, 287 (3d Cir.1995). The federal common law in this area is guided by contract principles usually developed by state law, keeping in mind the policies underlying ERISA. <em>Scott, </em>754 F.2d at 1502. Idaho contract law is instructive here, as Idaho courts apply \u201cthe general rules of contract law subject to certain special canons of construction.\u201d <em>Clark v. Prudential Prop, and Cas. Ins. Co., </em>138 Idaho 538, 540, 66 P.3d 242, 244 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The determination of whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law. <em>Shawver v. Huckleberry Estates, L.L.C., </em>140 Idaho 354, 361, 93 P.3d 685 692 (2004). \u201cWhen the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous its interpretation and legal effect are questions of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where terms of a contract are \u201creasonably subject to differing interpretations, the language is ambiguous and its meaning is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>138 Idaho at 541, 66 P.3d at 245. \u201cTo determine the meaning of an ambiguous contract, the trier of fact must determine what a reasonable person would have understood the language to mean and the words used must be construed given their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Here, the CSO\u2019s forfeiture clause provides that if Jeff Huber elects to leave voluntarily, or if his employment is terminated due to unsatisfactory performance, then all goodwill is lost. The district court concluded that the phrase \u201cunsatisfactory performance\u201d was ambiguous because it was not defined in the CSO. The district court then concluded that whether Huber was terminated for unsatisfactory performance would be determined by whether or not a reasonable person would find Huber\u2019s performance to be unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The meaning of the phrase \u201cunsatisfactory performance\u201d is subject to differing interpretations. Without any guidance within the four corners of the CSO, the district court properly concluded that the phrase was ambiguous. The court then articulated the appropriate standard for determining the meaning of an ambiguous phrase. Huber argues that the district court should have applied a more rigorous \u201creasonable businessman\u201d standard articulated in <em>Hollenbeck. </em>However, as discussed above, <em>Hollenbeck </em>is not applicable to forfeiture clauses in top hat plans. Therefore, the district court did not err in applying the reasonable person standard to determine the meaning of the phrase \u201cunsatisfactory performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">Additionally, there was substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Huber was terminated for unsatisfactory performance. The August 3, 2011, letter from Leniger-Sherratt to Jeff Huber documented several performance-related issues that justified Huber\u2019s termination. The letter provided that Huber was terminated based on (1) his inability to promote an open and transparent organization regarding accurate reporting and factual information sharing with the Board; (2) his instructing Coleman to falsify the backorder report in 2010; and (3) his treatment of LFUSA staff which put LFUSA at risk of losing a large number of key personnel. At trial, Coleman and Leniger-Sherratt testified that Huber ordered Coleman to falsify the back order report in 2010, that he micromanaged, and that he was demeaning toward staff. Additionally, the district court heard testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>several key employees threatened to quit if Huber returned to work in 2011. The district court found this testimony to be credible. Based on the foregoing evidence, the district court found that Huber did berate, belittle, and harass employees, and that his demeanor and management style were unprofessional and directly interfered with the business operations of LFUSA. Additionally, the district court found that Huber\u2019s management as vice president was unprofessional given the significant backorders in 2010, his failure to address the issue, and his directing staff to present false information to the LFA board.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">Huber argues that the above complaints did not actually result in Huber\u2019s termination because these actions took place in 2010 and 2011 and Huber\u2019s termination was not effective until August 2012. However, based on the above evidence, the district court found that the timing of Huber\u2019s termination was dictated by the other employees\u2019 threats that they would quit if Huber returned from his two-month vacation in 2011, but the actual reasons for his termination were an accumulation of factors summarized in the August 3, 2011 letter. \u201cA trial court\u2019s findings of fact in a court tried case will be liberally construed on appeal in favor of the judgment entered, in view of the trial court\u2019s role as trier of fact.\u201d <em>Benninger v. Derifield, </em>142 Idaho 486, 489, 129 P.3d 1235, 1238 (2006). Here, there was substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that a reasonable person would find that Huber\u2019s management style, demeanor, unprofessional treatment of LFUSA employees, and actions as vice-president collectively amounted to unsatisfactory performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Lastly, Huber contends that the district court erred in holding that the entire benefit was forfeited. Huber argues that, under federal common law, an employer is only entitled to withhold top hat plan benefits that accrued during the period of the employee\u2019s disloyalty. <em>Id. </em>In support of this position Huber relies on <em>Tyco, </em>756 F.Supp.2d 553, and <em>Aramony v. United Way Replacement Benefit Plan, </em>28 F.Supp.2d 147 (S.D.N.Y.1998) <em>rev\u2019d in part, </em>191 F.3d 140 (2d Cir.1999). <em>Id. </em>Huber\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced. In <em>Tyco, </em>the District Court of Southern District of New York held that benefits in a top hat plan \u201care assumed to be forfeitable unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the contract.\u201d 756 F.Supp.2d at 565. The court found that even where a top hat plan lacked an express forfeiture clause, the beneficiary could still forfeit the benefit for wrongdoing, but only for those benefits accrued during the employee\u2019s disloyalty. <em>Id. </em>Tyco\u2019s holding is limited to implied forfeiture clauses, and has no application here, where the CSO contained an express forfeiture provision. <em>Aramony </em>does not even address the issue of whether benefits accrued before the period of misconduct can be forfeited, but merely holds that an employee can breach the implied duty of good faith by engaging in acts of disloyalty. 28 F.Supp.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Here, the CSO expressly provided that if Huber was terminated for unsatisfactory performance \u201call goodwill is lost.\u201d Huber\u2019s argument that he should receive all of the goodwill earned before the period of his misconduct is in essence saying that his right to the goodwill \u201cvested\u201d before the misconduct began. Top hat plans are expressly exempt from the vesting provisions of ERISA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051(2). \u201cFederal common law must further the purposes of the statute under which it is used; it may not be used to re-write the federal statute.\u201d <em>Bigda, </em>898 F.Supp. at 1016. For the same reason that federal common law cannot provide non-forfeiture protection for top hat plans, it cannot be used to grant vesting protection to avoid forfeiture. <em>See United States v. Graham, </em>No. CIV.A. 03-80504, 2007 WL 1806174, at <em>*2 </em>(E.D.Mich. June 21, 2007) (holding that the argument that a forfeiture clause in a top hat plan is not enforceable because the benefits vested runs contrary to the law). Under the terms of the CSO, Huber forfeited all of the goodwill benefit by being terminated for unsatisfactory performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Huber forfeited the goodwill benefit under the CSO because he was terminated for unsatisfactory performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>5. The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Huber\u2019s equity claim or denying Huber\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to conform to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">During closing arguments at trial, Huber argued that the court should grant him an equitable share of the goodwill even if he was not entitled to the 30% provided for in the CSO. The court denied relief, stating that Huber had not pled equitable relief and, even if he had, Huber had received adequate compensation for his past service. Huber later moved to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence and to incorporate the claim for equitable relief, which the district court also denied. Huber argues that he did plead equitable relief and that the district court erred in refusing to hear his claim or, alternatively, that the district court abused its discretion in not allowing him to amend his complaint to include the equity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The district court acted within its discretion in denying Huber\u2019s claim for equitable relief. Huber did not expressly plead equitable relief under the CSO in either his complaint or amended complaint. Huber seems to contend that he pled equitable relief because both his complaint and amended complaint included a request for \u201csuch other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.\u201d Such boilerplate language is not sufficient to put LFUSA on notice that Huber would seek an equitable portion of the goodwill benefit at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Nor did the district court err in denying Huber\u2019s motion to amend his complaint. The district court found that the plaintiff had not pled equitable relief in his complaint and that the parties never agreed to try the issue. Additionally, the district court found that Huber\u2019s claim for equitable relief was unsupported by evidence because no evidence was presented at trial to indicate what the value of the equitable share would be. Because the amendment was not supported by the evidence presented at trial, the district court did not err in denying the amendment. <em>See Valentine v. Rosenhaupt, </em>19 Idaho 130, 130, 112 P. 685, 686 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">We affirm the district court\u2019s orders denying Huber\u2019s claim for equitable relief and denying Huber\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to conform to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">6. The district court abused its discretion in awarding LFUSA costs under I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1) and attorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">After trial, both parties moved for an award of attorney fees under ERISA and Idaho Code section 12-120(3), and for an award of costs under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1). The district court held that LFUSA was the prevailing party under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1)(B) and awarded LFUSA $264,000 in attorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-120(3). The district court reasoned that Huber prevailed on his claim under the NDA, but LFUSA prevailed on the much larger and more litigated issues regarding the top hat status of the CSO and whether Huber was terminated for unsatisfactory performance. Although the district court awarded LFUSA attorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-120(3), it also held that neither party should be awarded attorney fees under ERISA. The district court reasoned that to award attorney fees to LFUSA would be contrary to one of the purposes of ERISA \u2014 to not discourage employees from filing claims against their employers. Additionally, the district court awarded LFUSA $15,584.51 in costs as a matter of right and $4,880.25 in discretionary costs under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 51(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">On appeal, Huber contends that the district court abused its discretion in finding that LFUSA, not Huber, was the prevailing party under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1)(B) and in awarding LFUSA fees and costs under Idaho Code section 12-120(3) and Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1). The thrust of Huber\u2019s argument is that the district court erred in considering the ERISA claims when awarding fees and costs under state law, because ERISA has its own attorney fee provision and preempts state law on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Idaho Code section 12-120(3) provides that \u201c[i]n any civil action to recover on a[ ] ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>contract relating to the purchase or sale of goods, wares, merchandise, or services and in any commercial transaction ... the prevailing party shall be allowed a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be set by the court.\u201d The same \u201cprevailing party\u201d standard applies to awards of attorney fees under Idaho Code 12-120(3) and an award of costs under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1). <em>Oakes v. Boise Heart Clinic Physicians, PLLC, </em>152 Idaho 540, 545, 272 P.3d 512, 517 (2012).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-4\">In determining which party to an action is a prevailing party and entitled to costs, the trial court shall in its sound discretion consider the final judgment or result of the action in relation to the relief sought by the respective parties. The trial court in its sound discretion may determine that a party to an action prevailed in part and did not prevail in part, and upon so finding may apportion the costs between and among the parties in a fair and equitable manner after considering all of the issues and claims involved in the action and the resultant judgment or judgments obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Generally, the prevailing party question is examined and determined from an overall view, not on a claim-by-claim basis. <em>Shore v. Peterson, </em>146 Idaho 903, 914, 204 P.3d 1114, 1125 (2009). \u201cThis Court has held that when both parties are partially successful, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to decline an award of attorney\u2019s fees to either side.\u201d <em>Oakes, </em>152 Idaho at 545, 272 P.3d at 517. Usually the district court has discretion to consider all of the claims together when determining whether either party prevailed under Rule 54(d)(1)(B). However, federal preemption imposes some limitations when an ERISA claim is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The Ninth Circuit has held that \u201cERISA preempts an award of attorney\u2019s fees for work done in an ERISA action when those fees are determined according to the standards of a state statute and the state standards differ from the standards that are applicable under ERISA.\u201d <em>S.F. Culinary, Bartenders &amp; Service Emp. Welfare Fund v. Lucin, </em>76 F.3d 295, 297 (9th Cir.1996). The Ninth Circuit considers five factors in determining whether to award attorney fees under ERISA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">(1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-11\">(2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of fees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-12\">(3) whether an award of fees against the opposing parties would deter others from acting under similar circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-13\">(4) whether the parties requesting fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-14\">,(5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-15\"><em>Id, </em>(citing <em>Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 453 (9th Cir.1980)). These factors \u201cvery frequently suggest that attorney\u2019s fees should not be charged against ERISA plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">ERISA does not forbid an award of attorney fees for an ERISA claim under a state statute in all circumstances. The issue arises where the district court awards attorney fees under the state statute and the fees would otherwise be unavailable under ERISA. As found by the court in <em>Lucin:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-17\">the district court\u2019s decision to apply a state statute and grant the defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees for work done in the underlying ERISA action notwithstanding the fact that both the district judge and this court had previously determined that the defendants were not entitled to recover such fees under ERISA cannot stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">Here, the district court found that LFUSA was the prevailing party under Rule 54(d)(1)(B) because LFUSA prevailed on the most crucial issues of the trial: whether the CSO was a top hat plan and whether Huber forfeited the goodwill by being terminated for unsatisfactory performance. These issues were encompassed in Huber\u2019s claim that LFUSA violated ERISA by denying him the goodwill benefit under the CSO. LFUSA argues that the district court did not err in considering the ERISA claims because the standard set forth in Idaho Code section 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>120(3) is not in conflict with the standard under ERISA. However, the district court expressly found that LFUSA would not be entitled to attorney fees under ERISA because awarding fees would run contrary ERISA\u2019s purpose not to discourage employees from filing claims against their employers. Similar to the situation in <em>Lucin, </em>the district court could not, within its discretion, consider the ERISA claim or award attorney fees for the ERISA claim under Idaho Code section 12-120(3) after it determined that attorney fees would not be available to LFU-SA under ERISA. \u201cIf a litigant were permitted to resort to a state statutory procedure to reach around ERISA\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees provisions for fees on an ERISA claim, the purposes of the ERISA provision would be severely undermined.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Alternatively, LFUSA argues that this court should uphold the district court\u2019s award by reconsidering whether LFUSA is eligible for fees under ERISA. \u201cIt is well established that this Court will use the correct legal theory to affirm the correct decision of a district court even when it is based on an erroneous legal theory.\u201d <em>J.R. Sim/plot Co. v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>120 Idaho 849, 853, 820 P.2d 1206, 1210 (1991). LFUSA contends that an award of attorney fees to LFUSA would be appropriate under ERISA because attorney fees have been awarded against ERISA plaintiffs who held executive positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">In an action brought under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132, a court \u201cin its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d 29 U.S.C \u00a7 1132(g)(1). As laid out above, the Ninth Circuit considers several factors in determining whether to award attorney fees in a specific case, including: the merits of the parties\u2019 positions, whether the parties acted in bad faith, and the possible deterrent effect of awarding fees. <em>Lucin, </em>76 F.3d at 297. Most often, \u201cthese factors weigh against awarding fees against an ERISA plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The cases cited by LFUSA strengthen that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">In two of the cases cited by LFUSA, the court awarded attorney fees against plaintiffs who were found to act in bad faith. <em>Feinstein v. Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp., </em>No. CIV.A. 10-4050, 2012 WL 4364641, at *4 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 25, 2012); <em>Epstein v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>No. CV 04-0400 SVW, 2004 WL 2418310, at *3 (C.D.Cal. Oct. 13, 2004). In the final case cited by LFUSA, the Ninth Circuit upheld an award of fees against an ERISA plaintiff where the plaintiff did not act in bad faith, but the claim was found to have no merit and the district court had limited the award to ten percent of the requested fees. <em>Estate of Shockley v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., </em>130 F.3d 403, 408 (9th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). As discussed in Judge Noonan\u2019s dissent, this award was unusual, as no other case had awarded fees against an ERISA plaintiff who had not engaged in culpable conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 409 (Noonan, J. dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">In the present case, there has been no allegation that Huber brought the ERISA claim in bad faith. Additionally, although Huber did not prevail in his ERISA claim, it was not without merit. The law concerning whether a plan is unfunded under ERISA is not well settled and whether Huber forfeited the benefit for being terminated for unsatisfactory performance was a close question of fact. Under these circumstances, an award of fees against an ERISA plaintiff could deter future ERISA plaintiffs from pursuing meritorious claims. Therefore, as found by the district court, LFUSA is not entitled to fees under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Where attorney\u2019s fees would not be available under ERISA, the district court abused its discretion by considering the ERISA claim in determining whether Huber or LFUSA was the prevailing party under Idaho Code section 12-120(3) and Rule 54(d)(1). Additionally, the district court abused its discretion by including attorney fees and costs incurred in litigating the ERISA claim in its award of fees and costs under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">We vacate the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees and costs to LFUSA, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">7. Attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">Both Huber and LFUSA requested attorney fees on appeal. LFUSA requests attorney fees under Idaho Appellate Rules 40 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>41, Idaho Code sections 12-121 and 12-120(3), and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g). Huber requests attorney fees under Idaho Code sections 12-120(3) and 45-615, and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Courts have construed 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1) to allow attorney fees on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Operating Eng\u2019rs Pension Trusts v. B &amp; E Backhoe, Inc., </em>911 F.2d 1347, 1356 (9th Cir.1990). To be eligible for an award of fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1), a party does not have to be a prevailing party but must have achieved some degree of success on the merits. <em>Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>560 U.S. 242, 254, 130 S.Ct. 2149, 2157-58, 176 L.Ed.2d 998, 1008-09 (2010). On appeal, Huber did not succeed on any issues related to his ERISA claim, and, therefore, he is not eligible for an award of fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Although LFUSA did successfully defend the ERISA claim on appeal, the factors set forth in <em>Lucin </em>weigh against an award of fees in this case. Huber\u2019s appeal of the ERISA claim was not frivolous or brought in bad faith, as the issues brought before this Court were complex and not well settled. Allowing an award of fees against an ERISA plaintiff in this case may chill future ERISA plaintiffs from appealing adverse rulings in close cases. On appeal, LFUSA only prevailed on issues related to the ERISA claim. Because LFUSA is not entitled to fees under ERISA, LFUSA cannot be granted fees under section 12-120(3). <em>See Lucin, </em>76 F.3d at 298. Additionally, we decline to award LFUSA fees under Idaho Code section 12-121 or Idaho Appellate Rules 40 and 41 as both parties prevailed in part on appeal. \u201cWhere both parties prevail in part on appeal, this Court may deny fees.\u201d <em>Caldwell v. Cometto, </em>151 Idaho 34, 41, 253 P.3d 708, 715 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Idaho Code section 45-615(2) provides that \u201c[a]ny judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction for the plaintiff in a suit filed pursuant to this section may include all costs and attorney\u2019s fees reasonably incurred in connection with the proceedings.\u201d On appeal, Huber prevailed on his claim that the amount owed under the NDA was wages under IWCA.
