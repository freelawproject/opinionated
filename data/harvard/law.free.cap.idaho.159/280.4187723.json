Dunlap raised several substantive claims for post-conviction relief. For each substantive claim, he advanced a corresponding claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. We affirm the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of Dunlap\u2019s successive petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-23\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b327-24\">This is the sixth appeal considered by this Court following Dunlap\u2019s plea of guilty to first-degree murder. This Court repeated the factual and procedural background of this case most recently in <em>State v. Dunlap, </em>155 Idaho 345, 357-58, 313 P.3d 1, 13-14 (2013) <em>{Dunlap V), </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-25\">On October 16, 1991, Dunlap entered and robbed the Security State Bank in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Soda Springs, Idaho. Dunlap entered the bank, stood within a few feet of bank teller Tonya Crane, and ordered her to give him all of her money. Without hesitation, Tonya Crane did so. Dunlap immediately and calmly pulled the trigger of his sawed-off shotgun, which was less than two feet from Tonya Crane\u2019s chest, literally blowing her out of her shoes. Police officers responded immediately. When the officers arrived at the bank, Tonya Crane had no pulse. When taken to the hospital she was pronounced dead on arrival.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">Dunlap fled the scene, but subsequently surrendered to police. After being given his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Dunlap confessed to the murder and to a murder that occurred ten days before in Ohio. The following day, Dunlap again confessed and explained how he planned and completed both murders. Dunlap was charged with first-degree murder and robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">Within days of his arrest, Dunlap arranged to be interviewed by Marilyn Young, Associate Editor of the Albany New Tribune in Indiana. During the interviews Dunlap explained to Young how he murdered his girlfriend in Ohio with a crossbow and then traveled west where he subsequently planned to rob the Soda Springs\u2019 bank. Dunlap described the bank robbery and Tonya Crane\u2019s murder to the editor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">In Idaho on December 30, 1991, Dunlap pled guilty to first-degree murder for shooting Tonya Crane during the course of a robbery. \u201cIn the agreement, the State dropped the robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery charges, and Dunlap pled guilty to first degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a murder.\u201d <em>State v. Dunlap, </em>125 Idaho 530, 531, 873 P.2d 784, 785 (1993) <em>(Dunlap I). </em>The plea agreement allowed the State to seek the death penalty. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">During the plea colloquy the court questioned Dunlap and his attorneys about Dunlap\u2019s mental history and whether it would have any impact on his ability to plead guilty. [The district court then reviewed medical records Dunlap provided related to his mental health.] ... The district court judge continued with the hearing, but informed the parties he would make his decision about accepting the plea after he had a chance to review the documents. After reviewing the records, the court accepted Dunlap\u2019s plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">After the aggravation-mitigation hearing the district court imposed the death penalty. Dunlap appealed his conviction and sentence, but this Court affirmed both. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">On May 12,1994, Dunlap filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The district court dismissed the petition because it was not filed within forty-two days of entry of judgment. This Court reversed the district court\u2019s decision and remanded Dunlap\u2019s case for further proceedings. <em>Dunlap v. State, </em>131 Idaho 576, 961 P.2d 1179 (1998) <em>(Dunlap </em>II).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">Prior to the commencement of the evidentiary hearing, the State conceded that error occurred during Dunlap\u2019s sentencing proceeding and he would have to be resentenced. On January 11, 2002, based on the State\u2019s concession, the district court ordered a new sentencing hearing be held, but denied Dunlap\u2019s guilt-phase post-conviction relief. Dunlap timely appealed from the denial of the post-conviction application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Dunlap v. State, </em>141 Idaho 50, 55-56, 106 P.3d 376, 381-82 (2004) <em>(Dunlap III)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">In <em>Dunlap III, </em>\u201cthis Court upheld the district court\u2019s denial of Dunlap\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief and the validity of his guilty plea.\u201d <em>Dunlap V, </em>155 Idaho at 358, 313 P.3d at 14. However, we \u201calso recognized that in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), the Supreme Court held that death sentences must be imposed by a jury, not a judge, and remanded the case for resentencing by a jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">The resentencing proceedings began with jury selection on February 6, 2006. Each potential juror completed a twenty-seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>page questionnaire prior to voir dire. The district court and counsel then conducted general voir dire before proceeding to individual voir dire. Individual voir dire was limited by the district court to five minutes per side for each juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The sentencing hearing was conducted between February 13 and February 22, 2006. The jury found that the State had proven three aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that by the murder, or the circumstances surrounding its commission, Dunlap exhibited utter disregard for human life (utter disregard aggravator); (2) the murder was committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, or mayhem and Dunlap had the specific intent to cause the death of a human being (specific intent aggravator); and (3) by prior conduct or conduct in the commission of the murder at hand, Dunlap exhibited a propensity to commit murder that will constitute a continuing threat to society (propensity aggravator). With respect to each individual aggravating circumstance, the jury concluded that all mitigating circumstances, when weighed against the specific individual aggravating circumstance, were not sufficiently compelling to make imposition of the death penalty unjust. On February 22, 2006, in accordance with the verdict, the district court entered a judgment sentencing Dunlap to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Following entry of the judgment, the State Appellate Public Defender\u2019s Office (SAPD) became Dunlap\u2019s counsel of record. On May 27, 2008, Dunlap filed a petition for post-conviction relief challenging his resentencing proceedings (the 2008 Petition). The State moved for summary dismissal of the 2008 Petition, which the district court granted on November 24, 2009. In a consolidated appeal, Dunlap challenged his sentence and the summary dismissal of his 2008 Petition (Consolidated Resentencing Appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">While the Consolidated Resentencing Appeal was pending, on April 7, 2011, Dunlap\u2019s new attorneys with the Capital Habeas Unit of the Federal Defender Services of Idaho filed an additional petition for post-conviction relief. In this petition, Dunlap presented several substantive claims which he had not advanced in the 2008 Petition. Dunlap further claimed ineffective assistance of appellate counsel due to the failure to present the substantive claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">On May 21, 2012, the State moved for summary dismissal of Dunlap\u2019s latest petition for post-conviction relief. On January 25, 2013, Dunlap moved for leave to amend his petition. The district court granted Dunlap\u2019s motion and Dunlap filed his Amended Petition for Post^Conviction Relief on February 15, 2013 (the 2011 Petition or Successive Petition). The parties submitted supplemental briefing in support of and in opposition to the State\u2019s motion for summary dismissal and the district court allowed post-argument briefing on the issues raised in the Successive Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The district court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary dismissal and dismissed each of Dunlap\u2019s claims for post-conviction relief. The district court concluded that Dunlap\u2019s substantive claims were not timely under Idaho Code section 19-2719, as they could have been raised in his 2008 Petition. The district court concluded that Dunlap\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel regarding his 2008 Petition should be dismissed because Dunlap failed to show SAPD\u2019s performance was deficient and that Dunlap had failed to show that he was prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s performance. The district court entered its final judgment dismissing Dunlap\u2019s Successive Petition on June 24, 2013. Dunlap timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">On August 27, 2013, this Court issued its decision in the Consolidated Resentencing Appeal. <em>Dunlap V, </em>155 Idaho 345, 313 P.3d 1. We affirmed the judgment sentencing Dunlap to death. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 313 P.3d at 48. We also affirmed in part and vacated in part the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of Dunlap\u2019s 2008 Petition. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the district court erred in summarily dismissing Dunlap\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel \u201cregarding the investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence\u201d and his claim of constitutional violations related to the State\u2019s alleged knowledge and failure to disclose exculpatory evidence related to Dunlap\u2019s mental health. <em>Id. </em>at 388-90, 313 P.3d at 44-46. This Court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>manded for an evidentiary hearing on those two issues. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 313 P.3d at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Dunlap\u2019s Successive Petition sought to have the district court consider substantive claims for post-conviction relief and for each substantive claim, a corresponding claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. This opinion comprises two parts. First, we address the timeliness of the substantive claims for post-conviction relief. Because we conclude Dunlap\u2019s substantive claims were not pursued in a timely manner, we will address the merits of these claims in the second part of this opinion, where we consider the corresponding claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">A. DUNLAP\u2019S SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u201cWhether a successive petition for post-conviction relief was properly dismissed pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-2719 is a question of law. This Court reviews questions of law de novo.\u201d <em>Fields v. State, </em>154 Idaho 347, 349, 298 P.3d 241, 243 (2013) <em>(Fields </em>V) (quoting <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>134 Idaho 793, 795, 10 P.3d 742, 744 (2000) <em>(Pizzuto III)). </em>When reviewing a dismissal based on Idaho Code section 19-2719, \u201cthe proper standard of review this Court should utilize is to directly address the motion, determine whether or not the requirements of section 19-2719 have been met, and rule accordingly.\u201d <em>Stuart v. State, </em>149 Idaho 35, 40, 232 P.3d 813, 818 (2010) (quoting <em>Hairston v. State, </em>144 Idaho 51, 55, 156 P.3d 552, 556 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">2. Dunlap\u2019s substantive claims are barred by Idaho Code section 19-2719.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Dunlap asserted seventeen substantive claims in his Successive Petition. The district court granted the State\u2019s Motion for Summary Dismissal for each substantive claim as untimely based on Idaho Code section 19-2719. The district court concluded that Dunlap\u2019s failure to raise these substantive claims in his 2008 Petition was not excused because the issues were known or reasonably could have been known at that time and, even if the substantive issues were not known at the time of his 2008 Petition, they were not raised within a reasonable time after they became known.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">On appeal, Dunlap contends that four of his substantive claims were erroneously dismissed. He argues: (1) Jury Instruction (J.I.) 11 was vague and ambiguous and therefore, unconstitutional; (2) J.I. 14 improperly instructed the jury and violated the ex post facto and due process clauses of the Idaho and U.S. Constitutions; (3) Preliminary Instruction P-3 was unconstitutional; and (4) trial counsel\u2019s inadequate voir dire amounted to ineffective assistance of trial counsel and resulted in a violation of Dunlap\u2019s right to an impartial jury. Dunlap asserts that he was unable to raise these claims because this Court limited SAPD\u2019s opening briefing in Dunlap\u2019s Consolidated Resentencing Appeal to 100 pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">\u201cPost-conviction proceedings are generally controlled by the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act (UPCPA),\u201d at Idaho Code sections 19-4901 to 4911. <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>149 Idaho 155, 160, 233 P.3d 86, 91 (2010) <em>(Pizzuto V). </em>However, \u201cIdaho Code Section 19-2719 provides a series of procedural requirements for post-conviction petitions in capital cases\u201d and \u201c[t]hese provisions supersede the UPCPA to the extent that any conflict exists.\u201d <em>Stuart, </em>149 Idaho at 41, 232 P.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">The purpose of Idaho Code section \u201c19-2719 is to eliminate unnecessary delay in carrying out a valid death sentence,\u201d <em>Rhoades v. State, </em>135 Idaho 299, 301, 17 P.3d 243, 245 (2000), by giving the claimant for post-conviction relief \u201cone opportunity to raise all challenges to the conviction and sentence.\u201d <em>Dunlap III, </em>141 Idaho 50, 57, 106 P.3d 376, 383 (2004). Under Idaho Code section 19-2719(3), \u201cwithin forty-two days after the judgment imposing the punishment of death, \u2018the defendant must file any legal or factual challenge to the sentence or conviction that is known or reasonably should be known.\u2019\u201d <em>Fields v. State, </em>151 Idaho 18, 23, 253 P.3d 692, 697 (2011) <em>(Fields IV) </em>(quoting Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2719(5)). Idaho Code section 19-2719 provides that if a defendant fails to timely apply for post-conviction relief, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>defendant has \u201cwaived such claims for relief as were known, or reasonably should have been known\u201d and \u201c[t]he courts of Idaho shall have no power to consider any such claims for relief as have been so waived____\u201d I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 19-2719(3), (5); see <em>Pizzuto III, </em>134 Idaho at 795, 10 P.3d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">There is one exception: \u201ca successive post-conviction petition may be heard ... for issues that were not known or could not reasonably have been known\u201d within forty-two days of the judgment. I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(a). However, even in such cases, this Court requires the claims to be asserted within a reasonable time after they are known or reasonably could have been known. <em>Stuart, </em>149 Idaho at 41, 232 P.3d at 819. In <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>146 Idaho 720, 727, 202 P.3d 642, 649 (2008) <em>(Pizzuto IV), </em>this Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">[A] reasonable time for filing a successive petition for post-conviction relief is forty-two days after the petitioner knew or reasonably should have known of the claim, unless the petitioner shows that there were extraordinary circumstances that prevented him or her from filing the claim within that time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u201cIdaho Code \u00a7 19-2719 places a heightened burden on petitioners to make a prima facie showing that the issues raised after the forty-two day time period were not known or could not reasonably have been known.\u201d <em>Pizzuto V, </em>149 Idaho at 160, 233 P.3d at 91. Idaho Code section 19-2719 dictates that a successive post-conviction petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">shall not be considered unless the applicant shows the existence of such issues by (i) a precise statement of the issue or issues asserted together with (ii) material facts stated under oath or affirmation by credible persons with first hand knowledge that would support the issue or issues asserted. A pleading that fails to make a showing of excepted issues supported by material facts, or which is not credible, must be summarily dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">I.C. \u00a7 19 \u2014 2719(5)(a); <em>see also </em>I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(11) (any successive post-conviction petition that does not comply with Idaho Code section 19-2719(5) \u201cshall be dismissed summarily\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">Here, the judgment imposing the death sentence was filed on February 22, 2006. Dunlap\u2019s initial version of the Successive Petition was filed on April 7, 2011. Thus, Dunlap was required to meet the heightened burden imposed by Idaho Code section 19-2719. Because Dunlap made no argument or showing that his claims of error regarding the jury instructions and voir dire were not known or could not have been known within forty-two days of the 2006 judgment, Dunlap is deemed to have waived each substantive claim for relief by operation of Idaho Code section 19-2719(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">Dunlap asserts that that he should be excused from failing to raise these claims within the time limits of Idaho Code section 19-2719 due to the page limit imposed by this Court in Dunlap\u2019s Consolidated Resentencing Appeal. Dunlap argues the page limit violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment because it impeded his ability to present all of his claims to this Court and consequently limited his ability to seek federal habeas corpus relief on the omitted claims. This Court\u2019s order imposing the page limit was entered on March 22, 2011. Dunlap did not raise the page limit issue in his Successive Petition. Instead, the issue was presented only as a response to the State\u2019s motion for summary dismissal. As Dunlap did not properly raise this due process claim in a timely fashion, we will not consider this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">\u201cAny remedy available by post-conviction procedure, habeas corpus or any other provision of state law must be pursued according to the procedures set forth in\u201d Idaho Code section 19-2719 and within the time limitations of Idaho Code section 19-2719(3). I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(4). Indeed, the courts of Idaho have no power to consider claims for relief \u201c[i]f the defendant fails to apply for relief as provided\u201d in Idaho Code section 19-2719. I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5). Thus, all claims for relief must be made by way of a petition for post-conviction relief. As this Court explained in <em>McKinney, </em>when the defendant fails to raise an issue in the petition or in an amended petition, that issue is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>raised before the district court and this Court will not consider the issue on appeal. <em>McKinney v. State, </em>133 Idaho 695, 708, 992 P.2d 144, 157 (1999); <em>see also Cowger v. State, </em>132 Idaho 681, 686-87, 978 P.2d 241, 246-47 (Ct.App.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">This Court has consistently maintained that \u201cthe petitioner must raise the newly discovered issues \u2018within a reasonable time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fields v. State, </em>155 Idaho 532, 535, 314 P.3d 587, 590 (2013) <em>(Fields </em>VI) (quoting <em>Fields V, </em>154 Idaho 347, 350, 298 P.3d 241, 244 (2013)); <em>see Stuart, </em>149 Idaho at 41, 232 P.3d at 819. Again, a reasonable time is forty-two days \u201cafter the petitioner knew or reasonably should have known of the claim, unless the petitioner shows that there were extraordinary circumstances that prevent him or her from filing\u201d within that time. <em>Pizzuto V, </em>146 Idaho at 727, 202 P.3d at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In the Consolidated Resentencing Appeal, Dunlap sought permission to file an over-length brief of 221 pages. On March 22, 2011, this Court granted Dunlap leave to file a 100 page brief. Dunlap renewed his motion and this Court permitted him to file a brief 114 pages long.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Dunlap filed the initial version of his Successive Petition on April 7, 2011, well after he had notice of his claim based upon the page limit. Dunlap did not raise this issue until November 30, 2012, when he filed his response to the State\u2019s motion for summary dismissal. Even though the State contended that the claim was improper because it was not raised in his petition for post-conviction relief, the Successive Petition filed on February 15, 2013, did not advance a claim based upon the page limit. Thus, at no point did Dunlap present a precise statement of the issue together with material facts in a petition for post-conviction relief as required by Idaho Code section 19-2719, and as such, it cannot be considered. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Further, Dunlap did not raise this issue within a reasonable time. Dunlap knew of the facts supporting this claim in March of 2011 and took no action until November of 2012. Dunlap has not identified any extraordinary circumstance which prevented him from filing this claim within a reasonable time. Because the requirements of Idaho Code section 19-2719 have not been met, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed all of Dunlap\u2019s substantive claims. As a result, we will only address Dunlap\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">B. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF APPELLATE COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">Dunlap challenges the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of his four claims for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Three claims involve jury instructions and one claim involves <em>voir dire, </em>which contains several sub-issues. For each of these claims, Dunlap argues that the substantive claim is stronger than the claims presented by SAPD in the Consolidated Resentencing Appeal and that SAPD was ineffective for failing to raise these claims. We conclude that the district court properly granted summary dismissal for each claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel as explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">1. Standard of Review: Summary Dismissal of Application for Post-Conviction Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">\u201cProceedings for post-conviction relief are civil in nature, rather than criminal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>and the applicant must therefore prove the allegations in the request for relief by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Dunlap V, </em>155 Idaho 345, 361, 313 P.3d 1, 17 (2013) (citing <em>State v. Payne, </em>146 Idaho 548, 560, 199 P.3d 123, 135 (2008)). However, an application for post-conviction relief differs from an ordinary civil action complaint because it must contain more than a short and plain statement of the claim that would be sufficient for a complaint under I.R.C.P. 8(a)(1). <em>State v. Yakovac, </em>145 Idaho 437, 443-44, 180 P.3d 476, 482-83 (2008). An application for post-conviction relief \u201cmust present or be accompanied by admissible evidence supporting its allegations, or the application is subject to dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 180 P.3d at 483 (citing I.C. \u00a7 19-4903). In addition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4906 authorizes summary dismissal of an application for post-conviction relief, either pursuant to motion of a party or upon the trial court\u2019s own initiative. Summary dismissal of an application is the procedural equivalent of summary judgment under I.R.C.P. 56.

When reviewing appellate counsel\u2019s performance, we determine whether, but for appellate counsel\u2019s errors, a reasonable probability exists that the defendant would have prevailed on appeal. <em>Robbins, </em>528 U.S. at 285, 120 S.Ct. at 764, 145 L.Ed.2d at 779-780; <em>Hurles, </em>752 F.3d at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">\u201c[A] court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699-700. Thus, \u201cthere is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The United States Supreme Court has stated: \u201cIf it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">To address the propriety of the district court\u2019s grant of summary dismissal, we look to each claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to discuss the merits of the omitted claim. This evaluation informs the determination whether appellate counsel\u2019s decision to omit the claim was objectively unreasonable and whether, but for appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the claim, there is a reasonable probability that the result of Dunlap\u2019s direct appeal in his 2008 Consolidated Resentencing Appeal would have been different. Because we conclude that Dunlap presented no genuine issue of material fact that, if resolved in his favor, entitles him to relief for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, we find the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of these claims to be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">4. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the claim that the propensity aggravator instruction was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">Dunlap argues that SAPD was ineffective because it failed to raise the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>claim on direct appeal: that J.I. 11, regarding the propensity aggravator was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. We consider the merits of this claim to evaluate whether, if it had been raised, there is a reasonable probability that it would have prevailed on appeal, the standard by which Dunlap\u2019s claim of prejudice is judged.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">At resentencing, the State alleged three aggravating circumstances. One of them was the propensity aggravator. J.I. 11 informed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">The phrase \u201cexhibited a propensity to commit murder which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society\u201d means conduct showing that the defendant is more likely than not to be a continuing threat to society. The state is required to prove the existence of this propensity beyond a reasonable doubt. Such finding cannot be based solely upon the fact that you found the defendant guilty of murder. In order for a person to have a propensity to commit murder, the person must be a willing, predisposed killer, a killer who tends toward destroying the life of another, one who kills with less than the normal amount of provocation. Propensity requires a proclivity, a susceptibility, and even an affinity toward committing the act of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Dunlap asserts that J.I. 11 failed to adequately narrow the class of murderers eligible for the death penalty and insufficiently channeled the jurors\u2019 sentencing discretion in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, along with the Fifth, Sixth, and Eight Amendments. Dunlap argues that the phrase \u201cless than the normal amount of provocation\u201d is ambiguous and that the phrase \u201cone who kills with less than the normal amount of provocation\u201d is likely understood to mean anyone who commits first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The State counters that, because this Court and the federal district court for the District of Idaho have previously approved the language of J.I. 11, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise this claim on appeal. Further, the State argues that even if the instruction was erroneous, the error would be harmless because the jury found two other statutory aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Rather than considering the claim of deficient performance by SAPD, we consider the prejudice prong under <em>Strickland. </em>To prove he was prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s failure to advance this claim on appeal, Dunlap must establish a reasonable probability that the claim would have succeeded on appeal. Because Dunlap did not object to this instruction below, had SAPD raised this issue on direct appeal, this Court could only have reviewed the argument for fundamental error. <em>State v. Adamcik, </em>152 Idaho 445, 472-73, 272 P.3d 417, 444-45 (2012). Thus, to prevail, Dunlap would have had to establish: \u201c(1) the alleged error violated an unwaived constitutional right; (2) the alleged error plainly exists and (3) the alleged error was not harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 272 P.3d at 445 (citing <em>State v.

Hardison, </em>2010 WL 1338126 * 21 (D.Idaho 2010) (explaining that the federal district court has affirmed, no less than four times, the constitutionality of Idaho\u2019s propensity aggravator with the limiting instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Although Dunlap argues that anyone convicted of first-degree murder necessarily kills with \u201cless than the normal amount of provocation,\u201d Dunlap ignores the fact that not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>every first-degree murder will satisfy the standard set forth in J.I. 11. The instruction provides that a finding of propensity to commit murder <em>\u201ccannot </em>be based solely upon the fact that you found the defendant guilty of murder,\u201d and that \u201c[p]ropensity <em>requires </em>a proclivity, a susceptibility, and even an affinity toward committing the act of murder.\u201d We continue to adhere to our previous decisions that the language found in J.I. 11 sufficiently directs and limits the jury\u2019s discretion by providing clear and objective standards and detailed guidance on what it means to exhibit a propensity to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Dunlap, he has failed to present an issue of material fact showing SAPD\u2019s omission of a challenge to the constitutionality of J.I. 11 prejudiced Dunlap. There is not a reasonable probability that had SAPD raised this issue on appeal the result would have been different because the argument is without merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court properly granted summary dismissal of Dunlap\u2019s claim that SAPD provided ineffective appellate counsel for omitting the claim that J.I. 11 was vague and ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">5. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the claim that the aggravating and mitigating circumstances instruction was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Next, Dunlap argues that SAPD provided ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to raise the claim on appeal that J.I. 14 and the verdict form violated the ex post facto and due process clauses of the United States Constitution. Dunlap argues that J.I. 14 and the verdict form improperly instructed the jury on the laws of sentencing by providing the language from the relevant statute as it existed at the time of Dunlap\u2019s resentencing and not as it existed at the time of his offense and guilty plea. To meet the <em>Strickland, </em>prejudice prong, Dunlap must show that but for SAPD\u2019s failure to raise the issue of J.I. 14, there is a reasonable probability that the result on appeal would have been different. Once again, we address the substantive merits of the claim in order to evaluate the prejudice prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">J.I. 14 instructed the jury on what it needed to decide in its deliberations and provided the language for the jury verdict form. J.I. 14 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-12\">In reaching your verdict, you must first decide whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the statutory aggravating circumstances exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-13\">If you unanimously find that the State has proven the existence of a statutory aggravating factor, then you must so indicate on the verdict form. You must also then consider whether any mitigating circumstances exist that make the imposition of the death penalty unjust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-14\"><em>If you find that all mitigating circumstances are sufficiently compelling to make the imposition of the death penalty unjust, </em>or you cannot unanimously agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>on that issue, then the defendant will be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">\n<em>If you, find that all mitigating circumstances do not make the imposition of the death penalty unjust, then the defendant will be sentenced to death.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">This instruction comes from the language of Idaho Code section 19-2515. As the language of the statute was amended over the years, it is helpful to recognize those changes before addressing Dunlap\u2019s claim. In 1991, at the time of Dunlap\u2019s offense and the entry of his guilty plea, Idaho Code section 19-2515(c) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">Where a person is convicted of an offense which may be punishable by death, a sentence of death shall not be imposed unless the court finds at least one (1) statutory aggravating circumstance. W^here the court finds a statutory aggravating circumstance the court shall sentence the defendant to death unless the court finds that <em>mitigating circumstances which may be presented outweigh the gravity of any aggravating circumstance found and make imposition of death unjust.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">I.C. \u00a7 19-2515(c) (Michie 1991). In 1995, Idaho Code section 19-2515(e) was amended, in pertinent part, to provide as follows: \u201cthe court shall sentence the defendant to death unless the court finds that mitigating circumstances which may be presented outweigh the gravity of any aggravating circumstance found and make imposition of <em>are sufficiently compelling that </em>the death <em>penalty would </em>be unjust.\u201d 1995 Idaho Sess. L. ch. 140, \u00a7 1, p. 595. In 1998, Idaho Code section 19-2515(c) was amended to include the requirement that the prosecutor file notice of intent to seek the death penalty as a condition precedent to a defendant\u2019s eligibility for capital punishment. 1998 Idaho Sess. L. eh. 96, sec. 3, p. 344. In 2003, the statute was amended to comply with the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), which required that a jury (unless waived) determine the existence of statutory aggravating circumstances. Following this amendment, Idaho Code section 19-2515(3) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">Where a person is convicted of an offense which may be punishable by death, a sentence of death shall not be imposed unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">(b) The jury, or the court if a jury is waived, finds beyond a reasonable doubt at least one (1) statutory aggravating circumstance. WTiere a statutory aggravating circumstance is found, the defendant shall be sentenced to death <em>unless mitigating circumstances which may be presented are found to be sufficiently compelling that the death penalty would be unjust.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">2003 Idaho Sess. L. eh. 19, \u00a7 4, p. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Dunlap\u2019s argument is predicated upon the differences between Idaho Code section 19-2515(c) in 1991, at the time of his guilty plea (the 1991 law), and Idaho Code section 19-2515(3)(b) in 2006, at the time of the resentencing proceedings (the 2006 law). Dunlap asserts that the 2006 law, which provided that \u201cthe defendant shall be sentenced to death unless mitigating circumstances ... are found to be sufficiently compelling that the death penalty would be unjust,\u201d imposed a lower burden of proof on the State than the 1991 law, which provided that the death penalty would be imposed unless the \u201cmitigating circumstances ... outweigh the gravity of any aggravating circumstance found and make imposition of death unjust.\u201d Dunlap argues that this violated the ex post facto and due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The district court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary dismissal of this claim, concluding that the 2006 law makes it easier for a jury to avoid imposing a death sentence. The district court further concluded that the amendments to Idaho Code section 19-2515 were procedural, and as such, did not place Dunlap in greater jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">Because Dunlap did not object to this instruction below, had SAPD raised this issue on direct appeal, this Court could only have reviewed the claim for fundamental error. <em>State v. Adamcik, </em>152 Idaho 445, 472-73, 272 P.3d 417, 444-45 (2012). \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s jury instructions de novo to determine \u2018whether, when considered as a whole, they fairly and adequately present the</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>issues and state the applicable law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dunlap V, </em>155 Idaho 345, 364, 313 P.3d 1, 20 (2013) (quoting <em>Adamcik, </em>152 Idaho at 472, 272 P.3d at 444).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u201cEx post facto laws are prohibited by article I, section 9, clause 3 of the United States Constitution and by article I, section 16 of the Idaho Constitution.\u201d <em>State v.

Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><em>Calder v.

Abdullah, </em>158 Idaho 386, 451, 348 P.3d 1, 66 (2015). As to the fourth category, \u201c[t]he last six words are crucial. The relevant question is whether the law affects the quantum of evidence required to <em>convict.... </em>\u201d <em>Carmell, </em>529 U.S. at 551, 120 S.Ct. at 1642, 146 L.Ed.2d at 605-606 (emphasis in original). Dunlap asserts that the third and fourth categories are relevant here, asserting use of the 2006 law lowered the State\u2019s burden with respect to finding and weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances and increased the punishment by making it easier to obtain a death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u201cThe inhibition against the passage of ex post fact laws does not extend to limit the legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure, which do not affect matters of substance.\u201d <em>State v.

Hoffman, </em>123 Idaho 638, 647, 851 P.2d 934, 943 (1993) (citing <em>Walton v.

Indeed, a State is allowed to specify how to prove mitigating circumstances. <em>Walton, </em>497 U.S. at 649-50, 110 S.Ct. at 3054-55, 111 L.Ed.2d at 525-526.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">This amendment was procedural. Under Idaho\u2019s capital sentencing law, as it stood in 1991 and in 2006, the State has the burden to prove the existence of any aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Hoffman, </em>123 Idaho at 647, 851 P.2d at 943. In both 1991 and 2006, the State was required to prove at least one aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt to render the defendant eligible for capital punishment. The change from \u201coutweigh the gravity\u201d to \u201csufficiently compelling,\u201d did nothing to lessen the amount or measure of proof which was necessary for a capital sentence to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Beyond the procedural nature of the amendment, the amendments did not disadvantage Dunlap. \u201cIt is axiomatic that for a law to be ex post facto it must be more onerous than the prior law.\u201d <em>Dobbert, </em>432 U.S. at 294, 97 S.Ct. at 2299, 53 L.Ed.2d at 356-357; <em>see State v. Johnson, </em>152 Idaho 41, 44, 266 P.3d 1146, 1149 (2011) (\u201cprohibition on ex post facto laws applies only to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them\u201d). Under the 1991 law, the sentencing authority needed to find that mitigating circumstances \u201coutweighfed] the gravity\u201d of an aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\u201cOutweigh\u201d means \u201cto exceed in weight, value, or importance.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1605 (2002). \u201cGravity\u201d means \u201csobriety or seriousness,\u201d or \u201cimportance, or significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 993. Thus, under the 1991 law, the death penalty was required unless the sentencing authority found that the mitigating circumstances exceeded the seriousness of the aggravating circumstance <em>and </em>that those mitigating circumstances would make imposition of the death penalty unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">The 2006 law eliminated the requirement that the sentencing authority find that the mitigating circumstances \u201coutweigh[ed] the gravity\u201d of any aggravating circumstance and provided that the death penalty will be avoided if the sentencing authority finds the mitigating circumstances \u201csufficiently compelling that the death penalty would be unjust.\u201d \u201cSufficiently\u201d means \u201cto a sufficient degree\u201d or a quantity \u201cto meet with the demands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2284-85. \u201cCompelling\u201d means \u201ctending to convince or convert by or as if by forcefulness of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463. Thus, under the 2006 law, the death penalty can be avoided in the event that the sentencing authority finds enough mitigating evidence to conclude that imposition of the death penalty would be unjust. Dunlap\u2019s claim that the changes between the 1991 and 2006 laws reduced the State\u2019s burden is without merit. Because we conclude there was no ex post facto violation, Dunlap was not prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s failure to raise this issue on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the district court properly granted summary dismissal of Dunlap\u2019s claim that SAPD provided ineffective appellate counsel for failing to raise the claim that J.I. 14 violated the ex post facto and due process clauses of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">6. The district court properly granted the State\u2019s motion for summary dismissal of Dunlap\u2019s claims that SAPD provided ineffective assistance of appellate counsel by failing to raise issues related to the impartiality of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Dunlap raises four ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims relating to the impartiality of the jury. Dunlap argues: (a) SAPD failed to raise the claim that Juror 263 was improperly excluded for cause; (b) SAPD failed to raise the claim that eleven jurors should have been excluded for cause based on their bias in favor of imposition of the death penalty; (c) SAPD failed to raise the claim that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire; and (d) SAPD failed to raise the claim that Preliminary Instruction P-3 was unconstitutional because it led to the seating of jurors who were substantially impaired in their ability to serve as impartial jurors. Because each of these issues relates to the xdght to trial by an impartial jury, we will discuss the governing legal principles before turning our consideration to the specific issues Dunlap has raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The Idaho Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.\u201d Idaho Const, art. 1 .\u00a7 7. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, mandates that the right to a jury trial includes the right to an <em>impartial </em>jury. <em>State v. Moses, </em>156 Idaho 855, 862, 332 P.3d 767, 774 (2014); <em>see Ross v.

Hairston, </em>133 Idaho 496, 506, 988 P.2d 1170, 1180 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">In <em>Uttecht, </em>the United States Supreme Court succinctly summarized the governing legal principles as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-16\">First, a criminal defendant has the right to an impartial jury drawn from a venire that has not been tilted in favor of capital punishment by selective prosecutorial challenges for cause. Second, the State has a strong interest in having jurors who are able to apply capital punishment within the framework state law prescribes. Third, to balance these interests, a juror who is substantially impaired in his or her ability to impose the death penalty under the state-law framework can be excused for cause; but if the juror is not substantially impaired, removal for cause is impermissible. Fourth, in determining whether the removal of a potential juror would vindicate the State\u2019s interest without violating the defendant\u2019s right, the trial court make's a judgment based in part on the demeanor of the juror, a judgment owed deference by reviewing courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">551 U.S. at 9, 127 S.Ct. at 2224, 167 L.Ed.2d at 1022 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-18\">a. Juror 263 was not improperly excluded for cause under <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-19\">Dunlap argues SAPD should have raised the following issue on appeal: that the district court improperly excluded prospective Juror 263 based on his<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> opposition to capital punishment. The district court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary dismissal concluding that exclusion of Juror 263 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>for cause was proper and thus, Dunlap failed to show that SAPD\u2019s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Dunlap argues that failure to raise this claim constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and that the district court erred in summarily dismissing this claim. Specifically, Dunlap alleges Juror 263 was improperly excluded in violation of the rule pronounced in <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 522, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 20 L.Ed.2d 776, 784-785 (1968). There, the Supreme Court held that \u201ca sentence of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d 391 U.S. at 522, 88 S.Ct. at 1777, 20 L.Ed.2d at 784-785. In <em>Witt, </em>the United States Supreme Court revisited the issue and explained that <em>Witherspoon </em>\u201cis not a ground for challenging\u201d a prospective juror, but is rather is a limitation on a State\u2019s power to exclude potential jurors. 469 U.S at 423, 105 S.Ct. at 851, 83 L.Ed.2d at 851 (quoting <em>Adams, </em>448 U.S. at 47-48, 100 S.Ct. at 2528, 65 L.Ed.2d at 590-592).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In <em>Witt, </em>a juror was excused for cause after the juror indicated that personal beliefs about the propriety of the death penalty would \u201cinterfere with judging the guilt or innocence of the Defendant.\u201d 469 U.S at 416, 105 S.Ct. at 848, 83 L.Ed.2d at 846-847. The defendant argued that the juror was improperly excluded for cause in violation of <em>Witherspoon. Id. </em>The Supreme Court disagreed, clarifying that a finding of bias does not require the juror to make it \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d that he would \u201cautomatically\u201d vote against the death penalty, but that exclusion is proper if the juror\u2019s views \u201cwould prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 105 S.Ct. at 852, 83 L.Ed.2d at 851-852 (quoting <em>Adams, </em>448 U.S. at 45, 100 S.Ct. at 2526, 65 L.Ed.2d at 589-590). Thus, the State \u201cmay properly challenge\u201d a prospective juror if he \u201crefuses to follow the statutory scheme and truthfully answer the questions put by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422, 105 S.Ct. at 850, 83 L.Ed.2d at 850-851. As the California Supreme Court explained, \u201c[a] juror whose personal opposition toward the death penalty may predispose him to assign greater than average weight to the mitigating factors presented at the penalty phase may not be excluded, unless that predilection would actually preclude him from engaging in the weighing process and returning a capital verdict.\u201d <em>California v. Martinez, </em>47 Cal.4th 399, 97 Cal.Rptr.3d 732, 213 P.3d 77, 98 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In his responses to the jury questionnaire, Juror 263 indicated that he disagreed with the proposition that \u201cmurder is murder and that understanding motives and circumstances is not important;\u201d disagreed with the statement that \u201cI do not believe criminals can be rehabilitated;\u201d agreed that he was uncomfortable with having to decide about executing someone; and disagreed with the notion that life without the possibility of parole is not a harsh enough penalty for murder. Juror 263 disagreed with the proposition that \u201conly the worst murderers should be executed;\u201d agreed that he could vote for the death penalty in some cases if on the jury; and had no opinion as to whether it would be hard for him to vote to kill someone. When asked how he felt about the death penalty he indicated: \u201cWhen they are guilty of taking a life then they should be able to give a life.\u201d He said he supported the death penalty, and indicated that the following statement most accurately represented the way he felt about the death penalty: \u201cI generally favor the death penalty, but I would base a decision to impose it on the facts and the law in the case.\u201d Juror 263 indicated that he did not feel that his views on the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair his ability to view the facts impartially or that his views on the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair his ability to impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">During individual voir dire the following exchanges took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Q [Counsel for Dunlap]: When you were asked about how you feel about the death penalty, you indicated, \u201cWhen they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>are guilty of taking a life, then they should be willing to give a life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">A [Juror 2633: Uh-huh.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB1\">Q: What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">A: Well, you are going to play, you have got to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">Q: Is that similar to an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">A: Yeah. I have a question, though, if I could really fast. In the big room, did you say he had mental problems?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">Q: That is going to be something that we are going to talk about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">A: Well, on that fact <em>I don\u2019t think I could give you a verdict of death. There is just no way. </em>I know about mental illness and there is just no way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">Q: How do you know about mental illness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">A: I have a stepsister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">Q: What has she been diagnosed with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">A: Paranoid schizophrenia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\">Q: If you hear evidence about Tim Dunlap having a mental illness, is that going to change your opinion on an eye for an eye? A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-15\">Q: That is something that the judge is going to tell you about, aggravating circumstances of the crime, mitigating circumstances of the crime, and you now understand that sometimes there are explanations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-16\">A: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-17\">Q: It doesn\u2019t get him out of being guilty. A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-18\">Q [Counsel for the State]: If you were chosen as a juror on this case and the Judge instructed you on the law and you disagreed with it, would you still be willing to follow the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-19\">A: Well, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-20\">Q: You talked a little bit about \u2014 it sounds like you have some pretty strong opinions on mental illness, and what that evidence might mean; is that fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATc\">A: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-24\">Q: If the facts and evidence in this case indicated that the death penalty was appropriate, and that being that the aggravating factors of this crime were not outweighed by any mitigation, <em>ivould you refuse to give the death penalty just based on evidence that he might have had some mental problems?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-25\">A: That is a hard one to answer. <em>I am not sure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-26\">Q: I guess my question is, <em>would you give more weight to the fact that there may be mental illness than you would the other evidence?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-27\">A: On my past experience with my stepsister, I would have to say yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-28\">Q: So if there is evidence of <em>any sort </em>of mental problems, you could not give the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-29\">A: <em>I could not.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-30\">The district court then sustained the State\u2019s challenge to Juror 263, concluding that based the juror\u2019s statements regarding evidence of mental problems disqualified him from sitting on the jury. Dunlap\u2019s counsel did not object and did not seek to make further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-31\">Under <em>Witt, </em>removal for cause was proper if Juror 263\u2019s views would substantially impair his ability to perform his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and oath. The jury was instructed that if the State proved one or more statutory aggravating circumstances, the jury would be required to \u201cdecide whether the imposition of the death penalty would be unjust by <em>weighing </em>all mitigating circumstances against each statutory aggravating circumstance____\u201d Juror 263\u2019s statement that if there was <em>any </em>evidence regarding mental illness he \u201ccould not\u201d impose the death penalty suggests an inability to weigh mitigating circumstances against any aggravating circumstance. The district judge was in a position to observe Juror 263\u2019s demeanor as he responded to questions from counsel. His decision that Juror 263 could not serve as an impartial juror is entitled to deference. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State\u2019s motion to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>cuse Juror 263 for cause. Consequently, Dunlap was not prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s failure to raise this claim on appeal and the district court did not err by summarily dismissing this claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">b. There were no substantially impaired jurors under the standard announced in <em>Morgan v. Illinois.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Dunlap argues that SAPD rendered ineffective assistance of appellate counsel by failing to raise the following claim on appeal: the district court should have <em>sua sponte </em>removed eleven jurors for cause because they would automatically vote for the death penalty in every case. The district court concluded that it was not reasonably probable that any of the eleven jurors would have been excused for cause and thus, concluded that summary dismissal was appropriate for each of these claims because Dunlap did not show he was prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s failure to raise these claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">During jury selection, Dunlap passed for cause each of the eleven jurors he now alleges were not impartial. Dunlap accepted the jury as empaneled. Thus, Dunlap\u2019s claim is that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to claim on appeal that the district court erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>remove all eleven jurors for bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Generally, failure to exhaust available means for excluding unacceptable jurors precludes the consideration on appeal of a claim of error in seating the juror. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>145 Idaho 970, 979, 188 P.3d 912, 921 (2008). \u201c[F]ailure to challenge a juror for cause \u2018indicates a satisfaction with the jury as finally constituted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Bitz, </em>93 Idaho 239, 243, 460 P.2d 374, 378 (1969)). However, this Court will consider such issues for fundamental error. <em>Id.; see State v. Perry, </em>150 Idaho 209, 224, 245 P.3d 961, 976 (2010) (\u201cIf the alleged error was not followed by a contemporaneous objection, it shall only be reviewed ... under Idaho\u2019s fundamental error doctrine.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">To succeed on a claim that the district court erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>remove a juror for cause, where, \u201cas here, no motion was made during jury selection to dismiss the juror in question for cause,\u201d the defendant \u201cassumes a greater burden: he must show that the evidence of partiality before the district court was so indicative of impermissible juror bias that the court was obliged to strike [the juror] from the jury, even though neither counsel made the request.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>568 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.2009); <em>but cf. People v. Metcalfe, </em>202 Ill.2d 544, 270 Ill.Dec. 69, 782 N.E.2d 263, 271 (2002) (\u201cWe decline to impose a duty upon a trial court to sua sponte excuse a juror for cause in the absence of a defendant\u2019s challenge for cause or exercise of a peremptory challenge.\u201d); <em>accord Cage v. McCaughtry, </em>305 F.3d 625 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">We will consider the governing standard before proceeding to analyze Dunlap\u2019s claims regarding each of the eleven jurors. Our focus will be on the prejudice prong, i.e., if SAPD had advanced a claim that the juror should have been excused for cause the result of the appeal would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">i. The <em>Morgan </em>Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">In <em>Morgan v. Illinois, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-14\">A juror who will automatically vote for the death penalty in every case will fail in good faith to consider the evidence of aggrava<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ting and mitigating circumstances as the instructions require him to do. Indeed, because such a juror has already formed an opinion on the merits, the presence or absence of either aggravating or mitigating circumstances is entirely irrelevant to such a juror. Therefore, based on the requirement of impartiality embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a capital defendant may challenge for cause any prospective juror who maintains such views. If even one such juror is empaneled and the death sentence is imposed, the State is disentitled to execute the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 2230, 119 L.Ed.2d 492, 502-503 (1992). The standard is whether jurors\u2019 \u201cviews would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties in accordance with their instructions or their oath.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728, 112 S.Ct. at 2229, 119 L.Ed.2d at 502 (quoting <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 424, 105 S.Ct. 844, 852, 83 L.Ed.2d 841, 851-852 (1985) (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The United States Supreme Court has explained that when the state\u2019s capital punishment scheme requires the jury to weigh and consider mitigating evidence, \u201c[a]ny juror who states that he or she will automatically vote for the death penalty without regard to the mitigating evidence is announcing an intention not to follow the instructions to consider mitigating evidence. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738, 112 S.Ct. at 2234, 119 L.Ed.2d at 508-509. Thus, jurors who \u201cdeem mitigating evidence to be irrelevant to their decision to impose the death penalty,\u201d and those jurors who \u201crefuse to give such evidence any weight\u201d should be disqualified for cause. <em>Id. </em>at 736, 112 S.Ct. at 2233, 119 L.Ed.2d at 507. This is because \u201cconsideration of the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense [is] a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.\u201d <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 304, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L.Ed.2d 944, 961 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">To make this determination, courts look to the entirety of the juror\u2019s responses regarding their views toward capital punishment. Thus, while jury questionnaires may squarely address <em>Morgan </em>issues, a juror may be rehabilitated in voir dire, and the trial judge has discretion to determine whether the juror\u2019s views would prevent or substantially impair his ability to perform his duties as an impartial juror. <em>See, e.g., Treesh v. Bagley, </em>612 F.3d 424, 438 (6th Cir.2010) (weighing juror\u2019s initial responses with later explanations to determine that juror could take into account mitigating factors); <em>Ledford v. Georgia, </em>289 Ga. 70, 709 S.E.2d 239, 250 (2011) (looking to potential juror\u2019s responses \u201cas a whole\u201d); <em>Sanchez v. Oklahoma, </em>223 P.3d 980, 997 (Okla.Crim. App.2009) (\u201cA review of the entire voir dire shows that the District Court could readily distinguish between the prospective jurors who were initially befuddled by the automatic death penalty question and those irrevocably committed to imposing the death penalty for murder.\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[i]t is not uncommon for jurors to express themselves in ambiguous and seemingly contradictory ways,\u201d and thus, given the superior ability of the judge to observe the prospective juror, we extend substantial deference to the trial judge\u2019s assessment as to which statements and assertions best demonstrate the juror\u2019s actual conceptions. <em>New Hampshire v. Addison, </em>165 N.H. 381, 87 A.3d 1, 64 (2013) (citing <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1038-40, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 2892-94, 81 L.Ed.2d 847, 857-860 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">We now address each juror whom Dunlap alleges to have been substantially impaired. In each instance, the district court determined that Dunlap could not show prejudice resulting from SAPD\u2019s failure to raise the claim because the district court found the challenged juror was not biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">ii. Juror 279</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">Dunlap argues that Juror 279 was an \u201cautomatic death\u201d juror and that he should have been excused for cause because he demonstrated dogmatic views of fairness, indicated he would not consider mitigating evidence of the defendant\u2019s childhood, and was predisposed on the propensity aggravator.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Juror 279 endorsed the statement \u201cI generally favor the death penalty, but I would base a decision to impose it on the facts and the law in the case.\u201d In his questionnaire, Juror 279 indicated he believed \u201cthat a defendant who does not testify is probably guilty or has something to hide\u201d and that \u201ca person on trial who does not take the witness stand and deny the crime is probably guilty.\u201d Juror 279 also answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cIf the defendant exercises his Constitutional right to remain silent and does not testify, would you hold that against him and consider it as an indication of guilt?\u201d Juror 279 strongly agreed with the proposition that \u201cour society would be stronger if the death penalty were imposed more often.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Juror 279 agreed with the following: \u201cmurder is murder, and understanding motives and circumstances is not important;\u201d that \u201clife in prison without the possibility of parole is not a harsh enough penalty for murder;\u201d that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had;\u201d and that \u201cpeople who kill should be punished no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d Juror 279 disagreed that it would be hard for him to vote to kill someone, and strongly disagreed that \u201conly the worst murderers should be executed.\u201d Juror 279 supported the death penalty, explaining \u201cI believe in the death penalty, I believe if the crime warrants it, it should be administered. We need some deterrent to murder and crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">However, Juror 279 also indicated that \u201cthe burden of proof should be greater than beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d stating that \u201cI feel you should be sure through the evidence that he or she did the crime with out [sic] doubt.\u201d Juror 279 agreed that the jury should be required to follow the law and jury instructions and did not agree the jury should be free to disregard the law, even if they disagree with it. Juror 279 agreed he would follow the instructions upon the law given by the judge even if he thought the law was different or disagreed with the law as instructed by the judge. Juror 279 strongly agreed with the proposition that \u201cevery defendant is innocent and remains so unless the State can prove otherwise.\u201d And Juror 279 agreed with the following statements: \u201cI am uncomfortable about having to decide about executing someone;\u201d that \u201ca person\u2019s upbringing influences the ability to make decisions later in life;\u201d and that \u201cI would review all the evidence before I made a decision in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">During individual voir dire, Juror 279 responded to counsel, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">Q [Counsel for the State]: Based on those questions, are there any issues that you see that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror in this ease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWr\">A [Juror 279]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">Q: I think you indicated that you wanted to see proof beyond all doubt, and I guess my question to you is, knowing what you know about the case now, is that still your opinion? Would you hold the State to a higher burden?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">A: To a point. You know, a lot depends on what the Judge \u2014 the rules that the Judge lays down for the case which I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">Q: So you wouldn\u2019t hold the State to a higher burden? You wouldn\u2019t disregard the Court\u2019s instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">Q: If you are chosen as a juror on this ease, you will hear the evidence and the Judge will instruct you on the law. At the end of the case, the State is going to be asking you to find that the law requires the death penalty. How do you feel about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">A: I believe in the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-15\">Q: How do you feel about being the one that has to make that decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-16\">A: That is a difficult [sic] because I have not had to live that out, you know, my beliefs before. So it is not the easiest, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-17\">Q: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-18\">A: Which you understand that, I know, but I believe that I can make that choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaL\">Q: Okay. You believe that you can make your decision solely upon the evidence pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>sented in court and the law as the judge instructs it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">A: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">Q: You wouldn\u2019t let your personal feelings about the death penalty come in and affect your decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">A: Well, you know, I thought about that a lot the last couple of days to be fair, you know, because I have to be fair too, and I believe I can when I thought it through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">Q [Counsel for Dunlap]: Do you feel that you could give Tim due benefit by listening to the evidence that we presented?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">A: I believe so, yes, because, like I said, I felt a lot the last two days trying to figure it out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">Q: I understand that you haven\u2019t actually heard any evidence yet, but you are certainly going to sit there and weigh it, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">Q: You feel that you are a fair person, you are open-minded about things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">A: Uh-huh. To a point, uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">Q: To what point is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">A: Being fair human nature-wise. I mean, I have my own set of absolutes and rules. You know, we all have that we live by. But I work with a lot of people, so I have learned \u2014 I work in a restaurant, so I have learned to deal with a lot of different backgrounds and a lot of different people, and to learn to not judge from that. You understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">Q: Sometimes people can surprise you, is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-16\">A: Yes, I do [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">Dunlap identifies two problems with Juror 279\u2019s responses. The first is that Juror 279 indicated that he had his \u201cown set of absolutes and rules.\u201d Dunlap asserts that this response, coupled with Juror 279\u2019s answers to the questionnaire, show that he is a juror who would automatically vote for the death penalty in every case without consideration for the actual evidence presented at trial. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330 (11th Cir.2006) is informative as to this claim. In <em>Brown, </em>a potential juror, when asked whether she would make her decision to impose the death penalty on her own \u201cinternal set of values or on what the law is\u201d as provided by the judge, responded: \u201cI believe I would probably make the decision based upon my own internal values.\u201d 441 F.3d at 1356. Counsel pressed by asking: \u201cEven if those might conflict and be different than what [the judge] is telling the jury to apply?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357. The potential juror responded, \u201c[y]es.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court determined that because the potential juror would vote based on her own internal values, not on the instructed law, the district court properly struck the juror for cause, despite the fact the juror stated she \u201cwould want to listen to all the facts and had not predetermined whether she would vote for or against the death penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-20\">Here, Juror 279\u2019s responses are markedly different from those in <em>Brown. </em>Juror 279\u2019s response that he had his \u201cown set of absolutes and rules\u201d was not in response to a question regarding following instructions; rather, it was made in reference to whether he was fair and open-minded. Unlike in <em>Brown, </em>at no point did Juror 279 indicate that his \u201cown set of absolutes and rules\u201d would prohibit him from considering the facts or following the law as he was instructed. To the contrary, Juror 279 indicated several times that he wanted to listen to all the evidence, stating \u201cI really believe I want to hear the facts.\u201d Juror 279 also indicated that how he treated the case would depend on \u201cthe rules that the Judge lays down,\u201d indicating a clear understanding that the judge would provide the standard he would be required to apply. While his questionnaire responses clearly indicate he favored the death penalty, he agreed that he would follow the court\u2019s instructions and consider all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-21\">The second problem with Juror 279, Dunlap argues, is that he could not give effect to mitigating evidence. In his questionnaire responses, Juror 279 agreed that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had\u201d and \u201c[p]eople who kill should be punished no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Dunlap argues that this necessarily means that Juror 279 could not give effect to mitigating evidence. When considering challenges for cause, a trial court should evaluate whether a prospective juror\u2019s views would \u201cprevent or substantially impair\u201d the juror\u2019s ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Waimuright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 424, 105 S.Ct. 844, 852, 83 L.Ed.2d 841, 851-852 (1985). If the court is left with the \u201cdefinite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law,\u201d that juror should be excused. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 105 S.Ct. at 853, 83 L.Ed.2d at 852-853. Therefore, as a part of its inquiry, the court must evaluate whether a juror would be able to faithfully and impartially apply the law regarding mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Here, we note that the questionnaire asks potential jurors to identify how each proposition relates to their personal beliefs; it is not a direct question regarding the juror\u2019s ability to apply the law regarding mitigating factors. At no point did Juror 279 indicate that he would not consider those factors. Albeit rather broadly, Juror 279 indicated that he would follow the law even if he disagreed with it, that he really wanted \u201cto hear the facts,\u201d and that he believed the death penalty was appropriate \u201cif the crime warrants it.\u201d He also indicated that he believed he could give \u201cdue benefit\u201d to all the evidence presented, and that he agreed that \u201c[a] person\u2019s upbringing influences the ability to make decisions later in life.\u201d Indeed, Juror 279 indicated that he did not believe the jury should be free to disregard the law, and he would follow the instructions on the law given by the judge, even if he disagreed. These responses do not present a compelling case that Juror 279 would fail to consider mitigating evidence when instructed to do so by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Ultimately, it is far from clear that Juror 279\u2019s views prevented or impaired his ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions and apply the facts to the law. As we must give deference to the trial judge, who was able to observe the juror\u2019s demeanor during his questioning by counsel, we are unable to hold that the record demonstrates that Juror 279 was a juror unable to conscientiously apply the law and find the facts. Therefore, Dunlap\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury was not violated by the district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>remove Juror 279 for cause and there was no prejudice resulting from SAPD\u2019s failure to raise this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">iii. Juror 293</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Dunlap asserts that Juror 293 only agreed capital punishment was inappropriate in instances of lesser degrees of murder, not due to mitigating factors, such that Juror 293 would automatically impose the death penalty upon anyone convicted of first-degree murder. Dunlap further argues that Juror 293 indicated he would not consider mitigating evidence regarding Dunlap\u2019s childhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In the questionnaire, Juror 293 indicated he agreed with the following propositions: \u201cI support the use of the death penalty,\u201d and \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had.\u201d Juror 293 also indicated he disagreed with the following: \u201conly the worst murderers should be executed;\u201d and \u201cit would be hard for me to vote to kill someone.\u201d When asked to identify the most accurate representation of his feelings on the death penalty, Juror 293 selected the following response: \u201cI generally favor the death penalty but would base a decision to impose it on the facts and the law of the case.\u201d When the questionnaire asked, \u201cHow do you feel about the death penalty?\u201d Juror 293 answered: \u201cIn some cases it is fair and warranted.\u201d Juror 293 also indicated that he did not feel that his views on the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair his ability to view the facts or impose the death penalty impartially. Further, Juror 293 indicated that he agreed that a person\u2019s upbringing influences their ability to make decisions later in life, and that he would review all of the evidence before he made a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">In individual voir dire, counsel delved into Juror 293\u2019s response to the question \u201cHow do you feel about the death penalty?\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">Q [Counsel for Dunlap]: You wrote, \u201cIn some cases it is fair and warranted.\u201d You generally support the death penalty. What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-12\">A [Juror 293]: Well, basically I think you take it case by case. In my opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>you know, if someone has thought it out, planned it, and then they execute it the way they had planned, I think it is different than something of a spur-of-the-moment type thing. That is kind of what I mean by that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">Q: Have you made up your mind yet that this is a case that he should get life imprisonment without parole, or the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Q: You understand that if you are selected as juror, that would be your job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">Q: Are there ever cases in your mind where a death penalty would not be appropriate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">A: Yeah, I think there is [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">Q [Counsel for the State]: Do you think you can listen to the evidence and follow the law as the Judge instructs it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">A [Juror 293]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">Q: You think you have any bias for or against either side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">A: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">Dunlap argues that Juror 293\u2019s responses indicate that he believed capital punishment was only unwarranted when the defendant has not actually committed first-degree murder. Dunlap argues that since he had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, Juror 293 would automatically impose the death penalty. However, as one court has observed, \u201cquestions put to prospective jurors in a death penalty <em>voir dire </em>can be confusing to laypersons,\u201d but it is the purpose of voir dire to ask questions which shed light on whether the juror\u2019s views on capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror. <em>Sanchez v. Oklahoma, </em>223 P.3d 980, 997 (Okla.Crim.App.2009). This observation is relevant to our analysis. When voir dire took place, the prospective jurors had not been instructed as to what constituted aggravating and mitigating circumstance. Potential jurors cannot be expected to provide answers that perfectly accord with Idaho\u2019s statutory framework without having been so instructed. <em>See New Jersey v. Papasawas, </em>163 N.J. 565, 751 A.2d 40, 49-51 (2000). Dunlap\u2019s argument assumes that Juror 293, who had no legal training or experience, was making a purposeful distinction between mitigating factors and lesser degrees of murder. Juror 293 made it clear that whether a death sentence was warranted depended on the case, he had not yet made up his mind as to whether the death penalty was appropriate, and he would listen to the evidence and follow the law. Juror 293 was not an automatic death juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">Dunlap also argues that since Juror 293 agreed that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had\u201d he would not give effect to mitigating evidence and was substantially impaired. However, the determination whether a juror is substantially impaired requires consideration of the totality of the record of the juror\u2019s statements and questionnaire answers. Juror 293 agreed that upbringing influences a person\u2019s ability to make decisions later in life. At no time did Juror 293 indicate that he would not consider mitigating evidence, and he asserted that the determination whether the death penalty was appropriate was to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Viewed in its totality, we are unable to share Dunlap\u2019s view that Juror 293 would disregard mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">Dunlap has not shown that Juror 293\u2019s views on capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair him from performing his duties as a juror in accordance with the instructions and his oath. Thus, Dunlap\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury was not violated by the district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>remove Juror 293 for cause. Dunlap was not prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s failure to raise this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-20\">iv. Juror 270</p>\n<p id=\"b351-21\">Dunlap argues that Juror 270 was an automatic death juror because he believed that life in prison without the possibility of parole was not a harsh enough penalty for murder and he would not narrow the death penalty to the worst murderers. Dunlap\u2019s argument is based on Juror 270\u2019s response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>two questions in the 27-page questionnaire. He disagreed with the following proposition: \u201conly the worst murderers should be executed;\u201d and agreed that \u201clife in prison without the possibility of parole is not a harsh enough penalty for murder.\u201d In individual voir dire, the following exchanges occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">Q [Counsel for the State]: [Y]ou will be asked to weigh those aggravating factors against any mitigation evidence the defense chooses to present. Do you feel like you are the type of person that can do that weighing process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">A [Juror 270]: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">Q [Counsel for Dunlap]: Have you made up your mind in this case that Tim Dunlap should get the death penalty or life in prison without parole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">A: No, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">Q: Even though you generally favor the death penalty, you still believe there could be some situation when \u2014 there might be a situation that would be unjust to give the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">A: Yes, I believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Considering the record as a whole, Juror 270 was not substantially impaired in his ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions. Indeed, Juror 270 stated that he felt the \u201cthe death penalty is warranted <em>in some cases. </em>I feel it is a deterrent to crime.\u201d Juror 270\u2019s answers in the questionnaire indicate a clear recognition and willingness to consider mitigating evidence. He disagreed with the propositions that \u201cmurder is murder, and understanding motives and circumstances is not important\u201d and \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had.\u201d While he generally favored the death penalty, he also recognized that there are situations when it would be unjust to impose it. Dunlap\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury was not violated by the district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>remove Juror 270 for cause and there was no prejudice resulting from SAPD\u2019s failure to raise this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">v. Juror 164</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">Dunlap argues that Juror 164 was an automatic death juror because, like Juror 293, the only mitigating circumstance he indicated was important was lack of intent. Dunlap asserts this answer shows Juror 164 would only abstain from imposing capital punishment in instances when the crime was not punishable by death, i.e., in cases not involving first-degree murder. Dunlap also argues that Juror 164 was predisposed to find the existence of the propensity aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">In the questionnaire, Juror 164 agreed with the proposition that \u201csomeone already convicted of a murder is likely to kill someone else.\u201d Juror 164 also indicated that he disagreed with the propositions \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had,\u201d \u201cunderstanding the motives and circumstances\u201d of a murder is not important, and life in prison without the possibility of parole is not a harsh enough penalty for murder. While he strongly agreed with the statement \u201cI support the use of the death penalty,\u201d he also strongly agreed with the assertion \u201cI am uncomfortable about having to decide about executing someone.\u201d Juror 164 felt there \u201care circumstances under which the death penalty could be an appropriate penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-16\">During individual voir dire, Juror 164 answered questions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-17\">Q [Counsel for the State]: Do you feel like as a juror as you sit here today, that you could go into this situation with an open mind and do the weighing that is required of the jurors that the Judge is going to instruct you on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-18\">A [Juror 164]: Yeah ... I have thought about this since I filled out the questionnaire, about how difficult it might be to come to that kind of decision. I think the only way that I could come to that decision would be to look at all of the evidence and listen to the instructions accordingly that explains [sic] what the law is, and the only way I could live with it is to look at all of that stuff and weigh it in my own mind and come to a decision for myself, what needs to be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-19\">Q [Counsel for Dunlap]: What kind of mitigating factors would you consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>death penalty to be unjust in? Have you thought about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">A: I haven\u2019t given that a lot of thought. You know, I think it was you earlier that talked \u2014 someone talked about intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">Q: I think it was Mr. Whatcott, but that is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">A: That would certainly be something that you would have to try and consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6A\">Q: Do you think it would be fair not only to evaluate the circumstances of the actual crime or crimes around the time they happened, but also to look at the history and background of Tim Dunlap?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">A: I think that would\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">Q: Looking at everything, how he was raised, things that happened to him as a young man as he approached those events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEq\">A: Certainly they ought to be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Juror 164\u2019s response regarding intent being a mitigating factor, without having been instructed on what constitutes first-degree murder or a mitigating factor, cannot be understood as meaning that Juror 164 would automatically vote to impose the death penalty in instances of first-degree murder. Dunlap\u2019s assertion that Juror 164 was predisposed to find the propensity aggravator is likewise without merit. Juror 164 agreed that the jury should be required to follow the law given in the jury instructions and that the jury is not free to disregard the law even if they disagree with it. This sentiment was reiterated in individual voir dire where Juror 164 explained that the only way he could make the decision would be to look at all of the evidence and listen to the instructions. Juror 164\u2019s willingness to consider mitigating circumstances is reflected in his answers regarding the importance of the circumstances of the murderer\u2019s childhood and his disagreement with the notion that life in prison without the possibility of parole is inadequate punishment for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Dunlap\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury was not violated by the district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>remove Juror 164 for cause. The record does not support Dunlap\u2019s contention that Juror 164\u2019s views on the death penalty prevented or substantially impaired his ability to serve as an impartial juror. There was no prejudice resulting from SAPD\u2019s failure to advance this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">vi. Juror 119</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">Dunlap argues that Juror 119 would also automatically impose the death penalty regardless of the facts and law. In the questionnaire, Juror 119 indicated that he supports the use of the death penalty and believes that life in prison without the possibility of parole is not a harsh enough penalty for murder. Juror 119 disagreed with the following propositions: \u201conly the worst murderers should be executed;\u201d \u201cit would be hard for me to vote to kill someone;\u201d and \u201cI am uncomfortable about having to decide about executing someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">Juror 119 indicated that he believed understanding the motives and circumstances of a murder were important and that, although he generally favored the death penalty, he would base his decision on the facts and the law of the case. He did not feel that his views on the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair his ability to view the facts impartially or to impose the death penalty. He disagreed with the statements that \u201cunderstanding motives and circumstances is not important\u201d and \u201cI do not believe criminals can be rehabilitated.\u201d Juror 119\u2019s questionnaire responses repeatedly reflected his belief that a person\u2019s upbringing is important to understanding the circumstances of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">The questionnaire provided a general procedural statement, followed by an open-ended question regarding the prospective jurors\u2019 views on capital punishment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-18\">Persons convicted of First Degree Murder <em>cannot </em>automatically be given the death penalty. Before the jury could impose the death penalty, there will be a hearing on the appropriate penalty, and the jury would have to find that the death penalty was appropriate under the guidelines set by Idaho law. Evidence will be presented regarding the appropriate penalty. How do you feel about the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Juror 119 responded: \u201cIf a person commits a crime that is punishable by the death penalty' \u2014 so be it____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In individual voir dire, counsel addressed this response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">Q [Counsel for Dunlap]: [H]ow do you feel about the possibility of sitting on a death penalty case and determining life or death for somebody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">A [Juror 119]: You know, I don\u2019t suppose anybody would want to do it but I would be prepared to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Q: Is that anything that you feel you can do fairly and impartially?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">A: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">Q: I noticed that in your questionnaire when you were asked how do you feel about the death penalty, your statement was \u201cIf a person commits a crime that is punishable by the death penalty,\u201d which this one is as we know, \u201cso be it.\u201d What does that mean \u201cso be it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">A: You know, I would just think that if the crime fits the punishment, then that is how it ought to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">Q: And how do you determine whether the crime fits the punishment or how is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">A: I suppose that is what we are doing here. We are going to have to determine that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">Q: You understand that with mitigating evidence, that life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is what we are talking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">A: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">Q: And that that is always a reasonable option for a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-16\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">Looking to voir dire as a whole, while Juror 119 was supportive of the death penalty, his answers indicate receptiveness to evidence in mitigation. Juror 119\u2019s answers indicated that he believed the task of the jury was to determine whether the punishment fit the crime. The record does not support Dunlap\u2019s claim that Juror 119\u2019s views on capital punishment prevented or substantially impaired his ability to weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Dunlap\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury was not violated by the district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>excuse Juror 119 for cause. Dunlap was not prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s failure to advance this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-19\">vii. Juror 3</p>\n<p id=\"b354-20\">Dunlap argues that Juror 3 would automatically vote to impose the death penalty based on his agreement with two propositions in the questionnaire. Juror 3 agreed with the statement that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had\u201d and that \u201csomeone already convicted of a murder is likely to kill someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-21\">Juror 3 strongly agreed with the assertion that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had\u201d but also strongly agreed that \u201ca person\u2019s upbringing influences the ability to make decisions later in life.\u201d Juror 3 disagreed that \u201clife in prison without the possibility of parole is not a harsh enough penalty for murder.\u201d Juror 3 also agreed that \u201csomeone already convicted of a murder is likely to kill someone else.\u201d Juror 3 supported the death penalty, responding in the questionnaire that the death penalty \u201ccould be an effective deterrent to crime if imposed more consistently and more timely\u201d and that it was an \u201cappropriate measure to protect society from crime/criminals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-22\">In individual voir dire, Juror 3 expanded upon his beliefs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-23\">Q [Counsel for the State]: [A]re you willing to vote against [the death penalty] if the evidence doesn\u2019t show it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-24\">A [Juror 3]: I think I am fairly objective, sir, yes, in mind [sic]. ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-25\">Q: And so you feel like you can give both the State and the defense a fair shake in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-26\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-27\">Q [Counsel for Dunlap]: Couple of questions about your questionnaire ____ You indicated that the death penalty, when asked about how you feel about it, \u201cCould be an effective deterrent if it was imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>more consistently and more timely\u201d ____ What do you mean by \u201cmore consistently?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW9\">A [Juror 3]: I believe the inconsistencies in our society lead to ambiguities and it is hard to judge on how people view those things, but if there is a universal standard, if there is ever such a thing in a democracy, then it would be more universally understood. And I know state-to-state and community-to-community and jury-to-jury is going to change. So that may be nirvana, kind of a utopia statement, but it is just something I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">Q: You also understand that when we talk about mitigating evidence, we are not implying mitigating factors that excuse Tim\u2019s behavior of what he did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">A: I understand, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">Q: But as jurors you go through a weighing process to see whether the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">Q: Is that something that you feel you can do fairly and justly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">A: Certainly, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">Q: Is there any reason that you can think of that you could not do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">A: I can\u2019t think of any circumstances that would influence that sir, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">Dunlap\u2019s assertions that Juror 3 is an automatic death juror are based entirely on his responses to two questions in the questionnaire. Looking to the record as a whole, Juror 3 indicated he would review all the evidence before making a decision, would listen to the other jurors if he did not agree, and that while he favored the death penalty, he would base a decision to impose it on the facts and law of the case. Juror 3 also indicated that he did not feel his views on the death penalty would impair his ability to view the facts or impose the death penalty impartially. Juror 3\u2019s responses indicate a commitment to standards and consistency, reflecting his determination to apply the law. Dunlap\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by the district court\u2019s failure to excuse Juror 3 on its own initiative and Dunlap was not prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s failure to raise this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">viii. Jurors 226, 150, and 151</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">Dunlap argues that three jurors should have been excused as automatic death jurors based solely on their agreement with the proposition in the questionnaire that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of a childhood a murderer had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-19\">Juror 226 responded that he agreed that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had.\u201d However, he also disagreed with the statements that \u201cmurder is murder, and understanding motives and circumstances is not important\u201d and \u201clife in prison without the possibility of parole is not a harsh enough penalty for murder.\u201d While Juror 226 supported the death penalty, he wrote: \u201cI feel it can be necessary, but should be used with extreme caution. It is not to be used loosely and must be used only after careful deliberation.\u201d He strongly agreed that he would listen and review all the evidence before making a decision in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-20\">Juror 226\u2019s apparent dismissal of the mitigating value of evidence regarding a murderer\u2019s childhood is inconsistent with his answers to several other questions touching on the importance of mitigating evidence. His support of the death penalty was tempered by his conviction that capital punishment must only follow \u201ccareful deliberation\u201d and reflect \u201cextreme caution.\u201d Juror 226 indicated that he could fairly and justly weigh evidence about mitigating factors and endorsed the statement that most accurately represented his feelings on the death penalty as: \u201cI am generally opposed to the death penalty, but I believe I can put aside my feelings against the death penalty and impose it if it [sic] is called for by the facts and law in the ease.\u201d Juror 226\u2019s answers indicate his verdict would be made based entirely on the facts in front of him and the law provided in the court\u2019s instructions. They fall short of demonstrating that Juror 226 would disregard mitigating evidence regarding Dunlap\u2019s childhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">Juror 150 also responded that he agreed that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>childhood a murderer had.\u201d He indicated that while he supported the death penalty, when asked \u201chow do you feel about the death penalty?\u201d he responded: \u201cIt is appropriate in some cases. It is not appropriate for all cases. You must decide on a case by case basis.\u201d Importantly, Juror 150 disagreed with the assertion that \u201cpeople who kill should be punished no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d In voir dire, Juror 150 indicated that to determine whether capital punishment was appropriate, \u201cyou would just have to weigh out all of the evidence. If the crime [fits] for that penalty, that is what you should hand down, after weighing out all of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Juror 151 also responded that he agreed that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of childhood a murderer had.\u201d He indicated that he had no opinion regarding the assertion that \u201cpeople who kill should be punished no matter what the circumstances are\u201d and \u201ca person\u2019s upbringing influences the ability to make decisions later in life.\u201d While supportive of the death penalty, he stated that \u201cI feel it has a place but you have to use it with caution and only when warranted.\u201d When asked to explain how he felt about imposing the death penalty, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">I think, you know, we have been asked if we are chosen to look at the circumstances and go above what our personal things are and provide what the law instructs you to do and keep that out of it. That is very important \u2018cause that is what our society is based on, to be able to take ourselves out of it. Yeah, it is easy to have biases sometimes but I think we need to be honest with ourselves in the purpose because I think it is a serious question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Juror 151 did not feel that jurors should be free to disregard the law given in the jury instructions if they disagreed with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">With these three jurors, Dunlap focuses on their response to a single question in the questionnaire without regard for the other answers and statements provided in voir dire, which, when reviewed, contradict his claim that these three jurors were automatic death jurors. Each juror indicated that he would support the death penalty only if it was warranted by the facts, circumstances and law. A juror is an automatic death juror if the juror \u201cwill fail in good faith to consider the evidence of aggravating and mitigation circumstances as the instructions require him to do.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 2230, 119 L.Ed.2d 492, 502-503 (1992). The record does not reflect that the jurors would not consider evidence of Dunlap\u2019s childhood as mitigating evidence if instructed to do so. Dunlap\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury was not violated by the district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>remove these three jurors for cause. Dunlap has not shown prejudice resulting from SAPD\u2019s failure to advance this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">ix. Juror 97</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Dunlap argues Juror 97 was substantially impaired based solely on his agreement with the assertion \u201csomeone already convicted of a murder is likely to kill someone else.\u201d Dunlap argues that Juror 97 was predisposed on the existence of this aggravating factor such that he would fail in good faith to consider the evidence regarding the propensity aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">In the questionnaire, Juror 97 indicated that he believed the State\u2019s burden of proof should not be lower than proof beyond a reasonable doubt; that he would not apply a lesser burden; and agreed that the jury should be required to follow the law given in the jury instructions. Nothing in Juror 97\u2019s responses indicate that he would not follow the instructions that required the State prove an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Dunlap\u2019s assertion that one answer <em>alone </em>renders Juror 97 a juror who would automatically vote to impose death ignores the remainder of his answers, and is in conflict with the requirement that a juror\u2019s voir dire be considered as a whole. In individual voir dire, when asked if there was any reason that he would not be a fair and impartial juror in this case, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">A [Juror 97]: Emotions would play a part in it no matter what, but I also feel like I have enough that I understand the law as it is presented to me. I believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>we are supposed to follow that. Because of that, I feel like I would do what was right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">Q [Counsel for the State]: So you are willing to put any of your personal beliefs or emotions that might arise during the trial aside and listen to the evidence and base your decision solely upon that and solely upon the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">A: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">It is important to observe that the response which Dunlap argues conclusively shows Juror 97 was predisposed to find the propensity aggravator was given to a question which asked about the juror\u2019s personal beliefs. Juror 97 repeatedly indicated that he would follow the law and instructions regardless of his agreement with them. We further note that the propensity aggravator requires substantially more than the limited proposition addressed in the questionnaire. The propensity aggravator instruction spoke in terms of the \u201cwilling, predisposed killer, a killer who tends toward destroying the life of another\u201d and noted that \u201c[propensity requires a proclivity, a susceptibility, and even an affinity towards committing the act of murder.\u201d Juror 97\u2019s agreement with the proposition contained in the questionnaire does not establish that he was substantially impaired in his ability to impartially decide whether this aggravating circumstance existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Dunlap\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by the district court\u2019s failure to remove Juror 97 on its own initiative and Dunlap was not prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s failure to raise this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">x. Juror 245</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Finally, Dunlap argues that Juror 245 was substantially impaired based on his agreement that \u201csomeone already convicted of a murder is likely to kill someone else\u201d and because he agreed that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of a childhood a murderer had.\u201d Dunlap argues Juror 245 would fail to consider mitigating evidence and was predisposed to find the propensity aggravator.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Juror 245 disagreed with the assertions that \u201cmurder is murder, and understanding motives and circumstances is not important\u201d and that \u201clife in prison without the possibility of parole is not a harsh enough penalty for murder.\u201d He agreed that \u201ca person\u2019s' upbringing influences their ability to make decisions later in life\u201d and that he would follow the instructions given by the district court, even if he thought the law was different or if he disagreed with the instructions. In response to the prompt, \u201chow do you feel about the death penalty?\u201d Juror 245 responded: \u201cI support the death penalty. I feel those who commit terrible murders and are a threat to society should be put to death.\u201d In individual voir dire, he explained further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANA\">Q [Counsel for Dunlap]: How do you determine what a terrible murder is? I mean, what kind of criteria do you use?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuQ\">A [Juror 245]: Well, see, I don\u2019t know what the State uses as their \u2014 I assume the Judge would provide us with some guidelines, and I don\u2019t know what those guidelines are.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">Considering Juror 245\u2019s responses in voir dire as a whole, we cannot say that Juror 245 was substantially impaired. Juror 245\u2019s answer to defense counsel demonstrates an understanding that his duty was to render a verdict based on the facts and the law provided to him by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">Dunlap\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated for the district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>excuse Juror 245 for cause. Dunlap was not prejudiced by SAPD\u2019s failure to advance this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">c. Trial Counsel\u2019s Inadequate Yoir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">Dunlap advances a corollary argument in support of his claim that his right to an impartial jury was violated. Dunlap argues that SAPD should have advanced a claim that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during voir dire. Dunlap contends trial counsel was ineffective for: (1) failing to follow up on \u201cobvious red flags in statements made by the prospective jurors;\u201d (2) failing to move to exclude \u201cmany jurors\u201d for cause; (3) failing to rehabilitate Juror 263; and (4) failing to oppose the State\u2019s motion to exclude Juror 263 for cause. These claims can be distilled down to two essential arguments: (1) trial counsel failed to properly question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>and move.to strike several jurors; and (2) trial counsel failed to rehabilitate and argue on behalf of Juror 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Dunlap\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim is predicated on the underlying claim against his trial counsel. As noted above, we review claims for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and trial counsel under the same <em>Strickland </em>standard. Because we address a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel by looking to the merits of the omitted issue, if trial counsel\u2019s performance was not objectively unreasonable or did not prejudice Dunlap, then Dunlap would not be prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s omission of a meritless ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. Thus, if Dunlap cannot establish a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, his appellate counsel claim automatically fails. As a result, when an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim is based on appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, the appellant must first show that trial counsel was ineffective under the <em>Strickland </em>two-prong test. <em>See Moormann v. Ryan, </em>628 F.3d 1102, 1106-07 (9th Cir.2010); <em>State v. Sellers, </em>290 Neb. 18, 858 N.W.2d 577, 585 (2015); <em>Wright v. State, </em>765 N.W.2d 85, 91 (Minn.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Under the <em>Strickland </em>two-prong test, the defendant must show: (1) that trial \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient;\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693 (1984); <em>see Dunlap V, </em>155 Idaho 345, 383, 313 P.3d 1, 39 (2013). \u201c[T]he performance inquiry must be whether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693-694. This Court \u201cwill not second-guess trial counsel\u2019s strategic and tactical choices ... and we presume trial counsel was competent and that trial tactics were based on sound legal strategy.\u201d <em>State v. Porter, </em>130 Idaho 772, 792, 948 P.2d 127, 147 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u201cVoir dire plays a critical function in assuring the criminal defendant that his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury will be honored.\u201d <em>Rosales-Lopez v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 182, 188, 101 S.Ct. 1629, 1634, 68 L.Ed.2d 22, 28-29 (1981). Indeed, \u201cpart of the guarantee of a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify unqualified jurors.\u201d <em>State v. Abdullah, </em>158 Idaho 386, 521, 348 P.3d 1, 136 (2015) (quoting <em>Morgan v. Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 2230, 119 L.Ed.2d 492, 503 (1992)); <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d 609, 615 (6th Cir.2001) (\u201cAmong the most essential responsibilities of defense counsel is to protect his client\u2019s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury by using voir dire to identify and ferret out jurors who are biased against the defense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u201cDespite its importance, the adequacy of voir dire is not easily subject to appellate review.\u201d <em>Rosales-Lopez, </em>451 U.S. at 188, 101 S.Ct. at 1634, 68 L.Ed.2d at 28-29. \u201cThe choice of questions to ask prospective jurors during voir dire is largely a matter of trial tactics.\u201d <em>Abdullah, </em>158 Idaho at 521, 348 P.3d at 136 (quoting <em>Milton v. State, </em>126 Idaho 638, 641, 888 P.2d 812, 815 (Ct.App. 1995)). \u201cThese tactical decisions made by counsel will not be second-guessed on post-conviction relief, unless made upon the basis of inadequate preparation, ignorance of relevant law, or other shortcomings capable of objective evaluation.\u201d <em>Id.; see also State v. Payne, </em>146 Idaho 548, 561, 199 P.3d 123, 136 (2008); <em>Porter, </em>130 Idaho at 793, 948 P.2d at 148; <em>Milton, </em>126 Idaho at 641, 888 P.2d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">i. Trial counsel\u2019s questioning and failure to move to strike jurors during voir dire did not constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Dunlap argues that trial counsel failed to follow up on \u201cobvious red flags\u201d in statements made by the venire and panel during voir dire, failed to move to strike several jurors, and that this led to the seating of biased jurors. Dunlap asserts that trial counsel failed to ask critical questions related to sentencing and that trial counsel wasted time asking questions which were too general or unrelated to the case. Dunlap also argues that trial counsel failed to move to exclude jurors for cause who should have been ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>eluded and because of trial counsel\u2019s failure biased jurors were seated. Particularly, Dunlap argues there can be no tactical or strategic reason for failing to seek dismissal of a juror who would fail to take into account mitigating circumstances or who was biased in favor of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">We turn first to the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice prong. \u201cAn error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695. Prejudice exists if counsel fails to question a juror during voir dire or move to strike a juror and that juror is found to be biased, because this evinces \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Fields v. Brown, </em>503 F.3d 755, 776 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 697-698). Because Dunlap\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is founded upon a claim that counsel failed to weed out and strike biased jurors, Dunlap must show that those jurors were actually biased against him. <em>See Fields, </em>503 F.3d at 776; <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d 609, 616 (6th Cir.2001) (when the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is founded upon a claim that counsel failed to strike a biased juror, the defendant must show that the juror was actually biased against him); <em>Goeders v. Hundley, </em>59 F.3d 73, 75 (8th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 215, 102 S.Ct. 940, 944-45, 71 L.Ed.2d 78, 84-85 (1981)) (\u201cTo maintain a claim that a biased juror prejudiced him, however, [the defendant] must show that the juror was actually biased against him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Here, because we have concluded that Dunlap has not shown bias on the part of any juror that was seated, Dunlap\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to strike these jurors necessarily fails. There is not a reasonable probability that had trial counsel asked additional questions or moved to strike the seated jurors the result would have been different because the \u201c[r]eplacement of one unbiased juror with another unbiased juror should not alter the outcome.\u201d <em>Fields, </em>503 F.3d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Further, we find trial counsel was not deficient. We examine trial counsel\u2019s performance in voir dire by examining the objective reasonableness of their actions at the time of voir dire. <em>Abdullah, </em>158 Idaho at 525, 348 P.3d at 140. This is because \u201c[flew decisions at trial are as subjective or prone to individual attorney strategy as juror voir dire, where decisions are often made on the basis of intangible factors.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>269 F.3d at 620; <em>see Milton, </em>126 Idaho at 641, 888 P.2d at 815. As such, we acknowledge that trial \u201ccounsel is in the best position to determine whether any potential juror should be questioned and to what extent.\u201d <em>State v. Mundt, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 22, 873 N.E.2d 828, 838 (2007) (quoting <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 516, 747 N.E.2d 765, 794 (2001)); <em>see also Hovey v. Ayers, </em>458 F.3d 892, 910 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Gustave v. United States, </em>627 F.2d 901, 906 (9th Cir.1980) (\u201cThe conduct of voir dire \u2018will in most instances involve the exercise of a judgment which should be left to competent defense counsel.\u2019\u201d)); <em>Bright v. State, </em>292 Ga. 273, 736 S.E.2d 380, 383 (2013). This deference carries over to trial counsel\u2019s decision whether to move to strike a juror. <em>See Abdullah, </em>158 Idaho at 522, 348 P.3d at 137; <em>Miller v. Webb, </em>385 F.3d 666, 673 (6th Cir.2004) (decision to strike a juror is part of trial strategy and is not deficient unless the strategy itself is objectively unreasonable); <em>State v. Adams, </em>156 N.C.App. 318, 576 S.E.2d 377, 382 (2003) (\u201c[T]rial counsel are necessarily given wide latitude in matters involving strategic and tactical decisions such as which jurors to accept or strike.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Dunlap has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s questioning or decision not to move to strike certain jurors for cause was objectively unreasonable. Dunlap\u2019s trial counsel questioned the jurors challenged in this appeal, inquiring into their views regarding capital punishment and frequently delving into the jurors\u2019 perceptions of their ability to view and weigh mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Dunlap presented no evidence that additional questioning would have revealed improper bias on the part of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>juror, nor did he establish that any of the jurors were not qualified to serve. Dunlap has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s choices were the result of inadequate preparation, ignorance of the relevant law, or other shortcomings capable of objective evaluation. Thus, because Dunlap did not demonstrate a basis for claiming ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Dunlap\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for SAPD\u2019s failure to raise this claim on appeal fails. The district court did not err by summarily dismissing this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">ii. Trial counsel\u2019s strategy regarding Juror 263 did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Dunlap argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to rehabilitate and oppose the State\u2019s motion to strike Juror 263. In determining whether trial counsel\u2019s performance in voir dire was deficient, we note that the conduct of trial counsel is entitled to some deference because of trial counsel\u2019s opportunity to observe the prospective jurors as they answer questions. <em>See State v. Lindsey, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 479, 721 N.E.2d 995, 1007 (2000); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>921 So.2d 490, 504 (Fla.2005). Trial counsel is in a much better position to determine if jurors can be rehabilitated and this decision is within the scope of acceptable practice for effective counsel. <em>Abdullah, </em>158 Idaho at 522, 348 P.3d at 137 (citing <em>Lindsey, </em>721 N.E.2d at 1007 (\u201c[C]ounsel\u2019s failure to rehabilitate jurors does not render trial counsel ineffective, as counsel is in a better position to determine whether the jui\u2019ors merited in-depth examination.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">As discussed earlier, Juror 263 indicated that he would not support the death penalty if there was any evidence of any form of mental health problems. This, we conclude, was sufficient to justify removal for cause as Juror 263 indicated that his views would substantially impair his ability to perform his duties as a juror. Although trial counsel may have attempted to rehabilitate Juror 263, trial counsel\u2019s failure to do so must not be viewed through the lens of hindsight. Based on the deference accorded to trial counsel, we are unable to conclude that trial counsel\u2019s choice not to resist the State\u2019s motion to excuse Juror 263 was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Further, Dunlap is unable to show he was prejudiced by Juror 263\u2019s absence from the jury. While Dunlap argues that empaneled jurors were biased against him, as previously discussed, we find no basis for this claim. Although Juror 263 was removed, he was replaced by an additional impartial juror. <em>See Fields, </em>503 F.3d at 776; <em>Keith v. Mitchell, </em>455 F.3d 662, 677-78 (6th Cir.2006); <em>Pennsylvania v. Wright, </em>599 Pa. 270, 961 A.2d 119, 150 (2008). Consequently, there was no prejudice to Dunlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Because trial counsel was not ineffective, Dunlap\u2019s claim that appellate counsel was ineffective necessarily fails. The district court\u2019s summary dismissal of this claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">d. Preliminary Instruction P-3</p>\n<p id=\"ABH\">Dunlap\u2019s final claim of error relates to Preliminary Jury Instruction P-3 (P.I. 3). P.I. 3 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">Because your verdict could lead to imposition of the death penalty, your attitude toward the death penalty is a proper subject of inquiry by the court and the attorney. <em>The fact that you may have reservar tions about, or conscientious or religious objections to, capital punishment does not automatically disqualify you as a juror in a capital case. Of primary importance is whether you can subordinate your personal philosophy to your duty to abide by your oath as a jury and follow the law I give to you. </em>If you are willing to render a verdict that speaks the truth as you find it to exist, even though such verdict may lead to the imposition of the death penalty, you are qualified to serve as a juror in this case. <em>If, however, you possess such strong opinions regarding capital punishment, no matter what those opinions may be, that you would be prevented from or substantially impaired in the performance of your duties as a juror, you are not qualified to serve as a juror.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">It is up to each one of you, using the standard described, to search your conscience to determine whether you are in a position to follow the law as I give it to you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>and render a verdict as the evidence warrants. Only by your candor can either the accused or the State of Idaho be assured of having this extremely serious case resolved by a fair and impartial jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">At trial, Dunlap did not object to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Dunlap argues that SAPD should have claimed on appeal that P.I. 3 violated his due process rights. Dunlap argues that P.I. 3 over-emphasized the need to exclude jurors who were inclined to render a life sentence without imposing the same requirement on jurors who were inclined to render a death sentence, and as such, is a violation of the rule announced in <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968). Dunlap asserts that this resulted in jurors who were substantially impaired deciding his ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Because Dunlap did not object to this instruction below, had SAPD raised this issue on direct appeal, this Court would have reviewed the argument for fundamental error. <em>State v. Adamcik, </em>152 Idaho 445, 472-73, 272 P.3d 417, 444-45 (2012). Thus, to prevail on appeal (and therefore to show prejudice resulting from the failure to advance this claim on appeal), Dunlap would have had the burden to prove three things: \u201c(1) the alleged error violated an unwaived constitutional right; (2) the alleged error plainly exists and (3) the alleged error was not harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Perry, </em>150 Idaho 209, 224, 245 P.3d 961, 976 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s jury instructions <em>de novo </em>to determine \u2018whether, when considered as a whole, they fairly and adequately present the issues and state the applicable law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dunlap V, </em>155 Idaho 345, 364, 313 P.3d 1, 20 (2013) (quoting <em>Adamcik, </em>152 Idaho at 472, 272 P.3d at 444). Instructions must not be judged \u201cin artificial isolation, but must be considered in the context of the instructions as a whole....\u201d <em>Adamcik, </em>152 Idaho at 472, 272 P.3d at 444. (quoting <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 482, 116 L.Ed.2d 385, 398-399 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Dunlap argues that this instruction does not adequately represent the applicable law regarding removal of jurors based on the juror\u2019s scruples against capital punishment under <em>Morgan </em>and <em>Witherspoon. Wither-spoon </em>provides that a death sentence cannot be carried out if the jury was chosen \u201cby excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d <em>Witherspoon, </em>391 U.S. at 522, 88 S.Ct. at 1777, 20 L.Ed.2d at 784-785; <em>see Wainrwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985). Thus, the statement in the instruction that the fact that a juror \u201cmay have reservations about, or conscientious or religious objections to, capital punishment does not automatically disqualify you as a juror\u201d is consistent with <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Dunlap argues, however, that the instruction is one sided because it does not indicate that those who are biased <em>toward </em>the imposition of the death penalty must also \u201csubordinate\u201d their personal philosophy. It is true that the focus is on those who may have objections to capital punishment and not those who may overtly favor its use. Yet, in this case, P.I. 3 goes on to say: \u201cIf, however, you possess such strong opinions regarding capital punishment, <em>no matter what those opinions may be, </em>that you would be prevented from or substantially impaired in the performance of your duties as a juror, you are not qualified to serve as a juror.\u201d This is an accurate statement of the law: \u201ca criminal defendant has the right to an impartial jury drawn from a venire that has not been tilted in favor of capital punishment.\u201d <em>Uttecht v. Brown, </em>551 U.S. 1, 9, 127 S.Ct. 2218, 2224, 167 L.Ed.2d 1014, 1021-1022 (2007). Further, \u201cthe State has a strong interest in having jurors who are able to apply capital punishment within the framework state law prescribes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201ca juror who is substantially impaired in his or her ability to impose the death penalty under the state-law framework can be excused for cause; but if the juror is not substantially impaired, removal for cause is impermissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, read as a whole, P.I. 3 properly indicates that regardless of the juror\u2019s opinions, should those opinions prevent or substantially impair their performance, an individual is not qualified to serve as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Because Dunlap\u2019s challenge to P.I. 3 fails on its merits, Dunlap has failed to show that SAPD provided ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to raise this claim on appeal. The district court properly granted the State\u2019s motion for summary dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We conclude that the district court properly dismissed all of Dunlap\u2019s substantive post-conviction claims because the requirements of Idaho Code section 19-2719 were not met. We also conclude that the district court properly granted summary dismissal as to each of Dunlap\u2019s claims for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dunlap\u2019s Successive Petition for Post-Conviction Relief. Costs to Respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-6\">Chief Justice J. JONES and Justices EISMANN, BURDICK and W. JONES concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\">. The district court concluded that the earliest possible time that Dunlap could have known of his claims for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was upon the filing of his first brief on March 22, 2011. The district court found that Dunlap\u2019s initial version of his Successive Petition was timely filed on April 7,2011. We agree with the analysis. <em>See Paz v. State, </em>123 Idaho 758, 760, 852 P.2d 1355, 1357 (1993) (the basis of claims for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are known at the time the brief is filed).We note, however, the amendment of Idaho Code section 19-2719, which permits additional time to file claims for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. 2015 Idaho Sess. L. ch. 245, \u00a7 1, p. 1040. As amended, Idaho Code section 19-2719(3) now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-16\">Within forty-two (42) days of the filing of the judgment imposing the punishment of death, and before the death warrant is filed, the defendant must file any legal or factual challenge to the sentence or conviction that is known or reasonably should be known. <em>The defendant must file any claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel within forty-two (42) days of the Idaho supreme court issuing the final remittitur in the unified appeal from which no further proceedings except issuance of a death warrant are ordered.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">. The State cites to <em>United States v. Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 395 (10th Cir.1995), for the proposition that the issue not raised must be a \"dead bang winner\u201d that was \"obvious from the trial record\" in order to find ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. In 2001, the Tenth Circuit disavowed the use of the language \"dead bang winner\u201d to the extent it implies \u201crequiring a showing more onerous than a reasonable probability that the omitted claim would have resulted in a reversal on appeal.\u201d <em>Neill v. Gibson, </em>278 F.3d 1044, 1057 n. 5 (10th Cir.2001). We decline to adopt the elevated standard advanced by the State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">. Even if we were to hold otherwise and conclude that J.I. 11 fell short of constitutional standards, the error would be harmless. In Idaho, the jury must weigh <em>all </em>mitigating circumstances together against <em>each </em>aggravating circumstance individually. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hairston, </em>133 Idaho 496, 510, 988 P.2d 1170, 1184 (1999).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">When such an analysis is followed, <em>the invalidation of one or more of the aggravating circumstances has no effect on the validity of the sentence </em>imposed; the [jury] has already determined that any one of the aggravating circumstances standing alone outweighs all the mitigating circumstances, thus justifying the death sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\"><em>Id. </em>At resentencing the jury found that the State had proven three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt: utter disregard, specific intent, and propensity. In Dunlap's Consolidated Resentencing Appeal, he challenged the propriety of both the utter disregard and specific intent aggravator. Although this Court concluded the jury instructions for the specific intent aggravator were erroneous, we found that the utter disregard aggravator was not unconstitutionally vague. <em>Dunlap V, </em>155 Idaho at 377, 313 P.3d at 33. We affirmed the jury\u2019s determination that the State proved the utter disregard aggravator beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 365, 313 P.3d at 21. Dunlap does not challenge the utter disregard aggravator in the current appeal. Thus, even had SAPD raised the issue of J.I. 11, and even if this Court had determined that the propensity aggravator was unconstitutional, it would have no effect on the validity of the sentence imposed because the sentence of death would be valid based solely on the utter disregard aggravator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">. We note that <em>Schriro </em>concluded that the change announced in <em>Ring </em>was procedural, not substantive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\"><em>Ring\u2019s </em>holding is properly classified as procedural. <em>Ring </em>held that \"a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, [may not] find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty.\u201d 536 U.S. at 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428 [2443, 153 L.Ed.2d at 576-577], Rather, \"the Sixth Amendment requires that [those circumstances] be found by a jury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This holding did not alter the range of conduct Arizona law subjected to the death penalty. It could not have; it rested entirely on the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury-trial guarantee, a provision that has nothing to do with the range of conduct a State may criminalize. Instead, <em>Ring </em>altered the range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendant\u2019s conduct is punishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than a judge find the essential facts bearing on punishment. Rules that allocate decision making authority in this fashion are prototypical procedural rules, a conclusion we have reached in numerous other contexts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">542 U.S. at 353, 124 S.Ct. at 2523, 159 L.Ed.2d at 449 (alteration in original). In <em>Rhoades v. State, </em>149 Idaho 130, 140, 233 P.3d 61, 71 (2010) we also concluded \"that <em>Ring </em>announced a new procedural rather than substantive rule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\">. Although not a basis for our decision, we note that SAPD\u2019s failure to raise this claim was not objectively unreasonable. SAPD did challenge J.I. 14 in the appeal from Dunlap\u2019s resentencing. SAPD argued that the term \u201csufficiently compelling\" in J.I. 14 was vague and ambiguous. SAPD asserted that without a limiting definition, \"sufficiently compelling\u201d left the jury without a clear indication of the quantum of evidence required to make a death sentence unjust. This Court disagreed, and determined in <em>Dunlap V </em>that it was unnecessary to define the phrase because it was comprised of ordinary words that did not require a definition. 155 Idaho at 365, 313 P.3d at 21. To show deficient performance, Dunlap must overcome the strong presumption that appellate counsel was competent, diligent, and made significant decisions using reasonable professional judgment. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-694 (1984); <em>Booth v. State, </em>151 Idaho 612, 618, 262 P.3d 255, 261 (2011). Considering one of the widely recognized hallmarks of effective appellate advocacy is weeding out issues on appeal, the fact that SAPD raised an issue directly related to the language of J.I. 14 in the direct appeal suggests SAPD made a tactical and strategic decision as to how to attack this particular instruction. Selection of a different avenue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>attack on J.I. 14 is consistent with the exercise of appellate counsel\u2019s reasonable professional judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b343-11\">.

In earlier proceedings, the transcript indicated \"uh-huh\u201d as affirmative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. Although we decide this claim solely on the prejudice prong, this is another instance where a showing of deficient performance is utterly lacking. To overcome the presumption that appellate counsel was competent and diligent, Dunlap had the burden of showing that SAPD failed to act reasonably by failing to raise this issue on appeal and that the decision was based on inadequate preparation, ignorance of the law, or other shortcomings capable of objective review. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-694 (1984); <em>Booth v. State, </em>151 Idaho 612, 618, 262 P.3d 255, 261 (2011). SAPD raised this precise issue in Dunlap\u2019s 2008 Petition and briefed it thoroughly. The district court found no error, and SAPD did not raise the issue on its direct appeal to this Court. Considering one of the widely recognized hallmarks of effective appellate advocacy is weeding out issues on appeal, the fact that SAPD raised this issue in the 2008 Petition but chose not to raise it on appeal, and Dunlap failed to overcome the presumption that SAPD acted reasonably. <em>See Miller v.
