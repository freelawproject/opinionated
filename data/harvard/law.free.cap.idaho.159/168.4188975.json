The district court ruled that Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute, Idaho Code section 36-1604, provided limited liability protection because the City did not receive \u201ccompensation\u201d or \u201ccharge\u201d for the use of the land upon which Hayes was injured. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">On September 17, 2011, Martin Hayes (Hayes)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was seriously injured after stumbling on uneven ground hidden by grass while attending his grandson\u2019s Pop Warner football game at the Plummer School Park (Park), which is owned by the City of Plummer (City). Hayes did not pay any fee or admission to enter the Park.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hayes filed a premises liability claim against the City for his injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In turn, the City filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis that the City was entitled to a limit on liability under Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">On October 13, 1976, the Western Benewah School District (School District) conveyed the Park to the City in fee simple for consideration of ten dollars. The Park was deeded shortly after both parties entered into a formal agreement to \u201cdevelop outdoor recreational facilities for general public outdoor recreation use\u201d as outlined in the parties\u2019 Joint Service Agreement (JSA). Both parties assume as fact that School Park was transferred to the City in 1976 for the sole purpose of obtaining a federal grant for improvements, which were not available if the School District continued to own it. As a result of this transaction, the City was able to obtain a federal grant from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to make general improvements to the park for public use and enjoyment. Pursuant to the JSA, the City agreed to construct joint facilities in the park for public use in conjunction with school activities,, and the School District agreed to maintain the facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-18\">Although the School District pays for all maintenance, water, and electric utilities; has made significant improvements to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>facilities; maintains property insurance for those improvements; and controls the scheduling for organized events, the Park is generally open to the public at no expense. For this reason, the district court ruled that Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute, Idaho Code section 36-1604, provided the City of Plummer with immunity because the City did not receive \u2018compensation\u2019 or \u2018charge\u2019 for use of the land upon which Hayes was injured. Hayes filed a timely notice of appeal on April 22, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">This Court reviews a ruling on summary judgment under the same standard as the trial court. <em>Grade, LLC v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>149 Idaho 570, 572, 237 P.3d 1196, 1198 (2010). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c). Disputed facts \u201cshould be construed in favor of the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d Ca<em>storena v. Gen. Elec., </em>149 Idaho 609, 613, 238 P.3d 209, 213 (2010). The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that the Supreme Court reviews de novo. <em>State v. Schulz, </em>151 Idaho 863, 865, 264 P.3d 970, 972 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Hayes\u2019s appeal ultimately hinges on whether the School District\u2019s payment of utilities and property insurance, maintenance, improvements to the facilities, and control of the Park\u2019s activities schedule constitutes \u201ccompensation\u201d that the City \u201ccharged\u201d to the School District in exchange for the use of the Park. Hayes also contends that an issue of fact exists as to whether Hayes entered the Park under the scope of the School District\u2019s \u201cpermission and use.\u201d However, no legal authority is cited to support the second argument, nor does any authority suggest that a third party organizing and scheduling events on public land would cause a landowner to forfeit immunity under the Recreational Use Statute. When issues presented on appeal are not \u201csupported by propositions of law, citation to legal authority, or argument they will not be considered by this Court.\u201d <em>Lebow v. Commercial Tire, Inc., </em>157 Idaho 379, 384, 336 P.3d 786, 791 (2014). As such, we shall limit our analysis to the dispositive issue of whether the City received compensation for use of the Park for this activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The School District\u2019s payment of all utilities, ongoing maintenance, and scheduling of the Plummer School Park is not a \u201ccharge\u201d or \u201ccompensation\u201d under Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute was intended to encourage landowners to make land \u201cavailable to the public without charge for recreational purposes.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 36-1604(a). A \u201clandowner\u201d who provides property for public recreational use is afforded a limitation of liability and \u201cowes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry by others for recreational purposes, or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on such premises to persons entering for such purposes.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 36-1604(c). The owner assumes no liability if any person is invited or permitted to use the property for recreational purposes \u201cwithout charge.\u201d <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 36-1604(d). A landowner\u2019s limitation of liability is not extended \u201cto any person or persons who for compensation permit the land to be used for recreational purposes.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 36-1604(g)(3). Neither the term \u201ccharge\u201d as twice used in the statute, nor the term \u201ccompensation\u201d as used in the exception clause, are defined. Thus, the scope of Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute is a matter of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The objective of statutory interpretation is to \u201cderive the intent of the legislative body that adopted the act.\u201d <em>Farber v. Idaho State Ins. Fund, </em>147 Idaho 307, 310, 208 P.3d 289, 292 (2009). Statutory interpretation \u201cbegins with the literal language of the statute\u201d and \u201cprovisions should not be read in isolation, but must be interpreted in the context of the entire document.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Words should be given their \u201cplain, usual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>and ordinary meanings\u201d and only if the language is \u201cambiguous\u201d may this court \u201cconsider rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCharge\u201d is ordinarily defined as \u201cto demand a fee; to bill.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>282 (10th ed.2014). \u201cCompensation\u201d is defined as \u201cremuneration and other benefits received <em>in return for services rendered.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>342-43 (10th ed.2014) (emphasis added). As plainly read in the context of the statute, the statutory language unambiguously demonstrates that the terms \u201ccharge\u201d and \u201ccompensation\u201d only reflect payment for direct use or admission to the property. Consistent with such an interpretation, persuasive authority has only applied the compensation exception in instances where a landowner received monetary payment specifically for the public\u2019s entrance or enjoyment of a recreational area.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">First, this court applied the compensation exception to Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute where plaintiffs paid a vehicle entry fee to park their car in an Idaho state park. <em>Allen v. State ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Parks and Recreation, </em>136 Idaho 487, 488, 36 P.3d 1275, 1276 (2001). In <em>Allen, </em>the injured plaintiff was impaled on a submerged fence post while fishing in the state park and subsequently filed a premises liability claim against the state. <em>Id. </em>This Court reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claim and applied the compensation exception on the basis that the fee was levied against the public for its use of the property. <em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 36 P.3d at 1276-77. Unlike <em>Allen, </em>it is undisputed that Hayes entered the Park at no expense whatsoever. No assertion has ever been made that either the School District or the City benefited by Hayes\u2019s access to the Park in any way. Although <em>Allen </em>is the only binding Idaho ease on point for the current issue, a number of federal decisions also provide guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The most comparable case outside our jurisdiction comes from the United States District Court for the District of Idaho, which held that a state snowmobile registration fee did not erode a county\u2019s immunity under Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute. <em>Albertson v. Fremont Cnty., Idaho, </em>834 F.Supp.2d 1117, 1131 (D.Idaho 2011). In <em>Albertson, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent was killed while snowmobiling in the Caribou-Targee National Forest. <em>Id. </em>at 1132. The plaintiffs argued Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute did not shield the county from liability due to a registration fee all snowmobile owners are required by law to pay under Idaho Code section 67-7102. <em>Id. </em>at 1130. Evidence demonstrated that a portion of the State\u2019s registration fee was used to fund maintenance of the Caribou-Targee National Forest trails. <em>Id. </em>at 1131. Through the program, the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent designated eighty-five percent of his registration fee to go specifically to the Fremont County parks program. <em>Id. </em>Although the plaintiff paid a fee to the state, and a large percentage of that fee was directly used for the upkeep of the recreation area, the court held that the compensation exception did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 1132. Applying <em>Allen, </em>the court reasoned, \u201cThe fact that a portion of the fee charged may have been intended by the State for the upkeep of the Park, its roads, or the parking lot, is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1131. The determining factor for the <em>Albertson </em>court was that the state park was open and freely accessible to the general public. <em>See id. </em>The <em>Albertson </em>court also narrowly defined \u201ccharge\u201d as \u201cconsideration given in return for the express and direct privilege of being allowed to utilize the property, in money or other thing of value.\u201d <em>Albertson, </em>834 F.Supp.2d at 1131 (quoting <em>Corey v. State, </em>Case No. 57158, First Dist., Kootenai County, Mem. Op., May 23, 1984).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Hayes relies upon a Ninth Circuit decision applying the \u201cconsideration\u201d exception of Nevada\u2019s Recreational Use Statute<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>his argument. <em>Ducey v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 504, 507 (9th Cir.1983). In <em>Ducey, </em>the plaintiffs were killed in a flash flood while camping and boating on the Colorado River, operated by the National Park Service. <em>Id. </em>No entry or admission fees were paid, but all three plaintiffs paid \u201cmoney for store purchases, moorage fees, and trailer space rental fees\u201d to a concessioner, which ultimately shared 1.75 percent of its profits with the United States government. <em>Id. </em>at 509. Although no direct admission was paid, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision was predicated on the fact that the concessioner\u2019s fees for trailer space and boat slips amounted to charging the public \u201cin return for permission to recreate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514. Unlike <em>Ducey, </em>there is no suggestion that the City benefited by Hayes\u2019s use or admission into the Park, directly or indirectly. In fact, no fee was levied for admission or use of the Park whatsoever, and all members of the public could recreate free of charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Hayes also cites to <em>Twohig v. United States, </em>711 F.Supp. 560, 563 (D.Mont.1989) as evidence that Hayes\u2019s free admission into the Park is irrelevant. In <em>Twohig, </em>the United States District Court for the District of Montana applied Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute and held that because a ski area charged for passes, the recreational area was receiving \u201ceconomic benefits\u201d from the general public\u2019s use. <em>Id. </em>Even though the individual plaintiff entered for free using a friend\u2019s pass, the court held that the compensation did not need to be paid directly by the plaintiff, but only that the owner received \u201ctangible economic benefit\u201d from permitting the user access to the land. <em>Id. </em>Although the plaintiff himself did not pay for the pass, the landowner in <em>Twohig </em>received direct economic benefit from the plaintiffs admission and use through the paid pass and therefore was not protected by Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute. <em>Id. </em>at 564. The facts being inapposite in the present matter, <em>Twohig </em>does not support Hayes\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The present issue is unique from the standpoint that the City benefits from the School District\u2019s services, yet the Park remains open and free to the general public. Notably, subsection (e) of Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute contemplates that land owners may enter into leases or other arrangements within the protection of the statute. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 36-1604(e). Under subsection (e), a private entity may lease land to the state, presumably for compensation or profit, yet immunity may be extended so long as the land is leased \u201cfor recreational purposes\u201d and no charge is levied against the public for access or use of the land. <em>Id. </em>By analogy, land leased from a public landowner to a private entity for public recreational purposes would also fall under the protection of the statute. The arrangement between the City and the School District, although unusual, is not unlike a land-lease agreement expressly contemplated by Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute. The JSA between the City and the School District specifically articulates that the arrangement is intended to better allocate resources for the \u201cmutual best interest\u201d of developing \u201coutdoor recreational facilities for general public outdoor recreation use.... \u201d Although Hayes is correct in recognizing the JSA reflects the City and the School District\u2019s \u201cjoint operation and use of the facilities,\u201d he is incorrect regarding the assertion that as a matter of law \u201cthe Recreational Use Statute does not depend upon the general character of the property____\u201d Rather, the character of the property as a gratuitously accessible public recreational space is dispositive when determining whether the compensation exception to Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The intent and purpose of Idaho\u2019s Recreational Use Statute is to provide recreational access at no cost to the general public. I.C. \u00a7 36-1604(a). In this case, the City and the School District have done that by allocating resources in order to provide and maintain the Park for all to enjoy. Because the City did not charge or receive compensation from Hayes or the public for their use and enjoyment of the land, Idaho Code section 36-1604 provides a limitation on liability for Hayes\u2019s injuries. The district court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">For the reasons stated above, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>judgment. Costs on appeal are awarded to respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-4\">Chief Justice J. JONES and Justices EISMANN, W. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-12\">. Although we recognize that the appeal has been filed by both Martin and Lynn Hayes, both parties in briefing and in oral arguments refer to only Martin in the singular. Because Martin\u2019s injuries are the central issue in this appeal, we shall follow suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-13\">. The Pop Warner program is annually organized and supported by the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and the Plummer community. The program has no affiliation to the School District or the City, although the program did reserve the field through the School District\u2019s scheduling form. It is undisputed that the Pop Warner program used the fields at no expense to the program, the players, or those in attendance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b207-20\">.Defendants Worley School District # 44 and Accelerated Construction and Excavation, LLC were also listed in the original claim, but were dismissed from this action by stipulation and are not part of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\">.
