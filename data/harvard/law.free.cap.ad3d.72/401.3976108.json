As an alternative holding, we also reject it on the merits. The sentencing court conducted a sufficient inquiry and properly concluded that two violations of the plea agreement occurred, namely that defendant failed to appear in court for the scheduled sentencing and that he failed to cooperate with the Department of Probation. The court \u201cprovided defendant with a reasonable opportunity to present his explanations for the violation[s]\u201d and properly rejected them <em>(People v Villanueva, </em>65 AD3d 939 [2009], <em>lv denied </em>13 NY3d 863 [2009]).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">We do not agree with defendant\u2019s contention that no increase in the promised sentence was warranted even if he did violate one or both conditions. Moreover, the increase the court determined to impose, although not insubstantial, was not so severe as to constitute an abuse of discretion. We perceive no other basis for reducing the sentence. However, as the People <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>concede, the surcharge and crime victim assistance fee should have been based on the statute in effect at the time of the crime.
