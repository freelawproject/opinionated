The issues raised on the appeal from the order are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the judgment <em>(see </em>CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Pursuant to CPLR 4404 (a), the trial court \u201cmay set aside a verdict . . . and direct that judgment be entered in favor of a party entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d A court may set aside a jury verdict as unsupported by legally sufficient evidence only if there is \u201c \u2018simply no valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences which could possibly lead rational [individuals] to the conclusion reached by the jury on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>of the evidence presented at trial\u2019 \u201d <em>(Soto v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>6 NY3d 487, 492 [2006], quoting <em>Cohen v Hallmark Cards, </em>45 NY2d 493, 499 [1978]). In considering such a motion, \u201c \u2018the trial court must afford the party opposing the motion every inference which may properly be drawn from the facts presented, and the facts must be considered in a light most favorable to the nonmovant\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hand v Field, </em>15 AD3d 542, 543 [2005], quoting <em>Szczerbiak v Pilat, </em>90 NY2d 553, 556 [1997]).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Contrary to the plaintiffs contention, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to him, there was no valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences which could possibly have led rational individuals to conclude, based upon the evidence presented, that the defendants were liable. In sum, the plaintiffs version of the events was \u201cmanifestly untrue, physically impossible, or contrary to common experience, and such testimony should be disregarded as being without evidentiary value\u201d <em>(Cruz v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>31 AD3d 688, 690 [2006], <em>affd </em>8 NY3d 825 [2007]). We note that the record is replete with instances where the testimony and other evidence adduced by the plaintiff was manifestly untrue and tailored to avoid the consequences of previous statements made by him to disinterested nonparty witnesses. Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion pursuant to CPLR 4404 (a) which was to set aside the verdict and for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In light of our determination, the parties\u2019 remaining contentions are academic.
