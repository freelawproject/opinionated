As relevant to this appeal, in the third through seventh causes of action, the plaintiffs asserted against Powell Road Mobile Home Park, Inc. (hereinafter Powell), a cause of action to recover punitive damages, a cause of action alleging a violation of New York State Navigation Law \u00a731, which requires a permit before excavating or placing fill in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>the navigable waters of the State, and causes of action alleging negligence, nuisance, and trespass, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">After successfully obtaining the dismissal of the first and second causes of action insofar as asserted against it, and after joinder of issue, Powell moved, in effect, for summary judgment dismissing the third through seventh causes of action insofar as asserted against it, or to preclude any party to the action from introducing a certain document at trial. The Supreme Court granted that branch of Powell\u2019s motion which was, in effect, for summary judgment dismissing the third through seventh causes of action insofar as asserted against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The Supreme Court properly determined that Powell was entitled to summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 fourth cause of action to recover punitive damages insofar as asserted against it, since <em>\u201ca </em>demand for punitive damages may not constitute a separate cause of action for pleading purposes\u201d (Rosen<em>blum v Frankl, </em>57 AD3d 960, 961 [2008]). However, contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s determination, Powell did not establish its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing the third and fifth through seventh causes of action insofar as asserted against it, alleging a violation of Navigation Law \u00a7 31, negligence, private nuisance, and trespass, respectively, since Powell failed to tender sufficient evidence to eliminate any material issues of fact from the case as to whether the flood wall is not a proximate or substantial cause of the flooding of the plaintiffs\u2019 property <em>(see generally DiDomenico v Long Beach Plaza Corp., </em>60 AD3d 618, 619-620 [2009]). Thus, those branches of Powell\u2019s motion which were for summary judgment dismissing the third and fifth through seventh causes of action insofar as asserted against it should have been denied, regardless of the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 opposing papers <em>(see Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., </em>68 NY2d 320, 324 [1986]; <em>Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr., </em>64 NY2d 851, 853 [1985]; <em>Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557, 562 [1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">We decline the plaintiffs\u2019 request to search the record and award them summary judgment on the issue of Powell\u2019s liability with respect to the third and fifth through seventh causes of action insofar as asserted against Powell, since the subject of Powell\u2019s motion before the Supreme Court was limited to the issue of causation <em>(see Dunham v Hilco Constr. Co., </em>89 NY2d 425, 429-430 [1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">In light of our determination, we must remit the matter to the Supreme Court, Dutchess County, for a determination on the merits of that branch of Powell\u2019s motion which was to preclude any party to the action from introducing a certain doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>ument at trial <em>(see generally Ryba v Almeida, </em>44 AD3d 740, 741 [2007]).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\">Finally, we decline Powell\u2019s request for an award of costs or to impose sanctions upon the plaintiffs <em>(see </em>22 NYCRR 130-1.1). Rivera, J.P., Florio, Miller and Eng, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
