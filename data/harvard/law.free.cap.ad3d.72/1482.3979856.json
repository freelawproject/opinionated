Renzi, J.), rendered November 15, 2006. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of course of sexual conduct against a child in the first degree and endangering the welfare of a child (two counts).</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-9\">It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-10\">Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon a jury verdict of course of sexual conduct against a child in the first degree (Fenal Law \u00a7 130.75 [1] [a]) and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child (\u00a7 260.10 [1]). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>reject the contention of defendant that County Court erred in denying his request to represent himself. \u201cThe request to represent oneself must be invoked clearly and unequivocally\u201d <em>(People v LaValle, </em>3 NY3d 88, 106 [2004]; <em>see People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d 10, 17 [1974]). Here, however, the sole request by defendant to represent himself was equivocal because he made that request \u201cas a way of obtaining the dismissal of . . . assigned counsel. [Indeed,] defendant\u2019s . . . request[ ] to proceed pro se [was] made in the alternative [inasmuch as] he sought to represent himself only because [the c]ourt refused to replace ... assigned counsel!,] who had displeased him\u201d <em>(People v Gillian, </em>8 NY3d 85, 88 [2006]). Consequently, viewing defendant\u2019s request in its immediate context and in light of the record before us, we cannot conclude that defendant made an unequivocal request to proceed pro se <em>(see id.; LaValle, </em>3 NY3d at 106). Present\u2014Smith, J.P., Carni, Pine and Gorski, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
