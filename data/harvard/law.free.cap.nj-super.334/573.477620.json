The order declares that \u201clate fees, attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs as set forth in Defendant\u2019s lease with the [Authority] are deemed valid in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>summary dispossession action\u201d and grants judgment of possession to the Authority as of a certain date in the event that defendant had not, by that date, made payment to the Authority of not only the back rent of $972, but also a late fee of $20 plus attorneys\u2019 fees and court cost of $144.50. Defendant had previously deposited the back rent. Although there is nothing in the rather sparse record before us to show whether she paid the additional fees and costs totalling $164.50 so as to ward off the entry of the judgment of possession and issuance of a warrant of removal, we are informed by counsel that that money was deposited with the clerk of the court. Should we affirm the trial judge, the additional $164.50 will be turned over to the Authority; should we reverse, it will be returned to defendant. In either event, defendant will remain a tenant of the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">This appeal then involves the Authority\u2019s entitlement to the disputed late fees, attorneys\u2019 fees, and court costs in the context of the circumstances before us. To crystallize exactly what the issue is, several concessions by defendant must be noted. Defendant does not dispute or raise any issue as to the existence and validity of the governing lease provisions which provide for late fees, attorneys\u2019 fees, and court costs in the event of a nonpayment of rent and a summary dispossess action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither does defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>contend that these lease charges are prohibited by the governing federal public housing law. But it is defendant\u2019s position that payment thereof cannot, by virtue of federal law, be made a condition of the dismissal of a summary dispossess action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In a nonpayment of rent summary dispossess action, it is well recognized under our state law that if the tenant \u201cbefore entry of final judgment, pay[s] to the clerk of the court the rent claimed to be in default, together with the accrued costs of the proceedings, all proceedings shall be stopped[,]\u201d and the complaint dismissed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-55; <em>Housing Auth. of City of Wildwood v. Hayward, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>311, 316, 406 A.2d 1318 (1979). Even where the tenant is a public housing tenant, such accrued costs can include attorneys\u2019 fees and costs where so provided by lease. <em>University Court v. Mahasin, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 553-54, 400 A.2d 133 (App.Div.1979); <em>Trenton Hous. Auth. v. Green, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>544, 545-46, 289 A.2d 264 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>159, 293 A.2d 389 (1972). <em>See also Community Realty Management, Inc. v. Harris, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>212, 233-34, 714 A.2d 282 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Plaintiff, as a federally funded public housing authority, is subject to the applicable federal law and regulations. As we have said, defendant does not contend that the lease provisions for late fees, attorneys\u2019 fees, and court costs are prohibited by or are inconsistent with that federal law. Indeed, the federal law recognizes that such lease provisions are permissible. <em>See </em>24 <em>C.F.R. </em>966.4(b)(3) (\u201cLate payment penalties. At the option of the [public housing authority], the lease may provide for payment of penalties for late payment.\u201d); 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>966.6(h) (prohibiting lease provisions that require the tenant to pay attorneys\u2019 fees or other legal costs arising from a legal action brought by the public housing authority even when the tenant prevails, but stating that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u201c[p]rohibition of this type of provision does not mean that the tenant as a party to the lawsuit may not be obligated to pay attorneys\u2019 fees or other costs if he loses the suit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Nonetheless, it is defendant\u2019s contention that, in a nonpayment of rent dispossess action, conditioning a public housing tenant\u2019s legal right to avoid a judgment of possession upon not only payment of accrued back rent but the additional fees and costs that may have accrued by virtue of the governing lease provisions is violative of 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1437a(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">[A] family shall pay as rent ... the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">(A) 30 per centum of the family\u2019s monthly adjusted income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">(B) 10 per centum of the family\u2019s monthly income; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">(C) if the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the family\u2019s actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the family's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">[42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1437a(a)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">As applicable to defendant\u2019s lease, \u201ctenant rent\u201d is defined in pertinent part as \u201c[t]he amount payable monthly by the family as rent to the PHA or [section 8] owner, as applicable....\u201d 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>5.603.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 5.613 (defining \u201ctotal tenant payment\u201d as \u201cthe amount calculated under [42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1437a(a)(l) ]\u201d and, in subsection (a)(2), exempting from \u201ctotal tenant payment\u201d for public housing tenants \u201ccharges for excess utility consumption or other miscellaneous charges....\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The late fees, attorneys\u2019 fees, and court cost at issue here are not defendant\u2019s \u201ctotal monthly rent\u201d governed by the federal law. They are, rather, additional costs incurred by the tenant as a result of failing to pay the rent when due and/or prior to the filing of a summary dispossess action. There is nothing in the federal law that prohibits these additional assessments where they are otherwise authorized by state law and lease provisions. More to the point, there is nothing in the federal law relied upon by defendant that addresses the precise issue here, that is whether such otherwise legally incurred fees and costs can be made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>condition of the tenant\u2019s payment obligations under state law so as to avoid entry of a judgment of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Although dealing with a section 8 federal housing program and, therefore, different regulatory provisions, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Community Realty Management, Inc. v. Harris, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>212, 714 A.2d 282, is instructive. In <em>Community Realty, </em>the court concluded that attorneys\u2019 fees sought by the section 8 landlord could not have been made a condition of the tenant\u2019s payment to avoid a judgment of possession. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 714 A.2d 282. But it so concluded because the applicable lease did not provide for such fees, not because of the governing federal law. As we read the court\u2019s decision, it recognized that there was nothing in the federal law that precludes such additional fees as part of the summary dispossess proceedings when provided for by lease. <em>Id. </em>at 233-34, 714 A.2d 282.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We acknowledge that the precise federal statute at issue here, 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1437a(a)(l), was not at issue in <em>Community Realty. </em>But there is nothing significantly different between that statute and the statute applicable to section 8 public subsidized housing owners in the context of defendant\u2019s contention. Both delineate what monthly rent can be charged by, on the one hand, the public housing authority (42 <em>U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>1437a(a)(l)), and on the other hand, the section 8 owner (42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1437f(c)). It is this delineation that defendant claims precludes the additional fees and costs as part of the tenant\u2019s obligation to pay to avoid judgment of possession. As we have said, we disagree with this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Miles v. Metropolitan Dade County, </em>916 F.2d 1528 (11th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>898, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>273, 116 L.Ed.2d 225 (1991), is misplaced. There, plaintiff was a tenant in a public housing project owned by defendant. She had received an eviction complaint that turned out to be meritless. The housing authority voluntarily dismissed the action. No costs were assessed by the court. But in plaintiffs next rent statement, she was assessed $41.50, the amount of the filing fee for the defendant\u2019s meritless complaint. When she complained, she was told that it was the housing authority\u2019s policy to assess tenants for eviction proceeding court, costs regardless of the merits or results thereof. Plaintiff brought a 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983 action seeking a declaration that this policy was violative of 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1437a(a)(l) and its implementing regulations. The court concluded that court costs for an eviction action could be charged to a tenant where so entered by a court, but that such costs could not automatically be imposed by a housing authority regardless of the outcome of the action. This conclusion was premised upon 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 966.6(h), applicable to public housing tenants, which, as we have previously stated, prohibits, in part, lease provisions obligating a public housing tenant to pay \u201cattorney\u2019s fees or other legal costs whenever the landlord decides to take action against the tenant even though the court determines that the tenant prevails in the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">That is not the situation here. It is not denied that plaintiffs summary dispossess action was meritorious, that is to say, defendant owed the back rent. In this respect, 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 966.6(h) clearly contemplates, under these circumstances, collection of attorneys\u2019 fees and other legal costs where so permitted under state law. We reject defendant\u2019s contention that, because such additional fees are permitted under state law only if provided for by lease and designated as a form of rent obligation, this somehow conflicts with the federal law. The additional costs are not part of a public housing tenant\u2019s \u201cmonthly total rent\u201d that is governed by that law. We are, therefore, convinced that Judge Winkelstein properly required defendant to pay the late fees, attorneys\u2019 fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>and court costs provided for by lease, in addition to the back rent, in order to avoid entry of a judgment of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> In this aspect, the lease provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">(c) Late Charges \u2014 A charge of $20.00 per month for rent, or other charges paid after the 5th calendar day of the month.... The Authority shall provide written notice of the amount of any charge in addition to Tenant Rent, and when the charge is due. Charges in addition to rent are due no sooner than two weeks after Tenant receives the Authority\u2019s written notice of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">(d) Legal Fees \u2014 In the event eviction proceedings are instituted by or on behalf of the Authority for possession of the leased premises due to the tenant's failure to pay rent, utility and maintenance fees, late fees, court costs or any other violation of this lease, the tenant agrees to pay, as additional rent, the reasonable fees charged by the attorney handling the matter, plus court costs. The attorney's fees shall include, but are not limited to, the costs of filing, serving and litigating any notice to cease, notice to quit, complaint for possession, or warrant for removal. Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ney\u2019s fees shall be charged <em>to </em>the tenant only if the Authority prevails or if it is agreed that such fees will be paid in settlement of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-15\"> The definition of \"tenant rent\u201d was recently amended, 65 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>16716 (2000). As amended, 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 5.603 defines \"tenant rent\u201d as \u201c[t]he amount payable monthly by the family as rent to the unit owner (section 8 owner or PHA in public housing)____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b607-17\"> It was agreed by the parties during oral argument that this version of 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 5.613 applies to defendant\u2019s lease. 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 5.613, however, was recently amended, 65 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>16718 (2000), and, in part, recodified as 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 5.628. That <em>section </em>provides:</p>\n<p id=\"Ap0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>(a) Determining total tenant payment (TTP).

The current 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 5.613 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">(a) This section applies to the public housing program and the Section 8 tenant-based assistance program.</p>\n<p id=\"A3S\">(b) The PHA must take best efforts to enter into cooperative agreements with welfare agencies under which such agencies agree:</p>\n<p id=\"ANC\">(1) To target public assistance, benefits and services to families receiving assistance in the public housing program and the Section 8 tenant-based assistance program to achieve self-sufficiency;</p>\n<p id=\"AFN\">(2) To provide written verification to the PHA concerning welfare benefits for families applying for or receiving assistance in these housing assistance programs.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Y\">As currently codified, then, 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 5.613 has no applicability to the issue before us.
