Plaintiff appeals only from the grant of summary judgment to Hazlet and Jacobs. We affirm the grant of summary judgment to Hazlet, but reverse the summary judgment to Jacobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The Jacobs purchased the property on March 1, 1993. Pursuant to a written lease providing for a year-to-year tenancy, the Jacobs rented the property to their adult daughter, who has resided there with her children since March 1993. Under the terms of the lease, the tenant contracted to pay rent equivalent to the Jacobs\u2019 monthly mortgage payment and real estate tax liability. The lease also provided that the Jacobs were responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>all major repairs; the tenant would be responsible for all minor repairs and general maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Deposition testimony revealed that the Jacobs have no intention of deeding the property by gift to their daughter. Should the mortgage be satisfied, the Jacobs intend to retain ownership and allow the property to become a part of the estate of the surviving spouse. The Jacobs also indicated that, should their daughter vacate the property, they would sell the property and retain the net proceeds. It is clear that the Jacobs are accruing equity in this property and could be entitled to depreciation and federal and state income tax deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">On Jacobs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the motion judge concluded that despite the written lease, the monthly rental, and the accrual of equity, that the property was residential and, as such, the owner was under no obligation to maintain the sidewalk abutting the residence. <em>See Yanhko v. Fane, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>528, 362 A.2d 1 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Consistent with prior cases, the <em>Yanhko </em>court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">an abutting owner is not liable for the condition of a sidewalk caused by the action of the elements or by wear and tear incident to public use, but only for the negligent construction or repair of the sidewalk by himself or by a specified predecessor in title or for direct use or obstruction of the sidewalk by the owner in such a manner as to render it unsafe for passersby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">[70 <em>N.J. </em>at 532, 362 A.2d 1 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">On appeal, plaintiff contends that the Jacobs\u2019 property is commercial and thus the rule of commercial owner responsibility for sidewalk maintenance enunciated in <em>Stewart v. 104 Wallace Street, Inc., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>146, 432 A.2d 881 (1981), applies. <em>Stewart </em>held, \u201c[Cjommercial landowners are responsible for maintaining in reasonably good condition the sidewalks abutting their property and are liable to pedestrians injured as a result of their negligent failure to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 432 A.2d 881.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The Supreme Court in <em>Stewart </em>noted that problems would arise in close cases in determining whether a particular parcel of abutting real estate was commercial or residential and cautioned: \u201cAs for the determination of which properties will be covered by the rule we adopt today, commonly accepted definitions of \u2018commercial\u2019 and \u2018residential\u2019 property should apply, with difficult cases to be decided as they arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 432 A.2d 881. In a footnote, the Court added, \u201cFor example, apartment buildings would be \u2018commercial\u2019 properties covered by the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Since <em>Stewart, </em>we extended liability to a non-owner occupied two-family house that was leased to two separate tenants. <em>Hambright v. Yglesias, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 394-95, 491 A.2d 768 (App.Div.1985). <em>Hambright </em>specifically noted that <em>Stewart </em>\u201cmade it clear that it was the nature of the ownership that mattered, not the use to which the property is put.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395, 491 A.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In <em>Brown v. St. Venantius School, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>325, 338, 544 A.2d 842 (1988), the Supreme Court limited the scope of the residential exception set forth in <em>Stewart </em>by holding that a non-profit charitable and religious organization owed a duty to non-beneficiary pedestrians to maintain abutting sidewalks.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In <em>Gilhooly v. Zeta Psi Fraternity, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>201, 207-08, 578 A.2d 1264 (Law Div.1990), the court held that a fraternity house-was liable for its sidewalk under <em>Stewart </em>because it was used not only as a residence for forty-two college students, but also as a social club for members, including members and alumni who did not reside therein. The Law Division judge, citing <em>Brown, </em>concluded that \u201cwhere property is partially commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>and partially non-commercial the former will take precedence in the application of the rule in <em>Stewart.\u201d Id. </em>at 205, 578 A.2d 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In <em>Borges v. Hamed, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 589 A.2d 169 (App.Div.1991), we refused to impose <em>Stewart </em>liability on a three-family residence where the owners resided in one apartment and other family members resided in the other two apartments. The other family members paid rent to the owner, but we noted there was no evidence that the rent yielded a profit. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 589 A.2d 169. We said: \u201cWe do not consider what should be the result if defendants lived in one apartment and rented the other two at market rates----\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In <em>Avallone v. Mortimer, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 599 A.2d 1304 (App.Div.1991), we concluded that \u201cthe <em>Gilhooly </em>approach to hybrid residential/non-residential properties partially misinterprets the <em>Brown </em>rationale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 599 A.2d 1304. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">As we read <em>Brown, </em>its weighing of policy considerations was ultimately resolved entirely on the grounds that there simply was no residential use of the property, and that its charitable use was not crucial in balancing the interests of the injured party against that of the abutting owner except as to a beneficiary of the charity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">In <em>Avallone, </em>the owners of property in Wildwood Crest were sued after the plaintiff tripped and fell on a sidewalk abutting their residence. <em>Id. </em>at 435, 599 A.2d 1304. A portion of that residence was leased as a residential apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 599 A.2d 1304. We characterized defendant\u2019s property as a hybrid property. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 599 A.2d 1304. We raised the question, \u201cwhat should be the result where the owner resides in a two- or three-family residence which abuts the sidewalk in question?\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">The policy considerations which are set forth at length in <em>Stewart, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 154-157 [432 A.2d 881] and <em>Brown, 111 N.J. at 330-35 </em>[544 A.2d 842], were substantially linked with a balancing approach which resulted in the Court\u2019s conclusion that commercial and other non-residential entities are more readily able to pass on to their users the added costs associated with sidewalk liability. This rationale includes owners of apartment houses and of non-owner-occupied smaller residential buildings operated for revenue purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-12\">[Id. at 437-38, 599 A.2d 1304 (parallel citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>In <em>Avallone, </em>the motion judge who granted summary judgment to the property owner concluded that \u201c \u2018as a matter of law ... the premises were still residential and not commercial for the purposes of sidewalk responsibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 599 A.2d 1304. On appeal, we reversed and remanded in order \u201cto permit exploration of the predominance of use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 599 A.2d 1304. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">Until and unless the Legislature or the Supreme Court abolishes the residential exception ... we hold that the same applicable considerations of balance and ability to pass along cost require that the residential sidewalk exception be continued for owner-occupants whose residency is established to be the <em>predominant </em>use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 438, 599 A.2d 1304. (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The most recent discussion of <em>Stewart </em>is our opinion in <em>Smith v. Young, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>82, 692 A.2d 76 (App.Div.1997). In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff fell on a sidewalk abutting a property that was co-owned by two parties. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 692 A.2d 76. One co-owner resided in one apartment and the other co-owner rented a second residential apartment unit to a tenant. <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded that there was no liability under <em>Stewart </em>because one owner resided in the premises. <em>Id. </em>99-100, 692 A.2d 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Here, this appeal involves a non-owner occupied residence. The property is leased on a yearly basis pursuant to a written lease. The tenant pays rent equivalent to the monthly mortgage debt plus the monthly real estate tax liability of the owners and the tenant is responsible for all minor repairs and property maintenance. It is perfectly clear that, were this property occupied by a non-family member, we would easily conclude the property was \u201ccommercial\u201d within the parameters of <em>Stewart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">We cannot conclude that the familial relationship of the occupant to the owner should constitute a cognizable differentiation in the \u201cresidential\u201d or \u201ccommercial\u201d analysis. The defendants, as owners, can pass the costs of protecting against sidewalk liability to the tenant-family member. Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that defendants have no intent of deeding the property to their daughter, but rather intend to retain ownership as long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>she resides within the property and ultimately allow title to pass by will or intestacy to the estate of the surviving owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Alternatively, if their daughter vacates the premises, defendants intend to sell the property and to retain the proceeds, which naturally will include any equity accruing during the tenancy. As we have previously stated, <em>Stewart </em>\u201cmade it clear that it [is] the nature of the ownership that [matters], not the use to which the property is put.\u201d <em>Hambright v. Yglesias, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 395, 491 A.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In a separate summary judgment motion, plaintiffs complaint against defendant Hazlet was dismissed. The motion judge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> concluded, citing <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), that as a matter of law, plaintiff failed to establish that the condition of this sidewalk constituted a dangerous condition of public property as defined by the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to 12-3, and particularly embodied in <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:4-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:4-2 provides, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">A public entity is liable for injury caused by a condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in dangerous condition at the time of the injury, that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred, and that either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">a.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">b. a public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition under section 59:4-8 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-13\">Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability upon a public entity for a dangerous condition of its public property if the action the entity took to protect against the condition or the failure to take such action was not palpably unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>N.J.S.A </em>59:4-l(a) defines \u201cdangerous condition\u201d as \u201ca condition of property that creates a <em>substantial </em>risk of injury when such property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be used.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>59:4-3 defines actual notice and constructive notice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">a. A public entity shall be deemed to have actual notice of a dangerous condition ... if it had actual knowledge of the existence of the condition and knew or should have known of its dangerous character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">b. A public entity shall be deemed to have constructive notice of a dangerous condition ... only if plaintiff establishes that the condition had existed for such a period of time and was of such an obvious nature that the public entity, in the exercise of due care, should have discovered the condition and its dangerous character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Using this statutory scheme, the motion judge emphasized that the plaintiff had failed to offer any evidence by way of answers to interrogatories, deposition testimony, or certifications that defendant.Hazlet had either actual or constructive notice of the alleged sidewalk defect. The judge also correctly noted that the mere happening of an accident on public property is insufficient to impose liability upon a public entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The condition of the property must pose a substantial risk of injury. <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:4-1. In evaluating the condition of this sidewalk, the judge was provided with color photographs of the accident scene that were shown to the plaintiff at her deposition and identified by her as accurately depicting the place where she fell. Those same photographs were presented to this court within the record on appeal. The judge noted that there was a space between two concrete blocks \u201cwhere some grass is growing. There is no obvious defect in the elevation of that particular sidewalk----\u201d Lastly, he concluded that the condition of the sidewalk was not one which any finder of fact could conclude created a dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">\u201cGenerally, immunity for public entities is the rule and liability is the exception.\u201d <em>Fluehr v. City of Cape May, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>532, 539, 732 A.2d 1035 (1999). The motion judge correctly noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>that plaintiff failed to present any evidence of potential public entity liability, thus he appropriately granted summary judgment to Hazlet. Summary judgment must be granted if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Summary judgment to defendant Jacobs is reversed and the matter is remanded for trial. Summary judgment to defendant Hazlet is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-11\"> The record on appeal does not reflect the purchase price for this property or the amount of the Jacobs' first mortgage. The record does reflect that the Jacobs paid a down payment of $40,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-12\"> In <em>Mirza </em>v. <em>Filmore Corp., 92 N.J. </em>390, 395, 456 A.2d 518 (1983), the duty of a commercial landowner was held to include removal or reduction of snow and ice as well as repair. The Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"ATC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>We hold ... that maintenance of a public sidewalk in a reasonably good condition may require removal of snow or ice or reduction of the risk, depending upon the circumstances. The test is whether a reasonably prudent person, who knows or should have known of the condition, would have within a reasonable period of time thereafter caused the public sidewalk to be in reasonably safe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"AUe\"><em>[Id. </em>at 395-96, 456 A.2d 518 (footnote omitted).]</p>\n<p id=\"AAz\">Since plaintiff fell on a allegedly defective sidewalk, the rule enunciated in <em>Mirza </em>is not applicable in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b677-14\"> The motion judge presiding at Hazlet's summary judgment application was not the same judge who presided at Jacobs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
