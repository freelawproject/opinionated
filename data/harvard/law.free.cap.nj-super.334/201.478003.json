Likanchuk\u2019s, Inc., </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 644 A.2d 120 (App.Div.1994), and <em>Moore v. Bridgewater Twp., </em>69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 173 A.2d 430 (App.Div.1961). In this opinion, we will address the scope of the diminishing asset exception to the general rule limiting expansion of a prior nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The Wall Township Board of Adjustment rejected plaintiffs application to declare that plaintiffs prior nonconforming use of portions of its 295-acre lot to mine sand and gravel entitled it to extend the mining operation to its contiguous 211-acre lot. On plaintiffs appeal, the Law Division Judge rejected the Board\u2019s determination and declared plaintiffs right to mine on both lots as a prior nonconforming use. Defendants now appeal, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">As a prerequisite to obtaining a license to mine the second lot, plaintiff, Fred McDowell, Inc. sought a declaration from the Board of Adjustment that mining was permitted as a prior nonconforming use of that lot. The Board denied the requested declaration, finding no prior nonconforming use of the second lot or, in the alternative, finding that plaintiff had abandoned any prior nonconforming use of that lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Plaintiff brought an action in lieu of prerogative writs challenging the Board\u2019s decision. In a written opinion dated December 21, 1998, the Law Division Judge concluded that the Board \u201cabused its discretion\u201d and therefore was \u201carbitrary, capricious and unreasonable\u201d when it determined that mining was not a valid \u201cpreexisting, non-conforming right\u201d on the 211-acre lot. Judgment therefore was entered for plaintiff, declaring mining a prior nonconforming use of the 211-acre lot. We disagree with the judge\u2019s application of <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>and <em>Moore </em>to the undisputed facts in the record, which we conclude are sufficient under the law to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>support the Board\u2019s decision. We therefore reverse and reinstate the Board\u2019s resolution denying plaintiffs right to mine the 211-acre lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">McDowell has conducted a mining operation, extracting sand and gravel from its land in Wall Township, since the 1940\u2019s. McDowell separately purchased the lots in question, referred to by all parties as Lot 5 (the 295-acre lot) and Lot 7 (the 211-acre lot), in January 1944 and November 1944, respectively. Lot 5 was mined by a prior owner as early as the 1920\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Wall Township passed its first zoning ordinance in 1955, placing Lots 5 and 7 in a zone in which mining is not permitted. In 1956 the township passed a mining ordinance requiring an annual license to excavate any natural mineral deposit. An ordinance regulating the grading of land and commercial removal of soil was adopted in 1966.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Interstate Highway 1-195 was completed in 1976 along the boundary between Lot 5 and Lot 7. Prior to the highway construction, plaintiff maintained a scale, a weigh house and a maintenance building on Lot 7 to serve the mining operation on Lot 5. Plaintiff also used an access road through Lot 7 connecting Lot 5 to Route 34. After construction of 1-195, plaintiff discontinued its use of the support facilities on Lot 7, including the access road.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Until the mid-1980\u2019s, McDowell repeatedly obtained mining licenses covering both Lots 5 and 7 (as well as several other lots) and actually mined a portion of Lot 5. The ordinance was amended in 1986 to provide for two-year licenses and to require a separate license for each lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">When McDowell applied in 1988 to renew its mining license for the next two-year term, the Township Committee approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>McDowell\u2019s request to mine Lot 5, denied McDowell\u2019s application for a license for two other lots<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and for the first time concluded with respect to Lot 7: \u201c[T]he Township Committee finds that with respect to Lot 7 a mining license should not be issued at this time, but that the applicant should be permitted to submit an appropriate application at a later date should it wish to perform mining operations on that Lot.\u201d The Committee noted that McDowell had not submitted all of the documents required by township ordinances. In 1991 and 1993, McDowell again applied for a mining license for Lot 7; those applications were similarly rejected for insufficient documentation, while the Township continued to approve licenses for Lot 5. In 1995 plaintiffs application for a license again was granted as to Lot 5 but refused as to Lot 7, \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d It is the 1995 refusal that ultimately resulted in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The licensing authority had sought, among other documentation with respect to Lot 7, a plan certified by the Freehold Soil Conservation District (the District) for soil erosion and sediment control covering the \u201crehabilitation\u201d of the areas plaintiff intended to mine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1995, along with its license application, plaintiff submitted a letter from the District indicating that no soil erosion plan was required because plaintiff proposed no mining on Lot 7 during the next two years. Nevertheless, plaintiff later submitted an approved soil erosion plan to the Board. Thereafter, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>plaintiff inquired why it had not received a mining license for Lot 7, the township attorney responded by letter referencing the 1989, 1991 and 1993 resolutions denying a mining license for Lot 7. Eventually the Township Administrator referred McDowell to the zoning board to seek a determination that it had a prior nonconforming right to mine Lot 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In its application to the Board, plaintiff did not claim that Lot 7 was actually mined prior to the enactment of the 1955 zoning ordinance. Plaintiffs application relied instead upon two arguments. First, plaintiff argued that Lots 5 and 7 were a single tract, such that the undisputed mining use of Lot 5 prior to enactment of the zoning ordinance established McDowell\u2019s right to mine or quarry sand and gravel on the entire tract, that is, throughout Lots 5 and 7. Second, plaintiff relied on its alleged prezoning-ordinance use of Lot 7 for certain support operations as an independent ground for declaring prior nonconforming use status to Lot 7 for actual mining.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In determining whether McDowell had established a prior nonconforming use of Lot 7 as of the date the Township passed its zoning ordinance, the primary questions before the Board were (1) whether Lot 7 was part of a single tract including Lot 5, on which extraction of sand and gravel was being carried on before 1955 and as to which plaintiff had objectively manifested its intention to extend its operation to its claimed \u201creserve,\u201d including Lot 7; or (2) whether plaintiffs support activity on Lot 7 by itself established a prior nonconforming use as a sand and gravel mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Our task, as was the Law Division Judge\u2019s, is to determine whether the Board\u2019s negative answer to both those questions was supported by sufficient credible evidence and therefore was neither arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. We conclude that the record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that McDowell\u2019s proofs were insufficient to support either of its arguments. We therefore need not address the Board\u2019s alternative finding of abandonment as a ground for denying plaintiffs right to mine Lot 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>An evidentiary hearing that concluded on March 1, 1998 provided the facts on which the Board relied. McDowell\u2019s Vice-President and General Manager for Operations, Frank Fine, testified before the Board regarding the history of McDowell\u2019s use of Lots 5 and 7. The only evidence adduced at the hearing was that offered by plaintiff, and the factual testimony and documents offered by plaintiff are not disputed. What is disputed is the interpretation of <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>and <em>Moore </em>and the application of those decisions to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">These are the additional relevant facts appearing in the record. Mining began on a small portion of Lot 5 in the 1920\u2019s. After plaintiff purchased Lot 5 in 1944, it continued to mine \u201chigh quality sand\u201d and gravel on a small portion of Lot 5. There was little demand for those materials in the 1940\u2019s and therefore only a small volume of material was mined. Demand increased in the 1980\u2019s, such that \u201cmaybe thirty or forty acres\u201d were mined in that decade, and \u201cin \u201996, in \u201995, [plaintiff] mined a lot more than ... in \u201997.\u201d As to the rate at which Lot 5 had been mined, Fine \u201cwould guess in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve mined about twenty acres....\u201d He testified that approximately one hundred to one hundred fifty acres of Lot 5 had been mined as of January 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">At an unspecified date, a scale and scale house and a maintenance shop and storage area for the mining equipment were constructed on Lot 7. However, after 1-195 was finished in 1976, it became impractical to access Lot 5 from Lot 7, and plaintiff abandoned those uses, as well as the access road through Lot 7 to Route 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Lot 7 is now bounded on the north by 1-195, by the Garden State Parkway on the east, Allaire State Park on the west, residential housing on the southwest, and a recently approved residential sub-division on the south. Plaintiff originally owned other contiguous property, which was earlier separated from Lot 5 and Lot 7 by the Garden State Parkway. At least one of plaintiffs lots east of the Parkway was sold for residential development.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The only evidence of actual mining on Lot 7 is Fine\u2019s testimony that two mine faces remained on Lot 7 and a municipal engineer\u2019s report that as of 1987, one acre of Lot 7 appeared to have been mined to a depth of four to six feet. According to Fine, the last time Lot 7 was mined was \u201c[p]robably [the] early seventies.\u201d McDowell did not offer evidence of the date when this minimal mining began on Lot 7, or for how long any such activity had taken place. Fine testified that except for a small amount of sand removed each year for plaintiffs own use to deal with icing conditions on the property, \u2018We\u2019ve ever hardly really ever mined that property. It\u2019s always been the reserve____\u201d Plaintiff offered no credible evidence that Lot 7 was actually mined before 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Fine testified that before 1995 McDowell did not submit additional documentation to support its license application for Lot 7 because it had no immediate plans to mine Lot 7, and the process of obtaining all of the necessary documentation was \u201ca rather expensive undertaking to do when you\u2019re not intending to mine it.\u201d However, as evidence of the intention to maintain Lot 7 as a \u201creserve\u201d to be mined for sand and gravel after exhaustion of Lot 5, Fine cited test borings McDowell undertook in the 1980\u2019s. In answer to the question whether any test borings had been done at an earlier date, Fine answered \u201cNo. Just Mr. McDowell when he bought it, he did \u2014 he knew what he was buying. He did some testing there and he knew what he was getting into.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Fine also testified that in recent years, a contract farmer continuously cultivated 20 acres of Lot 7, and another 190 acres of Lot 7 were forested to produce firewood. Lot 7 qualified for farmland assessment, and plaintiff paid $817 per year in property taxes on Lot 7. The property tax on Lot 5, assessed as a commercial mine, was more than $92,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">After the hearing, the Board enacted a resolution detailing its findings of fact and conclusions of law and declaring that mining was not a prior nonconforming use of Lot 7. The Board found that after the construction of 1-195:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>[Applicant removed the scale and abandoned the weigh house and the use of the maintenance buildings in conjunction with the mining operation. There was no longer direct access between Lots 5 and 7 and it was no longer practical or feasible to use the two lots as they had been used prior to the construction of 1-195.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Among its findings, the Board specified that McDowell had not mined Lot 7 in any significant fashion since acquiring the property in the 1940\u2019s, that the sand on Lot 5 was \u201cnot close to becoming exhausted,\u201d and that \u201c[sjince the mining operation commenced in the 1920\u2019s and by McDowell in the 1940\u2019s, there has been [sic] substantial changes in the development of Wall Township.\u201d The Board considered our opinions in <em>Likanchuk\u2019s, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 644 A.2d 120 and <em>Moore, </em>69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 173 A.2d 430, and expressly relied upon <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>for its decision. The Board found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">there has been residential development which is incompatible with the mining use in reliance on a perceived dormancy or limitation of the excavation activity, at the very least, for the last 25 years [and] [dormancy of the mining activity could continue for another 25 years or more on this property____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The Board concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">the submission of an incomplete application [for a mining licensej does not establish a prior nonconforming right, nor does it establish an intent to continue to use the property as a mining operation to defeat the concept of abandonment [and] at some point, in order to protect a pre-existing non-conforming right, there must be more of a manifest intent than has been established in this case to justify the preexisting non-conforming status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">The Law Division Judge expressly adopted the Board\u2019s factual findings, consistent with the general rule that \u201c[t]he trial court should accept the factual determinations of the agency and lay them against the legal issues to be resolved.... \u201d <em>Matter of Valley Road Sewerage Co., </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278, 291, 685 A.2d 11 (App.Div.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>224, 712 A.2d 653 (1998) (quoting <em>Boss v. Rockland Elec. Co., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>33, 42, 468 A.2d 1055 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">The judge distinguished this plaintiff from the property owner in <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>on legally insufficient grounds, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">consistent applications by Plaintiff to mine Lot 7, which put the township and the community on notice of Plaintiffs intent; continued recognition through public filings by Wall Township that Lots 5 and 7 are a single mining operation, and a former Township ordinance which recognized that a tract divided by a highway remains contiguous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Whereas the judge concluded that McDowell\u2019s \u201cintent to mine has been objectively manifested from the time the use became nonconforming ... [and] this intent has been made very clear ...,\u201d the record plainly shows that the conduct the judge cited post-dated the 1955 zoning ordinance and logically cannot evidence the owner\u2019s manifest intent before 1955 to expand the nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The judge distinguished <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>on the ground that \u201cthe property owner had never conducted a full-scale mining operation on any of its parcels ... [whereas McDowell] has an undisputed right to mine Lot 5 and to do so on a full-scale basis.\u201d But McDowell\u2019s mining on Lot 5 prior to 1955 involved a relatively small portion of that lot. Finally, while the judge noted that \u201cmany of the unique facts which led to the decision in <em>Moore </em>... are not present in the instant matter,\u201d he nevertheless concluded that mining any portion of the \u201ctract\u201d created the broad prior nonconforming use to mine the entire \u201ctract,\u201d ignoring the separate lots. We conclude that in so holding, the trial judge misinterpreted <em>Moore </em>and <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>and did not give sufficient deference to the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The scope of review applicable to a decision of a municipal zoning board is narrow. The board\u2019s decision is not to be set aside unless it is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>E.g., Burbridge v. Governing Body of Mine Hill Twp., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>376, 385, 568 A.2d 527 (1990); <em>Kramer v. Board of Adjustment, Sea Girt, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>268, 296-97, 212 A.2d 153 (1965). \u201cBound by the same scope of review as the Law Division, our role is to defer to the local land-use agency\u2019s broad discretion and to reverse only if we find its decision to be arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Bressman v. Gash, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>517, 529, 621 A.2d 476 (1993). It is presumed that the board has acted fairly, <em>see Charlie Brown of Chatham, Inc. v. Board of Adjustment, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 321, 495 A.2d 119 (App.Div.1985), and a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the board. <em>Kaufmann v. Planning Bd. for Warren Twp., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>551, 558, 542 A.2d 457 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>We first consider the general principles underlying the statutory protection afforded to a prior nonconforming use<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in New Jersey. With the enactment of the Municipal Land Use Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 to -129 (the MLUL), the Legislature permitted every municipality to enact a master plan and a zoning ordinance as the land use element of that plan. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-28. Recognizing and encouraging rational zoning in the interest of the public health and welfare, the MLUL balances the municipality\u2019s interest in enacting and uniformly applying its zoning ordinance with the rights of property owners who may be affected by a new zoning ordinance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The expression of that balance appears in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">Any nonconforming use or structure existing at the time of the passage of an ordinance may be continued <em>upon the lot </em>or in the structure so occupied and any such structure may be restored or repaired in the event of partial destruction lhereof.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In <em>Shire Inn, Inc. v.

Planning Board of Twp. of Montville, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>546, 565, 628 A.2d 321 (1993); <em>Avalon Home &amp; Land Owners Ass\u2019n v.

Board of Adj. of Borough of Fort Lee, </em>37 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 464, 117 A.2d 650 (App.Div.1955). \u201cBecause nonconforming uses are inconsistent with the objectives of uniform zoning, the courts have required that consistent with the property rights of those affected and with substantial justice, they should be reduced to conformity as quickly as possible.\u201d <em>Town of Belleville v. Parrillo\u2019s, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>309, 315, 416 A.2d 388 (1980); <em>Shire Inn, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 466, 729 A.2d 473. Nonetheless, a municipality may not take active steps to extinguish nonconforming uses, <em>see Nickels v. City of Wildwood, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>261, 266, 658 A.2d 291 (1995), but instead must wait with \u201cfervent hope that they would in time wither and die and be replaced by conforming uses.\u201d <em>Grundlehner v.

The question before us, not resolved by <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>or <em>Moore </em>alone, is the breadth of the diminishing asset exception to the rule against expansion.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In <em>Moore, </em>after restating the basic premise that \u201cwhile nonconforming uses may be continued as of right they are to be restricted, and may not be enlarged as of right, except where the enlargement is insubstantial or where a variance therefore has been granted,\u201d 69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 10-11, 173 A.2d 430, we distinguished the extraction of a diminishing asset from other uses of land:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">Wo must not lose sight of the fact that the instant case deals with the removal from land of a natural resource or a diminishing asset, as distinguished from a structure placed upon land or some use made by the owner upon his land. <em>This opinion, of necessity, must be concerned and limited only to its own facts dealing with a diminishing asset.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 11, 173 A.2d 430. (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">It is quite obvious that an owner intending to carry on a quarrying operation acquires more land than he thinks he will need so that he will not be a source of nuisance to his neighbors. For practical and economical reasons he must begin operations at one given point and continue from there to a point on his lands where his natural resource ends or at his boundary line. For the same reasons, it is not feasible for him to quarry at different locations at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">[69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 15, 173 A.2d 430.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Nevertheless, we recognized there must be some \u201coutward manifestation of ... intent\u201d and not merely an \u201cunexpressed intention or hope\u201d on the part of the landowner that he intends to utilize an entire parcel for what has become a nonconforming use. <em>Moore, </em>69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 16, 173 A.2d 430; <em>accord Likanchuk\u2019s, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 329, 644 A.2d 120. The nature and extent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>required \u201coutward manifestation\u201d of the intent to expand is a significant factor in our resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Because these diminishing asset cases are fact sensitive, we consider in some detail the facts of each. In <em>Moore, </em>the quarry owner had taken title to a single tract of twenty acres of mountain land, six acres of which were located in Warren and fourteen acres in Bridgewater. He began to quarry stone from the Warren portion in 1931, after a geological survey revealed the value of the rock deposits. He fenced around the entire property, except where a stream created a natural boundary. The owner also contracted to allow a third party the right to remove dirt from any portion of the property. Thereafter, both Bridgewater and Warren adopted land use ordinances in 1950 and 1952 respectively, and quarrying was not permitted in the zones where Moore\u2019s land was located. The quarry had \u201cslowly, but steadily, increased\u201d through the 1950\u2019s,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in 1958 Bridgewater found that the quarry had extended 150 feet inside its boundary line.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">A group of residents of Warren and Bridgewater brought an action in lieu of prerogative writs, seeking to restrain the entire operation. We found that the landowner had manifested an intent to quarry throughout his parcel, reasoning that \u201cit is difficult to comprehend how a quarry operator would evidence such intent other than by continuing to quarry,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, 173 A.2d 430, and Bridgewater\u2019s attempt to limit the owner to mining only the six acres in Warren was rejected. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding that the quarry could continue as a prior nonconforming use on the entire twenty acres in both municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Significantly, in <em>Moore, </em>the owner had taken title to the entire 20 acres as one piece of property, even though it straddled the boundary line between two municipalities. In this case, defendants have never challenged plaintiff\u2019s right to mine all of Lot 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>subject only to certain set-back and buffer restrictions in the licensing ordinance. The Board rejected only the expansion to Lot 7. <em>Moore </em>is consistent with a line of cases in other jurisdictions that recognize \u201cthat quarrying as a nonconforming use cannot be limited to the land actually excavated at the time of the enactment of the restrictive ordinance because to do so would, in effect, deprive the landowner of his use of the property as a quarry.\u201d <em>Syracuse Aggregate Corp. v. Weise, </em>51 N.Y.2d 278, 434 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>150, 154, 414 N.E.2d 651 (1980). <em>See </em>4 Zeigler, <em>Rathkopfs The Law of Zoning and Planning, </em>\u00a7 51A.04[5][b] (4th ed.); <em>but see, Billerica v.

The New York Court of Appeals in <em>Syracuse Aggregate </em>nevertheless declined to extend its theory to an adjoining but separate parcel. 434 <em>N.</em>Y.S.2d at 154, 414 <em>N.E.2d </em>651. <em>Contra, Bainter v.

Dane County Bd. of Adjust., </em>177 Wis.2d 445, 501 N.W.2d 782 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">On very different facts in <em>Likanchuk\u2019s, </em>we again addressed a claimed prior nonconforming use involving a diminishing asset. There the defendant operated an automobile salvage business on one of four contiguous lots it owned in Fairfield. On the same lot, defendant also had removed a small amount of earth and gravel\u2014 less than 500 cubic yards per year \u2014 prior to 1969 when Fairfield adopted of an ordinance rendering both mining and the auto salvage lot nonconforming uses. In the 1970\u2019s, a large housing development was built alongside the defendant\u2019s property. In 1987 the defendant received a municipal license to accept fill and demolition materials on all four lots. By 1988, neighbors were complaining about the volume of the operation, which had reached a level of 100 truckloads of gravel on some days.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">When the municipality brought suit to restrain Likanchuk\u2019s mining operations, the Chancery Division required it to apply to the zoning board for a determination regarding the extent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>prior nonconforming use. The Board determined that Likanchuk\u2019s had a prior nonconforming right to remove sand and gravel only at the prior rate and on the single lot, that is, at the same intensity as when the zoning ordinance was passed. The Chancery Division reversed, finding that \u201cmining was permitted on the entire property as a prior nonconforming use, because the activity involved a \u2018diminishing asset.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 644 A.2d 120.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Reversing the trial court and reinstating the Board\u2019s decision, Judge Havey wrote for this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">[Slimply because the nature of the use involves a diminishing asset does not necessarily justify its expansion. Because of the expressed aversion toward expansion of nonconforming uses, the \u201cdiminishing asset\u201d theory must be applied with caution. Public concern toward wholesale excavation and its attendant dangers are well founded. <em>See Bernardsville Quarry, Inc. v. Borough of Bernardsville, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>221, 236-38, 608 A.2d 1377 (1992); <em>Dock Watch Hollow Quarry Pit, Inc. v. Township of Warren, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 125, 361 A.2d 12 (App.Div.1976), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>312, 377 A.2d 1201 (1977). Also, neighboring property may be developed for residential or other uses which are incompatible with the mining use in reliance on the perceived dormancy or limitation of the excavation activity at the time it became a nonconforming use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">Therefore, in such cases the owner must show that the entire tract was \u201cdedicated\u201d to the mining activity despite the fact that the activity was limited when it was rendered a nonconforming use. <em>Moore, </em>69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 15-16, 173 A.2d 430. The mere unexpressed intention or hope of the owner to use the entire tract at the time the restrictive zoning ordinance is adopted, is not enough. <em>Intent must be objectively manifested by the initial and ongoing operation of the owner before the activity was rendered nonconforming by the newly adopted regulation. See id. </em>at 16, 173 A.2d 430.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 329, 644 A.2d 120. (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The critical facts in <em>Likanchuck\u2019s </em>were that prior to the adoption of the ordinance, the landowner\u2019s activity had been confined to one of the four lots; the defendant did not systematically expand its prior nonconforming use over the years; the primary use of the disputed lot was as an auto salvage yard; and the mining use had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>been incidental. <em>Id. </em>We therefore found that the owner did not establish an \u201cobjectively manifested\u201d intention to expand the mining operation to the entire tract, <em>id. </em>at 330, 644 A.2d 120. We also found it \u201csignificant\u201d that after 1969, \u201ca substantial residential development was constructed contiguous to the property. The developer and subsequent buyers no doubt relied on the perceived limitation of the mining activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore limited the mining operation to its original lot and its previous scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Defendants argue before us that <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>controls and supports the denial of prior nonconforming use protection for Lot 7, whereas McDowell contends that future mining on Lot 7 is permitted by <em>Moore. </em>The facts before us do not closely parallel either case. While all applications for protected status as a prior nonconforming use are fact sensitive, the relatively rare cases involving a diminishing asset are especially so.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We do not view <em>Moore </em>and <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>as inconsistent. Rather we draw the conclusion from both cases that the \u201cdiminishing asset\u201d exception, which widens the otherwise narrow protection afforded a prior nonconforming use, must be applied with caution, <em>see Likanchuk\u2019s, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 329, 644 A.2d 120, and with due regard to the specific facts on a case-by-case basis. <em>See Moore, </em>69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 11, 15, 173 A.2d 430. In <em>Moore, </em>we allowed the rock quarrying operation that pre-dated the zoning ordinance to continue to the boundaries of a twenty-acre tract under the following circumstances: quarrying had gradually expanded from the original site on the tract since before the enactment of the zoning ordinance; the owner had fenced virtually the entire tract; the topography made other uses of the land impractical; and the immediately surrounding area was not residentially developed. By contrast, prior to the zoning ordinance in <em>Likanchuk\u2019s, </em>the extraction operation was always secondary to the auto salvage business; its volume was limited; it was conducted on only one of four lots comprising the tract for which the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>sought protection;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> residential development had taken place on neighboring property since the zoning changes; and there was no evidence that other uses of the lots were impractical. Thus in <em>Moore </em>there was sufficient objective, manifest intention on the part of the owner to expand to the boundaries of the tract, evidence that was lacking in <em>Likanchuk\u2019s </em>and is lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">On the one hand, we have recognized and continue to recognize that extraction of a diminishing asset, such as the sand and gravel mining conducted by the property owner in this case, is a distinct category of prior nonconforming use that warrants some exception to the rule against expansion of a prior nonconforming use. On the other hand, the municipality\u2019s recognized right to limit prior nonconforming uses and to bring such uses into conformity with subsequently enacted zoning ordinances remains the rule and cannot be swallowed by the diminishing asset exception. We are satisfied that the diminishing asset exception has reasonable limits and does not stand for the proposition that unlimited expansion of a mining site is permissible, irrespective of other potentially relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In setting limits to the expansion of a prior nonconforming use to extract a diminishing asset, thereby balancing the inherent tension between the rule and the exception and between the legitimate interests of the municipality and those of the property owner (and in the absence of legislation more specific than \u00a7 68 of the MLUL), we deem it reasonable for a zoning board to consider, without limitation, such factors as the size of the lot or tract for which the prior nonconforming use is claimed; the rate of extraction as well as the rate of expansion as of the date the ordinance was enacted; the projected exhaustion of the asset at the present rate of extraction; evidence that the owner manifested its intention to expand before the zoning change; and the nature of development of surrounding properties and the community since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the enactment of the zoning ordinance that rendered the prior use nonconforming.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In support of its claimed prior nonconforming use, including its objectively manifested intention (before 1955) to expand into Lot 7, plaintiff offered the Board only vague references to the historical rate of expansion of plaintiffs mining operation. In the hearing before the Board, plaintiff proceeded not on the basis of any claimed pre-ordinance mining on Lot 7,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but rather on the theory that Lots 5 and 7 (along with two other lots no longer in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>issue) constituted a single tract and that plaintiff objectively manifested its intention before 1955 eventually to expand its extraction of sand and/or gravel to Lot 7, keeping the unmined portions of Lot 5 and 7 in reserve. However, plaintiffs proofs before the Board failed to establish any such objective manifestation of intent. Plaintiffs proofs in that regard consisted only of its repeated applications for mining licenses, all of which obviously post-dated the 1956 licensing ordinance and thus the 1955 zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Even if viewed as a single tract, plaintiff cannot establish that its intention to expand its sand and gravel extraction to Lot 7 was objectively manifested before 1955 or that extending its mining operation from Lot 5 into Lot 7 is an insubstantial expansion of its prior nonconforming use. Any doubt as to whether an expanded use is substantial must be resolved against expansion. <em>Belleville v. Parrillo\u2019s, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 316, 416 A.2d 388. Plaintiff does not dispute defendants\u2019 contentions that it will be \u201cyears\u201d before the resources of Lot 5 will have been fully depleted. Fine\u2019s testimony that McDowell \u201cknew what he was buying\u201d does not evidence a manifest intention to expand to Lot 7. Moreover, the farmland assessment that has sheltered plaintiff from any significant property tax on Lot 7, and the forestry maintained on the property, while not dispositive of a prior nonconforming use, evidence the practicality of other uses for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We deem it appropriate for the Board to have considered the nature of development in the surrounding area since the zoning ordinance, as well as the opportunity of neighboring property owners to assess the apparent use of the subject property. The Board found that \u201cin fact, there has been residential development which is incompatible with the mining use in reliance on a perceived dormancy or limitation of the excavation activity, at the very least, for the last 25 years.\u201d It had been 40 years since Wall Township passed the zoning ordinance that made mining a nonconforming use. The Board was entitled to consider the substantial changes and development in the township as it addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>scope of plaintiffs right to extend the prior nonconforming use on Lot 5. Residential development in close proximity to Lot 7, undertaken in the absence of demonstrated evidence that Lot 7 would be changed into a mining or quarrying site, is entitled to some protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Other jurisdictions that have recognized the diminishing asset doctrine as an exception to the rule against expansion of a prior nonconforming use have generally required some demonstrated intent to extend the extraction operation into the areas later claimed to be protected for such use. <em>E.g., Hansen Bros. Enters., Inc. v. Board of Supervisors of Nevada Co., </em>12 Cal.4th 533, 48 Cal.Rptr.2d 778, 792, 907 P.2d 1324 (1996); <em>Stephan and Sons, Inc. v. Municipality of Anchorage Zoning Bd., </em>685 P.2d 98, 102 (Alaska 1984); <em>Syracuse Aggregate Corp. v. Weise, </em>51 N.Y.2d 278, 434 N.Y.S.2d 150, 155, 414 N.E.2d 651 (1980); <em>Town of Wolfeboro v. Smith, </em>131 <em>N.H. </em>449, 556 A.2d 755, 757 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In support of its argument that Lots 5 and 7 should be treated as one, McDowell cites a 1978 Wall Township mining ordinance, later repealed, which the Law Division Judge also relied upon. The 1978 ordinance provided in part that \u201cdivision of a <em>tract </em>by a road ... shall not ... render the portions thereof non-contiguous.\u201d In support of his ruling, the judge also relied upon a 1981 municipal document listing mines in the town, which included Lots 5 and 7 as a \u201csingle mine.\u201d Neither the ordinance nor the list, each created long after the zoning ordinance was enacted, evidences a nonconforming use of Lot 7 before 1955. Nor is it up to the municipal governing body to determine whether a prior nonconforming use exists. <em>See Cronin v. Township Comm. of Chesterfield, 239 N.J.Super. </em>611, 618-20, 571 A.2d 1354 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Moreover, section 68 of the MLUL explicitly refers to the owner\u2019s right to continue \u201ca nonconforming use ... existing ... <em>upon the </em>lot____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68. McDowell implicitly seeks to apply the <em>Loechner </em>doctrine, holding that contiguous nonconforming lots assembled under one owner become one parcel and therefore require planning board approval for subdivision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Loechner v. Campoli, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>504, 511-12, 231 A.2d 553 (1967). <em>See generally, </em>Cox, <em>Zoning and Land Use Administration, </em>Ch. 12-2. In the <em>Loechner </em>situation, merger is employed to further the goal of bringing (or keeping) nonconforming lots into conformity with the zoning ordinance and thereby serving the overall goals of the master plan. By contrast, if we were to adopt such a merger theory to render the once \u201ccontiguous\u201d Lots 5 and 7 as one \u201clot\u201d and to apply the protection of \u00a7 68 to Lot 7 as well as to Lot 5, the result would be to expand the nonconforming use, contrary to the purposes of the local zoning ordinance and the master plan. We therefore reject plaintiffs implicit merger argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We hold that contiguity alone does not evidence the intent to expand nor otherwise warrant expansion of a prior nonconforming use on one lot to an adjoining lot under the same ownership. <em>Cf. Struyk v. Samuel Braen\u2019s Sons, </em>17 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 5, 85 A.2d 279 (App.Div.1951), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>294, 88 A.2d 201 (1952), where then Judge (later United States Supreme Court Justice) William J. Brennan, Jr., held that a property owner who had operated a quarry on his property before a zoning ordinance placed that property in a residential zone, and who acquired an adjoining property after the zoning ordinance was enacted, did not have the right to extend its quarry onto the later acquired land on a prior nonconforming use theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Finally, we analogize to the standard of review applicable to a zoning board decision on a variance application for a nonconforming use. <em>See generally, Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1, 526 A.2d 109 (1987). It is a well-settled principle that greater deference is accorded to a resolution denying the variance than to one granting the variance. <em>See, e.g., Cerdel Constr. Co., Inc. v. Township Comm. of East Hanover, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>303, 307, 430 A.2d 925 (1981) (affirming denial); <em>New York SMSA Ltd. Partnership v. Board of Adj. of Bernards, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 164, 734 A.2d 817 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>488, 744 A.2d 1210 (1999) (affirming denial); <em>Funeral Home Mgmt., Inc. v. Basralian, </em>319 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>200, 208, 725 A.2d 64 (App.Div.l999)(reversing grant). That principle is based upon the Board\u2019s familiarity both with conditions in the municipality and with the land use plan embodied in the zoning ordinance, as well as disfavor for deviations from that plan. For similar reasons to those supporting deference to a board\u2019s decision denying a variance for a new nonconforming use, the board\u2019s decision denying prior nonconforming use protection or expansion is entitled to greater deference than a decision finding and protecting a prior nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We do not reach the issue of abandonment, the Board\u2019s alternate ground for its decision, in light of our conclusion that there was no prior nonconforming use of Lot 7. <em>See Ferraro v. Zoning Bd. of the Bor. of Keansburg, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>288, 291, 728 A.2d 863 (App.Div.1999). We merely note that the right to continue a prior nonconforming use may be lost not only through abandonment (which has been held to involve an intention to abandon the use) but also through cessation of the <em>prior </em>nonconforming use. <em>See Villari v. Zoning Bd. of Adj. of Deptford, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>130, 135, 649 A.2d 98 (App.Div.1994) (citing <em>Camara v.

The law also supports the Board\u2019s determination that Lot 7 is not entitled to the protection afforded by the prior nonconforming use of Lot 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">We reverse and remand to the Law Division for entry of judgment reinstating the determination of the Wall Township Zoning Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\"> Municipal regulation of mines or quarries by means of licensing or permit ordinances is a permissible exercise of delegated police power. <em>Bernardsville Quarry, Inc. v.

Our rejection of the property owner\u2019s estoppel argument in <em>Likanchuk\u2019s, </em>regarding its recycling operation, is not relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\"> The reported opinion does not reveal the size of the lots.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\"> Several states have resolved the conflicting interests of the municipality and the property owner by \u201camortization\u201d of the prior nonconforming use. <em>See generally </em>12 <em>Powell on Real Property </em>\u00a7 79C.06[4][b] (1999); 4 <em>Rathkopfs </em>\u00a7 51B.05. Either by statute or case law, those states have permitted municipalities to limit the future life of a prior nonconforming use, so long as the permitted life is rationally related to the property owner's investment expectations. <em>See, e.g., Ouimet v. Frasier, </em>240 <em>A.D.2d </em>906, 658 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>733 (1997); <em>Hansen Bros. Enterprises, </em>48 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>at 789-90, 907 P.2d 1324; <em>Lone v. Montgomery County, </em>85 <em>Md.App. </em>477, 584 A.2d 142, 153 (Md.l991)(ten-year amortization period for nonconforming multi-family dwelling was reasonable); <em>Town of Islip v. Caviglia, </em>73 <em>N.Y.2d </em>544, 542 N.Y.S.2d 139, 148, 540 <em>N.E.2d </em>215 (1989)(amortization period must allow recapture of investment); <em>Rives v. City of Clarksville, </em>618 <em>S.W.2d </em>502, 509 (Tenn.Ct.App.l981)(amortization does not violate federal or state constitutions). <em>But see Bauer v. Waste Mgmt. of Connecticut, Inc., </em>234 <em>Conn. </em>221, 662 A.2d 1179, 1191 (1995)(amortization conflicts with statutory protection for nonconforming use); <em>PA Northwestern Distributors, Inc. v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of Twp. of Moon, </em>526 <em>Pa. </em>186, 584 A.2d 1372 (1991)(amortization violates state constitution); <em>State v. Bates, </em>305 <em>N.W.2d </em>426 (Iowa 198)(amortization not specifically authorized by statute or state constitution); <em>Hoffmann v. Kinealy, </em>389 S.W.2d 745 (Mo.1965) (amortization void on constitutional grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">New Jersey has never' taken such an approach. <em>See United Advertising Corp. v. Borough of Raritan, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>144, 152, 93 A.2d 362 (1952), (ordinance requiring removal of nonconforming signs was invalid because it conflicted with the predecessor to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> Although the Board's finding that plaintiff never mined Lot 7, combined with the undisputed evidence of two small, \u201cold\u201d mine faces on that lot, permit the inference that at <em>sometime </em>before 1944 minimal mining was conducted on Lot 7, the inference is equally available that the minimal mining took place after 1955. Plaintiff has offered no other proof of mining conducted on Lot 7 before 1955 and has not relied upon the actual conduct of mining operations on Lot 7 to support its claimed prior nonconforming use.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
