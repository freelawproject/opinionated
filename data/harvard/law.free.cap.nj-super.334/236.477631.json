Herdelin, </em>published at 334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>238, 758 A.2d 158 (Ch.Div.2000), dealing with Ms. Herdelin\u2019s and Mr. McKissick\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">We add only that defendant Robert Herdelin never argued that the foreclosure judgment should be vacated under <em>R. </em>4:50 \u2014 1(f) when he was before Judge Gibson. Therefore, we need not consider this issue. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). Nevertheless, we conclude that the circumstances presented do not justify relief from the judgment under this provision of the applicable rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">We acknowledge that Mr. Herdelin allegedly will lose a substantial investment because of the foreclosure, and plaintiff\u2019s judgment constitutes a significant profit. However, to vacate plaintiffs judgment in this case would, in our opinion, significantly impair the integrity of the Recording Act. <em>N.J.SA.. </em>46:22-1. There is simply no excuse for Mr. Herdelin\u2019s failure to record his deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
