We affirm concluding, as did the trial judge, that Hemmen\u2019s medical malpractice expert, Steven M. Lomazow, M.D., a neurologist, has failed to provided medical support for his opinion that the ACMC deviated from accepted standards of medical practice in treating Hemmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">At the outset, we note a deficiency which unnecessarily burdened our appellate review. Hemmen\u2019s index to his appendix does not \u201cindicate the initial page of each document, exhibit or other paper included.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:6 \u2014 1(c). The rule requires that, \u201cattachments to a document by way of affidavit, exhibits or otherwise shall each be separately identified in the table of contents and the initial page of each such attachment noted therein.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">Hemmen\u2019s claim arose in the following context. On January 19, 1996, he received an intramuscular injection in his left buttock to relieve chronic pancreatitis. Upon receiving the injection, Hem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>men experienced the immediate onset of discomfort. Subsequently, he developed a condition known as \u201cfootdrop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">As a result, he sued the ACMC. Dr. Lomazow submitted a report on October 15, 1998, which opined that the sciatic neuropathy that led to Hemmen\u2019s footdrop condition was \u201ca direct consequence of the injection.\u201d He also opined that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">the subsequent development of a sciatic neuropathy secondary to a intra-muscular injection in the buttocks represents a deviation from the accepted standards of practice. The buttock is a common site of injection and physicians and nurses are regularly educated in the avoidance of the sciatic nerve in giving an intra-muscular injection in the buttocks. I do not see any evidence or reports refuting the relationship between the aforementioned injection and the sciatic neuropathy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The ACMC moved to bar Dr. Lomazow\u2019s testimony because he had rendered a \u201cnet opinion.\u201d Judge George I. Seltzer denied the motion without prejudice. Hemmen submitted a new report prepared by Dr. Lomazow and dated June 8, 1999. Dr. Lomazow\u2019s second report cited a number of textual sources supporting the proposition that there is a medically recognized and documented relationship between intramuscular injections and sciatic nerve injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The ACMC renewed its motion for summary judgment. This time, Judge Seltzer granted the motion and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">On appeal, Hemmen contends that: (1) the judge erred in concluding that Lomazow\u2019s report was a net opinion; (2) the doctrine of res <em>ipsa loquitur </em>applies to this cause of action; and (3) plaintiff produced competent medical evidence to satisfy the requirements of <em>res ipsa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Seltzer in his June 1, 1999 written opinion and his July 9, 1999 written opinion reported at <em>Hemmen v. Atlantic City Medical Center, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 758 A.2d 1145 (Law Div.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
