Jancsy\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMq\">'(Signed) Elinor F. Jancsy\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\"The court finds that the only involvement of the defendant, Record, was as President of the Incorporated defendant and court finds for the defendant, Record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\"As to the defendant corporation the court finds that there was a valid release executed by the plaintiffs to said defendant and that it was for a valid consideration ($2,367.95) and the court finds for the defendant corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The plaintiffs claim to be aggrieved by the denial of their motion for a new trial and by the action of the trial justice with respect to their request for ruling <em>$ </em>8.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The duty of the Appellate Division is \"to deal with the questions reported and no others.\u201d <em>Associated Electric Co., Inc. v. E. J. Kelley Co., 44 </em>Mass. App. Dec. 1, 3 (1970); <em>James J. Derba, Inc. v. Hamilton Service, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 127 (1969); <em>Blackstone Nursing Home, Inc. v. P. &amp; H. Leasing Co., </em>48 Mass. App. Dec. 58, 64 (1972); <em>Barnes v. Springfield, </em>268 Mass. 497, 504 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">With respect to the denial of the motion for a new trial, it appears that the plaintiffs filed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>request for rulings and claim no abuse of discretion. There is therefore no question of law presented to us for consideration. <em>Gurney, et al v. McIntires Dairy, Inc., et al, </em>50 Mass. App. Dec. 46, 49 (1972); <em>Mills v. Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>48 Mass. App. Dec. 206, 211 (1972); <em>Bartley v. Phillips, </em>317 Mass. 35, 42 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Plaintiffs request #8 and the ruling of the court thereon is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\"Any clause in a contract that makes the party to a contract waive all his rights under the law must be found to be illegal as against public policy.\u201d \"Granted but not so found under conditions of present case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The plaintiffs in their brief and argument appear to rely on G.L.c. 93A, G.L.c. 106, \u00a72-316A and the case of <em>McDonough v. Whalen, </em>Mass. Adv. Sh. (1974) 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">G.L.c. 93A relates to the regulation of business practices for consumer protection. G.L.c. 106, \u00a72-316A deals with the exclusion or modification of warranties in connection with sales of consumer goods, or service or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">These statutes deal with disputes arising out of contracturai relations between the parties to the dispute and are not applicable to the facts in the case before us. The case of <em>McDonough v. Whalen, </em>supra, is clearly distinguishable on its facts from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">In the instant case, the instrument dated October 16, 1973 is not a contract but was found by the trial justice to be a release of claims of the plaintiffs against the defendant Hy-Land Realty, Inc. for which the defendant paid a valid consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">A release is not a contract. <em>Sablone v. Miraglia, </em>39 Mass. App. 108, 110 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The portion of the instrument dated October 16, 1973 which is pertinent is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u201c. . . . and waives all warranties, guarantees, express or implied by law or by an agreement by and between Hy-Land Realty, Inc. and Edward Jancsy and Elinor Jancsy dated July 5, 1973.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Where the terms of a written release are clear, unequivocal and unambiguous, evidence may not be received to change its content or show a different agreement or to create an ambiguity. <em>Sherman v. Koufman, </em>349 Mass. 606, 610-611 (1965); <em>Governor Apartments, Inc. v. Carney, </em>342 Mass. 351, 354 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We perceive no ambiguity in the writing dated October 16, 1973, and, even if this writing be deemed to be ambiguous, the trial justice on the evidence introduced at the trial, has resolved the interpretation of this writing against the contention of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">We are bound by the findings of fact of the trial justice if they may be supported by the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. Co<em>dman v. Beane, </em>312 Mass. 570, 573 (1942). Moreover, the credibility of the witnesses is exclusively for the trial justice. <em>Dolham v. Peterson, </em>297 Mass. 479, 481 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The plaintiffs in their brief have argued other questions for the consideration of this Division but as hereinbefore stated, these matters are not open to the plaintiffs as the only issues of law raised by them in the report before us relate to the denial of the motion for a new trial and the ruling of the court with respect to request #8, each of which have been considered and discussed. <em>Dolham v. Peterson, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">There being no prejudicial error it is ordered that the report is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
