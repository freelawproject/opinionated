In this matter we consider a question reported by a judge in the Juvenile Court: \u201cWhether a knife that is not a per se dangerous weapon enumerated in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>may constitute a \u2018dangerous weapon\u2019 as that term is used in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (j), when that knife is not being used in a dangerous manner.\u201d The matter came before the Juvenile Court on the juvenile\u2019s motion to dismiss and, on the oral motions of both the juvenile and the Commonwealth, was reported pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>consider the matter on the stipulated facts and hold that the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d as used in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(j), </em>should be given its common-law meaning. We remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The parties have stipulated that the police report attached to the application for criminal complaint constitutes an accurate and full statement of the facts. That report is summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">On April 1, 2009, Officer Michael Gough of the Marlborough police department was dispatched to Assabet Valley Regional High School on a report that a student, the juvenile, had been found in possession of a knife. When Officer Gough met with the juvenile in the dean\u2019s office, the juvenile admitted that the knife in question was his and that his father had given it to him three days before on the occasion of his sixteenth birthday. The knife had fallen out of his pocket in shop class and had been seen on the floor by the instructor, who reported the juvenile to the dean. The knife was a small folding knife with a blade approximately two inches long with a black plastic and metal handle. The juvenile\u2019s father confirmed for Officer Gough that the knife had indeed been a recent birthday present.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The school suspended the juvenile pursuant to its own procedures. He was then charged with possession of a dangerous weapon on the grounds of a school in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(j). </em>The juvenile filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Grim. R 13 (c), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1516 (2004), on the ground that the knife in question is not a dangerous weapon. The judge determined that the question of law presented in the motion is dispositive of the case, and the parties both moved to report the above-quoted question to the Appeals Court. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>The reported question hinges on the meaning of the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in \u00a7 10 <em>(J), </em>which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">\u201cWhoever, not being a law enforcement officer, and notwithstanding any license obtained by him under the provisions of [G. L. c. 140], carries on his person a firearm ... or other dangerous weapon in any building or on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>the grounds of any elementary or secondary school, college or university without the written authorization of the [school] shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Possession of a dangerous weapon by a student or any other individual on the grounds of an educational institution is thus a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>However, the term \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is not specifically defined in \u00a7 10, in the remainder of G. L. c. 269, or elsewhere in the General Laws. Interpretation of the term as used in \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>appears to be a question of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\u201cWe interpret a statute \u2018according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed in the ordinary and approved usage of the language ... to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deberry, </em>441 Mass. 211, 215 (2004) <em>(Deberry), </em>quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). \u201cWhere the statutory language is not conclusive, we may \u2018turn to extrinsic sources, including the legislative history and other statutes, for assistance in our interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deberry, supra, </em>quoting <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Nantucket County, </em>437 Mass. 430, 435 (2002). \u201cWhere the Legislature does not define a term, we presume that its intent is to incorporate the common-law definition of that term, \u2018unless the intent to alter it is clearly expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>440 Mass. 741, 747 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>392 Mass. 688, 690 (1984). \u201cWhere the Legislature uses the same words in several sections which concern the same subject matter, the words \u2018must be presumed to have been used with the same meaning in each section.\u2019 \u201d <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 188-189 (1969), quoting <em>Lidell </em>v. <em>Standard Acc. Ins. Co., </em>283 Mass. 340, 346 (1933). Finally, \u201c[i]f it is a criminal statute [that] we interpret, the rule of lenity requires that the defendant be given the benefit of the ambiguity.\u201d <em>Deberry, supra </em>at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>A number of analytical approaches are suggested to us on appeal. The motion judge, through the phrasing of the reported question, posits that the proper definition for the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d may be the list of items prohibited pursuant to G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(b). </em>In contrast, the juvenile argues that the list of items prohibited under that statute is somewhat arbitrary and limited and that, as a result, \u00a7 <em>10(f) </em>is better interpreted by giving the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d its ordinary meaning under the common law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 825, 828 (2003). Finally, the Commonwealth argues that these approaches are incorrect; it offers no alternative definition but proposes that the absence of a firm definition does not require that the statute be held void for vagueness because a separate statute, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H, provides that \u201c[a]ny student who is found on school premises ... in possession of a dangerous weapon, including, but not limited to, a gun or a knife . . . may be subject to expulsion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Considering these positions, we begin our analysis by noting the State\u2019s extraordinary responsibility to ensure the safety of students in the educational institutions of the Commonwealth. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Worcester, </em>421 Mass. 117, 131 (1995) (\u201cthe Legislature\u2019s and school officials\u2019 duty to provide children an adequate public education includes the duty to provide a safe and secure environment in which all children can learn\u201d). This responsibility grants the Legislature authority to regulate conduct by students in schools that \u201cwould be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult,\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 339 (1985), or that might be appropriate if occurring outside the school setting. The case before us does not present a question of the Legislature\u2019s authority to protect students in schools, however, but rather a question of what the Legislature intended when enacting \u00a7 10 <em>(j).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Section 10 <em>(j) </em>renders it a criminal offense to \u201ccarry[] on his person a firearm ... or other dangerous weapon in any building or on the grounds of any . . . school.\u201d Section 10 <em>(j) </em>makes carrying a dangerous weapon a criminal offense, and includes no specific intent requirement. <em>Id. </em>The crucial language of \u00a7 10 <em>(j), </em>exactly which objects are prohibited, is not defined, and therefore we must look to extrinsic aids in interpreting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>statute. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Deberry, supra. </em>We note that the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d has a defined meaning under the common law that is routinely applied to those statutory crimes that have a dangerous weapon element. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass. 526, 529 (2010). Under the common law of Massachusetts, dangerous weapons include those objects that are dangerous per se \u2014 \u201cdesigned and constructed to produce death or great bodily harm\u201d and \u201cfor the purpose of bodily assault or defense,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 303 (1980) \u2014 as well as those objects that are dangerous as used \u2014 items that are not dangerous per se but \u201cbecome dangerous weapons because they \u2018are used in a dangerous fashion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevlin, </em>433 Mass. 305, 310 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 304. \u201cThe interpretation of well-defined words and phrases in the common law carries over to statutes dealing with the same or similar subject matter.\u201d 2B N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 50:3, at 176 (7th ed. 2008). We presume, therefore, that the Legislature\u2019s decision to use a term with a common-law meaning in \u00a7 10 <em>(J) </em>indicates an intention to adopt that common-law definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The application of this rule of construction is bolstered by the use of the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in similar statutes and the general regulatory framework. See <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra. </em>The most closely analogous provision, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>is contained in the same statute as \u00a7 10 <em>(J) </em>and establishes the statutory crime of carrying a dangerous weapon. Section 10 <em>(b) </em>contains two parts, the first of which does not include the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d but prohibits the carrying of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\u201cany stiletto, dagger or device or case which enables a knife with a locking blade to be drawn at a locked position, any ballistic knife, or any knife with a detachable blade capable of being propelled by any mechanism, dirk knife, any knife having a double-edged blade, or a switch knife, or any knife having an automatic spring release device by which the blade is released from the handle, having a blade of over one and one-half inches.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">This portion of \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>lists a number of objects that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>dangerous per se and that may not be carried by any individual in any location, \u201cexcept as provided by law.\u201d The second portion of \u00a7 10 (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">\u201c[Wjhoever, when arrested upon a warrant for an alleged crime, or when arrested while committing a breach or disturbance of the public peace, is armed with or has on his person ... a billy or other dangerous weapon other than those herein mentioned . . . shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than two and one-half years nor more than five years in the state prison, or for not less than six months nor more than two and one-half years in a jail or house of correction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">This second portion of \u00a7 10 (b) includes the dangerous items Usted in the first portion of \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>as well as \u201cother dangerous weapon[s]\u201d and thus sweeps more broadly than the specifically prohibited items. The Appeals Court has interpreted the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in this context as incorporating the common-law definition. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Thompson, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 974 (1983) (defendant, arrested on outstanding warrants, was in violation of \u00a7 10 [6] where she carried eight-inch steak knife \u201cfor her protection\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blavackas, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 746, 752-753 (1981) (defendant, arrested as disorderly person, was not in violation of \u00a7 10 <em>[b\\ </em>where eight-inch kitchen bread knife in her possession was not being used as dangerous weapon). As experience has shown in interpreting these provisions of \u00a7 10 (b), the common law includes as dangerous weapons, whether per se or as used, a number of items not covered by the list of objects in \u00a7 10 (b). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lord, 55 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 265, 269 n.6, 271 (2002) (although not included in \u00a7 10 <em>\\b\\, </em>chemical mace is per se \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d under common law); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Another statute that uses the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A (b), establishes the statutory crime of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and provides, in part, that \u201c[wjhoever commits an assault and battery upon another by means of a dangerous weapon shall be punished . . . .\u201d Because it did not define \u201cthe term \u2018dangerous weapon\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A, the Legislature is \u2018presumed to have intended to incorporate the common law definition of the phrase, at least in so far as it is not inconsistent with the terms or the purpose of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lord, supra </em>at 269 n.6, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cotto, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 225, 227 (2001). As in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A, the Legislature used the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(J), </em>without additional or supplemental definition. The Legislature is presumed to be aware of the manner in which its statutes have been interpreted, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>449 Mass. 227, 231-232 (2007), and we accordingly may infer that by using the term \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d without further definition it intended to achieve the same result in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(j), </em>that prevailed in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>and G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 15A. Precedent surrounding those statutes is thus highly persuasive regarding interpretation of \u00a7 10 <em>(J).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the better analogy is to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H, which requires that every secondary school student be provided with a handbook warning them that \u201cpossession of a dangerous weapon, including, but not limited to, a gun or knife\u201d subjects the student to the risk of expulsion. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Worcester, </em>421 Mass. 117, 119, 134 (1995) (\u201cThe type of knives included as dangerous weapons in \u00a7 37H is all inclusive\u201d). Even though \u00a7 10 <em>(J) </em>lacks the additional definition of \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d that is found in \u00a7 37H (\u201cincluding, but not limited to, a gun or knife\u201d), the Commonwealth argues that this language should be imported to \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>because the Legislature was simultaneously considering both statutes, because the Legislative purpose of \u00a7 10 <em>(J) </em>would be undermined if criminal sanctions were not applied to all knives, and because any other holding would render the statutory scheme nonsensical. These arguments are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s first argument actually undercuts its position. The fact that the Legislature simultaneously drafted two statutes does not necessarily indicate that the Legislature intended them to have identical meanings. See St. 1989, c. 603 (amendments to \u00a7 37H approved December 15, 1989); St. 1989, c. 648 (new \u00a7 10 [j] approved January 3, 1990). \u201c[T]he same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>words in different parts of a statute enacted at the same time . . . should receive the same meaning.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Provincetown, </em>404 Mass. 571, 573 (1989). The corollary to this rule, however, is not that <em>different </em>words in statutes enacted at the same time should have the <em>same </em>meaning \u2014 the inference is, in fact, the opposite. See <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 252-253 (1996) (\u201cDifferent words often do mean different things\u201d). The language used in \u00a7 37H clearly demonstrates that the Legislature knew that certain knives fall outside the common-law definition of per se \u201cdangerous weapons\u201d and did not wish this definition to have effect regarding school disciplinary proceedings. The Legislature made no such provision regarding \u00a7 10 <em>(j). </em>Thus, we infer that it did not intend to include the supplemental definition that the Commonwealth proposes we read into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s second argument is similarly unpersuasive because it is not at all clear that subjecting a student to expulsion but not Juvenile Court proceedings or criminal prosecution for bringing certain knives to school would undermine the purposes of \u00a7 10 <em>(J). </em>School discipline, up to and including expulsion, is not an arm of criminal law, and the sanctions imposed by school administrators serve pedagogical, corrective, safety, and disciplinary purposes rather than the punitive, retributive, or deterrent purposes that may underlie criminal sanctions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not irrational for the Legislature to have determined that possession of a two-inch folding knife in a secondary school may warrant administrative sanction (up to and including expulsion) without warranting criminal sanctions (up to and including one year in prison). Accordingly, we do not conclude that application of the common-law definition of \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>would frustrate legislative purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that redundancy and absurdity would result if \u00a7 10 (/\") is read as either adopting the common law or incorporating the list of dangerous weapons set forth in \u00a7 10 (b). The Commonwealth\u2019s arguments in this regard need not be addressed at length. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion, the potential for some overlap between \u00a7\u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>and 10 (;\") does not render \u00a7 10 (b) a lesser included offense of \u00a710 (;'). Further, the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the purposes of \u00a7 10 0) require an extremely broad interpretation does not assist us in determining where, precisely, the Legislature determined to draw the line between objects properly brought to school and those that give rise to criminal liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 825, 830-831 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., </em>430 Mass. 219, 227 (1999), the Appeals Court succinctly addressed the difficulties inherent in an open-ended definition of \u201cdangerous weapon:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201cTwo insurmountable problems with [such a] position immediately emerge. The first is the limitless nature of the construction the Commonwealth urges. If a \u2018dangerous weapon\u2019 is any object that has the potential for harming [students] while they are [in school] . . . [then] all but the shoeless . . . would find themselves beneath the statute\u2019s broad cover. We decline to adopt an interpretation that would produce such an absurd result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">\u201cThe second problem relates to the first. Due process requires \u2018fair notice of the proscribed conduct\u2019 . . . [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>[acceptance of the Commonwealth\u2019s position would . . . produce a statutory scheme with the potential for criminalizing otherwise innocent activity in a way that provides a defendant with no notice of his conduct\u2019s prohibited nature until after the crime had occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">There must be some defined limits to the meaning of \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d under \u00a7 10 <em>(J), </em>and as a matter of fundamental fairness, the matter cannot be left to well-intentioned, but ad hoc, determinations. This is particularly true where \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>mandates that all potential violations, without exception, be referred from the educational to the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">We turn then to answer the reported question in light of our holding that \u201cdangerous weapons\u201d under \u00a7 10 <em>(J) </em>are those \u201cobjects that are dangerous per se, i.e., objects that are . . . \u2018designed for the purpose of bodily assault or defense\u2019 . . . and objects that are dangerous as used, i.e., \u2018those things that become dangerous weapons because they are \u201cused in a dangerous fashion.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, supra </em>at 828, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 303 (1980), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevlin, </em>433 Mass. 305, 310 (2001). This definition includes knives that are \u201cdesigned and constructed to produce death or great bodily harm\u201d but that are not necessarily stilettos, daggers, dirk knives, or the other objects listed in \u00a7 10 (6).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra. </em>Such knives are dangerous per se under the common law and thus prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>from schools under \u00a7 10 (/). The reported question asks if such a category exists, and we must therefore answer in the affirmative. Although it appears unlikely that the two-inch folding knife carried by the juvenile constitutes a dangerous weapon within the common-law definition, we make no holding in this respect because we rely exclusively on the stipulated facts and are thus without complete information regarding the design, purpose, and construction of the knife. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we hold that the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d as used in \u00a7 10 (/), must be interpreted as incorporating the common-law definition of that phrase. Comparison between that definition and the list of prohibited items under \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>requires that we answer the reported question in the affirmative. This matter is remanded to the Juvenile Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Section 10 (j) further provides that \u201c[a]ny officer in charge of an [educational institution] or any faculty member . . . failing to report violations of [\u00a7 10 (_/)] shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Considering their subject matter, it appears likely that G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(j), </em>and G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H, most frequently will be applied in the Juvenile Court, and we therefore note that the purposes underlying the juvenile justice system differ significantly from those underlying the criminal justice system. See R.L. Ireland, Juvenile Law \u00a7 1.3 (2d ed. 2006 &amp; Supp. 2010) (addressing philosophy and judicial goals of juvenile justice system). The general purposes of the criminal justice system are relevant to our consideration here, however, because G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (_/'), is a general criminal statute not limited to delinquency proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">More specifically, the Commonwealth argues that \u201c[i]t would be contrary to legislative intent to limit the scope of [\u00a7] 10 s reach to weapons that are actually being \u2018used\u2019 in a dangerous manner.\u201d What distinguishes an item innocently carried on the grounds of an educational institution and one that constitutes a dangerous weapon is often, however, the use to which that item may be put at any moment. There is thus a broad category of items that courts have recognized to be dangerous weapons when used as such that, in the absence of some express statement, we cannot assume the Legislature meant to ban from schools and universities. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevlin, </em>433 Mass. 305, 310-312 (2001) (shoes); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bankston, </em>121 F.3d 1411, 1412 n.l (11th Cir. 1997) (pens); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kivlehan, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 793, 797 (2003) (chairs); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cherubin, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 834, 842 (2002) (automobiles); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 50, 57 (1993) (scissors); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>State, </em>218 P.3d 291, 301-302 (Alaska 2009) (sharpened pencils).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">In considering this category, we note a stray comment in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 825, 828 (2003), stating that \u201c[s]traight knives typically are regarded as dangerous per se while folding knives, at least those without a locking device, typically are not.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 9, 12 n.5 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, supra </em>at 828-829; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Molligi, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 113 (2007) (same). This is an incorrect statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The <em>Turner </em>opinion, <em>supra, </em>relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 303-304 (1980), where this court identified various weapons that are dangerous per se because of their designed puipose (e.g., \u201cfirearms, daggers, stilettos, and brass knuckles\u201d), then cited cases noting that knives, and many other tools and household items, might be used as dangerous weapons but are not dangerous per se. The <em>Turner </em>case also cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 694, 695 (1986), where the Appeals Court analyzed the meaning of the term \u201cdirk knife\u201d under \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>and concluded that, in common usage, it refers to \u201ca long straight-bladed dagger or short sword usually defined by comparison with the ceremonial weapons carried by Scottish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>highlanders and naval officers of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries.\u201d The <em>Miller </em>case does not state that all straight-bladed knives are \u201cdirk knives\u201d or otherwise dangerous per se, and none of the other cases cited in the <em>Turner </em>case stands for such a proposition or for a general understanding that folding blades are inherently more or less dangerous than straight blades.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Straightness of a blade, like its length, a locking mechanism, a serrated edge, or any other individual feature, is not dispositive of the question whether a knife is dangerous per se under the common law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra. </em>Rather, the question is whether the knife is \u201cdesigned for the purpose of bodily assault or defense\u201d and \u201cto produce death or great bodily harm,\u201d or whether it has some other useful purpose and is only dangerous when used in a dangerous fashion. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevlin, supra </em>at 310.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
