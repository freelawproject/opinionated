L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6 (o). The board determined that Hy-Line did not \u201cengage in foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and interstate commerce\u201d within the meaning of the statute\u2019s sales tax exemption. Global argues error in the board\u2019s legal conclusions. Because we agree with the board that Hy-Line was not \u201cengaged in foreign and interstate commerce\u201d within the meaning of the statute, we affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><em>Facts and procedure. </em>We present the essential facts as found by the board. Global, a Massachusetts company with its principal place of business in Waltham, sells fuel to commercial and industrial interests in this country and elsewhere. Hy-Line, a Massachusetts company with a principal place of business in Hyannis, is licensed by the Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and Nantucket Steamship Authority (Steamship Authority) to provide daily ferry service between Hyannis and Nantucket and seasonal service between Hyannis and Martha\u2019s Vineyard and between Nantucket and Martha\u2019s Vineyard (islands). At the relevant times, Hy-Line served Massachusetts residents, but its passengers regularly included out-of-State and foreign tourists. Its vessels were not authorized to carry automobiles or other freight. To avoid the shoal waters off Massachusetts, Hy-Line vessels routinely crossed into Federal waters (i.e., over three miles from land) and then reentered Massachusetts waters, making no intervening stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Hy-Line purchased fuel for its seven vessels exclusively from Global, and a sales tax was charged on each sale pursuant to G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 <em>2.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Global sought a sales tax abatement for Hy-Line under G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6 <em>(o), </em>which provides an exemption for \u201csales of fuel ... to vessels engaged in foreign and interstate commerce.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The Commissioner of Revenue denied Global\u2019s applications for abatement of the sales taxes and Global appealed to the board, which, after a hearing, issued its written decision in May, 2009. The board concluded that, based on the fact that HyLine\u2019s vessels did not ferry passengers between States or other countries and on the plain language of the statute, Hy-Line did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>not engage in \u201cforeign and interstate commerce.\u201d The board also concluded that the passage through Federal waters by HyLine\u2019s vessels did not amount to foreign commerce. Global appealed to the Appeals Court and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cWe will not reverse a decision of the board \u2018if it is based on substantial evidence and on a correct application of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Macy\u2019s East, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>441 Mass. 797, 800, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 957 (2004), quoting <em>Bill DeLuca Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>431 Mass. 314, 315 (2000). \u201cWe have frequently recognized that an exemption from taxation \u2018is a matter of special favor or grace,\u2019 and that statutes granting exemptions are therefore to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Macy\u2019s East, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 804, quoting <em>South Boston Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>418 Mass. 695, 698 (1994). See AA <em>Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>454 Mass. 114, 121 (2009) (applying same principle to sales tax exemption). \u201c[A]n exemption [is] . . . to be recognized only where the property falls clearly and unmistakably within the express words of a legislative command.\u201d <em>South Boston Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra, </em>quoting <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Blinder, </em>336 Mass. 698, 703 (1958). \u201cThe burden is on the taxpayer to demonstrate entitlement to the exemption claimed.\u201d <em>Macy\u2019s East, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra, </em>quoting <em>South Boston Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra. </em>Although statutory interpretation is a duty of the court, \u201cbecause the board is an agency charged with administering the tax law and has \u2018expertise in tax matters,\u2019. . . we give weight to its interpretation of tax statutes . . . and will affirm its statutory interpretation if [it] is reasonable\u201d (citations omitted). AA <em>Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 119, quoting <em>RHI Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 681, 685 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We begin by addressing Global\u2019s core contention that the board erred in rejecting its assertion that commerce clause jurisprudence was an appropriate analytical tool for discerning what the Legislature meant by the words \u201cengaged in foreign and interstate commerce.\u201d The essence of Global\u2019s argument is that the phrase \u201cforeign and interstate commerce\u201d has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>given a broad interpretation under commerce clause jurisprudence. The flaw in Global\u2019s argument is that it fails to address the reason such a broad interpretation has been given by various courts. The commerce clause of the United States Constitution grants Congress the authority, inter alia, \u201cto regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States.\u201d Where courts consider the scope of congressional power under the commerce clause, it has been interpreted broadly. See, e.g., <em>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>379 U.S. 241, 253-258 (1964) (Title II of Civil Rights Act of 1964 valid exercise of \u201ccommerce power\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>312 U.S. 100, 118-120 (1941). However, under the so-called dormant commerce clause, the United States Supreme Court has \u201cimpos[ed] limits on the authority of State and local governments to regulate in ways that impinge on interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>428 Mass. 1201, 1203-1204 (1998), citing <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Jefferson Lines, Inc., </em>514 U.S. 175, 179 (1995). Where a State tax has a sufficient effect on the instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce, it is subject to scrutiny under the dormant commerce clause. <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1204-1205, quoting <em>Perini Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>419 Mass. 763, 766 (1995). Such a tax will be valid only if it \u201cis applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.\u201d <em>George S. Carrington Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>375 Mass. 549, 552 (1978), quoting <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274, 279 (1977). Here, we are not dealing with the scope of congressional power under the commerce clause, nor has Global claimed that the State sales tax exemption should be subject to scrutiny under the dormant commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In any event, as detailed <em>infra, </em>where the United States Supreme Court has been called on to discern the congressional intent underlying a Federal law created pursuant to its power under the commerce clause, the Court\u2019s interpretation of that intent has differed depending on whether the adjective modifying \u201ccommerce\u201d is \u201caffecting\u201d or \u201cengaging.\u201d Compare <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>513 U.S. 265,277 (1995) (phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201caffecting commerce\u201d indicates congressional intent to use full authority of its commerce clause powers), with <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>532 U.S. 105, 115-116 (2001) (phrase \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d provides limited exception to Federal Arbitration Act [FAA]).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Global further argues, in essence, that because G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6 (o), is an additional exemption to the one provided in G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there is no support in the statutory structure for the board\u2019s central argument that G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6 <em>(o), </em>requires a narrow construction of \u201cengaging\u201d in interstate commerce. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We conclude that although \u00a7 6 <em>(a) </em>provides exemptions for the same activities the United States Constitution already requires States to exempt, the plain language of \u00a7 6 <em>(o) </em>provides an additional, but limited, exception for the activity of \u201cengaging] \u201d in foreign or interstate commerce. Thus, under the statute, even if a sales tax is valid because it does not burden interstate commerce, a business might qualify for a sales tax exemption under \u00a7 6 <em>(o) </em>if it demonstrates that its activities constitute \u201cengaging]\u201d in interstate or foreign commerce.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Our conclusion is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the same language in a case involving the FAA. In <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>the Court rejected an argument that Congress intended an exemption from coverage of the FAA for those \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d to be applied broadly so as to incorporate the full extent of its commerce powers. <em>Id. </em>at 115-116. In making that determination, it held that, although the phrase \u201c \u2018affecting commerce\u2019 indicates Congress\u2019 intent to regulate to the outer limits of its authority under the Commerce Clause,\u201d the phrase \u201c \u2018engaged in commerce\u2019 [is] understood to have a more limited reach.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>American Bldg. Maintenance Indus., </em>422 U.S. 271, 279-280 (1975) (phrase \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d indicates limited assertion of Federal jurisdiction). Therefore, the Court concluded, the FAA exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>tion had limited applicability. <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>at 119. As the board noted, in <em>United States Glue Co. </em>v. <em>Oak Creek, </em>247 U.S. 321 (1918), the Court made a similar distinction between activity that affects foreign and interstate commerce and activity that constitutes engaging in foreign or interstate commerce.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 325, 329 (even though Wisconsin manufacturer engaged in interstate commerce, State tax did not so affect interstate commerce as to violate commerce clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Here, as the board noted, even if Hy-Line\u2019s vessels <em>affected </em>foreign and interstate commerce the language of the statute is not satisfied. There is no evidence in the record to establish that the vessels were \u201cengaged\u201d in foreign or interstate commerce. It is telling that, although Global argues that Hy-Line\u2019s vessels engaged in foreign and interstate commerce, it offers no analysis of the word \u201cengaged.\u201d However, as the <em>Circuit City Stores </em>case (which Global does not cite) demonstrates, where Congress intended to <em>limit </em>those who were exempt from coverage of the FAA, it is reasonable to conclude that the Congress deliberately chose the word \u201cengage\u201d to express that limited purpose. By analogy, we conclude that the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cengaged\u201d in G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6 <em>(o), </em>also was meant to express a limited application of the sales tax exemption. <em>Macy\u2019s East, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>441 Mass. 797, 804 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Because \u00a7 6 <em>(o) </em>serves a different purpose from \u00a7 6 (a), and is not tied to the constitutional commerce clause prohibitions, we conclude that it was reasonable for the board to interpret \u00a7 6 <em>(o) </em>as a limited tax exemption. <em>AA Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>454 Mass. 115, 119 (2009) (court will affirm board\u2019s reasonable construction of statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Global also argues that \u201c[n]either the Commissioner nor the [b]oard cited any stated policy or other authority that circumscribes the [Legislature\u2019s grant of the exemption under G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6 <em>(o),\u201d </em>justifying the board\u2019s narrow reading. There was no error. It is Global\u2019s burden to show that it is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the exemption and it has failed to do so. See <em>AA Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 121. We have determined that the board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 6 (o) is reasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Macy\u2019s East, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 804 (statute granting tax exemption strictly construed).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In sum, the board\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cengaged in foreign and interstate commerce\u201d is reasonable under the statute\u2019s language and Federal jurisprudence. Global has not met its burden in demonstrating why, without challenging the constitutionality of the statute under the commerce clause, the board must use commerce clause jurisprudence to discern the intent of our Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Global next argues that Hy-Line\u2019s vessels are engaged in foreign and interstate commerce because they are part of an essential transportation system<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that brings foreign and out-of-State travelers to the islands, and because the vessels travel into Federal (and international) waters during their trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Concerning the presence of foreign and out-of-State travelers on the vessels, Global first argues that the board erred in rejecting its argument that the focus of the statute is on the activities of the passengers rather than on the activities of the vessels themselves. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Most important, Global\u2019s focus on the activities of the passengers is contrary to the plain language of the statute, which, as the board stated, explicitly focuses on the activities of the vessels. G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6 <em>(o) </em>(exempting \u201csales of fuel <em>... to vessels </em>engaged in foreign and interstate commerce\u201d [emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>added]). See <em>Massachusetts Broken Stone Co. </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>430 Mass. 637, 640 (2000) (where language of statute is clear, court need not look beyond statute itself). Thus, to qualify for the exemption, Global must demonstrate that Hy-Line\u2019s vessels are engaged in foreign and interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Despite the statute\u2019s plain language, Global argues that we should be guided by <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>428 Mass. 1201 (1998). The opinion is not apt. At issue was a proposed two-tiered surcharge on vehicle rentals under which Boston residents would pay three dollars and all others, including out-of State and foreign residents, would pay ten dollars. <em>Id. </em>at 1205. The court held that the surcharge on the individual transactions of out-of State and foreign residents was a facially discriminatory measure that burdened interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1206, 1208. See <em>George S. Carrington Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>375 Mass. 549, 552 (1978) (tax that discriminates against interstate commerce is invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Unlike the proposed surcharge in <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra, </em>here there is no claim that the sales tax burdens the commerce clause. The sales tax is imposed not on individuals, but on a transaction for the purchase of fuel that is conducted entirely between two Massachusetts companies, on Massachusetts soil. The board\u2019s conclusion that, because Hy-Line was not involved in bringing any foreign or out-of-State travelers into the Commonwealth and that its dealings with them was \u201cclearly domestic\u201d is supported by our case law. In <em>H.P. Hood &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>235 Mass. 572, 575, 577 (1920), this court held that, although transporting milk from other States into Boston was interstate commerce, its subsequent processing, delivery, and sales were purely intrastate and subject to an income tax. The court stated that the sales \u201care as clearly domestic transactions as are sales by grocers or by any other retail dealers from local stocks of goods\u201d and the \u201cbusiness ... is indistinguishable from the sales by any other retail or wholesale dealer who sells from a stock of goods bought in a foreign market and brought to his store here by interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Moreover, Global\u2019s citation to cases that hold that tourism is an activity in interstate commerce does not aid its argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>because those cases deal with claims that various State or local statutes, regulations, or ordinances violated the commerce clause, whereas here the challenge is to the board\u2019s interpretation of a valid sales tax.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Concerning the fact that, for safety reasons, the vessels travel outside of Massachusetts waters to and from the islands, we agree with the board that this foray does not transform Hy-Line\u2019s routes into foreign commerce within the meaning of the statute. As the board pointed out, over one century ago, the United States Supreme Court rejected the argument that \u201cthe mere passage over the soil of another State\u201d in the transportation of freight or passengers between two points in one State \u201crenders that business foreign.\u201d <em>Lehigh Valley R.R. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>145 U.S. 192, 202 (1892). In the <em>Lehigh Valley </em>case, a certain Pennsylvania railroad route passed into New Jersey, but \u201c[t]here was no breaking of bulk or transfer of passengers in New Jersey. The point of departure and the point of arrival were alike in Pennsylvania.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. The Court held that this circumstance was not interstate commerce, noting that the term does \u201cnot embrace that commerce which is completely internal ... or between different parts of the same State, and which does not extend to or affect other States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, quoting <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 189 (1824). The Court reiterated, \u201ccommerce . . . undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more; it is intercourse.\u201d <em>Lehigh Valley R.R. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Here, we agree with the board that, like the passengers in the <em>Lehigh Valley </em>case, passengers on Hy-Line\u2019s vessels could not embark or disembark in Federal waters, but only did so at points located in Massachusetts. Thus, there was no \u201cintercourse\u201d conducted outside of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The cases on which Global relies to bolster its argument that travel into Federal waters was \u201cengag[ing] in foreign and interstate commerce\u201d within the meaning of the statute are not apt. Three cases concerned State policies that burdened interstate commerce; each explicitly distinguished the <em>Lehigh Valley </em>case. See <em>Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mealey, </em>334 U.S. 653, 656-661 (1948) (tax on gross receipts burdens interstate commerce); <em>Hanley </em>v. <em>Kansas City S. Ry., </em>187 U.S. 617, 619, 621 (1903) (railroad rates applied to out-of-State travel burdens interstate commerce); <em>Conlin Buss Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Old Colony Coach Lines, Inc., </em>282 Mass. 498, 503, 505 (1933) (travel from Massachusetts to Connecticut, however negligible, is interstate commerce and therefore not subject to Massachusetts regulation). One case, <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Steamship Co., </em>102 U.S. 541 (1880), was distinguished by the <em>Lehigh Valley </em>case. <em>Lehigh Valley R.R. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra </em>at 202, 203.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Finally, Global seems to argue that the board made an error of law in determining that Hy-Line\u2019s vessels passed through Federal and not international waters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To support its argument it included citations to cases and statutes in its posthearing brief to the board, but presented no evidence in this regard at the hearing. We need not belabor this argument because, even if it is true that the vessels passed into international waters, Global has failed to meet its burden to show that the vessels were \u201cengaged\u201d in foreign commerce while doing so. See <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>532 U.S. 105, 112 (2001) (\u201cengaged\u201d in commerce has limited meaning); <em>Lehigh Valley R.R. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra </em>at 200 (\u201cCommerce . . . undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more; it is intercourse\u201d). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the decision of the board denying Global\u2019s application for a sales tax abatement pursuant to G.

We agree with the board that the fact that Hy-Line vessels were so licensed is immaterial in determining the issue before us. Global\u2019s conclusory statement that Hy-Line is \u201cnot merely offering a recreational experience or retail product\u201d is insufficient to meet its burden to show that its vessels \u201cengage\u201d in foreign and interstate commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\">See <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Babbitt, </em>214 F.3d 483, 486-487, 493 (4th Cir. 2000), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>531 U.S. 1145 (2001) (rejecting challenge to United States Fish and Wildlife Service regulation concerning red wolves, under commerce clause); Young vs. Coloma-Agaran, U.S. Dist.
