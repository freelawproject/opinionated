Michaels, an officer and director of Anawan (collectively, Anawan), charging Anawan with paying commissions to an unlicensed broker in violation of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2. The appeal, which is before us on further appellate review, raises three principal issues: (1) whether the statute of limitations set out in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5, or G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, governs enforcement actions brought by the division under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177; (2) whether the discovery rule applies to the appropriate limitations statute; and (3) whether the division is authorized to levy sanctions against Anawan under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2, under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, or under both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">After a hearing, the division\u2019s presiding officer (hearing officer) concluded that the four-year statute of limitations in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, governed an enforcement action brought under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177; applied the discovery rule to find that statute\u2019s limitations period tolled for a period of time; and, while finding that Anawan had committed violations of both G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 77, and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2, assessed fines only for the c. 176D, \u00a7 2, violations under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 7. The Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s decision, and a judge in the Superior Court, acting on Anawan\u2019s appeal under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, also affirmed the division\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In deciding Anawan\u2019s appeal from the Superior Court judgment, however, the Appeals Court concluded that while G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, was the controlling statute of limitations, the discovery rule did not apply and the division was barred from assessing fines for improper insurance transactions occurring earlier than four years before the administrative enforcement action was commenced; the Appeals Court also decided that fines could only be assessed against Anawan under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, and not G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 7. <em>Anawan Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Division of Ins., </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 447, 451-455 (2010) <em>(Anawan). </em>Accordingly, the court vacated the Superior Court judgment and directed that the matter be remanded to the commissioner for further action consistent with the court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 455. We granted the division\u2019s application for further appellate review, and for the reasons that follow, affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The Appeals Court sets out the undisputed facts of this case, taken from the hearing officer\u2019s decision and the exhibits that were admitted in the administrative proceeding. See <em>Anawan, supra </em>at 448-449. We summarize those facts here. The division received two anonymous letters in 1999 stating, among other allegations, that Anawan, in addition to its principal place of business in the West Roxbury section of Boston, had improperly begun operating out of a second location at 76 Shirley Avenue in Revere; one of the letters alleged that the name of the agency operating from that address was \u201cHandel Ins.\u201d The division assigned an investigator to investigate the facts alleged in the anonymous letters. The investigation took a very long time, for reasons not explained in the record. During its course, the investigator learned that Kuntthy Pram was doing business as Handel Insurance Agency at 76 Shirley Avenue in Revere, that Pram had been licensed as an insurance broker from May 27, 1994, for three years (i.e., until May, 1997), but had not renewed his license thereafter. On June 1, 2004, the investigator sent a letter notifying Anawan that it had been the subject of a complaint received by the division, and requesting information. The letter asked specifically whether Anawan had ever employed Pram and if so, the dates of his employment and the insurance carrier or carriers with which Pram had placed insurance policies. On June 23, 2004, Anawan, through Michaels, responded, informing the division that Prum had brokered insurance business through Anawan from January 7, 1997, through December 31, 2001, and listing all the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sions paid to Prum. On October 25, 2004, the division commenced its enforcement action. Specifically, the division issued an order to show cause alleging that Anawan had violated both G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, by paying commissions to Prum at a time when he was not licensed to transact insurance business in the Commonwealth, as well as G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2, by engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The division sought imposition of a fine or civil penalty against Anawan for every separate violation of these two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Anawan filed a response to the division\u2019s order to show cause in November, 2004. After the denial of Anawan\u2019s two separate motions for summary decision, an evidentiary hearing was held on March 28, 2006, before a hearing officer of the division. The hearing officer issued his decision with \u201ccompendious findings\u201d (Anawan, <em>supra </em>at 449) in May, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The hearing officer ruled that Anawan had violated both G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2, in failing \u201cto ascertain whether Prum had renewed his license before soliciting business from, accepting applications from and paying compensation to Prum after his license expired on May 27, 1997.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Applying the four-year statute of limitations set out in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, the hearing officer determined that the division had proved (1) 278 violations of both G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2, occurring within four years of the filing of the order to show cause on October 25, 2004 \u2014 that is, between October 25, 2000, and October 25, 2004; and (2) by application of the discovery rule, twenty-two violations occurring before November of 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The hearing officer assessed a fine under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2, of one hundred dollars for each of the 300 (278 plus twenty-two) violations of that statute that he found proved, for a total of $30,000. He did not assess any separate penalty for the parallel 300 violations of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We review in this case the division\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and in doing so, we are called on to interpret a number of statutes that bear on the validity of that decision. The court reviews \u201cquestions of statutory interpretation de novo,\u201d <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478,481 (2006), giving \u201csubstantial deference to a reasonable interpretation of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its administration [and] enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may set aside or modify the division\u2019s decision if we determine \u201cthat the substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced because,\u201d among other reasons, the decision is based on an error of law or is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>450 Mass. 311, 318 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">a. <em>Statute of limitations. </em>General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 177, prohibits an insurance company, among others, from paying an individual \u201cwho is not then duly licensed as an insurance agent of the company for which he assumes to act or as an insurance broker.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first question of statutory interpretation posed is, what statute of limitations governs actions brought under \u00a7 177? Anawan contends that the appropriate statute is G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5. That statute imposes a two-year limitation period with respect to actions for penalties brought by the Commonwealth (which encompasses the division), but expressly states that it does not apply to \u201cany action set forth in [G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>c. 260, \u00a7 5A].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 5A of G. L. c. 260, in turn, applies to \u201c[ajctions arising on account of violations of any law intended for the protection of consumers, including but not limited to the following: . . . [G. L. c. 176D].\u201d Section 5A does not expressly mention actions for violations of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177. Given the absence of express reference, Ana-wan\u2019s argument, which is very brief, appears to be that the statute of limitations in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 5, and <em>only </em>in that statute, applies to actions for fines or penalties; and that because the division\u2019s enforcement action was for fines, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5, must define the permissible limitations period. Like the Superior Court judge and the Appeals Court, we agree with the division that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, is the applicable statute of limitations for actions brought under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\u201cThe essential nature of the right asserted determines the appropriate statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Micera </em>v. <em>Neworld Bank, </em>412 Mass. 728, 731 (1992).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Nantucket </em>v. <em>Beinecke, </em>379 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Mass. 345, 347-349 (1979). The essential nature of the right under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, reflects a legislative intent to protect consumers from unlicensed practitioners in the field of insurance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roswell, </em>173 Mass. 119, 121 (1899) (\u201cIt is within the proper exercise of the police power of the Commonwealth to require that persons acting as insurance brokers or insurance agents shall be licensed, in order that the business may be in the hands of trustworthy persons\u201d). See also <em>Deluty </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 91 (1979) (\u201cTrustworthiness and competence are thus requirements for the issuance of a broker\u2019s license [whether or not they are exhaustive]\u201d). Given this consumer-protective intent or purpose, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, clearly has \u201ccharacteristics that are common to consumer protection statutes.\u201d <em>Micera </em>v. <em>Neworld Bank, supra </em>at <em>732. </em>And as was true in that case, we conclude here that \u00a7 5A\u2019s four-year statute of limitations applies to actions under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">b. <em>Discovery rule. </em>We turn to the issue whether the discovery rule applies to G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A; as the division points out, that statute provides a four-year limitation period to begin \u201cafter the cause of action accrues,\u201d but is silent on when the accrual clock begins to run. The discovery rule tolls a statutorily mandated limitations period until the cause of action is discovered or reasonably should have been discovered by the plaintiff. See, e.g., <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Jablonski, </em>371 Mass. 482, 484-485, 487 (1976); <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>365 Mass. 83, 91 (1974). As previously mentioned, the hearing officer determined that the discovery rule did apply, and on the evidence presented, ruled that the statute of limitations period did not begin to run until well after October 25, 2000, so that when the division initiated this proceeding on October 25, 2004, it was entitled to impose penalties for violations of c. 175, \u00a7 177, occurring more than four years before that date. The Appeals Court, however, concluded that the discovery rule did not apply. It reasoned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, was a statute imposing penalties for its violation, that therefore a cause of action under its terms \u201caccrued\u201d at the time of violation, and that nothing in the language of c. 260, \u00a7 5A, suggested that tolling the limitations period in such a case would be necessary. <em>Anawan, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. at 451-452.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In reaching this conclusion, the Appeals Court cited and relied on Federal cases construing statutes of limitations solely applicable to actions for enforcement of civil fines or penalties. See <em>Anawan, supra </em>at 451-452, citing <em>3M Co. </em>v. <em>Browner, </em>17 F. 3d 1453, 1455, 1460-1463 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (construing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462, which establishes statute of limitations applicable to action or proceeding \u201cfor the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise\u201d; court rejected Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s argument that discovery rale should apply to toll running of statute\u2019s limitations period until its \u201cdiscovery\u201d of company\u2019s violations of Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-2629, concluding that limitations period began to ran when company committed violations); and <em>Unexcelled Chem. Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>345 U.S. 59, 65 (1953) (construing statute of limitations in Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255: \u201cIt is [the] breach of duty [by regulated entity], not its discovery, that normally is controlling\u201d). But the limitations statutes at issue in these cases pertained exclusively to actions brought to recover civil fines, penalties, or forfeitures. In that respect, they are more like the statute of limitations set out in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5, which similarly applies <em>only </em>to \u201c[a]ctions for penalties or forfeitures under penal statutes.\u201d As discussed, however, c. 260, \u00a7 5, explicitly disclaims any intent to reach actions governed by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, and by its terms, \u00a7 5A covers not only actions for fines or penalties brought by a government entity, but also actions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201cdamages ... or other relief and brought by <em>any </em>person\u201d (emphasis added). This court has previously concluded that the discovery rule applies to \u00a7 5A\u2019s limitations period in the context of an action brought by a private \u201cperson\u201d under G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Fleet Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>449 Mass. 119, 126 (2007). See also <em>Albrecht </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>436 Mass. 706, 714-715 (2002). Where G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, draws no distinctions based on (1) the specific nature of the consumer protection claim being brought<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; (2) who is bringing the consumer protection claim or case; or (3) the nature of the relief being sought (e.g., whether civil penalties, monetary damages, or restitution), and consistent with our interpretation of this statute in the cases just cited, we read \u00a7 5A to permit application of the discovery rule in an action brought by the division to enforce G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, just as it applies to causes of action brought by private individuals under G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">c. <em>Damages. </em>As mentioned earlier, the division\u2019s hearing officer found Anawan to have committed multiple violations of both G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but assessed fines only for the violations of c. 176D, \u00a7 2, and did so as provided under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Superior Court affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>this determination, but the Appeals Court concluded instead that the division could only impose a penalty on Anawan under c. 175, \u00a7 177,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and not under c. 176D, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 7. In that court\u2019s view, c. 176D, \u00a7 7, is \u201ca statute of general application,\u201d while c. 175, \u00a7 177, is \u201ca self-contained statute, prescribing specific remedies for its violation.\u201d <em>Anawan, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. at 454, quoting <em>Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>378 Mass. 707, 711 (1979). Accordingly, the court ruled, the penalty imposed on Anawan must be confined to the specific one prescribed by c. 175, \u00a7 177, alone. <em>Anawan, supra </em>at 454-455. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 2, precludes trade practices connected to the business of insurance that are unfair or deceptive; G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 7, provides the penalties for violations of c. 176D. See notes 15 and 16, <em>supra. </em>As the Appeals Court stated, G. L. c. 176D as a whole, including c. 176D, \u00a7 7, is a statute that applies generally \u201cto all unfair practices in the insurance industry.\u201d <em>Anawan, supra </em>at 454. But that being said, G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 12, provides that \u201c[t]he powers vested in the commissioner by this chapter, <em>shall be additional to </em>any other powers to enforce any penalties, fines or forfeitures authorized by law with respect to the methods, acts, and practices hereby declared to be unfair or deceptive\u201d (emphasis added). In light of the unambiguous language of c. 176D, \u00a7 12, we think it clear that in a case such as this one, where violations have been found of both a specific statute such as c. 175, \u00a7 177, regulating one aspect of the insurance industry, and the more general c. 176D, the commissioner, acting through the division, permissibly may impose separate penalties under both statutes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>supra </em>(penalty can be assessed only under G. L. c. 93B, where that statute was enacted after G. L. c. 93A, and imposes penalties specifically for one industry, in contrast to general applicability of c. 93A).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The parties and the Superior Court refer to the administrative decision being reviewed in this case as the decision of the Division of Insurance (division).

L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1).

L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, the division\u2019s separate charge that Anawan violated G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2, is expressly within the ambit of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, and, therefore, the four-year limitation period prescribed by \u00a7 5A applies to it. It remains necessary to resolve whether \u00a7 5A also applies to actions under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, because the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that Anawan had committed 300 violations of c. 176D, \u00a7 2, was based entirely on his determination that Anawan had committed that many violations of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, by paying at least 300 commissions to Pram, an unlicensed insurance broker, between 1998 and the end of 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\">In <em>Micera </em>v. <em>Neworld Bank, </em>412 Mass. 728 (1992), this court concluded that an action brought under G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 60, which imposes conditions on interest provisions in renewal notes secured by residential mortgages, was a statute \u201cdesigned to benefit consumers by shielding them from sharp practices\u201d of residential mortgage lenders, <em>id. </em>at 732, and was essentially a \u201claw intended for the protection of consumers\u201d within the scope of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A (although not specifically listed in \u00a7 5A). <em>Id. </em>at 731-733.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Anawan argues that G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, was promulgated by statute in 1919, before \u201claws intended for the protection of consumers\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, were passed, and therefore c. 175, \u00a7 177, cannot be found to come within the ambit of c. 260, \u00a7 5A. The argument fails. General Laws c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 96 and 110, both expressly listed in c. 260, \u00a7 5A, were first enacted in 1898. See St. 1898, c. 577, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The division argues that the issue of the discovery rule\u2019s application to G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, was not raised before the Appeals Court, and the Appeals Court therefore erred in raising the matter on its own. While we agree that \u201c[a]s a fundamental principle, appellate courts should not reach out to decide issues that have not been briefed by any party,\u201d <em>Bongaards </em>v. <em>Millen, </em>440 Mass. 10, 28 (2003), it is not wholly clear whether the Appeals Court reached out to decide an unbriefed issue; Anawan\u2019s brief before the Appeals Court may possibly be read as raising the discovery rule question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b620-6\">For example, nothing in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, distinguishes between an action brought under one of the statutes expressly mentioned in the section \u2014 such as G. L. c. 93A \u2014 and one that \u00a7 5A also covers because it arises out of a claim of violation of \u201cany law intended for the protection of consumers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"AQk\">The Legislature\u2019s decision to use different language in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 5A, to describe when an action must be commenced is also noteworthy. In \u00a7 5, applicable only to actions for penalties or forfeitures, an action by the Commonwealth \u201cmay be commenced only within two years next after the of-fence is committed.\u201d In \u00a7 5A, the action \u201cshall be commenced only within four years next after the cause of action accrues.\u201d The Legislature thus was extremely clear that it did not intend a discovery rule to apply to actions governed by \u00a7 5, but evinced no such intent in actions governed by \u00a7 5A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"AuA\">General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 2, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">\u201cNo person shall engage in this commonwealth in any trade practice which is defined in this chapter as, or determined pursuant to [G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 6,] to be, an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 7, directs that if, after hearing, the commissioner determines that a \u201cperson\u201d (defined in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 1 [a], to include an individual or an entity engaged in the business of insurance) has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, that person \u201cshall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars for each and every [such] act or practice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 177, as in effect (see note 7, <em>supra), </em>prescribed that a fine of \u201cnot less than twenty nor more than two hundred dollars\u201d be imposed on whoever \u201cviolates any provision of this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\">That the hearing officer decided in this case to impose penalties under only one of the statutes does not suggest a different conclusion. Rather, we consider the hearing officer\u2019s decision to limit the penalty as a discretionary determination that was well supported by the evidence of mitigating circumstances before him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Anawan makes an argument that St. 2002, c. 184, \u00a7 109, amending G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, applies to this case and the amended statute requires that the division prove any violation was knowing \u2014 which, Anawan claims, cannot be shown here. For the reasons stated by the Appeals Court, the amended statute is not applicable to this case. <em>Anawan Ins. Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Division of Ins., </em>76 Mass.
