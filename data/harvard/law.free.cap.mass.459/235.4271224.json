He was beaten by a group of men and shot twice at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>close range. The defendant, Jose M. Marrero, was subsequently indicted for the murder and, after a jury trial, was found guilty of premeditated murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed from the conviction, as well as from the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial (and for an evidentiary hearing) that was based on the defendant\u2019s allegation that his attorney never informed him of his right to testify on his own behalf at trial. On appeal, the defendant also claims that his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he made certain remarks in closing argument that trivialized the jury\u2019s fact-finding function and diluted the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof; and that the judge erred in instructing the jury on a joint venture theory of murder when the Commonwealth presented no evidence that anyone other than the defendant acted as the principal in the crime. We affirm the convictions and decline to exercise our extraordinary power pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the murder verdict or grant other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">1. <em>Trial. </em>The jury could have found the following facts based on the evidence adduced at trial. Early in the evening of February 17, 2005, Jose Costoso, driving a green Ford Taurus automobile, picked up Rosa Cruz from the Diaz Market in Springfield. The two traveled in Costoso\u2019s vehicle to another location for the purpose of purchasing \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After purchasing and smoking the crack cocaine, Costoso and Cruz drove to the parking lot of a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, where Costoso began to repair the taillights on his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Ten minutes after Costoso entered the parking lot, a green sport utility vehicle pulled up behind his automobile and blocked it from leaving. The driver, Hector Garces, got out of the vehicle and began to hit Costoso. As he punched Costoso, Garces said, \u201cI thought you wanted to beat Omar; I thought you wanted to beat Omar, you tough guy.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An unidentified passenger in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>sport utility vehicle yelled to Cruz, \u201c[G]et the hell out if you don\u2019t want no part of this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">As Cruz fled the scene, she saw three men running toward the parking lot, two of whom she recognized. One was Jesus Gonzalez, from whom she had purchased drugs in the past, and the other was Oscar Reyes, whom she recognized from \u201cup the block.\u201d She had never seen the third man before, but noticed that he had a black mark on his cheek. This third man was later identified as the defendant. Reyes and the defendant joined Garces in beating Costoso on the driver\u2019s side of Costoso\u2019s vehicle. Soon after joining the fray, the defendant walked around to the passenger side of the vehicle and fired shots through the opened window, striking Costoso. One bullet entered Costoso\u2019s right upper back and pierced his lung and liver, killing him. Another bullet struck his left lower buttock.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Later that night, Springfield police detectives interviewed Cruz. She identified pictures of Gonzalez and Reyes from a photographic array as two of Costoso\u2019s attackers, but told police (falsely) that she could not describe anything about the person who fired the fatal gunshots (defendant). More than one year later, however, and after being summonsed to testify at the resulting trials, <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cruz told an assistant district attorney that, although she had been afraid to do so initially, she could identify the defendant as the shooter, and described him as having a black mark on his face.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In any event, on the night of the murder, and based on Cruz\u2019s identification of his photograph, Gonzalez was arrested. Gonzalez, in turn, identified the defendant as the shooter and selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>his picture from a photographic array. He also inculpated Garces and Reyes. Gonzalez subsequently signed a plea and cooperation agreement with the district attorney\u2019s office, in which he agreed to testify against the defendant in exchange for \u201cconsideration\u201d on the resolution of the murder charge and two other charges for drug trafficking and illegal possession of a firearm then pending against him. At trial, Gonzalez testified that the defendant drew a gun while standing on the passenger side of the car and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d before shooting Costoso.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The day after the murder, and based on Gonzalez\u2019s identification of his photograph, Springfield police officers arrested the defendant. The defendant provided the police with an alibi, claiming that between the hours of 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. on the night of the murder he watched Spanish-language television with his girl fiiend in the apartment they shared, took a shower, and then the two continued to watch television until 12:30 a.m., when they went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">After the defendant\u2019s arrest, police officers seized the black leather jacket that he was wearing. Samples from the jacket\u2019s cuffs were sent to a forensic laboratory in Pennsylvania, where they were analyzed for the presence of gunshot residue. David Freehling, the analyst who tested the jacket\u2019s cuffs, was qualified as an expert witness at trial. He testified that a small plume arises from a gun when fired, which releases particles into the air that then may fall on clothing in the immediate area of the gun. The clothing can be analyzed under an electron microscope. If any particle compound containing a fusion of lead, antimony, and barium, or two of those three elements, are detected, that is uniquely corroborative of the presence of gunshot residue. Freehling detected lead and antimony fused into a single particle on the sample cut from the left cuff of the defendant\u2019s leather jacket. This single particle also contained an \u201celemental tag[]\u201d indicating a trace amount of tin. Tin is found in certain specific types of European ammunition. Based on these observations, Freehling testified that the single particle came from the firing of ammunition manufactured by a Czech company, Seiller &amp; Bellot. There was further evidence that a .38 caliber class base portion of a metal projectile jacket was found behind the seat of the victim\u2019s vehicle, and a metal jacket fragment from a spent projectile was found embedded in the rear door behind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>driver\u2019s seat. Both bore the insignia \u201cSB,\u201d indicating that they were manufactured by Seiller &amp; Bellot.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Defense counsel objected to the admission of Freehling\u2019s testimony, arguing that the methodology Freehling used to identify gunshot residue was \u201cvoodoo science,\u201d and that both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the American Society for Testing and Materials have rejected gunshot residue analysis as unreliable. The judge overruled the objection, concluding that the subjects raised by counsel were proper for cross-examination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We now discuss each claim of error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">2. <em>Denial of evidentiary hearing and motion for a new trial. </em>In an affidavit submitted in support of his motion for a new trial, the defendant averred that he told his counsel \u201cearly on\u201d that he wanted to testify, and the attorney responded by saying \u201csomething like we would cross that bridge when we came to it.\u201d The defendant stated that he was dissatisfied at trial, and again told his attorney that he wanted to testify, but was told \u201csomething like don\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s going fine.\u201d According to the defendant\u2019s affidavit, the attorney subsequently told the defendant it would be a \u201cbad idea\u201d for him to testify. The defendant further claimed that he was never informed that the decision whether to testify was committed solely to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel also provided an affidavit with the defendant\u2019s motion, which stated, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">\u201cI do not remember whether I told Mr. Marrero that he had a right to testify; nor do I remember whether I told him that it was not up to me but solely up to him whether he should testify. I do remember that Mr. Marrero told me that he wanted to testify and tell the jury that he had not played any role in the shooting of the victim in this case but was at home watching TV when that happened. Mr. Marrero told me of his desire to testify both before trial and during the trial, and at trial I advised him that in my view he should not testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cA motion for new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the judge, . . . and the judge\u2019s disposition of the motion will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust, ... or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lucien, </em>440 Mass. 658, 669-670 (2004) <em>(Lucien). </em>The judge may rule on the motion for a new trial from the face of the affidavits or other supporting material, without an evidentiary hearing, \u201cif no substantial issue is raised by the motion or affidavits.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (c) (3), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Denis, </em>442 Mass. 617, 628 (2004) <em>(Denis). </em>However, \u201cwhere a substantial issue is raised and is supported by a substantial evidentiary showing, the judge should hold an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 260 (1981). Thus, \u201c[i]n determining whether a motion for a new trial warrants an evidentiary hearing, both the seriousness of the issue itself and the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s showing on that issue must be considered.\u201d <em>Denis, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 348 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim in this particular motion for a new trial raises \u201can issue of constitutional importance\u201d that readily qualifies as a serious issue. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 661 (1992). \u201cThe right to testify on one\u2019s own behalf in a criminal case is fundamental.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 335 (2000), citing <em>Harris </em>v. <em>New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 225 (1971). Accordingly, our analysis whether an evidentiary hearing was required focuses on the adequacy of the showing made by the defendant with respect to that issue. See <em>Denis, supra. </em>In reviewing the adequacy of the showing, the defendant\u2019s submissions in support of a motion for a new trial need not prove the factual premise of that motion, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 662, but they must contain sufficient credible information to \u201ccast doubt on\u201d the issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass. 596, 608 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Here, there was no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s assessment that the defendant\u2019s motion did not make an adequate evidentiary showing that the waiver of his right to testify was invalid.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant submitted two pieces of evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>support of his motion for new trial: his own affidavit and the affidavit of his defense counsel. As a threshold matter, the judge discredited the defendant\u2019s postconviction affidavit. This was not error. A defendant\u2019s \u201cself-serving affidavits and assertions are not sufficient, on their own, to raise a substantial issue\u201d warranting an evidentiary hearing. <em>Denis, supra </em>at 633-634, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scoggins, </em>439 Mass. 571, 578 (2003). \u201cThe judge was entitled to reject summarily any claim supported only by the defendant\u2019s self-serving affidavits, and infer from his own observation of the defendant and counsel at trial that they were conferring over precisely the matter the defendant now claims was never discussed.\u201d <em>Lucien, supra </em>at 672-673.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Therefore, the judge considered only the affidavit submitted by counsel and his own observations of the defendant interacting with counsel during the proceedings. See Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (c) (3); <em>Denis, supra. </em>In his affidavit, the defendant\u2019s counsel did not state that he neglected to inform his client that the decision to testify belonged solely to him. Rather, he claimed a lack of memory. \u201cIf the theory of the motion, as presented by the papers, is not credible or not persuasive, holding an evidentiary hearing to have the witnesses repeat the same evidence (and be subject to the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination further highlighting the weaknesses in that evidence) will accomplish nothing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, supra </em>at 348-349. The judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that an evidentiary hearing would serve no purpose here beyond duplicative recitation of the statements proffered in the defendant\u2019s self-serving affidavit, and his counsel\u2019s equally unhelpful submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">We similarly conclude that the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial was not manifestly unjust. A defendant has the burden of proving that his waiver of his right to testify was invalid. <em>Lucien, supra </em>at 671, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 635, 641-642 (1990). He must \u201cprove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that, but for his counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>erroneous advice ... he would have testified in his own defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 642. It is not enough to say that counsel had discouraged him from testifying. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>438 Mass. 766, 776-777, cert, denied, 540 U.S. 850 (2003). The defendant must show that waiver of the right was neither voluntary nor intelligent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, supra </em>at 335-336.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The judge concluded that the defendant discussed his desire to testify with his counsel on at least three occasions. During these conversations, the defendant stated his desire to testify, and the counsel responded that \u201cin [his] view\u201d the defendant should not. The judge found that the counsel \u201cdid not do or say anything to indicate that Marrero could not testify without his permission.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, as the trial transcript reflects, at the end of the defendant\u2019s case, defense counsel asked for time to speak to his client. A discussion, held off the record, then ensued between the defendant and counsel, at the conclusion of which the defense rested. The Commonwealth argues, and we agree, that the context and timing of this discussion permits the inference that the defendant and counsel discussed further whether the defendant would testify at this, the last possible juncture where the decision could be made. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In all, the defendant has failed to meet the burden of proving that he did not voluntarily and intelligently relinquish his right to testify, and on that basis the motion was properly denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>See Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, supra </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant contends that two statements made by his counsel during closing argument were highly prejudicial because they aligned the jurors with the prosecution, trivialized their somber fact-finding function, and diluted the rigor of the reasonable doubt standard of proof required to convict. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bonds, 424 Mass. 698, 701-702 (1997) (judge\u2019s charge to jury); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 129 (1977) (same). First, at the outset of his closing argument to the jury, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re involved in a capital case, usually you get to deal with whoever is at the top of the food chain. And this is that type of case. [The prosecutor], he wants to win; I want to win. The interesting thing is both of us demand justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201c[The prosecutor] has as his clients you, members of the Commonwealth. Those people over there [the victim\u2019s family], they demand justice. They lost a life that was close to them. He deserves your consideration. It\u2019s important that you do that and exercise the oath that you took, because while this may not be the most important decision you ever make in your life, it will be an important decision, probably one that you\u2019ll remember for a long time. The defendant, the same thing, he deserves your consideration. He demands justice. That\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Just a few seconds later, still at the beginning of the closing argument, defense counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">\u201cI suggest to you that oftentimes [the prosecutor] and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>appear before jurors arguing capital cases, and most of the time it depends on the hand that you\u2019re dealt. And I suggest to you that this is sort of like Texas Hold \u2018Em. He has two hold cards that are down, and those hold cards, that\u2019s Ms. Cruz and Mr. Gonzalez. That\u2019s really his case. If you believe those witnesses, then my client must be guilty. If you don\u2019t believe those two witnesses, then my client must be innocent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The defendant argues that by framing his closing argument with these two introductory statements, his counsel sounded three themes, all which worked to his client\u2019s detriment: (1) the jurors were aligned with the prosecution as \u201cclients\u201d of the prosecutor; (2) the trial was merely a \u201cpoker game\u201d between two experienced attorneys where the winner was the lawyer with the best cards; and (3) the jury\u2019s decision, though memorable, was not \u201cthe most important decision\u201d they will ever make.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Together, the defendant argues that these statements would have impermissibly created a preference for the prosecution\u2019s evidence, and diluted the exacting nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt by equating that standard with \u201cimportant decisions affecting [the jury\u2019s] own economic or social lives,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, supra </em>at 128, and worse, a poker game. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">For claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in capital cases, we review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to determine whether there exists a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. This is a standard of review that is \u201cmore favorable to a defendant\u201d than that set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>453 Mass. 203, 204-205 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681-682 (1992). We do not discern error in defense counsel\u2019s statements that would create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>To begin, the statements on which the defendant relies occurred early in his counsel\u2019s argument and must be \u201cconsidered in the context of the entire argument, and in light of the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 333-334 (2000). Although defense counsel seemed to equalize, if not minimize, the Commonwealth\u2019s rigorous burden of proof in his early statements, he concluded his summation with an appropriate admonition to the jurors: \u201cYou need to analyze whether or not you believe the statements of [the witnesses] under the standards that the judge tells you as to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and listen to what he says.\u201d This followed a lengthy and vigorous attack on the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s principal witnesses, in which counsel assailed Cruz\u2019s multiple conflicting statements and the fact that she was on heroin while observing the crime, and impugned the adverse implications of Gonzalez\u2019s cooperation agreement with the Commonwealth. Similarly, in his charge to the jury, the judge defined the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving the elements of each crime beyond a reasonable doubt precisely as we set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850). The judge\u2019s charge to the jury explaining the reasonable doubt standard without any perceptible deviation from the model formulation was sufficient to cure any confusion that could have arisen from counsel\u2019s rhetoric at the beginning of his closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, supra. </em>Viewing this instruction in light of the remainder of counsel\u2019s summation, there was no discernible error that \u201cwas likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, supra </em>at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Nor do we conclude that any individual statement complained of by the defendant, when viewed in isolation, created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. First, although the statement that the prosecutor had the members of the jury \u201cas his clients\u201d was ill advised, this misstep in speech is best understood as an \u201cawkward rhetorical flourish\u201d to counsel\u2019s greater argument that both parties in the case, including the defendant, demanded justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 236-237 (1991) (finding no reversible error in defense counsel\u2019s statement that \u201cburden of proof is on the government, on the Commonwealth, of which you are a part, and the burden is on you ... to hear all this evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Second, while counsel\u2019s statement that the jury\u2019s decision \u201cmay not be the most important decision\u201d they ever make was unfortunate, it was immediately followed by the admonition that \u201cit will be an important decision\u201d and \u201cprobably one that you\u2019ll remember for a long time.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 237. Any diminution of either the solemnity of the jury\u2019s fact-finding function in a capital case or the quantum of proof required to meet the reasonable doubt standard that could implicitly be found in counsel\u2019s statement did not rise to the level of triviality that we have concluded merited reversal in the past. His statement is more akin to a verbal stumble on the way to his broader point that, in fact, emphasized the seriousness of maintaining fidelity to the notion of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Lastly, while the statement analogizing the case to a poker game may have been an ill-advised attempt at colloquial humor and analogy, it did not amount to a reversible diminution of the reasonable doubt standard of proof, nor did it marginalize the solemnity of the jury\u2019s duty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Silva, 388 Mass. 495, 508 (1983). Perhaps the analogy was too convoluted, or did not register with the jury, but we acknowledge \u201c[a] certain measure of jury sophistication in dealing with argument . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>419 Mass. 114, 119 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In sum, several, and perhaps even all, of the statements complained of by the defendant were improvident, but the \u201cguaranty of the right to counsel is not an assurance to defendants of brilliant representation or one free of mistakes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>364 Mass. 1, 13-14 (1973). After examination of the isolated statements, and in view of their context in the closing argument as a whole, we do not conclude they amounted to error that \u201cwas likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">4. <em>Joint venture instruction. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred by not entering required findings of not guilty on the charges of murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree, and unlawful possession of a firearm, on theories of joint venture liability, and erred thereafter in instructing the jury on joint venture liability. The jury returned their guilty verdicts on a general verdict form, which did not indicate whether their decision rested on a principal or joint venture theory of liability, both of which were presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The defendant\u2019s argument rests on statements by this court, in cases of older vintage, that when the Commonwealth proceeds on a joint venture theory of criminal liability, it \u201cmust present evidence that a principal other than the defendant committed the [offense].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>440 Mass. 741, 745 (2004). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. 771, 779 (1995). Here, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth presented no witnesses, nor any forensic evidence, that offered even the faintest suggestion that any of the defendant\u2019s coventurers fired the fatal gunshot, or were in possession of a firearm. Therefore, the evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant on a joint venture theory. On review, we do not \u201cexamine the sufficiency of the evidence separately as to principal and joint venture liability\u201d; rather, \u201cwe . . . examine whether the evidence is sufficient to permit a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged, with the intent required to commit the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 468 (2009). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Housen, </em>458 Mass. 702, 706-707 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The evidence in this case was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant shot and killed Jose Costoso, and that he harbored the requisite intent to commit the crime of murder in the first degree. Both Cruz and Gonzalez placed the defendant at the scene of the crime and identified him as the shooter. Moreover, forensic testing revealed that a single particle of gunshot residue on the cuff of the defendant\u2019s jacket was consistent with Seiller &amp; Bellot ammunition. Police retrieved shell casings from Seiller &amp; Bellot ammunition at the scene of the killing. While the defendant\u2019s counsel aggressively challenged the scientific validity of gunshot residue testing methods in cross-examining the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness, the jury were entitled to assign their own weight to the forensic evidence. Additionally, from Garces\u2019s statement, \u201cI thought you wanted to beat Omar,\u201d the jury could have found that the motive for the killing was to settle a score between \u201cOmar\u201d and the victim, Costoso. As for the issue whether the defendant demonstrated the requisite intent to permit a finding of guilty on the charge of murder in the first degree, at trial, Gonzalez testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>defendant said, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d before shooting Costoso. If believed, this was sufficient evidence to prove the defendant acted with specific intent to commit murder. Therefore, the evidence at trial was sufficient \u201cto permit a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged, with the intent required to commit the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">5. <em>G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the briefs, the entire record, all the issues, and the arguments of counsel. We see no reason to exercise our powers under G.

They were all tried separately. Gonzalez pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Reyes was convicted of murder in the second degree and other charges. The Appeals Court affirmed the convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 1115 (2009). Garces pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\">In the interim, Cruz had made several statements to private investigators working on behalf of the men charged with Costoso\u2019s murder. She told an investigator working for Reyes that she never saw the shooter\u2019s face, and she signed a statement drafted by another investigator in which she said that the shooter \u201clooked like a teenager\u201d (the defendant was, in fact, almost thirty years of age at the time). She was cross-examined vigorously at trial regarding these conflicting statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The defendant had not filed a motion in limine either challenging the admissibility of this evidence or requesting a <em>Lanigan </em>hearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 24-26 (1994). Its admissibility is not challenged on appeal, and on the record before us, its admission was not error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pytou Heang, </em>458 Mass. 827, 851 (2011) (upholding admissibility of expert testimony regarding gunshot residue analysis).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The judge originally denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>an evidentiary hearing by writing \u201cdenied\u201d on the face of the motion, and entering that ruling on the docket. After oral argument, we entered an order remanding the case to the judge for the purpose of having him provide a statement of his specific reasons for denial of the motion, and denial of the request for an evidentiary hearing. Pursuant to our order, on February 4, 2011, we received a memorandum of decision and order on the defendant\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing and a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel was very experienced in the practice of criminal law, having defended numerous clients in capital cases. It would not have been inappropriate for the judge to consider such experience in determining whether defense counsel (although claiming not to remember one way or the other) would have neglected to advise the defendant correctly on such a fundamental matter routinely arising in criminal trials. See <em>Matter of Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>739 F.2d 1354, 1358 (8th Cir. 1984) (in ineffectiveness claim, \u201c[w]e also consider counsel\u2019s experience\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevlin, </em>433 Mass. 305, 316 (2001) (decision based on advice of counsel \u201cwith considerable experience\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The defendant does not argue that his counsel\u2019s decision to discourage him from testifying, as opposed to failing to inform him that it was his decision to waive that right, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Even if he had, this discouragement did not amount to an error \u201clikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion\u201d or otherwise create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). Such advice would best be characterized as a \u201ctactical decision\u201d that only rises to the level of ineffectiveness \u201cif it was manifestly unreasonable when made.\u201d <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 827 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>427 Mass. 816, 822 (1998). The record is silent in this regard, but we can postulate that the defendant\u2019s counsel had tactical reasons to support his advice that were not \u201cmanifestly unreasonable,\u201d such as sheltering the defendant from impeachment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>458 Mass. 791, 804-805 (2011). Even still, to constitute ineffectiveness, we would have to determine that the jury would have likely believed the defendant\u2019s self-serving and (apparently) uncorroborated alibi over both the testimony of Cruz and Gonzalez that placed the defendant at the scene, and the physical evidence suggesting the defendant had fired a gun with ammunition matching the shell casings found at the scene. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, supra. </em>We do not so conclude.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The defendant also argues that the prejudice created by these remarks was exacerbated by counsel\u2019s repeated reference to his decades of experience in trying capital cases. Among other statements, counsel told the jury he was an attorney \u201cat the top of the food chain,\u201d and had \u201cbeen doing this for thirty-four years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
