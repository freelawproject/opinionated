We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The following facts and circumstances were set forth in the affidavit of State Trooper Scott D. McGrath that was filed in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department in support of his application for a warrant to intercept and record the defendant\u2019s conversations. On the night of May 21, 2007, at 11:30 p.m., Brockton police officers found John Lima dead from multiple gunshot wounds in the driver\u2019s seat of a red Nissan Altima automobile. At the scene, an officer spoke with Jorell Archer, a passenger in the vehicle. Archer stated that, while on Main Street, a vehicle \u201ctailed\u201d the Nissan Altima at an unusually close distance and activated its high beam lights. The driver of the vehicle changed lanes and accelerated until he was driving adjacent to the passenger side of the Nissan Altima as it was driven by Lima. The occupants of the vehicle began shooting, shattering the passenger side window of the Nissan Altima and striking Lima. At the scene of the shooting, investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>gators found fourteen spent shell casings, ten from bullets fired from a .22 caliber gun, and four from bullets fired from a .40 caliber gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Police interviewed Lima\u2019s sister, the registered owner of the red Nissan Altima. She stated that her brother arrived at her home in Brockton with Archer on the evening of May 21, 2007, to borrow the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">A witness observed the entire shooting from his front porch. This witness reported to police that he saw three black males in a dark-colored Chevrolet \u201cMalibu Max\u201d sedan drive past seconds after hearing several gunshots. He printed a picture from an Internet Web site of a Chevrolet Malibu Max vehicle similar in appearance to the vehicle he observed, and provided it to the officers. The following day, May 22, State troopers observed a gray Chevrolet Malibu in Brockton, and after losing sight of the vehicle for several minutes, spotted it again on a nearby street and alerted its driver to pull over. The vehicle\u2019s driver was Christopher Hanson, and the passengers were Tavares and Eddie Ortega. The gray Chevrolet Malibu was registered to Enterprise Rent-A-Car of Boston, Inc., and had been rented by Deolinda Andrade of Brockton. Because Hanson, Tavares, and Ortega were not authorized to operate the Chevrolet Malibu under Andrade\u2019s rental agreement, police towed the vehicle to the Brockton police department, and called Andrade to the station to claim it. The police apparently did not detain the three occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">At the station, Andrade told police that she rented the Chevrolet Malibu because her vehicle had burned. She stated that the defendant, Tavares, was her former boy friend, and she allowed him and his friend \u201cChris\u201d (whom police believed to be Hanson) to borrow the vehicle. Police officers then brought the witness who had observed the shooting from his porch to a police garage where the gray Chevrolet Malibu was stored. On entering the garage, without prompting, the witness asked, \u201cHow did you get it here so fast?\u201d At the garage, the witness told police that the driver of the shooters\u2019 vehicle \u201ctook the comer very wide\u201d while fleeing, and drove over a curb. This, the witness told police, means the vehicle driven in the shooting would likely have scrape marks from the curb on the undercarriage. A detective examined the vehicle and observed scrape marks under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the front quarter of the driver\u2019s side and rear bumper on the passenger side.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On May 25, 2007, Trooper McGrath asked a confidential police informant (informant), whose identity was not revealed in the affidavit, for information regarding the murder of Lima.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The informant stated that he had known Tavares for years, and correctly identified him in a photographic array. The informant told Trooper McGrath that he knew Tavares to carry a black .22 caliber pistol capable of holding eleven rounds of ammunition. The informant said Tavares had purchased the gun (which was stolen in New Hampshire) from Jose Santos two months prior to the May 21, 2007, shooting. The informant also related that some time in April, 2007, Tavares told the informant that he \u201cshot off the whole clip\u201d from the same gun at a man in an apartment on Exchange Street in Brockton. Tavares allegedly told the informant that he shot the man for stealing a gun from Santos, and even though Santos had forgiven the man, Tavares refused to \u201clet it go.\u201d The informant also knew Santos to carry a .22 caliber gun. A man he knew as \u201cEddie,\u201d who the informant identified in a photograph array by selecting a picture of Ortega, was known to carry a .40 caliber pistol, and allegedly used the weapon when \u201che shot up Exchange St.\u201d following a 2006 murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The informant often acted informally as a \u201cmeans of transportation\u201d for Santos, Tavares, and Ortega. Earlier in the day of Lima\u2019s murder, the informant telephoned Tavares and asked if he needed a ride anywhere, and Tavares responded that he was driving \u201cShorty\u2019s rental,\u201d presumably meaning the vehicle rented by his former girl friend, Andrade. That night Santos was dining with the informant when he received a telephone call from Tavares requesting a meeting at the \u201cM.\u201d The informant stated that \u201cthey,\u201d inferably meaning some group of individuals including Santos and Tavares, were renting a first-floor apartment on Market Street in Brockton, which they call the \u201cM.\u201d The informant stated that the apartment\u2019s primary resident is a man named \u201cGreg,\u201d which was corroborated by information known to the Brockton police that a Gregory Tobias resided there.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Santos and the informant arrived at the \u201cM\u201d shortly after midnight on the night of the shooting. When they arrived, Tavares and a man the informant knew only as \u201cC\u201d (whom he later identified as Hanson) were in the driveway of the \u201cM.\u201d At the \u201cM,\u201d Tavares and Santos retreated to a back room and had a discussion lasting approximately five minutes, to which the informant was not privy. Tavares later told the informant that Santos was angry because Tavares \u201cdid the dude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The day after the shooting, May 22, Tavares telephoned the informant and advised him to \u201ctrust [me]\u201d and \u201cget rid\u201d of his, the informant\u2019s, cellular telephone. Tavares told the informant that the police \u201csnatched up \u2018D,\u2019 \u201d presumably meaning his former girl friend, Andrade, and that she told the police Tavares\u2019s cellular telephone number. Tavares then asked the informant to meet him at an apartment on Newbury Street in Brockton, and at this meeting, he told the informant that abandoning the cellular telephones was necessary because of the \u201chomeboy that I bodied last night.\u201d Tavares also told the informant, \u201cWe got bagged in the rental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The following day, May 23, Tavares again telephoned the informant and said, \u201cI see you don\u2019t listen, you still have your phone.\u201d Tavares needed to be picked up from the \u201cM\u201d in the informant\u2019s automobile. In the informant\u2019s vehicle, Tavares said that as long as \u201cdude,\u201d inferably meaning Archer, the passenger in the red Nissan Altima, \u201cisn\u2019t talking,\u201d Tavares would not get caught. According to the informant, Tavares further stated that he knew the police were examining the gray Chevrolet Malibu and that he\u2019s \u201ccaught a gun case before.\u201d He further told the informant that when he and Hanson were pulled over by State troopers the day after the shooting, they briefly evaded the troopers, and \u201cthrew the burner (gun) out the window.\u201d When police released Tavares and Hanson from custody, Tavares retrieved the gun, and stashed it at the \u201cM.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In his conversations with police, the informant stated that he learned that the victim, Lima, was \u201cSantos\u2019 boy,\u201d and that Tavares stated that he was friends with Lima too, and \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to [shoot] him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">On May 25, 2007, Tavares asked the informant to bring cigarettes and marijuana to Ortega, who was staying at a home in Fall River. That same day, the informant met Tavares in Fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>River, and Tavares showed him a .22 caliber Walther handgun. The informant said that Tavares and Ortega had been moving from apartment to apartment following the shooting in an attempt to remain undetected. As such, Trooper McGrath averred in his affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201cPaulo Tavares, Chris Hanson, Eddie Ortega or as yet any unknown co-conspirators are participating in an ongoing conspiracy relative to the crimes of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, accessory after the fact of murder, and intimidation of a witness, which are all crimes related to the murder of John Lima. . . . Further . . . that Paulo Tavares\u2019 and Eddie Ortega\u2019s oral communications will constitute material evidence .... Accordingly, I request that a search warrant be issued authorizing the secret interception of oral communications of Paulo Tavares and Eddie Ortega . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">A District Court judge issued a general search warrant by signing McGrath\u2019s application for a general warrant pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ultimately, the informant wore a concealed recording device and intercepted at least two conversations where Tavares can be heard making inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">A Plymouth County grand jury indicted Tavares for murder, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1; armed assault with intent to murder, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18 <em>(b); </em>and unlawful possession of a firearm, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>Prior to trial, Tavares filed a motion to suppress the admission of statements made on the surreptitious audio recordings, which the Superior Court judge granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">2. <em>The wiretap statute. </em>In 1968, the Legislature rewrote the wiretap statute, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, as appearing in St. 1968, c. 738, \u00a7 1, substantially overhauling a framework that had been in place since 1959. St. 1959, c. 449, \u00a7 1. The legislation had first been introduced in 1920. St. 1920, c. 558. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, </em>439 Mass. 64, 68 n.9 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>434 Mass. 594, 598-599 (2001). Alarmed by the commercial availability of sophisticated surveillance devices and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ease with which they facilitated surreptitious recording of private citizens, the Legislature appointed a special commission in 1964 to investigate electronic eavesdropping and \u201censure that unjustified and overly broad intrusions on rights of privacy are avoided.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass. 224, 231 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyde, supra </em>at 598; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 280 n.7 (1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982); Report of the Special Commission on Electronic Eavesdropping, 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1132, at 7, 18-19. The Legislature ultimately adopted the special commission\u2019s recommendation to prohibit nonconsensual electronic surveillance by individuals and law enforcement officers. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 C 1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra. </em>However, the Legislature also took pains to ensure that the bold new protections would not frustrate effective investigation and prosecution of \u201corganized crime\u201d enterprises, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A, which operated \u201cthrough layers of insulation and behind a wall of secrecy.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra. </em>The statutory amendments were \u201ccarefully worded and unambiguous,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyde, supra </em>at 598, and included a preamble, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A, declaring the Legislature\u2019s twin objectives to (1) curtail \u201cthe uncontrolled development and unrestricted use of modern electronic surveillance devices,\u201d which the Legislature termed a danger \u201cto the privacy of all citizens,\u201d and to (2) combat the \u201cgrave danger to the public welfare and safety\u201d and \u201clegitimate business activities\u201d posed by \u201cthe increasing activities of organized crime.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 276-277. Thus, the \u201csecret use of such [electronic surveillance] devices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>by private individuals [was] prohibited,\u201d and the \u201cuse of such devices by law enforcement officials [was to] be conducted under strict judicial supervision and . . . <em>limited to the investigation of organized </em>crime\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>454 Mass. 542, 553 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 280 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">To that end, the wiretap statute is framed largely in negative terms: surreptitious \u201cinterception\u201d of any \u201coral communication,\u201d by any person (private citizen or public official) is proscribed, except as specifically provided in a few narrow exceptions. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 C 1. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyde, supra </em>at 597; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 275. As defined by the statute, the term \u201cinterception\u201d \u201cmeans to secretly hear, secretly record, or aid another to secretly hear or secretly record the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any intercepting device by any person other than a person given prior authority by all parties to such communication. \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4. Of the exceptions to the proscription on interception of oral communications without the consent of all parties, two are of relevance in this case. First, \u201cany person duly authorized\u201d may obtain a judicially issued warrant by submitting an application in conformity with the requirements of the wiretap statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 D 1 d, E, and F (warrant exception).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>exception is available when the party surreptitiously recording the oral communications is an investigative or law enforcement officer investigating a \u201cdesignated offense,\u201d and that officer is either (1) a party to the communication or (2) has advance authorization from a party to the communication to intercept the conversation. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4 (one-party consent exception). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 275-276.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The common qualifying predicate for both of these exceptions is the existence of an investigation concerning a \u201cdesignated offense.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4 and E 2. That is, one of several specifically enumerated crimes, including murder, when the offenses are committed \u201cin connection with organized crime as defined in the preamble.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 7. The preamble specifically defines \u201corganized crime\u201d to mean \u201ca continuing conspiracy among highly organized and disciplined groups to engage in supplying illegal goods and services.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. Reading the plain language of the preamble\u2019s definition of \u201corganized crime,\u201d in concert with the clear legislative intent substantially to limit the availability of wiretapping in criminal investigations, we have stated that the one-party consent exception is \u201ca narrow exception to the broad statutory prohibition against warrantless surveillance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 279 (\u201cLegislature proceeded on the premise that electronic surveillance is anathema except within certain narrowly prescribed boundaries\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In this case, to admit in evidence the surreptitiously recorded communications between Tavares and a confidential informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>working with State police investigators, the Commonwealth must meet the criteria imposed by either the warrant exception or the one-party consent exception. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 276; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass. 224, 231-233 (1975). The Commonwealth concedes, as it must, that the warrant exception does not apply.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Thus, the sole issue for review is whether the Commonwealth, through Trooper McGrath\u2019s affidavit, demonstrated that the interception of Tavares\u2019s oral communications would disclose evidence of the commission of a designated offense in connection with \u201ca continuing conspiracy among highly organized and disciplined groups to engage in supplying illegal goods and services,\u201d as required by the one-party exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the information set forth in Trooper McGrath\u2019s affidavit establishes a nexus between the drive-by killing of Lima and the pursuits of an organized crime enterprise in which Tavares participated as a principal. Thus, the Commonwealth contends, the one-party consent communications, involving Tavares and recorded surreptitiously by a police informant, do not violate the wiretap statute\u2019s prohibition on \u201csecret transmission or recording of oral communications without the consent of all parties.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61, 66 (1987), citing G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4 and C 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Specifically, the Commonwealth argues that Trooper McGrath\u2019s affidavit presents evidence that Tavares, Ortega, and Hanson deliberately targeted either Lima or Archer, or both, in a carefully coordinated execution. It points to the fact that the men identified the red Nissan Altima just minutes after Lima\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>sister lent him the vehicle, suggesting surveillance and premeditation. It also points to evidence of discipline and organization in renting and meeting at the \u201cM,\u201d a central locus known to all of them. Further, the Commonwealth argues that the descriptions of Tavares\u2019s interactions with Santos suggest the group\u2019s hierarchical structure, with Santos occupying an unspecified position of supervisory authority. Tavares spoke with Santos immediately following the killing of Lima, and Tavares related to the informant that Santos was upset that Tavares \u201cdid the dude,\u201d presumably referring to Lima. Last, the group proved adept at conspiring to cover up the killing by evading police, concealing the murder weapon at the \u201cM,\u201d and retreating to several locations outside of Brockton to remain \u201cundetected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The Commonwealth also stresses that Tavares, Santos, and Ortega were all known to carry guns and commit violent crimes relating to ownership of those guns. Tavares had purchased a .22 caliber gun, which he was known to carry, from Santos. Santos previously owned a different .22 caliber gun. Ortega was reputed to carry a .40 caliber gun, and reportedly used the weapon when \u201che shot up Exchange St.\u201d in 2006. Tavares told the informant, despite Santos\u2019s admonition to \u201clet it go,\u201d that he murdered another man in the past for stealing a gun owned by Santos. The Commonwealth argues that this constellation of facts gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that the commission of the crimes described in the affidavit was part of \u201can effort to protect both the business and its organization.\u201d While the affidavit \u201clacked a clear picture of the players involved\u201d in killing Lima, the Commonwealth contends that the affidavit presented sufficient facts to prove that the \u201cnature of the crime involved here lends itself to inferences of discipline and organization.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>406 Mass. 135, 142 &amp; n.10 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In determining whether a nexus with organized crime exists, the Commonwealth must satisfy the burden of demonstrating that its \u201cdecision to intercept was made on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that interception would disclose or lead to evidence of a designated offense in connection with organized crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>380 Mass. 271, 281 (1981), cert, denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982). \u201cThe standard of reasonable suspicion is an objective one; it is met by a showing of articulable facts from which a reasonable person could conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>interception would lead to evidence of a designated offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>454 Mass. 542, 556 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, </em>428 Mass. 725, 737 (1999). Murder is an enumerated \u201cdesignated offense\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 7, so the only showing required from the Commonwealth is that Tavares\u2019s participation in Lima\u2019s murder occurred in connection with \u201corganized crime,\u201d as defined in the wiretap statute\u2019s preamble.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u201cThe definition of organized crime as \u2018a <em>continuing </em>conspiracy among highly organized and disciplined groups to engage in <em>supplying illegal goods and services\u2019 . . . </em>conceives of organized crime as a continuing criminal operation usually, but not necessarily, for pecuniary ends\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. To that end, we have said that to satisfy the wiretap statute\u2019s definition of organized crime, the Commonwealth must offer \u201csome evidence of an ongoing illegal business operation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 277 n.6 (noting that statutory definitions of organized crime in other jurisdictions focus on elements of organization, discipline, and provision of illegal goods and services).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In addition to the supply of illegal goods and services, the other signature of \u201corganized crime\u201d activity is discipline. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, supra </em>at 737. The \u201cdistinction between more \u2018garden-variety\u2019 criminal activity, where wiretapping is impermissible,\u201d and \u201corganized crime,\u201d as defined by the wiretap statute, is the \u201chigh degree of discipline and organization\u201d required to plan and coordinate the latter. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[w]hile \u2018the class of people subject to wiretaps includes more than full-time professional criminals,\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, supra </em>at 737, quoting <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 277 n.6, coordination of efforts among cohorts standing alone is insufficient.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, supra </em>at 557. \u201cFor a conspiracy to commit an offense enumerated in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 7, to rise to the level of organized crime, there must, at the very least, be an organized plan from which one reasonably may infer the existence of an ongoing criminal operation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">While the facts adduced in Trooper McGrath\u2019s affidavit evince some measure of organization, the dispositive factor is that the affidavit singularly fails to establish any evidence that the fraternization of Tavares, Ortega, Hanson, and Santos promoted the supply of \u201cillegal goods and services\u201d or the furtherance of an \u201congoing illegal <em>business </em>operation\u201d as the controlling definition of organized crime requires (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Long, supra </em>at 556, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 277 n.6. While the evidence that the group convened at the \u201cM,\u201d that they possessed guns, and that some members may have committed retributive killings in the past provides glimmers of the existence of a putative street gang, there is no information beyond speculation that Tavares or any other party was involved in a pecuniary enterprise, such as drug, gun, or contraband trafficking, or promoted some other unifying criminal purpose. Unlike the kidnapping for ransom in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, supra, </em>or the murder plot to collect insurance proceeds in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, supra, </em>no motive or plot is even alluded to in the affidavit. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, supra </em>at 557, the evidence of meetings and plans to conceal the killing of Lima, without more, demonstrates only \u201ccoordination of efforts among cohorts,\u201d which we said, \u201cstanding alone is insufficient\u201d to prove a nexus with organized crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Although the affidavit avers that Santos sold Tavares a .22 caliber gun, this exchange amounted to a single isolated transaction, not evidence of the type of \u201congoing, multi-transactional criminal enterprise\u201d that is required to meet the wiretap statute\u2019s narrow definition of organized crime, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A and B 7. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, supra </em>at 558. Moreover, even if illegal gun possession formed the basis of what the Commonwealth strains to paint as a \u201chighly organized and disciplined\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>criminal enterprise, there is not a scintilla of evidence in the affidavit that the designated offense (the murder of Lima) was committed \u201cin connection\u201d with that organized criminal trade as required to qualify for the one-party consent exception. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, supra. </em>By the alleged murderer\u2019s own account, the killing of Lima was an accident. Tavares told the informant that Lima was \u201cSantos\u2019 boy,\u201d and Tavares was friends with the victim too, and \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to hit him [with gunfire].\u201d If Archer, the passenger in the car Lima was driving, was the intended target, or there was some other motive linked to protecting or advancing the supply of \u201cillegal goods and services,\u201d as required by the one-party consent exception, the affidavit is problematically silent in that respect. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In addition to omitting evidence of a pecuniary or illegal business purpose, the affidavit contains information indicating that the group, as a unit, did not demonstrate \u201cother hallmarks of organized crime \u2014 discipline, organization, and a continuing nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the affidavit contains indicia of Santos\u2019s status as the putative leader of this group, there is other evidence that he lacked authority. As discussed, Tavares shot and killed Lima, even though Lima was a known friend of Santos and was not the target of the drive-by shooting. Moreover, in the past, Tavares killed another man who allegedly stole a gun from Santos, despite Santos\u2019s pleas to \u201clet it go.\u201d These facts suggest a continuing roguish or free-agent quality to Tavares\u2019s allegedly violent impulses, rather than an organized criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In sum, while street gangs that coordinate to commit violent acts may otherwise qualify as organized criminal entities, a member of a group or gang, like any other citizen of the Commonwealth, may not be surreptitiously wiretapped unless law enforcement meets its burden of demonstrating an objectively reasonable suspicion that the group has committed a designated offense in pursuit of organized efforts to supply illicit goods or services. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A, B 4, and C 1. In contrast to the Federal wiretap statute and the statutes of many other States, the Massachusetts wiretap statute conscientiously labors to afford only a narrow window of exception to its prohibition of warrantless wiretapping. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4. Having failed in the affidavit to establish a nexus between the drive-by killing of Lima and organized crime, as defined in the wiretap statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the Commonwealth, in turn, failed to meet the rigors of that narrow exception. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A and B 4; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, supra </em>at 556-558; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 279-281.

Organized crime, as it exists in the commonwealth today, consists of a continuing conspiracy among highly organized and disciplined groups to engage in supplying illegal goods and services. In supplying these goods and services organized crime commits unlawful acts and employs brutal and violent tactics. Organized crime is infiltrating legitimate business activities and depriving honest businessmen of the right to make a living.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u201cThe general court further finds that because organized crime carries on its activities through layers of insulation and behind a wall of secrecy, government has been unsuccessful in curtailing and eliminating it. Normal investigative procedures are not effective in the investigation of illegal acts committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>by organized crime. Therefore, law enforcement officials must be permitted to use modem methods of electronic surveillance, under strict judicial supervision, when investigating these organized criminal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u201cThe general court further finds that the uncontrolled development and unrestricted use of modem electronic surveillance devices pose grave dangers to the privacy of all citizens of the commonwealth. Therefore, the secret use of such devices by private individuals must be prohibited. The use of such devices by law enforcement officials must be conducted under strict judicial supervision and should be limited to the investigation of organized crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b316-11\">The amendments to the Massachusetts wiretap statute enacted in 1968 marked a significant departure from the framework of the earlier statute, and that of most States and the comparable Federal electronic surveillance statute, that generally permitted warrantless wiretapping with the consent of one party to the communication. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>434 Mass. 594, 599 &amp; n.5 (2001), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 280 n.7 (1981), cert, denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982).

However, applications for wiretapping warrants must be filed under \u00a7 99 E of the wiretap statute, and must comport with the rigorous and sui generis requirements of \u00a7 99 F. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>Similarly, a judge may only issue a wiretapping warrant \u201c[ujpon a sworn application in conformity with\u201d the wiretap statute, and not as a general search warrant. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 E 1. Although a District Court judge granted Trooper McGrath\u2019s application for a warrant, the application did not comply with many of the requirements set forth in \u00a7 99 F, and the warrant exception is unavailable.

I agree with the court that an electronic interception of oral communications under G.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 7 and F 2 b.

Finally, I agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the information in the electronic surveillance affidavit, while it provided probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed a murder and that the requested oral interceptions would provide evidence of the defendant\u2019s participation in the murder, did not provide the required reasonable suspicion that the murder was \u201cin connection with organized crime,\u201d so the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress must be affirmed. I write separately because I believe that \u201cattention must be paid\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the consequences of the statutory language in \u00a7 99 that permits electronic surveillance only to obtain evidence of a designated offense \u201cin connection with organized crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">By limiting electronic surveillance to designated offenses \u201cin connection with organized crime,\u201d \u00a7 99 prohibits electronic surveillance from being used to investigate designated offenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>including murder, that are committed by disorganized criminal gangs or even by organized street gangs that do not engage in supplying illegal goods and services, such as narcotics. The consequence is that electronic surveillance is lost as a tool to investigate and prosecute a substantial share of the murders and shootings that occur in this Commonwealth \u2014 those committed by street gangs. \u201cBetween 1999 and 2006, the number of gang-related youth homicides [in Boston] had increased six-fold.\u201d Braga, Losing Faith? Police, Black Churches, and the Resurgence of Youth Violence in Boston, 6 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 141, 153 (2008). \u201cIn contrast to large and semi-organized gangs in Chicago and Los Angeles, Boston gangs were (and are) mostly small, informal, and loosely organized groups of youth,\u201d usually associated with a \u201cspecific street, neighborhood, or housing project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154. Perhaps as a consequence, a \u201cmajority of Boston youth homicides identified as gang-related were not about drugs, money, turf, or other issues in which the violence could be reasonably construed to be instrumental. They were usually personal and vendetta-like.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153 n.40.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Kennedy, Youth Violence in Boston: Gun Markets, Serious Youth Offenders, and a Use-Reduction Strategy, 59 L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 147, 153 (1996) (\u201curban environment has become so threatening even for youth not involved in the drug trade that many are arming themselves [and engaging in other nominally self-protective behavior such as joining gangs] for self-defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The loss of electronic surveillance (which includes not only \u201cbugging\u201d a room or a telephone but also the consensual \u201cwearing of a wire\u201d by a cooperating witness, as occurred in the instant case) as an investigative tool in gang shootings is even more troubling when one considers that these violent crimes are among the most difficult to solve because the witnesses to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>crimes are so reluctant to come forward to provide information and testimony for fear of violence, retaliation, and social ostracism. At a 2004 legislative hearing, the district attorney for Suffolk County estimated that \u201cissues of intimidation,\u201d described as victims or witnesses refusing to cooperate or changing or recanting earlier testimony, occurred in up to ninety per cent of his office\u2019s cases involving guns, gangs, or serious violence. There is no reason to believe that this percentage has fallen since then, or that other urban areas in the Commonwealth do not face comparable problems obtaining the cooperation of victims and witnesses in street gang shootings. See generally Woldoff, Stop Snitchin\u2019: Exploring Definitions of The Snitch and Implications for Urban Black Communities, 17 J. Crim. Just. &amp; Popular Culture 184 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In short, the legislative inclusion of five words, \u201cin connection with organized crime,\u201d means that electronic surveillance is unavailable to investigate and prosecute the hundreds of shootings and killings committed by street gangs in Massachusetts, which are among the most difficult crimes to solve and prosecute using more traditional means of investigation. If the Legislature wishes to avoid this result, it should amend \u00a7 99 to delete those words.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">A.
