(Northern), Bay State filed a petition for a general increase in its natural gas distribution rates. In that rate increase filing, Bay State sought to recover from its customers approximately $1.96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>million in costs previously offset by revenues from its subsidiary Northern. Focusing on Bay State\u2019s position during the earlier stock sale and transfer proceeding that the divestiture of its subsidiary would not have an impact on its customer rates in the near future, the department denied that request while allowing Bay State a general rate increase of $19 million. Bay State has appealed from the department\u2019s decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We outline the relevant facts based on the department\u2019s findings in the proceeding now before us, D.P.U. 09-30 (2009) (D.P.U. 09-30), supplemented by the department\u2019s findings in its earlier investigation into Bay State\u2019s stock sale and transfer request, D.P.U. 08-43-A (2008) (D.P.U. 08-43-A), and other relevant materials as indicated. Bay State, a Massachusetts public utility, provides retail gas distribution services to approximately 285,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers in its three noncontiguous operating districts of Springfield, Brockton, and Lawrence. The company is a subsidiary of Ni-Source Inc. (NiSource), an energy holding company headquartered in Indiana. On November 30, 2005, the department approved the implementation of a performance based regulation (PBR) plan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for Bay State. See Bay State Gas Co., D.T.E. 05-27 (2005). Bay State\u2019s PBR plan involved \u201ccast-off\u201d distribution rates based on cost of service/rate of return (COS/ROR) ratemaking principles,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> thereafter adjusted annually by a \u201cprice cap\u201d formula for the life of the plan. See generally <em>MCI Telecomm. Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; </em>Energy, 435 Mass. 144, 147 (2001). The price cap formula set the conditions for annual changes to account for general inflation but allowed for an offset to the inflation-based increase based on presumed productivity gains; adjustments also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>were possible under an earnings sharing mechanism (ESM) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that was part of the PER plan. The cap applied, although in a somewhat different manner, both to Bay State\u2019s aggregate rate-based revenue and to rate components applicable to classes of customers. The company\u2019s approved PBR plan was to operate for ten years, or until 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Until December, 2008, Bay State owned all the stock of Northern, a New Hampshire corporation serving approximately 52,000 customers in New Hampshire and Maine. Northern was treated as a \u201cbelow-the-line\u201d asset of the company.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bay State provided certain services to Northern, such as call center functions, accounting functions, field personnel workload coordination, and credit and collection activities. Similarly, Northern\u2019s sales staff assisted Bay State\u2019s sales function. The company and Northern charged each other for the services rendered pursuant to the terms of one or more operational service agreements between the entities; the net effect on an annual basis was a flow of $2,710,387 in revenue from Northern to Bay State in exchange for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">At some point before November, 2008, Bay State decided to sell Northern after determining that Northern\u2019s operations required additional support services. Additionally, Bay State determined that Northern was underperforming from a rate of return perspective, and that this underperformance had a negative effect on the company\u2019s ability to attract capital. Accordingly, Bay State sought the approval of the department for the sale of Northern to Unitil Corporation (Unitil), pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 96 (\u00a7 96).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the proceeding that followed (\u00a7 96 Northern proceeding), the department evaluated the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>posed sale and transfer based on the potential impact on Bay State\u2019s customer rates, among other factors. See D.P.U. 08-43-A at 21. The Attorney General intervened as of right in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding, see G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11E, and opposed the proposed sale in the absence of a rate mechanism to hold Bay State customers harmless once costs of administrative functions were spread over fewer customers. D.P.U. 08-43-A at 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">On November 18, 2008, after its review, the department approved the sale of Northern to Unitil.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its decision, the department stated that in reviewing the sale it employed the \u201cno net harm\u201d test. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 25-26. It noted the Attorney General\u2019s argument that the company could expect to incur $5.5 million in stranded costs for management and back-office services previously funded by Northern ratepayers, and that the department should address the potential impact of these additional costs on Massachusetts ratepayers in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding itself. <em>Id. </em>at 30-33. However, the department also noted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>company\u2019s contention that it proposed no rate changes as a result of the proposed stock sale; that even costs at the \u201cabsolute upper end\u201d amount of $5.14 million annually would represent only one per cent of the company\u2019s annual revenues, a cost variance the company considered to be \u201cinsignificant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 33-34; and that in any event, because of Bay State\u2019s PBR plan, the effect of Northern\u2019s sale would not be a factor in rates prior to 2011.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The department agreed with the company that the Attorney General\u2019s effort to quantify the impact of the proposed stock sale on Bay State\u2019s cost structure was premature where \u201cBay State\u2019s distribution rates are not presently affected by the sale of Northern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 40. Nevertheless, it \u201crecognize[d] the Attorney General\u2019s concern regarding the potential economic harm to Bay State\u2019s customers\u201d and directed the company \u201cto address any measures to mitigate the potential increase in its overhead expenses in its next base rate proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. Accordingly, in approving the sale, the department delayed until the expiration of Bay State\u2019s PBR plan a determination \u201cwhether there are any potential cost impacts\u201d associated with the sale and, if so, the \u201cappropriate ratemaking treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38-39.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">On April 16, 2009, Bay State filed under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>(\u00a7 94),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> its petition for a general increase in gas distribution rates (\u00a794 rate proceeding). The company explained that its filing was motivated by two factors. First, the department had issued a directive for all distribution companies to be operating under decoupling<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> plans by year-end 2012, with a preference for implementing decoupling mechanisms through a base rate proceeding. Because the company\u2019s PBR plan extended through November, 2016, the company believed it necessary to prepare a petition for \u00a7 94 base rate review in order to comply with the decoupling time frame. Second, the company faced an operating deficiency of $34.2 million caused, in the company\u2019s view, by factors including long-term inflationary pressures, unrecovered capital costs, adverse capital market conditions, and declining customer usage not anticipated when rates were set in 2005. The Attorney General intervened on April 24, 2009,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and represents the department in this appeal. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">After hearings in May and July, 2009, the department concluded that Bay State had the statutory right to seek rate relief, see \u00a7 94, but that establishment of new base rates subjected the company\u2019s PBR plan to termination because resetting base rates \u201ccompletely changes the dynamic\u201d of the rate plan from a customer\u2019s perspective. In the absence of a proposal from Bay State for a new PBR plan, the department employed a rate-making approach akin to a COS/ROR model, with revenue decoupling provisions but without automatic annual base rate adjustments. It considered and rejected Bay State\u2019s claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>$1,960,065 in costs previously offset by revenue from Northern should be built into test-year cost of service.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This figure, $1,960,065, represented the net value of adjustments Bay State argued were required in order to account for the elimination of Northern\u2019s contributions to shared services, after accounting for cost reductions Bay State\u2019s consultants, Concentric Energy Advisors (Concentric), estimated the company could achieve through service realignment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Bay State filed a timely appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, in the county court, requesting that the department\u2019s decision be set aside and the company be authorized to recover an additional $1,960,065 annually in net operating costs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Where a party seeks judicial review of the department\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">\u201cOur standard of review ... is well settled: a petition that raises no constitutional questions requires us to review the department\u2019s finding to determine only whether there is an error of law. . . .

Moreover, we give deference to the department\u2019s expertise and experience in areas where the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>lature has delegated to it decision-making authority, pursuant to G.

Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Public utilities may \u201ccharge rates which are compensatory with the full cost incurred by efficient management, [but] they may not recover costs which are excessive, unwarranted, or incurred in bad faith.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>387 Mass. 531, 539 (1982). Whenever a public utility, including a gas distribution company such as Bay State, petitions for a general rate increase, the department must investigate the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the proposed changes. G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94. In this context, a utility\u2019s revenue needs may be established by the test-year method, whereby the department examines a test period \u201con the theory that the revenue, expense, and rate base figures during that period accurately reflect the utility\u2019s present financial situation and fairly predict [its] future performance.\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 24 (1978). However, \u201c[t]o the extent that known or anticipated changes in revenues, expenses, or [assets] will distort the correlation among these elements, adjustments are made in the test-year data to reflect those changes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining the \u201cpropriety\u201d of rates in a \u00a7 94 proceeding, the department must find they are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>438 Mass. 256, 264 n.13 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Bay State argues that the department erred in denying recovery of costs incurred on an annual basis to support functions once shared with Northern such as call center activities, customer bill inquiries, service requests or terminations, data entry, communications, scheduling, and marketing. It points out that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>was no evidence presented or other claim made in the \u00a7 94 rate proceeding that these costs would not be incurred, that they would not be necessary to service customers, or that they were otherwise unreasonable; rather, the department\u2019s decision addressed only who should bear the costs (customers or shareholders). Because under Massachusetts law, Bay State argues, customers bear responsibility for paying for the reasonably and prudently incurred costs of providing utility services, the department erred in denying recovery of these costs without a finding that they were excessive, unwarranted, or incurred in bad faith. Bay State further contends that in any event the department had no discretion to require the company to absorb the impact of the Northern sale on operating costs when the department established no such requirement at the time it approved the Northern sale; any such condition could only have been imposed in the earlier decision on the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding. In effect, the company argues that in the \u00a7 94 rate proceeding the department was obliged to assess the propriety of adjustments to test-year costs solely on their own terms, as it was too late to establish any conditions in connection with the sale of Northern.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We affirm the department\u2019s decision. As previously indicated, in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding, the department expressly left open the \u201cappropriate ratemaking treatment\u201d to be afforded the operational cost impacts associated with the sale of Northern. See D.P.U. 08-43-A at 38-39. It was therefore appropriate, in the subsequent \u00a7 94 rate proceeding, to address proper treatment of once-shared functions in light of Bay State\u2019s assertions during the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding. Consistent with those prior statements by the company, the department could deny costs associated with the loss of Northern\u2019s shared services, in Bay State\u2019s words, \u201c[i]n the short term . . . .\u201d Put another way, adjustments to test-year revenues and expenses are appropriate only where \u201canticipated changes . . . will distort the correlation\u201d among revenue, expenses, and assets. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass, at 24. In the context of the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding, Bay State had characterized even a $5.14 million impact from the Northern sale on Bay State\u2019s cost structure as an \u201cinsignificant\u201d effect that would be mitigated or absorbed until 2011 at the very earliest. See D.P.U. 08-43-A at 34-35. The company\u2019s description entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the department to conclude, in the \u00a7 94 rate proceeding, that the anticipated change would not distort the relationship between revenue, expenses, and assets, and that therefore no adjustment in this respect was necessary in order for the test-year financial data to form a proper foundation for projected revenue recovery needs. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Bay State also challenges as unsupported by substantial evidence the department\u2019s conclusion that the company could achieve further cost savings beyond those Concentric identified. We disagree. We conclude that from an evidentiary perspective, the department properly relied on testimony by the company (in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding) that relevant costs were \u201cinsignificant\u201d and as such could be entirely mitigated or absorbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Similarly, we disagree with the company\u2019s position that the department\u2019s attention to the timing of the general rate increase filing was an error of law and arbitrary and capricious. The timing of the filing was made directly relevant by the company\u2019s argument in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Where the department reasonably expected, based on Bay State\u2019s assertions in that proceeding, that the company would work to mitigate stranded costs over several years before asking that customers absorb any remaining costs, the department could properly conclude that, \u201cless than one year\u201d later, it was \u201cinequitable\u201d to require ratepayers to bear the burden of Northern-related overhead \u201cat this time.\u201d The department\u2019s conclusion is entirely consistent with the company\u2019s position in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The department apparently attempted in the \u00a7 96 Northern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>proceeding to give Bay State some leeway on future recovery of reasonable costs previously offset by Northern, after a period of adjustment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The department\u2019s approach implicitly concedes that at some future point, perhaps by 2016, it would be appropriate for Bay State to recover reasonably and prudently incurred administrative costs once covered by Northern to the extent that the company was not able to mitigate them. However, this flexibility expressed by the department in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding is something very different from a grant of permission to transfer the negative impacts of the Northern sale \u2014 namely, the increase in servicing costs per customer \u2014 to Bay State\u2019s ratepaying customers prior to a real attempt or effort by the company to cut those additional costs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such a result would be at odds with the \u201cno net harm\u201d standard under which the Northern sale was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Finally, Bay State argues that the department is collaterally estopped from holding the company\u2019s ratepayers harmless from the effect of the Northern sale when, in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding, the department expressly considered and rejected the Attorney General\u2019s argument that it do just that. We do not agree.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To the contrary, the related doctrine of judicial estoppel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>precludes the company from denying the department\u2019s right to address, in this case, a question reserved at the company\u2019s request in the Northern divestiture case.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Judicial estoppel bars a party from asserting a position directly inconsistent with, meaning mutually exclusive of, the position asserted in a prior proceeding where the party convinced the court to accept its prior position. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiBenedetto, </em>458 Mass. 657, 671 (2011), and cases cited. Here, the company\u2019s position that the department cannot lawfully disallow divestiture-related costs is directly inconsistent with the company\u2019s statement in the Northern divestiture case that \u201cwhen the Department declines to exercise authority over a potential rate or service matter in a [\u00a7] 96 proceeding, it does not divest itself of [the] ability to review those same issues in a later [\u00a7] 94 rate proceeding.\u201d The department adopted the company\u2019s position in the prior proceeding when it determined it would not impose any particular mechanism to account for stranded costs but could determine appropriate ratemaking treatment following the expiration of the PBR plan. D.RU. 08-43-A at 38-39. The company may not now argue that by deferring the issue, the department forever lost the ability to consider appropriate ratemaking treatment for costs previously offset by Northern.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The case is remanded to the county court where a judgment is to be entered affirming the decisions and order of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Performance based regulation (PBR) plans are structured to change base rates on an annual basis in accordance with a pricing formula approved in advance and designed to operate over a set number of years.

The company\u2019s briefs in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding stated that the department need not consider the impact of the sale of Northern on rates at that time because \u201cany potential, direct or indirect impacts on Bay State [of the termination of the Northern service agreements] . . . may be reviewed by the Department and adequately addressed, [including] in the next general rate proceeding.\u201d The company explained that ratepayers were shielded from immediate rate consequences because under the PBR plan, the loss of Northern revenue could not impact rates until 2011 at the earliest. \u201cIn the short term,\u201d the company argued, \u201cBay State has warranted it will mitigate the loss of Northern\u2019s shared services and will prudently realign its resources to meet its needs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b832-5\">General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 94, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">\u201cWhenever the department receives notice of any changes proposed to be made in any schedule filed under this chapter which represent a general increase in rates, prices and charges for gas or electric service, it shall notify the attorney general of the same forthwith, and shall thereafter hold a public hearing and make an investigation as to the propriety of such proposed changes . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Decoupling, which is not directly at issue in this appeal, refers to a methodology for rate setting that unties a utility\u2019s revenue recovery from ratepayer consumption, with the goal of aligning the financial incentives of utilities with energy conservation efforts. See Investigation into Rate Structures That Will Promote the Efficient Deployment of Demand Resources, D.P.U. 07-50-A (2008); St. 2008, c. 169, An Act Relative to Green Communities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b832-8\">The department also granted intervener status or limited participant status to other entities; none is a party to the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The \u201ctest year\u201d is the year in which financial data are measured for the purpose of projecting a utility\u2019s future revenue needs. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 24 (1978). The test year used in this case was 2008. Because the sale of Northern closed on December 1, 2008, for eleven months of the test year, there was a net flow of revenue from Northern to Bay State. As explained in the text immediately below, Bay State takes the position that to create an accurate view of its financial picture going forward, it was necessary for the department to approve offsetting adjustments to actual test-year costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Bay State\u2019s proposed adjustments assumed that projected net revenue losses of $2,710,387 resulting from the Northern sale would be partially mitigated by $750,322 in operations and maintenance savings that Concentric Energy Advisors (Concentric) estimated the company could achieve through realignment of services such as the elimination of full-time positions dedicated to providing service to Northern\u2019s customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">In total, the company\u2019s petition to the department requested a general increase in gas distribution rates of $34.6 million. Of this amount, the department granted an increase of $19.1 million, but excluded the remaining requested increases in net operating expenses. Only the $1.96 million net adjustments associated with the sale of Northern is before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\">This standard is distinct from the \u201cno net harm\u201d standard applicable to \u00a7 96 proceedings. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>438 Mass, at 264.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Bay State contests the reasonableness of the department\u2019s belief that it anticipated no general base rate filing by the company at the time it approved the Northern sale. Bay State points to a letter dated August 28, 2008, in which, it now argues, the company informed the department that it expected to file a base rate case during the second quarter of 2009. The letter does not support the company\u2019s position. In it, Bay State\u2019s president informs the department that \u201cif the decision is made to file a rate case, the Company expects it would file during the second quarter of 2009.\u201d In other words, the letter makes only a conditional statement. The department was entitled to rely on Bay State\u2019s later and far more direct assessment in its reply brief in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding on October 17, 2008, that because the company operated under a PBR plan, the impact, if any, of the Northern sale on rates would be \u201cmore than 3 years away.\u201d See note 8, <em>supra. </em>We conclude the department reasonably understood the company to be anticipating no base rate proceeding involving Bay State in the immediate future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\">This more flexible treatment contrasts with the department\u2019s determination that Unitil\u2019s subsidiaries could never pass along costs of the Northern acquisition to customers in Fitchburg. Unitil\u2019s subsidiaries serve Massachusetts customers in Fitchburg. See D.P.U. 08-43-A at 36 (2008). The department stated in its decision in the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding: \u201cUnitil has represented repeatedly that Fitchburg\u2019s customers will not bear any costs related to the acquisition of Northern .... We will hold Unitil to this representation at the time of Fitchburg\u2019s next base rate case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Bay State argues that the department\u2019s requirement of appropriate mitigation was met by the Concentric report quantifying potential savings. A report on potential savings does not equate to actual mitigation efforts in a profit-driven environment. Based on our review of the record, Concentric\u2019s anticipated cost savings appear to be focused on \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d \u2014 that is, relatively easy cuts achievable through attrition and through the elimination of full-time positions and vendor contracts dedicated entirely to Northern activities, as opposed to the more difficult savings that might be achieved through comprehensive scaling down and reorganization of administrative services, including redesigning positions and reducing physical space needs in light of the smaller customer base that remains after the departure of Northern. At any rate, the department had the discretion to rely on the company\u2019s statements that, in the short term, all costs could and would be mitigated or absorbed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel provides that \u201c[w]hen an issue of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>or law is actually litigated and <em>determined by a valid and final judgment, </em>and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Alba </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>441 Mass. 836, 841 (2004), quoting <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Ring, </em>401 Mass. 59, 61 (1987). In the \u00a7 96 Northern proceeding, at Bay State\u2019s request, the department deferred the issue of appropriate ratemaking treatment for costs previously borne by Northern. When the company filed its present petition, there was therefore no final judgment on the merits in regard to ratemaking treatment of the disputed costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
