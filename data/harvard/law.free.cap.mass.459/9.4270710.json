On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>June 5, 2000, Bishop sent a certified letter, return receipt requested, to Michelle Timlin, Ulery\u2019s daughter and a trustee of the trust, directed to both Ulery and Timlin, complaining about the leaking roof, including cracks and leaks in the two skylights near the tanning beds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nothing was done in response to the letter until September, 2001, when Ulery\u2019s husband performed some roof repairs, but he did nothing on the side of the roof with the skylights. On May 14, 2002, rain water fell from a leak in or around one of the skylights, and Bishop placed a bucket beneath the leak to catch the water and protect the rug from damage. When she looked up to the skylight, plaster fell from the ceiling into her eye, causing her to fall backward and then to trip over the bucket as she tried to get to her feet, resulting in a serious rotator cuff injury in her shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Bishop filed suit in Superior Court, alleging that her injuries were caused by the landlord\u2019s negligence in failing to repair the roof. At the close of all the evidence, the judge allowed the landlord\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The judge concluded that, under the commercial lease, Bishop was responsible for making all necessary repairs to the leased premises, which included the roof, and that the landlord owed no duty under the common law or the lease to repair an unsafe condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge also concluded that the defendants owed no statutory duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>to repair an unsafe condition, because G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19, did not apply to commercial leases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the landlord owed no duty to repair the roof and because the landlord and tenant did not contract for the repair, the judge concluded that the landlord could be liable only if there was gross negligence in the gratuitous repair of the roof, and there was no evidence of gross negligence. The plaintiff appealed, and we transferred her appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The fundamental issue on appeal is whether the statutory duty of a landlord under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19, to exercise reasonable care to correct an unsafe condition described in a written notice from a tenant applies to commercial leases. We conclude that it does. Because the evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that the tenant had given formal written notice of the leaky skylights, that the leaks were an unsafe condition, that the landlord committed a breach of its statutory duty to remedy the unsafe condition, and that the breach was a substantial contributing cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, we conclude that the judge erred in awarding a directed verdict in favor of the defendants. See <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>New England Power Co., </em>359 Mass. 119, 123 (1971) (in deciding motion for directed verdict, judge must determine \u201cwhether the evidence, considered in its entirety and in its light most favorable to the plaintiff, was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>permit the jury as the trier of facts to infer that some negligent act or omission by the defendant caused the injuries sustained by the plaintiff\u201d). We, therefore, vacate the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19, after receiving the required notice of an unsafe condition, not caused by the tenant, in a portion of the premises controlled by the tenant, the tenant\u2019s invitee, or a subtenant, a \u201clandlord or lessor of any real estate except an owner-occupied two or three-family dwelling\u201d owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to remedy the unsafe condition. If a tenant or any person lawfully on the premises is injured as a result of the failure to correct the unsafe condition within a reasonable time, the injured party has a right of action in tort against the landlord for damages. <em>Id. </em>A landlord may not obtain a waiver of this duty in any lease or other rental agreement; any such waiver \u201cshall be void and unenforceable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Although \u00a7 19 was enacted almost forty years ago, see St. 1972, c. 665, we have yet to decide whether the duty it imposes applies to commercial landlords.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To resolve this question, consistent with our general practice of statutory interpretation, we look first to the language of the statute because it is \u201cthe principal source of insight\u201d into the intent of the Legislature. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>456 Mass. 463, 468 (2010), quoting <em>O\u2019Sullivan </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., </em>402 Mass. 190, 194 (1988). While we generally conclude that the Legislature means what it says, we do not consider the language of the statute alone, but seek to ascertain the intent of the Legislature in enacting the statute \u201cfrom all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Halebian </em>v. <em>Berv, </em>457 Mass. 620, 628-629 (2010), quoting <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Focusing first on the language of \u00a7 19, there is nothing to suggest that it applies to less than all leases of real property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>except for leases of owner-occupied two- or three-family dwellings. Cf. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, supra </em>at 468 (interpreting G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15). Apart from this exception, the duty applies to a \u201clandlord or lessor of <em>any </em>real estate,\u201d which presumably includes commercial real estate (emphasis added). In enacting this statute, the Legislature demonstrated that it knew how to distinguish between \u201ca landlord or lessor of residential premises\u201d and a landlord of commercial premises, because the last sentence of the statute adds a second method for satisfying the notice requirement that pertains only to residential premises. G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19 (\u201clandlord or lessor of <em>residential </em>premises\u201d may receive notice from \u201cboard of health or other code enforcement agency\u201d of State sanitary code violation [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the Legislature has intended to distinguish between residential and commercial leases, it has included specific language to that effect.\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, supra </em>at 468-469, and statutes cited. \u201cWhere the Legislature has not done so here, we will not impute such an intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The legislative intent to include commercial landlords within the scope of \u00a7 19 is also reflected in the legislative history of the statute. Before discussing that history in detail, it is important to understand the legal context in which \u00a7 19 was enacted in 1972, because this context sheds light on \u201cthe cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Halebian </em>v. <em>Berv, supra. </em>Under the common law as it stood in 1972, a landlord owed a duty to tenants and visitors to \u201cexercise reasonable care to maintain the common areas in a condition not less safe than they were, or appeared to be in, at the time of the letting to the particular tenant.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>G &amp; M Realty Corp., </em>373 Mass. 658, 660 (1977). If the common areas were visibly unsafe at the time of the letting, the landlord owed no duty to make them safer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>See <em>id. </em>As to the leased premises that the tenant solely controlled, \u201ccaveat emptor reigned.\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Garwacki, </em>380 Mass. 162, 165 (1980). \u201cThe tenant took the premises as he found them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The landlord owed no duty to the tenant to remedy unsafe conditions in the areas over which the tenant had sole control, unless the landlord knew of hidden defects at the time of letting and failed to warn the tenant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>See also <em>Ackarey </em>v. <em>Carbonaro, </em>320 Mass. 537, 539 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In 1945, the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15, which declared any lease provision \u201cagainst public policy and void\u201d that had the effect of indemnifying the landlord or exonerating the landlord from liability arising from the landlord\u2019s negligence on any part of the leased premises or common areas that was \u201cnot within the exclusive control of the lessee or tenant.\u201d St. 1945, c. 445, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This statute did not expand the scope of a landlord\u2019s liability beyond the common law; it merely declared void any attempt by a landlord, whether residential or commercial, to nullify by contract the already narrow scope of common-law liability. See <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, supra </em>at 468-469.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In 1972, the Legislature began to exercise its authority to expand the scope of landlord liability by statute. First, in April, 1972, it enacted G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15E, which, where a tenant or occupant of a building was injured because of a defect in a common area that was a violation of the building code in the city or town where the property was located, barred the \u201cowner of a building\u201d from raising as a defense in a negligence action that the defect existed at the time the property was let.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15E, inserted by St. 1972, c. 157. While under the common law a landlord had no duty to remedy a building code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>violation that visibly existed at the time of letting, \u00a7 15E effectively imposed such a duty by precluding this defense in a negligence action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By denying this defense to an \u201cowner of a building,\u201d this statute did not distinguish between residential and commercial landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Three months later, in July, 1972, having just overridden the common law to expand the scope of landlord liability for defects in a common area, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 19, which expanded the scope of landlord liability for unsafe conditions in areas controlled by the tenant where the tenant gives notice. Under \u00a7 19, once a landlord received proper notice, the landlord owed a statutory duty to remedy any unsafe condition in these areas that was not caused by the tenant. In contrast with \u00a7 15E, which applied only to tort actions brought by a tenant or occupant, \u00a7 19 applied to tort actions brought by the tenant \u201cor any person rightfully on said premises\u201d who was injured as a result of the failure to correct the noticed defect. The apparent legislative purpose was to protect any tenant or other person rightfully on the leased premises from injuries arising from unsafe conditions for which the landlord received the required notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The legislative intent to impose this duty on all residential and commercial landlords is perhaps best demonstrated by the change in language in the proposed legislation that eventually became \u00a7 19. The first precursor to \u00a7 19, 1971 House Doc. No. 2181, which later became 1971 House Doc. No. 5338, limited the statutory duty of care to a \u201clandlord or lessor of real estate containing five or more dwelling units,\u201d excluding commercial landlords. In March, 1972, the House Committee on Commerce and Labor, to whom the bill had been referred, recommended 1972 House Doc No. 5270, which imposed the duty of care on a \u201clandlord or lessor of any real estate except an owner-occupied two or three family dwelling,\u201d the language that survived in \u00a7 19. The change in language suggests that the Legislature considered, and rejected, limiting \u00a7 19 to residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>landlords. See <em>Sudbury </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>439 Mass. 288, 301 (2003) (redrafting of bill demonstrates legislative intent); <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 596-597 (1974) (\u201chistory of [statute] indicates that the Legislature has been well aware of the significance of the exclusion or inclusion of the word \u2018voluntarily\u2019 \u201d); <em>Hoban </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>355 Mass. 681, 683-684 (1969) (where some versions of bill said, \u201cmay,\u201d and others said, \u201cshall,\u201d selection of \u201cshall\u201d reflected legislative intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In concluding that \u00a7 19 did not apply to commercial landlords, the judge declared that it would not \u201cmake any sense\u201d to allow a tenant, through notice, to impose on a commercial landlord a duty to remedy an unsafe condition that was not imposed under the common law or by the terms of the lease.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Byron, </em>447 Mass. 322, 326-328 (2006), we refused to extend to commercial landlords the common-law obligation we imposed on residential landlords in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Garwacki, </em>380 Mass. 162, 165 (1980), to exercise reasonable care to remedy defects on the leased premises. As a result, under our common law a commercial landlord is liable in tort for injuries arising from unsafe conditions on the landlord\u2019s property only if (1) the landlord \u201ccontracted to make repairs and made them negligently, or (2) the defect that caused the injury was in a \u2018common area\u2019 or other area appurtenant to the leased area, over which the lessor had some control.\u201d <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Byron, supra </em>at 328-329, quoting <em>Chausse </em>v. <em>Coz, </em>405 Mass. 264, 266 (1989). The judge is correct that, if \u00a7 19 applies to commercial landlords, a commercial tenant, by giving the required notice of an unsafe condition on the leased premises, may impose an obligation on the landlord to remedy the unsafe condition that the landlord does not have under the common law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>But the mere fact that a statute imposes a duty of care beyond that provided under the common law is not a reason to interpret the statute to be consistent with the common law where the Legislature intended to impose on landlords a duty that did not exist under the common law. As we have shown, when \u00a7 19 was enacted in 1972, neither residential nor commercial landlords under the common law owed the duty imposed by the statute to repair unsafe conditions on the portion of the leased premises solely in the tenant\u2019s control after receiving the required notice. This is not a case where we can infer that the Legislature intended to enact legislation that comported with the common law, and interpret the language in accordance with that intent. See, e.g., <em>Brear </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>447 Mass. 68, 72, 74 (2006) (\u201clegislation was explicitly designed to supplant those common-law rules\u201d governing restrictions on land). Rather, this is a case where the Legislature intended to expand the scope of a landlord\u2019s duty beyond the common law, which the Legislature is entitled to do and we are required to respect where, as here, there is a rational basis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acen, </em>396 Mass. 472, 477 n.13 (1986), quoting <em>New Bedford Standard-Times Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Third Dist. Court of Bristol, </em>377 Mass. 404, 410 (1979) (\u201cUnless there is a violation of a constitutional guaranty, the Legislature may modify or abrogate common law practices under Part II, c. 6, art. 6, of the Massachusetts Constitution\u201d). See also <em>Chebacco Liquor Mart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>429 Mass. 721, 722-723 (1999) (where no fundamental interest involved and no suspect class burdened, statute subject to rational basis review).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Nor is it reasonable to fear that interpreting \u00a7 19 to apply to all landlords, including commercial landlords, will render meaningless the more limited common-law duty owed by commercial landlords or lease provisions imposing a duty to repair on the tenant. The statutory duty imposed by \u00a7 19 applies only where the required notice of an unsafe condition has been provided to the landlord. Where the lease imposes on the tenant a duty to repair, the tenant is unlikely to provide such notice and is more likely to repair the condition herself. Where a tenant with such a duty under the lease gives the required notice and the landlord remedies the unsafe condition, the landlord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>may bill the tenant for the cost of repair or, as expressly provided under the lease in the instant case, charge the cost of repair as additional rent. And if the application of \u00a7 19 to commercial landlords does, in practice, devour the common-law rule or allow commercial tenants to shirk their responsibilities under a lease, commercial landlords may petition the Legislature to limit \u00a7 19 to residential landlords, as the Legislature has done in many other statutes. See <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>456 Mass. 463, 468-469 (2010) (listing statutes where Legislature distinguished between residential and commercial landlords).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">At oral argument, the defendants conceded that \u00a7 19 applies to commercial landlords but argued that the statute did not apply here because the statute is limited to unsafe conditions not caused by the tenant. The defendants contend that where, as here, the lease provides that the tenant is responsible for all necessary repairs, the tenant should be deemed to have \u201ccaused\u201d an unsafe condition by failing to repair it. We conclude that this interpretation is inconsistent with both the language and the spirit of the provision in \u00a7 19 that makes \u201cvoid and unenforceable\u201d any provision in a lease that waives a landlord\u2019s obligations under \u00a7 19. If a lease provision making the tenant responsible for all repairs meant that the tenant could not, through the required notice, impose on the landlord a duty to repair an unsafe condition because the tenant would always be deemed to have caused the unsafe condition by failing to repair it, the lease provision would effectively constitute a waiver of the landlord\u2019s obligations under \u00a7 19, which is not permitted. See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We conclude that the judge erred in allowing the landlord\u2019s motion for a directed verdict because the evidence was sufficient to support a jury finding that the defendants committed a breach of their statutory duty to remedy an unsafe condition under \u00a7 19, and that their breach of duty was a substantial contributing cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. See <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp. </em>v. <em>Edel-Brown Tool &amp; Die Co., </em>381 Mass. 1, 4 (1980), quoting <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>363 Mass. 402, 404 (1973) (\u201cIf, upon any reasonable view of the evidence, there is found a combination of facts from which a rational inference may be drawn in favor of the plaintiffs, there was an issue for decision by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>jury\u201d). The jury reasonably could have found that, because the leaks in the roof at or around the skylights were near the electrical tanning beds, an unsafe condition existed of which the landlord had notice; and because the landlord had a statutory duty to repair the unsafe condition, but failed to do so, the injury that resulted was caused by the landlord\u2019s breach.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We agree with the judge, however, that the evidence was not sufficient to support a finding in favor of the plaintiff on any other legal theory presented. Under the common law, the landlord had no duty to repair the roof because the tenant leased the entire one-story building, so the roof was not \u201cin a \u2018common area\u2019 or other area appurtenant to the leased area, over which the lessor had some control.\u201d <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Byron, </em>447 Mass. 322, 329 (2006), quoting <em>Chausse </em>v. <em>Coz, </em>405 Mass. 264, 266 (1989). Nor did the landlord contract with the tenant to repair the roof, either in the lease or in some other agreement, so there was no duty reasonably to make the repairs. See <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Byron, supra </em>at 328-329. Furthermore, there was no evidence that any negligence in the roof repairs in 2000 or 2001 caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, because there was no evidence that the repairs were made in the area of the skylight where the plaster fell onto the plaintiff, and no evidence that the negligent repair of one part of the roof caused another part of the roof to collapse.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the plaintiff may proceed at a new trial only on her claim of statutory liability under \u00a7 19.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, the judgment is vacated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>and the case remanded for a new trial on the plaintiff\u2019s claim of statutory liability under G.

L. c. 186, \u00a7 15E, as amended by St. 1974, c. 192, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Five years later, we abandoned this traditional common-law rule and held that a landlord is liable to a tenant and his guest for failing to exercise due care in maintaining common areas under the landlord\u2019s control, regardless of the condition of the common areas at the time of letting. See <em>King v. G &amp; M Realty Corp., </em>373 Mass. 658, 660 (1977); <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Massios, </em>372 Mass. 79, 81-82 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The judge orally provided this explanation in preliminarily ruling that G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19, did not apply to commercial landlords. When he granted the landlord\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and orally set forth his reasons, he made no mention of \u00a7 19. We infer from his allowance of the motion that his position regarding \u00a7 19 remained the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The judge is also correct that, under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19, any waiver of the provision in a lease would be void and unenforceable, and under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15, the commercial landlord would be barred from adding a lease provision that would indemnify the landlord for liability arising from the unreasonable failure to remedy the unsafe condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">We note that although the certified letter was admitted in evidence solely for the purpose of notice, there was other evidence, apart from the letter, that demonstrated that the skylights near the tanning beds were leaking at the time the letter was sent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Because there was no evidence that the roof repairs caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, we need not decide if we should revisit whether \u201c[gratuitous repair creates tort liability only if it is done in a grossly negligent fashion.\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Garwacki, </em>380 Mass. 162, 166 (1980), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\">We have often said that \u201cthe better procedure in a case in which it is a close question whether the standard for granting a directed verdict is met is to allow the matter to go to the jury. If the judge then decides that the jury\u2019s verdict cannot stand, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be allowed.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>375 Mass. 620, 627-628 (1978). See <em>Upham </em>v. <em>Chateau De Ville Dinner Theatre, Inc., </em>380 Mass. 350, 355 n.9 (1980). The judge appeared to believe that he could not reserve decision on the motion for a directed verdict and allow the jury to answer special questions as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>liability, causation, and damages on the statutory liability theory under \u00a7 19, because it would permit the jury to decide the case based on what he thought to be an erroneous view of the law. The judge took too narrow a view of his options. Where, as here, there is not settled law on a theory of liability, a judge may provide the jury with special questions that will answer all the factual questions in dispute and, if the jury verdict does not render the legal question moot, resolve the legal question in a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. This way, if the judge is in error as to tire law, the case need not be retried, and a judgment may enter based on the answers to the relevant special questions. See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Garwacki, supra </em>at 164 n.l (commending judge for providing jury with special questions on disputed theory of liability to avoid need for retrial).
