L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1), without the live testimony of the technician who had performed the certification test on the machine. The certification and supporting records were created as part of a regulatory program providing standardized mechanisms for the routine maintenance of all breathalyzer machines throughout the Commonwealth. Given this fact, we conclude that they were admissible in evidence as business records pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, and were not testimonial statements within the scope of protection afforded by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, their admission in this case was not error, and the conviction of the defendant, Zoanne Zeininger, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>1. <em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On the evening of April 13, 2007, Zeininger drove through a flashing red light at the intersection of Main Street and Bank Row in Greenfield without bringing her vehicle to a complete stop. Officer Patrick Buchanan of the Greenfield police department pulled Zeininger\u2019s vehicle over. He observed that Zeininger\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, her speech was slurred, and she smelled of alcohol. Zeininger told him that she consumed two pints of ale at a local tavern and, later, another \u201chalf pint or so\u201d at a friend\u2019s home. Officer Buchanan instructed Zeininger how properly to complete various field sobriety tests. After observing her perform four different tests, he concluded that Zeininger was intoxicated and arrested her for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (OUI), in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">At the Greenfield police station, Zeininger telephoned a friend to discuss whether she should provide consent to submit to a chemical analysis test of her breath to determine the alcohol content in her blood (breathalyzer test). Eventually, she consented to administration of the breathalyzer test. During her testimony at trial, she recounted that the stress of her arrest exacerbated her acid reflux condition and that she regurgitated acid into her mouth. Zeininger also testified that just moments before taking the breathalyzer test, she \u201cspit up\u201d acid into her mouth and then spit that reflux fluid into a trash can. Officer Buchanan, who was observing Zeininger through a doorway from an adjacent room, testified that he did not see Zeininger spit into the trash can and that the closest trash can in the station was situated ten feet from the booking room where Zeininger was awaiting administration of the breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Officer Buchanan proceeded to administer the breathalyzer test. Zeininger gave two breath samples that each registered a blood alcohol content of 0.10 per cent on the breathalyzer device. After a two-day jury trial, Zeininger was convicted of operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 percent or greater, and sentenced to a one-year term of proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>tion and ninety-day loss of license. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24D. Zeininger appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">2. <em>Statutory framework. </em>To support a prima facie case for OUI, the prosecution must prove three elements: (1) the defendant was in physical operation of the vehicle; (2) on a public way or place to which the public has a right of access; and (3) had a blood alcohol content percentage of .08 or greater, or was impaired by the influence of intoxicating liquor. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1). The first alternative of the third element is proved by admission in evidence of a report memorializing the results of a chemical test of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content of the percentage by weight, which in practice is commonly conducted using a breathalyzer machine. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (e); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>455 Mass. 209, 210 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (e), places several conditions on the admissibility of the results of a breathalyzer test, and the prosecution must prove compliance with those conditions as a foundational matter before the judge may admit the results in evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, ante </em>165, 173 (2011). Under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K, the results of a breathalyzer test \u201cshall not be considered valid\u201d and, thus, are inadmissible in evidence at a subsequent prosecution for OUI, unless \u201cperformed by a certified operator using a <em>certified </em>infrared breath-testing device\u201d (emphasis supplied). A breathalyzer test must further comply with several specific \u201crules and regulations regarding satisfactory methods, techniques and criteria for the conduct of such tests,\u201d as promulgated by the Secretary of Public Safety.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>c. 90, \u00a7 24K. 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.00 (2006). See 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The regulations promulgated pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K, establish an office of alcohol testing (OAT) within the State police crime laboratory. 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.10. The OAT is charged with maintaining a list of approved breathalyzer machines, subject to several enumerated criteria. 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.38.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In order to effectuate the requirement that all breathalyzer tests are conducted on certified devices, the regulations provide that OAT must annually certify that any breathalyzer machine in use is compliant with certain regulatory criteria. 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.39, 2.40. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbeau, </em>411 Mass. 782,786 (1992). The certification process consists of several diagnostic tests performed by OAT technicians, including a blind test of the breathalyzer machine and its calibration simulator using an approved solu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>tion to ensure that the machine registers a reading that matches the known alcohol content of the solution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See OAT Breath Test Operator Manual \u00a7\u00a7 10.0-10.4 (2006). Acetone is also added to the solution to gauge the breathalyzer machine\u2019s ability to detect interferants. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10.2. The effective dates of certification of the breathalyzer machine and the simulator must be annotated on the report created by the breathalyzer machine at the completion of a test (breathalyzer results report).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.39-2.40. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K. The breathalyzer results report also lists the model and serial number of the breathalyzer machine, its calibration simulator device, and the type of alcohol simulation solution used to conduct the required calibration analysis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> OAT Breath Test Operator Manual, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Because this notation of certification appears on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>report as the results of the breathalyzer test, as a matter of practice, it is admitted in evidence and published to the jury in an OUI prosecution. In this case, the breathalyzer results report indicates that the Greenfield police department machine used on the night of Zeininger\u2019s arrest was certified on February 13, 2007, and valid through February 13, 2008. The Commonwealth also introduced OAT documents detailing the results of the diagnostic testing performed by OAT technicians as part of this annual certification process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The notation of certification on the breathalyzer results report and accompanying diagnostic records (collectively, OAT certification records) serve two independent evidentiary purposes. First, the OAT certification records are proof of conformity with the foundational predicate to admissibility of the breathalyzer test results required by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K, and 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.38-2.39. Second, proof of OAT certification may be relevant to aid the jury in weighing the reliability of the test results. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durning, </em>406 Mass. 485, 490-494 (1990) (defendant has right to challenge accuracy of machine); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yameen, </em>401 Mass. 331, 336 (1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1008 (1988) (adequacy of breathalyzer test procedure goes to weight of evidence). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 104(e), at 9 (2011) (jury may consider evidence relevant to weight and credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Zeininger\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the judge committed an error of constitutional dimension when she admitted in evidence the OAT certification records. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Zeininger argues that (1) the OAT certification records amounted to out-of-court statements that did not fall within any cogniz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>able exception to the hearsay rule, and (2) were testimonial evidence, introduced by the Commonwealth without an opportunity to cross-examine the OAT technician who tested the breathalyzer machine, in violation of the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. See <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527, 2532 (2009) (Melendez-Diaz); <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 51-52 (2004) <em>(Crawford).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">We have held that the admissibility of an out-of-court statement in a criminal trial is to be determined by a two-part inquiry: \u201ca statement must first be evaluated for admissibility under normal evidence rules, i.e., whether it qualifies as a hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 391 (2008) <em>(Nardi), </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>450 Mass. 422, 431 n.6 (2008). \u201cThen, the [challenged] statement must be appraised under the criteria of <em>Crawford </em>... to determine if it satisfies the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 391-392, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra. </em>We address each requirement in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">a. <em>Hearsay exception. </em>Generally, out-of-court statements offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted are inadmissible at trial under the rule against hearsay. See Mass. G. Evid., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 802, at 243. Hearsay statements contained in official business records, however, are admissible if (1) the entry, writing, or record was made in good faith; (2) in the regular course of business; (3) before the beginning of the civil or criminal proceeding in which it is offered; and (4) it was the regular course of such business to make such a memorandum at the time of such act, transaction, occurrence, or event or within reasonable time thereafter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>396 Mass. 202, 208 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 230 &amp; n.15 (1980). \u201cThe operations of the instrumentalities of government constitute \u2018business\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Sawyer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>354 Mass. 481, 484 (1968), quoting <em>LaPorte </em>v. <em>United States, </em>300 F.2d 878, 880 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The certification records are derived from a computerized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>database maintained by OAT. It is undisputed that the OAT certification records admitted in evidence were made on or around February 13, 2007, two months prior to Zeininger\u2019s arrest, when OAT performed its annual certification tests on the Greenfield police department breathalyzer machine. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. It is also uncontroverted that the OAT certification records were made and maintained by public officials acting under a statutory duty to comply with a rigorous regulatory certification program that expressly charges them with producing the records at issue. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K. 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.29, 2.38-2.40. This is sufficient to establish not only that the records were made in good faith, but that OAT, as an office, generates such records in the regular course of business and at the time of certification. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K. 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.29, 2.38-2.40. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thissell, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 773, 777-778 (2009), <em>S.C., </em>457 Mass. 191 (2010).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Zeininger argues, however, that the OAT certification records do not qualify for the business records exception to the hearsay proscription because they reflect the opinions and evaluative statements of a government official. <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 394. See <em>Mattoon </em>v. <em>Pittsfield, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 124, 135 (2002). This argument is misplaced. In <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 393, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, 417 (1923), we held that an unavailable medical examiner\u2019s opinion as to cause of death constituted hearsay because it concerned \u201ccauses and effects involving the exercise of judgment and discretion, expressions of opinion, and making conclusions,\u201d which have not traditionally been within the ambit of the exception for public or official records, an exception not identical with the business records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>exception.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 393 (1980) (police report, comprising investigating officer\u2019s opinion and recommendation, not admissible); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The OAT certification records are distinguishable. They memorialize the results of routine scientific measurements. The certification, rather than reflecting \u201cjudgment and discretion\u201d or \u201cexpressions of opinion\u201d of an OAT technician, merely signifies that the diagnostic testing and calibration procedures prescribed by regulation were satisfactorily performed. <em>Vassallo </em>v. <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>428 Mass. 1, 17 (1998) (scientific studies containing primarily factual data admissible as business records). Cf. <em>Nardi, supra, Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Zeininger also points to United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, which counsels that even if a record is prepared in the regular course of business, it does not qualify as a business or official record under the Federal rules of evidence if it was \u201ccalculated for use essentially in the court, not in business.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2538, quoting <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>318 U.S. 109, 114 (1943) (discussing accident reports). See Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). She misapprehends the significance of the quoted statement as it relates to the OAT certification records. First, although they share many similarities, Massachusetts courts follow statutory and common law of evidence, not the Federal rules. More importantly, the OAT certification records are not \u201ccalculated for use essentially in the court.\u201d <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hoffman, supra. </em>Rather, OAT prepares the certification records in concert with its statutory charge to administer an internal regulatory program that standardizes \u201csatisfactory methods, techniques and criteria for the conduct of [breathalyzer] tests.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K. In this sense the records are \u201ctypical of entries made <em>systematically </em>or as a matter of routine to . . . <em>provide internal </em>controls,\u201d which are admissible under the Federal rules and the common law (emphasis supplied). <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hoffman, supra </em>at 113. In sum, the OAT certification records were admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>b. <em>Confrontation clause. </em>The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has held that the confrontation clause guarantees a defendant the opportunity to confront any person, in the \u201ccrucible of cross-examination,\u201d whose \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements are introduced against him. <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 50-52, 61. While <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 51-52, 68, endeavored to \u201cleave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201d the Court instructed that \u201c[vjarious formulations of this core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements exist.\u201d These definitions, the Court stated, \u201call share a common nucleus\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">\u201c \u2018ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent \u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,\u2019 . . . \u2018extrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions;\u2019 <em>White </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 365 (1992) (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment), \u2018statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 51-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2532, the Supreme Court held that certificates of drug analysis, memorializing the results of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>forensic analysis performed to determine the identity and quantity of a chemical substance suspected to be a controlled substance, fall within this \u201ccore class of testimonial statements.\u201d See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31; G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 13. Although denominated \u201ccertificates,\u201d the Court held the documents were \u201cquite plainly\u201d \u201cex parte out-of-court affidavits.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2532, 2542. The Court held that the certificates of analysis were \u201cmade under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u201d and in fact, it was established by statute that the \u201csole purpose\u201d of the analysis was to provide prima facie evidence in criminal prosecutions. <em>Id. </em>at 2532, quoting <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 52. See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The Court also repudiated the argument that the certificates of analysis were admissible without confrontation because they were \u201cakin to the types of official and business records admissible at common law.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2538. The Court held that it was the testimonial character of the certificates of analysis that triggered the confrontation right, notwithstanding their admissibility under State rules of evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 2539-2540. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1, 14 (2005), cert, denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006). As such, the Court drew a distinction between traditionally admissible business records and testimony within the scope of the confrontation clause: \u201cBusiness and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation . . . because \u2014 having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial \u2014 they are not testimonial.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Here, the OAT certification records are outside the orbit of the \u201ccommon nucleus\u201d of the various definitions of \u201ctestimonial\u201d set forth in <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 51-52. See <em>Rembusch </em>v. <em>State, </em>836 N.E.2d 979, 982 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>231 Or. App. 36, 41-42 (2009). Whereas certificates of drug analysis were offered as direct proof of an element of the offense charged, <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2532, the OAT certification records bear only on the admissibility or credibility of the evidence. The OAT certification records are offered, first, as proof that the Commonwealth has met a foundational predicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>to admissibility of the breathalyzer test results and, then, either through direct testimony or by implication, as evidence bolstering the reliability of those results.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durning, </em>406 Mass. 485, 492-494 (1990); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 104(e), at 9 (2011). See also note 13, <em>supra. </em>We agree with the Court of Appeals of Oregon, which concluded that such records \u201cbear a more attenuated relationship to conviction: They support one fact (the accuracy of the machine) that, in turn, supports another fact that can establish guilt (blood alcohol level).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, supra </em>at 41. Indeed, it appears that the Supreme Court has already acknowledged this attenuation, stating in <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2532 n.l: \u201cContrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion ... we do not hold, and it is not the case, that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . [Documents prepared in the regular course of equipment maintenance may well qualify as nontestimonial records.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-q\">Further, the OAT certification records were made \u201cfor the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial,\u201d the distinction the Supreme Court forged between business records traditionally admissible absent confrontation and testimonial records subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>to confrontation. <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2539-2540. See <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 56. The OAT certification records are maintained in the routine administration of the affairs of an administrative agency tasked with quality control, not with supplying evidence \u201ctaken for use at trial.\u201d <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>131 S. Ct. 1143, 1155 (2011) (\u201cobjective of the Confrontation Clause\u201d is to provide opportunity to cross-examine when statements are \u201ctaken for use at trial\u201d). See 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01 (purpose of OAT regulations is to establish uniform \u201crules . . . for the training and certification of breath testing operators, instructors and devices\u201d). The primary purpose of OAT certification is to guarantee, internally, as a matter of course, and when necessary, in court, the accuracy and standardization of all breathalyzer testing equipment across the various police departments of the Commonwealth. See 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.26 (\u201cuniform statewide Certification Instruction program\u201d), \u00a7 2.38 (\u201cmaintain a list of approved Infrared Breath Testing instruments and simulators [meeting specific criteria]\u201d). At the time of certification, the hypothetical use of that record in an as-yet-unknown criminal proceeding is merely an ancillary purpose, subordinate in importance to the \u201cadministration of the entity\u2019s affairs.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2539. See <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">In comparison to a chemist who authors certificates of drug analysis, a technician certifying a breathalyzer machine has no \u201cparticular prosecutorial use in mind.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, supra. </em>The certificate of analysis is particularized and performed in aid of a prosecution seeking to prove the commission of a past act and, thus, resembles the type of \u201cex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u201d at the nucleus of the confrontation clause. <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 51, 52. That the OAT certification records are generalized and performed prospectively in primary aid of the administration of a regulatory program makes all the difference. See <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 51-52. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, supra. </em>Consequently, we conclude that the OAT certifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>tion records are nontestimonial, and their admission without the live testimony of the technician who prepared them did not violate the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">c. <em>Other claims of error, </em>(i) <em>Improper expert testimony. </em>Zeininger argues that the judge impermissibly allowed Officer David Rice,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the officer in charge of the Greenfield police department\u2019s breathalyzer machine, to testify that, in his opinion, the machine was \u201cworking properly\u201d on the night of the arrest, and was capable of differentiating between so-called \u201cmouth alcohol\u201d and alcohol from the consumption of liquor. See 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.54. Zeininger takes particular exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Officer Rice\u2019s statement, elicited on direct examination, that mouth alcohol, such as the acid reflux she claimed was the cause of the failed breathalyzer test, \u201cwould shut down the machine.\u201d Zeininger argues that Officer Rice\u2019s response was an expert opinion, based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge, which was inadmissible unless the judge made preliminary findings of fact regarding the officer\u2019s qualifications. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frangipane, </em>433 Mass. 527, 533 (2001); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 701-702 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Testimony in the form of an opinion based on the expertise or specialized knowledge of a witness is admissible if (1) it will aid the triers of fact in understanding issues beyond their common experience, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. 766, 768 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyarsky, </em>452 Mass. 700, 716 (2008); and (2) the witness possesses sufficient skill, knowledge, or experience in the particular field to qualify as an expert. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shanley, </em>455 Mass. 752, 761-762 (2010); <em>Adoption of Hugo, </em>428 Mass. 219, 232 (1998), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hugo P. </em>v. <em>George P., </em>526 U.S. 1034 (1999). The judge is not required to hold a voir dire before qualifying an expert, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 593 (2006); see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>442 Mass. 826, 834 (2004), and the judge\u2019s determination may be inferred from the record. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>367 Mass. 169, 183 (1975). A trial judge has broad discretion to decide whether a witness is qualified to testify as an expert, and that decision is \u201crarely upset on appellate review.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seat, </em>373 Mass. 83, 92 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Here, it is plain from the record that the judge properly concluded that Officer Rice possessed sufficient specialized knowledge to permit his testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, supra. </em>Officer Rice testified that he has been certified as a breath test operator under 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.25. Officer Rice was also qualified as a breath test instructor, meaning that he has taught police officers who seek certification as breath test operators. See 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.26. He testified that in February, 2007, he changed the machine\u2019s simulator solution as required by the periodic testing regulations, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>and performed the required sequence of simulation tests to ensure the breathalyzer machine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>was calibrated. He also testified that prior to the administration of a breathalyzer test, a machine will automatically test the simulator solution, see notes 7 and 9, <em>supra, </em>and if the results read greater than 0.01 percent plus or minus the known 0.15 percent alcohol composition of the solution, the machine will \u201clock up until the solution is changed.\u201d After adducing this testimony, the prosecutor asked, \u201cAnd, in your opinion, was the machine working properly on the date that [Zeininger] took her test?\u201d The judge allowed Officer Rice to answer, \u201cYes.\u201d This was not error. In the context of the preceding exchange, Officer Rice was merely affirming his prior testimony that his periodic calibration testing in February, 2007, produced satisfactory results, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>and that the machine\u2019s pretest calibration was also valid since the machine did not \u201clock up.\u201d See 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Similarly, the judge did not abuse her discretion in permitting Officer Rice to testify as to the breathalyzer machine\u2019s ability to distinguish between mouth alcohol and alcohol detected from the consumption of liquor. He testified that, during his training as a breath test instructor, he gained expertise about the composition of mouth alcohol in substances like mouthwash and vomit. He testified that the breathalyzer machine has the ability to detect the presence of those substances on a person\u2019s breath because they contain an unusually high concentration of alcohol. He testified that a breath sample containing mouth alcohol \u201cwould shut down the machine,\u201d and produce a reading of mouth alcohol. Officer Rice\u2019s advanced training from OAT was sufficient to demonstrate his specialized knowledge in the field of breathalyzer machine operation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, supra. </em>Such testimony also assisted the jury in weighing the ability of the breathalyzer machine to differentiate between the mouth alcohol from acid reflux, as Zeininger claims was the cause of her failed test, and alcohol from liquor \u2014 a matter beyond the common experience of jurors. <em>Id. </em>There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">(ii) <em>Observation for fifteen minutes. </em>As a final matter, Zeininger argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to demonstrate that Officer Buchanan observed her for fifteen minutes prior to conducting the test, as required by regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>and, as such, the test results should have been excluded. See 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.55. \u201cThe purpose of the fifteen-minute waiting period is to ensure that the defendant has not brought any substance into [her] mouth, such as food, drink, or regurgitation by burping or by hiccoughing, that would have had a contaminating impact on the accuracy of the results, and to permit a sufficient lapse in time to allow such possible contaminants to clear.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Pierre, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 231-232 (2008). In that case, the Appeals Court recognized that \u201cin the vast majority of cases, weakness in [evidence of compliance with the fifteen-minute observation period] is not a ground for suppression, as it would instead go to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235. While mere \u201cdeviations from meticulous compliance,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 453 (1995), are inadequate to justify suppression of the results of the breathalyzer test, in cases where there is a \u201csubstantial deviation,\u201d their admission constitutes reversible error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pierre, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Here, there was no substantial deviation. Officer Buchanan testified that once the breathalyzer machine is turned on, it asks the operator a series of questions, and once activated, the machine will not allow the administration of a test until fifteen minutes has elapsed. Officer Buchanan further testified that he understood that the purpose of this fifteen-minute observation window was to ensure that a defendant did not put a foreign substance in his mouth, burp, or vomit. He testified that he normally observes subjects awaiting a breathalyzer test through a doorway in the booking room, while he initiates the machine in an adjacent room. In addition, he testified that, on the night of Zeininger\u2019s arrest, he was not so distracted in answering the questions prompted by the machine that he could not simultaneously observe the defendant. He observed no belching, hiccoughing, or vomiting, nor did he see Zeininger place a foreign substance in her mouth. Officer Buchanan\u2019s testimony and the breathalyzer results report indicate that Zeininger was first observed at 1:32 a.m. and the officer performed the first of two tests at 1:47 a.m. Contrary to Zeininger\u2019s argument, there is nothing in the record to suggest a \u201csubstantial deviation\u201d from compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>with the fifteen-minute observation period. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pierre, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\"><em>4.
