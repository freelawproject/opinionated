It raises the question, among others, whether actions taken by an employer against a former employee may violate G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A), sections of the anti-discrimination law that respectively prohibit retaliation and interference with a protected right. On this question, we conclude that an employer or other person may be liable to a former employee under these sections for retaliatory or interfering conduct that occurs after the employment relationship has terminated. We defer all discussion of the additional issues raised until later in this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Introduction. </em>Before us are cross appeals from judgments in two actions in the Superior Court. The first was brought in 1999 by Psy-Ed Corporation (Psy-Ed, or company) and Joseph Valenzano, Jr., against Dr. Stanley Klein and Kimberly Schive. Klein brought the second action in 2002 against Valenzano and Psy-Ed, setting out a claim of retaliation. The two actions were consolidated prior to trial, which took place in 2006. We summarize first the facts as the trial judge found them, followed by a summary of the procedural history of the two actions. We reserve for later discussion the posttrial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">b. <em>Facts. </em>Klein, Maxwell Schleifer, and a third man founded Psy-Ed in 1969. In 1971, Psy-Ed began publishing Exceptional Parent (EP), a magazine for families of children with disabilities and special health care needs; Klein and Schleifer served as copublishers. In the early 1990s, Psy-Ed began to have financial problems, and in 1993, Valenzano was approached to evaluate Psy-Ed as an investment opportunity. He decided to invest, and brought in about forty other investors. In the resulting restructuring of the company, Psy-Ed bought Schleifer\u2019s shares, Klein remained with the company and became editor-in-chief of EP, Valenzano joined Psy-Ed as president, chief executive officer, a member of the company\u2019s board of directors (board), and publisher, and the company opened a second office in New Jersey in addition to its original Massachusetts office. At various times after 1993, the third-party defendants, Kenneth Rossano, Dr. David Hirsch, Robert Striano, Donald S. Chadwick, and Robert K. Hopkins, served as members of the board. During Klein\u2019s employment as editor-in-chief, there were disagreements between him and the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">From 1993 until 1996, Schive worked for Psy-Ed in the Massachusetts office, first as an assistant editor of EP and later as associate editor. Schive, who is deaf, required certain accommodations to be provided by her employer, including an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>preter at meetings. On several occasions, she was not provided an interpreter at meetings, and she perceived Valenzano to be impatient and angry at questions she asked while attempting to follow the discussion. In the summer of 1996, during the restructuring process initiated by Valenzano\u2019s new management team, certain functions were moved to New Jersey, and Schive was told she would continue to have a role at Psy-Ed. However, she was offered only a three-month position as a part-time consultant, and thereafter she no longer worked for the company.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 13, 1997, Schive filed a charge of discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). On June 13, 1997, at Valenzano\u2019s request and despite misgivings of which Valenzano was aware, Klein signed an affidavit generally supportive of Psy-Ed\u2019s position in Schive\u2019s MCAD matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Klein was informed in June, 1997, that his employment contract with Psy-Ed was due to expire on June 30, and that it would not be renewed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Klein still held a twenty-one per cent interest in the company, however, and he proposed an alternative slate of Psy-Ed directors for election at a shareholders\u2019 meeting on September 30, 1997. Valenzano, meanwhile, promoted the election of his own preferred slate. Klein\u2019s attempt to have Psy-Ed shareholders elect his slate of directors failed at the September shareholder meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">His proxy fight lost, Klein entered into negotiations with representatives of Psy-Ed for a complete and permanent separation from the company. Valenzano began negotiating with third-party defendant C. Kenneth Mehrling to arrange financing for the acquisition of Klein\u2019s shares. On March 27, 1998, Klein, Psy-Ed, and Valenzano executed a settlement agreement that included a mutual release of all claims (settlement agreement). Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Klein received an initial payment of $45,000 and a promissory note specifying sixteen quarterly payments of $13,797.19, for a total of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>$265,755, while Psy-Ed reacquired all of Klein\u2019s shares in the company.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">On October 6, 1997, without Valenzano\u2019s knowledge and while the negotiations over buying out Klein\u2019s Psy-Ed shares were in process, Klein signed a second affidavit in connection with Schive\u2019s MCAD charge against Valenzano and Psy-Ed. In his second affidavit, which was filed with the MCAD, Klein stated that after preparing his June, 1997, affidavit, he had become aware of and dissatisfied with the company\u2019s response to Schive\u2019s charge, as well as the manner in which his earlier affidavit had been characterized in that response. Klein also stated in the second affidavit that after completing the first affidavit, he had been reminded of certain incidents by former members of the Massachusetts staff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In September, 1999, Valenzano became aware of Klein\u2019s second affidavit in the Schive MCAD matter. He became aware as well that a former Psy-Ed sales and marketing contractor, Lawrence Qualiano, also had signed an affidavit in support of Schive\u2019s claim. At the next formal meeting of Psy-Ed\u2019s board of directors, held on September 30, 1999, the directors<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> addressed the affidavits of Klein and Qualiano. They decided to terminate the company\u2019s involvement in an ongoing mediation of Schive\u2019s discrimination complaint before the MCAD, and agreed to \u201clitigate this matter aggressively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">On December 2, 1999, the MCAD issued a probable cause determination in Schive\u2019s favor on her complaint.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On December 17, 1999, Psy-Ed and Valenzano filed a complaint against Klein and Schive in which they alleged defamation, violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, civil conspiracy, and tortious interference with contractual and business relations (1999 action).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Before serving either defendant, the board met on December 23, 1999, and voted five-to-one to discontinue further payments to Klein under the promissory note attached to the settlement agreement until Klein signed a settlement agreement between Psy-Ed and Qualiano,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and until authorized by the board \u201cbased on the opinion of Boston counsel and their assessment and evaluation of alternative scenarios and their estimate of legal costs associated with the litigation the company has filed against Stan Klein and Km Schive.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rossano\u2019s was the sole dissenting vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">c. <em>Prior proceedings. </em>As just stated, Psy-Ed and Valenzano filed their action against Kein and Schive in December, 1999. In response, Klein counterclaimed against Psy-Ed and Valenzano and brought a third-party complaint against Rossano and the other members of the board.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In his counterclaim and third-party complaint, Klein alleged interference with contractual relations by Valenzano, Rossano, and the other board members. He also alleged abuse of process by Psy-Ed and Valenzano, and violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, by Psy-Ed, Valenzano, and the board members.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On account of Psy-Ed\u2019s 1999 action, Schive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>filed another complaint with the MCAD on February 17, 2000, asserting a claim of retaliation in violation of G. L. c. 151B against Psy-Ed and Valenzano. Thereafter, as authorized by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, she brought this retaliation claim in the Superior Court as a counterclaim in the 1999 action. At the same time, Schive counterclaimed against Psy-Ed and Valenzano for abuse of process. Psy-Ed and Valenzano moved to amend their complaint in November, 2000, to add an allegation that by executing the settlement agreement without disclosing his second affidavit, Klein fraudulently induced them to enter the settlement agreement. A Superior Court judge (the eventual trial judge) denied Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s motion as untimely under the tracking order applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In 2002, Klein filed a separate complaint against Psy-Ed and Valenzano alleging retaliation in violation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A) (\u00a7 4 [4] and [4A]) (2002 action). In response, Psy-Ed and Valenzano counterclaimed, alleging breach of contract and fraud. On December 1, 2003, a Superior Court judge allowed Klein\u2019s motion to dismiss the counterclaims because in the 1999 action, Psy-Ed and Valenzano\u2019s attempt to add a breach of contract claim had been dismissed as untimely, and the allegation of fraud arose out of the same transaction as the barred breach of contract claim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In April, 2005, a different Superior Court judge (motion judge) entered judgment sua sponte against Klein on his retaliation claims because the alleged conduct had occurred when he was no longer an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">By the time of trial, in June, 2006, no claims remained in Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s 1999 action against Schive, and only one claim, for defamation, remained against Klein.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The trial judge tried that claim and the remaining counterclaims<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>third-party claims of Klein and Schive in a jury-waived trial, and thereafter issued findings of fact, rulings of law, and an order of judgment. He rejected Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s claim of defamation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The judge found in favor of Klein on his claim of tortious interference with contractual relations, in favor of Klein and Schive on their respective claims of abuse of process, and in favor of Schive on her retaliation claim. He found against Klein on his remaining claims, including violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In his order, the trial judge indicated a hearing would be held to determine damages with respect to those counterclaims on which he had found liability. However, the trial judge retired before holding such a hearing. As we explain in more detail below, a different Superior Court judge (posttrial judge) held a nonevidentiary hearing on damages on January 4, 2008. On March 13, 2009, she awarded Klein $125,000 in emotional distress damages in connection with his claims of abuse of process and tortious interference with contractual relations, $124,174.71 plus prejudgment interest in connection with the unpaid principal on the promissory note, $510,960.23 in attorney\u2019s fees, and $17,002.50 in costs. The same day, she awarded Schive $125,000 in emotional distress damages, $443,040.95 in attorney\u2019s fees, and $20,407.65 in costs. In Schive\u2019s case, judgment entered against Psy-Ed and Valenzano, the only defendants named in her counterclaims. All amounts due to Klein, however, were awarded and assessed jointly and severally against Psy-Ed, Valenzano, and four of the six third-party defendants: Hirsch, Striano, Chadwick, and Mehrling.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Before us are multiple appeals. Psy-Ed and Valenzano appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>from and argue error in the judgments against them on Klein\u2019s claims of tortious interference with contractual relations and abuse of process, and on Schive\u2019s claims of abuse of process and retaliation. Psy-Ed and Valenzano also argue abuse of discretion or other error of law in the denial of Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s motion to amend the complaint in the 1999 action and in awarding damages without conducting further evidentiary hearings. Hirsch, Chadwick, Striano, and Mehrling appeal from and claim error in the judgments against them on Klein\u2019s claim of tortious interference with contractual relations. Finally, Klein appeals and challenges the entry of summary judgment on his claims of retaliation under \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A) and the entry of judgment against him on his claim of unfair or deceptive conduct under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">2. <em>Retaliation, </em>a. <em>Generally. </em>Both Schive and Klein claim they were the victims of retaliation in violation of G. L. c. 151B.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Chapter 151B, however, does not actually use the word \u201cretaliation.\u201d Rather, \u00a7 4 (4) makes it unlawful for \u201cany person ... to discharge, expel or otherwise discriminate against any person because he has . . . filed a complaint, testified or assisted in any proceeding under [G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 5],\u201d while \u00a7 4 (4A) makes it unlawful for \u201cany person to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with another person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by this chapter, or to coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere with such other person for having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of any such right granted or protected by this chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A claim of retaliation may succeed even if the underlying claim of discrimination fails, provided that in asserting her discrimination claim, the claimant can \u201cprove that [she] reasonably and in good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>believed that the [employer] was engaged in wrongful discrimination.\u201d <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 121 (2000), quoting <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>419 Mass. 356, 364 (1995). In the absence of direct evidence of a retaliatory motive, to make out a prima facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff must show that \u201che engaged in protected conduct, that he suffered some adverse action, and that \u2018a causal connection existed between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., </em>442 Mass. 582, 591-592 (2004), quoting <em>Mesnick </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>950 F.2d 816, 827 (1st Cir. 1991), cert, denied, 504 U.S. 985 (1992). This causal connection may be inferred, for example, where \u201cadverse action is taken against a satisfactorily performing employee in the immediate aftermath of the employer\u2019s becoming aware of the employee\u2019s protected activity.\u201d <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., supra </em>at 592. However, the employer\u2019s desire to retaliate against the employee must be shown to be a determinative factor in its decision to take adverse action. <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">As with the word \u201cretaliation,\u201d courts have adopted \u201cadverse employment actions\u201d as shorthand for the actions of an employer that may violate \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A). See, e.g., <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., supra </em>at 592 n.14, 594 (defining \u201cadverse actions\u201d by quoting \u00a7 4 [4] and [4A], then relying on shorthand \u201cadverse employment actions\u201d later in decision). Like \u201cretaliation,\u201d however, \u201cadverse employment action\u201d appears nowhere in the statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A). Rather, courts use \u201cadverse employment action\u201d as a convenient term of reference to the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>detailed statutory language when assessing, for example, whether actions taken by employers were substantial enough to have materially disadvantaged an employee, see <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>423 Mass. 652, 662-663 (1996), or whether actions of employers were causally related to employees\u2019 protected conduct. See, e.g., <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., </em>446 Mass. 1, 19-20 (2006), quoting <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., supra </em>at 592, 595 (juries may infer retaliation from timing and sequence of \u201cprotected activity\u201d and \u201cadverse employment actions\u201d). Cf. <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>434 Mass. 493, 505-506 (2001) (discussing causal link required between \u201cdiscriminatory animus\u201d and adverse employment action).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Perhaps because of the term \u201cadverse employment action,\u201d confusion has arisen as to whether conduct challenged as retaliatory must target a current employee in order to fall afoul of \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We conclude that under the plain meaning of these sections, it need not. Section 4 (4) addresses action taken by \u201cany person\u201d against \u201cany person,\u201d while \u00a7 4 (4A) concerns actions taken by \u201cany person\u201d against \u201canother person.\u201d In neither case does the statute expressly require that an employer-employee relationship exist at the time of the wrongful conduct, or at any other time. In light of the c. 15IB\u2019s broad remedial purposes, it would be an error to imply such a limitation where the statutory language does not require it. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9 (G. L. c. 151B to be \u201cconstrued liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes\u201d). Cf. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997) (hmiting protections of antiretaliation provision of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3[a], to current employees would be destructive of a primary statutory purpose: \u201cMaintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms\u201d); <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. </em>v. <em>White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 67 (2006) (to achieve primary purpose, scope of Title VII\u2019s antiretaliation provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\u201cextends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm\u201d). For example, where an employer\u2019s discriminatory conduct results in an employee\u2019s termination, \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A) must necessarily expand beyond current employees to have the intended effect of protecting victims of discrimination from suffering further ill treatment as a consequence of exercising their rights under G. L. c. 15IB. Cf. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra </em>(restriction of statutory antiretaliation provision to current and not former employees would undermine Title VII\u2019s effectiveness \u201cby allowing the threat of postemployment retaliation to deter victims of discrimination from complaining\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Where the alleged retaliatory act is the filing of a lawsuit, however, the scope of \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A) are bounded by State and Federal constitutional rights to seek judicial resolution of disputes. See <em>Sahli </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc., </em>437 Mass. 696, 700-701 (2002) <em>(Sahli). </em>But the \u201cright to petition is not... an absolute right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702. The filing of \u201csham\u201d or \u201cbaseless\u201d litigation, as distinct from \u201cunsuccessful but reasonably based suits,\u201d is not a constitutionally protected right.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 702-704. \u201cSham\u201d litigation, at least in the antitrust context, is litigation that is \u201cobjectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits,\u201d and also is subjectively motivated by the litigant\u2019s desire to use the governmental process \u2014 as opposed to its outcome \u2014 to influence or harm the target of the litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 702-703, quoting <em>Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., </em>508 U.S. 49, 60-61 (1993). This court in <em>Sahli </em>concluded that a complaint filed by an employer seeking a declaration of its contractual rights, vis-a-vis an employee, was reasonably based and therefore constitutionally protected in that it had \u201ca legitimate basis in law and fact,\u201d and the record lacked \u201cevidence that the employer\u2019s purpose [was] other than to stop conduct it reasonably believe[d] violate[d] the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Sahli, supra </em>at 704-705. See <em>BE &amp; K Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>536 U.S. 516, 533-534 (2002) (right to petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>protects suits that are \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">b. <em>Schive\u2019s claim of retaliation. </em>In reviewing a judge\u2019s decision after a jury-waived trial, \u201cwe accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact as true unless they are clearly erroneous\u201d but \u201cscrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 620, 621 (1992). With respect to Schive\u2019s claim of retaliation, we conclude that the trial judge applied the proper legal standards to the facts, and that his factual findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The judge properly outlined the elements of unlawful conduct under \u00a7 4 (4). Relying on <em>Sahli, </em>437 Mass, at 702-704, he identified the dividing line between \u201c[b]useless\u201d or \u201csham\u201d litigation, which is not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and those \u201creasonably based but unsuccessful lawsuits\u201d that are constitutionally protected and so cannot constitute a violation of \u00a7 4 (4) or (4A). He correctly pointed out that, while a causal connection must be established between protected conduct and adverse action, that connection may be shown either directly or by inference. Where the link is inferentially shown by closeness in time between an adverse action and the conduct that apparently triggered it, he stated, the triggering conduct need not be the initial filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The judge ruled that Schive engaged in legally protected conduct by bringing her discrimination claim with the MCAD. He further ruled that the 1999 action<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> was an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d and that it was \u201cbaseless,\u201d see <em>Sahli, supra </em>at 702-704, in that all claims against Schive were dismissed \u201con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the grounds that admissible evidence of damages and actionable defamation was lacking.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> He found Schive demonstrated the necessary causal link between the protected conduct and the adverse action where, in the judge\u2019s view, Valenzano testified at trial that he brought the case to \u201cretry\u201d Schive\u2019s MCAD claims,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and where the \u201crapid succession\u201d of events in the fall and winter of 1999 also supported an inference of a causal connection between Schive\u2019s MCAD case and the complaint her former employer filed.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The trial judge concluded by ruling that \u201cSchive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>has acted reasonably and in good faith in believing she had suffered discrimination, and reasonably responded to that belief by filing a complaint at MCAD.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The judge found, \u201c[bjased on direct and indirect evidence,\u201d that Psy-Ed and Valenzano brought suit \u201cbecause of her reasonable efforts at MCAD.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">c. <em>Klein\u2019s claim of retaliation. </em>As noted in Part 1 (c), <em>supra, </em>the motion judge entered summary judgment on Klein\u2019s claim for retaliation on the ground that the retaliatory acts he alleged \u201coccurred over two years after the employment relationship between the parties terminated.\u201d Because, as we have concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>a person need not be a current employee to enjoy the protection of \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A), the entry of summary judgment on Klein\u2019s claim must be vacated.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">3. <em>Abuse of process. </em>As noted above, the trial judge found in favor of Klein and Schive on their respective counterclaims of abuse of process, brought in both instances against Psy-Ed and Valenzano. The elements of an abuse of process claim are \u201cthat \u2018process\u2019 was used, for an ulterior or illegitimate purpose, resulting in damage.\u201d <em>Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC </em>v. <em>Mahlowitz, </em>456 Mass. 627, 636 (2010) (Millennium). To sustain the claim, \u201cthe fact finder must find that process was used \u2018to accomplish some ulterior purpose for which it was not designed or intended, or which was not the legitimate purpose of the particular process employed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Quaranto </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>345 Mass. 423, 426 (1963). Filing a groundless claim is not an element of the tort, but it is relevant, because it may \u201ctend[] to show that the process was used for an ulterior purpose.\u201d <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. 643, 652 (1986). However, the ulterior purpose element is not satisfied merely by a showing that a person commenced litigation knowing it was groundless. <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>387 Mass. 589, 596 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Relying on the standard for the separate tort of malicious prosecution laid out in <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>the trial judge erred in this case in equating the ulterior purpose element with an improper motive of vexation, harassment, or annoyance. See <em>id. </em>at 594 n.9. In an abuse of process claim, in contrast to a claim for malicious prosecution, such a motive does not alone suffice to show ulterior purpose.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Rather, the ulterior purpose must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>to gain some collateral advantage.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 519 n.3 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004), quoting <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 406 (2000) (\u201cMore specifically, abuse of process has been described as a \u2018form of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself, such as the surrender of property or the payment of money\u2019 \u201d). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 682 comment b, at 475 (1977) (\u201c[Tjhere is no action for abuse of process when the process is used for the purpose for which it is intended, but there is an incidental motive of spite or an ulterior purpose of benefit to the defendant. Thus, the entirely justified prosecution of another on a criminal charge, does not become abuse of process merely because the instigator dislikes the accused and enjoys doing him harm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The trial judge determined that the primary reason, and ulterior motive, for Valenzano\u2019s filing the abuse of process claim against Schive was to retaliate for her initiating and pursuing the MCAD proceedings. Immediately before stating this conclusion, the judge quoted Schive\u2019s contention that the company and Valenzano brought the lawsuit against her in order to discourage her from pursuing her pending MCAD claims, to distract her from the MCAD claims and impose legal costs on her, and to induce her to abandon her claims. The purpose articulated by Schive qualifies as an effort to obtain a collateral advantage. See <em>Millennium, supra </em>at 640, 642 (upholding judgment on abuse of process claim where motive in bringing separate action against attorney was desire to remove attorney as wife\u2019s divorce counsel). However, the judge did not indicate whether he was adopting or rejecting Schive\u2019s position.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> When this fact is considered in light of the judge\u2019s initial articulation of the incorrect legal standard to apply to an abuse of process claim, we are constrained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>to conclude that the judgment in favor of Schive on the abuse of process claim must be vacated.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">With respect to Klein, the judge\u2019s findings do not clearly identify what, if any, ulterior purpose and collateral advantage Psy-Ed and Valenzano sought to gain in bringing suit against Klein. The judge stated Valenzano testified that he brought the lawsuit because he \u201cexpected to bring into one point of justice the unbelievably frivolous charges of the MCAD complaint against me\u201d and that he \u201cwanted to have some kind of resolution . . . with a man who had essentially defrauded us.\u201d The desire to litigate a dispute, by itself, does not translate into an ulterior purpose for bringing the action, even when, as here, many of the claims were groundless. See <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Polidoro, </em>424 Mass. 196, 199-200 (1997). As with Schive, we must vacate the judgment on Klein\u2019s abuse of process claim and remand for further review in light of the proper standard for abuse of process.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">4. <em>Tortious interference with contract. </em>The trial judge found that Valenzano and the members of Psy-Ed\u2019s board who were third-party defendants tortiously interfered with Klein\u2019s contract with the company. To prevail on a claim of tortious interference with a contract, a plaintiff must establish that \u201c(1) he had a contract with a third party; (2) the defendant knowingly induced the third party to break that contract; (3) the defendant\u2019s interference, in addition to being intentional, was improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>actions.\u201d <em>G.S. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 272 (1991). Where the defendant is a corporate official acting in the scope of his corporate responsibilities, a plaintiff has a heightened burden of showing the improper motive or means constituted \u201cactual malice,\u201d that is, \u201ca spiteful, malignant purpose, unrelated to the legitimate corporate interest.\u201d <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>448 Mass. 255, 260-261 (2007) (Blackstone), quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, </em>412 Mass. 469, 476 (1992).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We consider separately Klein\u2019s tortious interference claims against Valenzano and against the third-party defendant board members.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">a. <em>Valenzano. </em>The judge began his analysis of Klein\u2019s claim against Valenzano by stating the legal proposition that \u201ca defendant may be liable for his intentional interference with the performance of his own contract with the plaintiff.\u201d The judge then concluded that Klein\u2019s settlement agreement with Psy-Ed, an agreement to which Valenzano was a party,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> was a contract, that it included the promissory note between Klein as \u201cPayee\u201d and Psy-Ed as \u201cMaker,\u201d and that Valenzano intentionally interfered with the settlement agreement by deciding to suspend payments on the note on account of his personal animus and hostility toward Klein.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The judge\u2019s threshold premise \u2014 that a party can tortiously interfere with a contract to which he is a party \u2014 is an incorrect statement of the law. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>NetCentric Corp., </em>433 Mass. 465, 476 n.12, 477-478 (2001) (party to contract cannot be held liable for intentional interference with that contract).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Accord <em>Blackstone, </em>448 Mass, at 259 n.8.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> For Valenzano to be held liable for tortious interference, it must be proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>that there existed a relevant contract to which Valenzano was <em>not </em>a party, that Valenzano caused one or more parties to that contract to \u201cbreak\u201d (i.e., breach) it, that Klein was harmed as a result, and that Valenzano acted with actual malice. <em>G.S. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass, at 272. See <em>Blackstone, supra </em>at 260-261. Assuming that the promissory note, to which Valenzano was not a party, see note 43, <em>supra, </em>was an operative contract independent of the settlement agreement, the note could form the basis of a claim of tortious interference against Valenzano.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> But for Klein to prevail on his claim, the judge would have had to find that Valenzano induced Psy-Ed\u2019s breach of a contract (specifically, the promissory note) with Klein.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The trial judge made no findings on this issue, or on the antecedent issue whether, when Psy-Ed\u2019s board voted to suspend payments on the promissory note, this action in fact caused a breach by Psy-Ed of the contract that the note represented.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> This omission was significant in light of Klein\u2019s contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>obligation, under the terms of the settlement agreement, \u201cto cooperate with the Company in its investigation and defense of any claims against the Company by Kimberly Schive.\u201d If, as Valenzano and the third-party defendants suggested below and argue on appeal, Klein breached the settlement agreement or fraudulently induced Psy-Ed and Valenzano to enter into it by failing to disclose the second affidavit he had signed in connection with Schive\u2019s MCAD matter, Psy-Ed may not have had a legal obligation to make the full payments on the promissory note.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 3-303 (b), 3-305 <em>(a) </em>(2) (defenses to enforcement of instruments). If that were the case, Valenzano (as well as the third-party defendant board members) could not be liable for tortious interference. Cf. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>NetCentric Corp., </em>433 Mass, at 478-479 (chief executive officer of corporate employer did not tortiously interfere with plaintiff\u2019s employment contract where, under terms of contract, employer was entitled to take action it did).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We therefore vacate the judgment against Valenzano on Klein\u2019s claim of tortious interference with contract and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">b. <em>Third-party defendants. </em>The board members who are third-party defendants argue that the trial judge\u2019s factual findings reflect the absence of actual malice on the part of all members of the board other than Valenzano. See <em>Blackstone, supra </em>at 260-261. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The judge stated that the board\u2019s minutes indicated that the board\u2019s decision to stop payment was due to Klein\u2019s unwillingness to sign a settlement agreement with Qualiano. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>describes this reason as constituting \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d and therefore improper. It is not clear what the judge meant, but in any event, the reason stated in the board\u2019s minutes does not suggest \u201ca spiteful, malignant purpose, unrelated to the legitimate corporate interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, </em>412 Mass. 469, 476 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">On appeal, Klein argues that the directors adopted and participated in Valenzano\u2019s vengeful campaign. For evidence he cites Rossano\u2019s testimony that the board was \u201cadamant\u201d in its decision to discontinue payments on the note; Klein argues that this means the board members failed to manifest objectivity or independence of thought. Klein also states they \u201cflouted\u201d the advice of Rossano, a decision that ultimately exposed the company to litigation expenses greatly in excess of the note\u2019s outstanding principal. Even if, as Klein suggests, the board\u2019s course of action was ill considered or short sighted, Klein\u2019s arguments simply fail to demonstrate \u201ca spiteful, malignant purpose.\u201d The judgment against the members of the Psy-Ed board other than Valenzano on Klein\u2019s claim for tortious interference with contract cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">5. <em>Chapter 93A. </em>The trial judge found in favor of Valenzano, Psy-Ed, and the third-party defendant board members on Klein\u2019s counterclaim alleging a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. Section 11 covers \u201cindividuals acting in a business context in their dealings with other business persons and not . . . every commercial transaction whatsoever.\u201d <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 10 (1983). It does not provide a remedy for disputes arising out of an employer-employee relationship, see <em>id. </em>at 15, or for disputes that \u201coccur within a single company.\u201d <em>Szalla </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>421 Mass. 448, 451 (1995). The facts as found by the judge adequately support his conclusion that the dispute arose out of a private transaction between the Psy-Ed board and Klein in his role as a former employee and shareholder of the company. Klein\u2019s efforts to describe the dispute as commercial in nature are contradicted by the fact that, despite the complex entanglement of the parties in this case, the context in which they were operating was a single business enterprise. See <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Moffie, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 462, 466-467 (1982) (G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, intended to apply only to dealings between legally separate \u201cpersons\u201d engaged in arm\u2019s-length transactions, not to dealings between members of single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>legal entity). Contrast <em>Grand Pac. Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Brauer, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 407, 416 n.7 (2003) (\u201cdistinguishing mark\u201d for G. L. c. 93A applicability is \u201cinteractive business transactions [involving] independent business entities\u201d). There was no error in the judge\u2019s rejection of Klein\u2019s claims under G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">6. <em>Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s counterclaims against Klein. </em>As noted previously, after Klein filed his separate action for retaliation against Psy-Ed and Valenzano in 2002, his motion to dismiss Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s counterclaims alleging breach of contract and fraud was allowed because, in 2001, Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s efforts to amend their own complaint to raise these same claims against Klein had been denied as untimely under the applicable tracking order.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The allowance of Klein\u2019s motion to dismiss the counterclaims was error. The denial in 2001 of the motion to amend Valenzano and Psy-Ed\u2019s complaint had no bearing on Psy-Ed and Valenzano\u2019s right to bring timely counterclaims to Klein\u2019s separate complaint.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> See Mass. R. Civ. P. 13 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1405 (1996) (pleadings shall state counterclaims arising out of same transaction or occurrence); Mass. R. Civ. P. 13 (b), 365 Mass. 758 (1974) (pleadings may state other claims against opposing party). Their counterclaims were not so closely connected to the claims in their own, earlier complaint as to be derivative of the pending action brought by Psy-Ed and Valenzano. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (9), as appearing in 450 Mass. 1403 (2008). See also <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zack, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 649, 652 (1992) (dismissal under rule 12 [b] [9] may be appropriate if parties and issues are identical to those in prior pending action). We reverse the grant of Klein\u2019s motion to dismiss Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s claims of breach of contract and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">7. <em>Damages. </em>In his order, the trial judge stated that a hearing would be held to determine damages on Klein\u2019s and Schive\u2019s successful counterclaims. After the trial judge retired, the post-trial judge held a status conference on March 21, 2007, and a nonevidentiary hearing January 4, 2008. She awarded damages on the basis of that conference and hearing and her review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the record, including the findings of the trial judge. The post-trial judge proceeded under Mass. R. Civ. R 63, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), which allows a different judge to perform duties of the trial judge if the trial judge is unable to do so.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> We conclude that the award of emotional distress damages to Schive was properly within the posttrial judge\u2019s authority to make, but that she erred in her other awards of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">a. <em>Award of damages to Schive for emotional distress. </em>The posttrial judge awarded Schive damages for emotional distress on the basis of the judge\u2019s review of Schive\u2019s trial testimony and the trial judge\u2019s finding that \u201cSchive credibly testified that she suffered emotional distress on account of [Psy-Ed\u2019s] and Valenzano\u2019s lawsuit.\u201d The posttrial judge detailed the evidence presented at trial concerning Schive\u2019s emotional injuries and awarded damages in the amount of $125,000. Where Psy-Ed and Valenzano challenge the award only fleetingly and without any critique of the methodology for calculating the amount,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> we conclude that the posttrial judge acted within her discretion in this award of damages.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>b. <em>Award of damages to Klein. </em>The posttrial judge awarded Klein $125,000 as damages for emotional distress in connection with his claims of abuse of process and tortious interference with contractual relations. She also awarded him $124,174.71, plus interest since December 31, 1999, as separate damages on the same two claims. Because, for reasons previously discussed, we have concluded that the judgments in favor of Klein on these two claims were in error, we vacate the damage awards that pertain to them.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">c. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Psy-Ed and Valenzano contest the posttrial judge\u2019s awards of attorney\u2019s fees, challenging, among other claimed errors, the lack of an evidentiary hearing. An evidentiary hearing on attorney\u2019s fees is not always required, especially when the award of fees is being considered by the judge who presided over the trial. Cf. <em>Matter of the Estate of King, </em>455 Mass. 796, 805-806 (2010). In this case, fees were awarded without an evidentiary hearing by a judge who did not preside at trial, despite some indication at trial and in the trial judge\u2019s ruling that a further evidentiary hearing was anticipated. Furthermore, in calculating and adjusting the \u201clodestar\u201d figure in order to determine Schive\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, the posttrial judge relied on the affidavit of an expert witness who did not testify and whom Psy-Ed and Valenzano had no opportunity to cross-examine. In the circumstances, the posttrial judge erred in declining to hold at least a limited evidentiary hearing on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. On remand, the award of attorney\u2019s fees to Schive may also need to be adjusted if she does not pursue or in any event does not prevail on her abuse of process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The award of attorney\u2019s fees to any party must be tied to specific claims and supported by findings that are adequately supported by the record. With respect to Klein, in light of the conclusions we have reached concerning his substantive claims, we vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">8. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the decisions with regard to li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ability and damages in favor of Schive on her counterclaim of retaliation against Psy-Ed and Valenzano, but we vacate the judgment on this counterclaim with respect to associated attorney\u2019s fees. We also vacate the judgment in favor of Schive on her counterclaim of abuse of process against Psy-Ed and Valenzano.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We vacate the judgments in favor of Klein on his counterclaim of abuse of process against Psy-Ed and Valenzano, and on his counterclaim of tortious interference with contract against Valenzano. We reverse the judgment in favor of Klein on his counterclaim of tortious interference with contractual relations with respect to the third-party defendants. We affirm the judgment in favor of Valenzano, Psy-Ed, and the third-party defendants on Klein\u2019s counterclaim alleging a G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, violation. We vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of Psy-Ed and Valenzano on Klein\u2019s retaliation claim and the judgment of dismissal with respect to Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s counterclaims against Klein for breach of contract and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Finally, with the exception of the award to Schive of emotional distress damages, which, as noted above, we affirm, we vacate all other awards of damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs.

See <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 765 (1997). Although we have described a claim under \u00a7 4 as a \u201cretaliation\u201d claim, and one under \u00a7 4 (4A) as an \u201cinterference\u201d claim, and recognize that they are distinct from one another, see <em>Sahli </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info.

Accordingly, we refer generally to the claims that Klein and Schive raise under these statutes as \u201cretaliation\u201d claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">This court first used the phrase \u201cadverse employment action\u201d in decisions in the mid-1990s that looked to Federal law for support in interpreting G. L. c. 151B. See <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>423 Mass. 652, 662 (1996); <em>Fairneny </em>v. <em>Savogran Co., </em>422 Mass. 469, 473 (1996); <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 444 (1995). Even as a matter of Federal law, however, \u201cadverse employment action\u201d is merely shorthand and is not confined to adverse actions taken directly in the context of an ongoing employment relationship. See <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. </em>v. <em>White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 63 (2006) (Federal law recognizes that \u201cemployer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm <em>outside </em>the workplace\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997) (former as well as current employees encompassed within meaning of \u201cemployees\u201d in Title VII\u2019s prohibition on retaliation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In the two actions before us, for example, the motion judge granted summary judgment to Psy-Ed and Valenzano on Klein\u2019s claim of retaliation because he was no longer an employee at the time of the alleged acts, but the trial judge made a finding that Psy-Ed and Valenzano unlawfully retaliated against Schive even though, like Klein, her employment had terminated prior to the challenged conduct. The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), too, has taken inconsistent positions in the course of this case. However, the MCAD, as amicus curiae in this appeal, argues that retaliation is not limited to present employees. We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\">We do not suggest that only a \u201cbaseless\u201d suit may be retaliatory. A suit that is not entirely baseless may nonetheless be retaliatory if it is not subjectively genuine. See <em>BE &amp; K Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>536 U.S. 516, 536-537 (2002) (leaving open question whether National Labor Relations Board may declare unlawful unsuccessful, reasonably based actions filed for improper motive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Psy-Ed and Valenzano challenge the trial judge\u2019s description of the 1999 action as occurring \u201c[sjhortly after\u201d Schive\u2019s MCAD filing, because their lawsuit followed the filing of Schive\u2019s MCAD complaint by nearly three years. Although the phrase in isolation may seem misleading or even incorrect, the judge went on to state that \u201cseveral events occurred in rapid succession\u201d in late 1999 that concerned Schive\u2019s MCAD case: the mediation session, at which Valenzano first saw Klein\u2019s second affidavit; the board\u2019s decisions to stop all settlement efforts; and, most significantly, the MCAD\u2019s finding of probable cause in relation to Schive\u2019s MCAD complaint just two weeks before the 1999 action was filed. We think it clear from the trial judge\u2019s ruling that he found causality on the basis of that sequence (and on Valenzano\u2019s testimony), not because he considered the passage of three years as short.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Just because a claim was dismissed prior to trial does not make it baseless. See <em>Sahli </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc., </em>437 Mass, at 703-704. In this case, however, the record supported the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the lawsuit was baseless. Four and one-half years after filing suit, Psy-Ed and Valenzano admitted they had no proof of money damages to offer the court. The trial judge (acting on a pretrial motion) also determined that Psy-Ed and Valenzano\u2019s allegations of defamation against Schive were factually without support. The record thus supports the conclusion that the 1999 action, with respect to Schive, was not objectively reasonable. Additionally, we note the incongruity between Valenzano\u2019s stated reason at trial for filing the 1999 action \u2014 to \u201cbring into one point of justice the unbelieveably frivolous [MCAD] charges\u201d \u2014 and the substance of Psy-Ed and Valenzano\u2019s allegations in the 1999 action, which related only tangentially to Schive\u2019s MCAD claim. The evidence was therefore sufficient for the judge to conclude the 1999 action was also not subjectively genuine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Psy-Ed and Valenzano dispute this characterization of Valenzano\u2019s testimony, because they say it suggests that Schive\u2019s MCAD claims had earlier been adjudicated unfavorably to him when in fact the MCAD ultimately dismissed Schive\u2019s claims. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>We read the trial judge\u2019s decision differently. In particular, we understand the judge to have meant that Valenzano\u2019s testimony provided direct evidence that he was motivated to file the lawsuit by Schive\u2019s conduct in pursuing an MCAD claim (and Klein\u2019s conduct in support of Schive). While \u201cretry\u201d may not have been the best word choice, we conclude the judge\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Psy-Ed and Valenzano argue that the trial judge stated a test that seemed to require that Schive raise only an inference of a causal connection between protected conduct and an adverse action, when as a matter of law she was required to make a showing that the protected conduct was a determinative factor in the employer\u2019s decision to take the adverse action. See <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>434 Mass. 493, 504-506 (2001) (describing causation element of discrimination claim in terms of \u201cdeterminative cause\u201d). There was no error. It is true that where a plaintiff lacks \u201cdirect evidence of a retaliatory motive, [the plaintiff] ha[s] the burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation, and, in the wake of the defendants\u2019 introduction of nonretaliatory reasons for the various actions taken, the burden of proving that the articulated nonretaliatory reasons were pretext.\u201d <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., </em>442 Mass. 582, 591 (2004). Timing and sequencing of events may, depending on the facts of a case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>be sufficient to raise an inference of causation, and although that inference may be overcome by the defendant\u2019s contrary evidence, see <em>id. </em>at 591-593, it also may become the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s proof that retaliation was in fact determinative. We read the judge\u2019s decision, and particularly his discussion of the evidence that the 1999 action was an adverse employment action, as reflecting his factual and legal determination that Schive had proved her filing with the MCAD was a \u201cdeterminative\u201d cause behind her employer\u2019s initiation of the lawsuit against her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Psy-Ed and Valenzano dispute that Schive acted reasonably and in good faith. The judge\u2019s conclusion is supported by the fact that MCAD made an initial finding of probable cause and by Schive\u2019s testimony, which he was entitled to believe, that she was not always provided with an interpreter at meetings and that she perceived Valenzano to be impatient and angry with her efforts to follow the discussion without an interpreter. The judge, as trier of fact, was in a better position than we are to gauge whether Schive acted in good faith. Absent clear error, we defer to his finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Psy-Ed\u2019s and Valenzano\u2019s reliance on <em>Clark County Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001) <em>(Clark County), </em>is misplaced. The Court noted that the issuance of a right-to-sue letter by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is an activity in which the employee plays no role, and therefore it cannot plausibly be considered a protective activity of the employee. <em>Id. </em>The Court went on to conclude that although there was no evidence to indicate that the employee\u2019s supervisor was aware of the right-to-sue letter, even if one assumed such awareness and further assumed that the supervisor was also aware that the employee had earlier filed her EEOC complaint \u2014 which <em>was </em>the protected activity \u2014 that filing had occurred twenty months before the allegedly adverse employment action occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 273-274. Here, in contrast to <em>Clark County, </em>the record supports the conclusion that it was Schive\u2019s active pursuit of her MCAD claim \u2014 including her production of Klein\u2019s second affidavit in the fall of 1999 \u25a0\u2014 that triggered Valenzano\u2019s angry response in December, 1999. More generally, we think it reasonable to believe that an employer might perceive the issuance of a probable cause finding by the MCAD as an indicator that a discrimination claim was not going to go away, and that an employer at that point may be tempted to retaliate against the employee\u2019s continued pursuit of a protected activity. In our view, \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A) forbid such a response.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Contrary to Klein\u2019s argument, it does not necessarily follow that because the trial judge concluded that the lawsuit was \u201cbaseless\u201d in relation to Schive, see <em>Sahli, </em>437 Mass, at 702-704, the same holds true for Klein. Klein\u2019s claim must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">An ulterior purpose is not simply the intent to harm the other party directly by bringing suit, but rather the intent to gain some other end indirectly. See, e.g., <em>Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC </em>v. <em>Mahlowitz, </em>456 Mass. 627, 640 (2010) <em>(Millennium) </em>(ulterior purpose of suit was to disqualify defendant from serving as divorce attorney to plaintiff\u2019s wife); <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>437 Mass. 396, 408-409 (2002) (evidence police encouraged criminal prosecution to preempt tort and civil rights claims sufficient to put abuse of process claim to jury). Contrast <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Polidoro, </em>424 Mass. 196, 199-200 (1997) (groundless claim and harm to defendant insufficient to show abuse of process, absent showing of ulterior motive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We do not suggest that the claim must be collateral to the proceeding, but only that it be collateral to the legitimate purposes of the proceeding. It has been compared to extortion, in that the defendant has allegedly tried to exact some advantage by wrongful means. See 2 D.B. Dobbs, Torts \u00a7 438, at 1235 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The parties, not surprisingly, disagree on this point. Schive argues that in context, the judge\u2019s decision should be read as adopting her contention, while Valenzano and Psy-Ed assert that simply stating the contention without adopting it does not operate as a finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We leave to Schive whether to pursue the abuse of process claim on remand, because the damages she has claimed in relation to it \u2014 for emotional distress \u2014 appear to be identical to those she sought in connection with her retaliation claim. She may only recover once for that emotional distress, and for reasons discussed and to be discussed, we affirm the judgment on Schive\u2019s claim of retaliation, including the award of damages. Cf. <em>Millennium, </em>456 Mass, at 644-645 (court declined to consider appellate challenge to judge\u2019s adverse mling on malicious prosecution claim where court affirmed on abuse of process claim against defendants and damages associated with both claims were same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Although the parties do not raise the issue, we are troubled by the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the harm Klein suffered on account of the claimed abuse of process included the loss of $124,174.71 in principal still owed on the note at the time Psy-Ed stopped payment, plus interest. This harm may form the basis of a breach of contract claim, but we do not see how it resulted in any way from abuse of process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Valenzano and the third-party defendants were all officers of the company and acting in those capacities. The actual malice standard applied to their conduct, and therefore Klein had a heightened burden of proving actual malice. See <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Community Teamwork, Inc., </em>434 Mass. 761, 781-782 (2001); <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Emmanuel College, </em>425 Mass. 761, 764 (1997). Accord <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>448 Mass. 255, 260-261 &amp; n.10 (2007). In his decision, the trial judge misstated the actual malice standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The settlement agreement indicates by its terms and by the notarized signatures that Valenzano was a named party to it and signed it in his individual as well as his representative corporate capacities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\">For this proposition, the judge cited <em>Shafir </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>431 Mass. 365, 368-371 (2000). In that case, we adopted the rule, set out in the Restatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>(Second) of Torts \u00a7 766A (1979), that a defendant may be subject to liability for tortious interference by interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s performance of a contract between the plaintiff and a third person. <em>Id. </em>at 369. Cf. <em>G.S. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 272 (1991) (question for jury whether defendant knowingly induced third party to break contract with plaintiff). Nothing in <em>Shafir </em>v. <em>Steele, supra, </em>indicated a defendant could be liable for tortiously interfering with a contract to which the defendant was a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\">One might conclude, as Psy-Ed and Valenzano argue in their reply brief, that because the judge described the promissory note as included within the settlement agreement, the contracts at issue were so closely connected that Klein\u2019s claim of tortious interference with the note must fail as a matter of law because Valenzano was a party to an integrally related contract. Cf. <em>Chelsea Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Florence, </em>358 Mass. 50, 55-56 (1970) (where contracts are closely interrelated, provisions are not interpreted to operate independently). The judge\u2019s findings are not sufficient to support such a result. Although he stated that the settlement agreement \u201cincluded\u201d the note, he did not examine directly whether Valenzano was thus protected from liability for tortious interference with the note. Weighing against this view is the fact that, as Valenzano agrees, he was not a party to the note and so presumably had no personal liability on the note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\">In fact, Klein pleaded his tortious interference claim in this form: his counterclaim identified the note, not the settlement agreement, as the contract with which Valenzano and the third-party defendant board members allegedly interfered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\">That Klein brought no breach of contract claim in this case in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>with the note undoubtedly contributed to the difficulty in assessing whether he had the right to enforce the note. Although he filed a breach of contract claim as a counterclaim to the 1999 action, the contract he alleged the members of the board breached was not the note but, instead, their agreement to fulfil their duties as directors of the company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">We make no determination whether Klein entered into the settlement agreement fraudulently, or whether a later breach could form a defense to enforcement of the promissory note. We merely point out that the trial judge should have considered these issues, because in order to decide Klein\u2019s tortious interference claim, it was necessary to decide whether Psy-Ed did in fact commit a breach of a contract when it stopped payment on the note. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-305 (a) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The trial judge found that the decision to suspend payments was motivated by \u201cpersonal animus on the part of Valenzano.\u201d We think this finding was adequate to show \u201cactual malice\u201d by Valenzano.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">We do not consider whether the denial of the motion to amend represented an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Rule 63 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), provides: \u201cIf by reason of . . . resignation . . . a judge before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be performed by the court under these rules after . . . findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, then any other judge regularly sitting in or assigned to the court in which the action was tried may, on assignment by the Chief Justice of such court, . . . perform those duties; but if such other judge is satisfied that he cannot perform those duties because he did not preside at the trial or for any other reason, he may in his discretion grant a new trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Psy-Ed and Valenzano\u2019s statement that the posttrial judge made her assessments of Schive\u2019s emotional distress damages \u201con a cold record and without adequate supporting findings\u201d by the trial judge is controverted by the trial judge\u2019s express finding that Schive \u201ccredibly testified\u201d to her emotional distress and its causation. Psy-Ed and Valenzano\u2019s attempt to incorporate the arguments made in the briefs of third-party defendants also fails. The referenced arguments \u2014 that the trial judge made no finding as to Klein\u2019s credibility on his emotional distress and that emotional distress damages may be awarded only rarely in tortious interference cases \u2014 are not relevant to Schive or to her claim for retaliation damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Because emotional distress damages may be awarded where factually appropriate as compensation for retaliation in violation of G.
