Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981). See <em>Real Estate Bar Ass\u2019n for Mass. </em>v. <em>National Real Estate Info. Servs., </em>608 F.3d 110, 119-120 (1st Cir. 2010) <em>(REBA III). </em>The questions arise in the context of litigation pursued by the Real Estate Bar Association for Massachusetts, Inc. (REBA), against defendants National Real Estate Information Services, Inc., and National Real Estate Information Services (collectively, NREIS). See <em>id. </em>at 113-114. See also <em>Real Estate Bar Ass\u2019n for Mass. </em>v. <em>National Real Estate Info. Servs., </em>642 F. Supp. 2d 58 (D. Mass. 2009) <em>(REBA II); Real Estate Bar Ass\u2019n for Mass. </em>v. <em>National Real Estate Info. Servs., </em>609 F. Supp. 2d 135 (D. Mass. 2009) <em>(REBA I). </em>REBA claims that certain activities undertaken by NREIS in Massachusetts constitute the unauthorized practice of law; in making the claim, REBA focuses on NREIS\u2019s provision of real estate settlement services to mortgage lenders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and its issuance of real estate title insurance policies as a title insurance agent. See <em>REBA III, supra </em>at 113. The certified questions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201c1. Whether NREIS\u2019s activities, either in whole or in part, based on the record in this case and as described in the parties\u2019 filings, constitute the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, \u00a7\u00a7 46 et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u201c2. Whether NREIS\u2019s activities, in contracting with Massachusetts attorneys to attend [real estate] closings, violate Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, \u00a7\u00a7 46 et seq.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 119-120.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we conclude that certain of the real estate settlement activities undertaken by NREIS do not constitute the unauthorized practice of law, but we cannot determine, based on the record before us, whether other of the described settlement activities may do so. As to the second question, the limitations of the record prevent us from providing a definitive answer. Nevertheless, we conclude that the closing or settlement of the types of real estate transactions described in the record require not only the presence but the substantive participation of an attorney on behalf of the mortgage lender, and that certain services connected with real property conveyances constitute the practice of law in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>REBA initiated this action against NREIS in the Superior Court in November, 2006. The amended complaint alleges that certain business activities of NREIS constitute the unauthorized practice of law in violation of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 46A,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 46B. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The challenged activities include services NREIS provides in connection with Massachusetts mortgage transactions that REBA claims are integral components of real estate \u201cconveyancing.\u201d REBA also challenges NREIS\u2019s issuance of real estate title insurance policies as a title insurance agent for underwriters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> NREIS removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on diversity grounds, and counterclaimed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) that REBA\u2019s lawsuit violated the dormant commerce clause, art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, of the United States Constitution. On cross motions for summary judgment, a District Court judge allowed NREIS\u2019s motion, concluding as a matter of law that NREIS\u2019s activities did not constitute the unauthorized practice of law in Massachusetts. See <em>REBA I, </em>609 R Supp. 2d at 143-144. The judge also found in favor of NREIS on its counterclaim and ordered REBA to pay attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the amount of $904,076.17. See <em>REBA II, </em>642 F. Supp. 2d at 73. REBA appealed, and the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court judgment on the unauthorized practice of law claim. <em>REBA III, </em>608 F.3d at 117-118. The court concluded that there was \u201cno controlling precedent that establishes a definition for \u2018conveyancing\u2019 or the extent of activities that constitute conveyancing,\u201d and certified the two questions set forth above to this court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 118, 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>We briefly set forth the relevant facts, based on the parties\u2019 pleadings and the prior proceedings, reserving additional details for our discussion of the questions. REBA is a Massachusetts bar association with approximately 3,000 real estate attorneys as members. REBA was formerly known as the Massachusetts Conveyancers\u2019 Association, Inc., and the organization has a long history of attempting, through both legislation and litigation, to confine conveyancing activities in the Commonwealth to Massachusetts attorneys. See <em>REBA III, supra </em>at 115-116, and cases cited. NREIS is a business entity based in Pennsylvania. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> NREIS describes itself as both a multi-State real estate settlement services provider, or \u201cvendor manager,\u201d and a title insurance agency. The record before us does not demonstrate that any NREIS employee is licensed to practice law in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">As a vendor manager, NREIS provides services for mortgage lenders related to the settlement, or closing, of real estate mortgage transactions. These services may include some or all of the following: (1) contracting for title examination searches relating to specific properties to be performed by third parties; (2) obtaining other third-party reports or public records relating to those properties; (3) contracting with a third party to draft deeds for mortgage loan transactions if a lender so requests; (4) drafting Federal HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statements; (5) arranging for a Massachusetts attorney to attend a \u201cclosing\u201d on behalf of the lender; (6) transmitting the lender\u2019s documents to the closing attorney prior to the actual closing, and reviewing those documents postclosing for proper execution; (7) ensuring the recording of documents related to the mortgage at the appropriate registry of deeds; and (8) disbursing settlement funds. REBA claims that many if not all of these activities, at least when undertaken in the context of \u201cconveyancing,\u201d constitute or involve the practice of law and therefore must be performed, supervised, or overseen by an attorney. NREIS, on the other hand, describes its vendor management services as \u201cmanagerial, admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>istrative, clerical or ministerial,\u201d and maintains that in performing them, it is not practicing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">As a title insurance agency, NREIS issues title insurance commitments and policies to both lenders and borrowers on behalf of title insurance underwriters. To issue a policy, NREIS takes the information from a title examination conducted by a third party and creates a title commitment based on guidelines promulgated by the particular underwriter for which NREIS is acting as an agent. NREIS then issues the title insurance policy to the lender or borrower consistent with the requirements and exceptions outlined in the title commitment. REBA maintains that because issuing title insurance policies requires some examination of the legal title to a property, NREIS is engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">2. <em>Practice of law. </em>The two certified questions focus on the unauthorized practice of law; to answer them, of course, we must be concerned in the first instance with what constitutes the practice of law. The subject is one within the exclusive power of the courts to determine. <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 176, 180 (1943) (judicial department \u201cis necessarily the sole arbiter of what constitutes the practice of law\u201d in Massachusetts). Nevertheless, as G. L. c. 221, \u00a7\u00a7 46-46B, illustrate, the Legislature may assist the judiciary in enforcing and discharging the duty to control the practice of law with appropriate statutory enactments. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>289 Mass. 607, 612 (1935). The purpose in limiting the practice of law to authorized members of the bar is not to protect attorneys from competition but rather to protect the public welfare. <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, supra. Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass \u2019n, </em>295 Mass. 369, 372 (1936). See <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 613-614.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u201cIt is not easy to define the practice of law.\u201d <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, supra </em>at 180. Whether a particular activity constitutes the practice of law \u201cmust be decided upon its own particular facts\u201d because \u201cit is impossible to frame any comprehensive and satisfactory definition\u201d of the term. <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 372. See <em>Matter of Chimko, </em>444 Mass. 743, 749 (2005); <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, supra </em>at 184. See also <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 613-615. As general observations, we have noted that the practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>law involves applying legal judgment to address a client\u2019s individualized needs, see <em>Matter of Chimko, supra </em>at 750, and that custom and practice may play a role in determining whether a particular activity is considered the practice of law, see <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, supra </em>at 186. More specifically, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201c[Djirecting and managing the enforcement of legal claims and the establishment of the legal rights of others, where it is necessary to form and to act upon opinions as to what those rights are and as to the legal methods which must be adopted to enforce them, the practice of giving or furnishing legal advice as to such rights and methods and the practice, as an occupation, of drafting documents by which such rights are created, modified, surrendered or secured are all aspects of the practice of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, supra. </em>Accord <em>Matter of Hrones, </em>457 Mass. 844, 849-850 (2010). The difficulty, however, is that many of the activities just described are also undertaken by persons in other professions and occupations, and the creation of legally binding obligations and commitments is not confined to lawyers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe proposition cannot be maintained, that whenever, for compensation, one person gives to another advice that involves some element of law, or performs for another some service that requires some knowledge of law, or drafts for another some document that has legal effect, he is practising law.\u201d <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, supra </em>at 181. Thus, for an activity to be considered the \u201cpractice of law\u201d such that a nonlawyer cannot perform it without committing the unauthorized practice of law, the activity itself must generally fall \u201cwholly within\u201d the practice of law. <em>Matter of Chimko, supra </em>at 750. <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, supra </em>at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">3. <em>Conveyancing and the practice of law. </em>As described by the Court of Appeals, the \u201cunderlying legal dispute in this case is whether the activities required to transfer title in real estate . . . in whole or in part constitute the practice of law.\u201d <em>REBA III, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>supra </em>at 114. Even though NREIS\u2019s vendor management activities primarily involve facilitating mortgage transactions for its lender clients, mortgage transactions are conveyances of title in the Commonwealth because Massachusetts is a so-called \u201ctitle theory\u201d State.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Faneuil Investors Group, Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Dennis, </em>458 Mass. 1, 6 (2010), and cases cited. REBA uses the term \u201cconveyancing\u201d to describe the activities required to transfer title in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Conveyancing is defined as \u201c[t]he act or business of drafting and preparing legal instruments, esp. those (such as deeds or leases) that transfer an interest in real property.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 383 (9th ed. 2009). Modem conveyancing of real property interests, however, typically involves many more activities than merely drafting and preparing legal instruments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See generally K.M. O\u2019Donnell, Handling Residential Real Estate Transactions in Massachusetts (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. 2d ed. 2007 &amp; Supp. 2009). This court has stated previously that the practice of law \u201cembraces conveyancing.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>289 Mass, at 613. See <em>Fall River Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 83 (1984) (discussing \u201cconveyancing\u201d as area of \u201claw practice\u201d). At the same time, we have never held that \u201cconveyancing\u201d is a unitary, indivisible activity that constitutes the practice of law, nor do we do so today. Many of the discrete services and activities that may fall within the penumbra of modem conveyancing do not qualify as the practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>of law, see, e.g., <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>289 Mass, at 615, and the talismanic invocation of the word \u201cconveyancing\u201d is not sufficient to require that all of them be performed by or under the supervision of an attorney.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether a particular service or activity constitutes the practice of law remains a fact-specific inquiry. See <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>295 Mass, at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">4. <em>Question 1. </em>The first certified question asks whether NREIS\u2019s activities that are described in the record \u201ceither in whole or in part . . . constitute the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d <em>REBA III, </em>608 F.3d at 119. As the previous discussion indicates, we view conveyancing in the real estate context as comprising a series of connected but discrete activities. Accordingly, we do not attempt to characterize NREIS\u2019s activities \u201cin whole,\u201d but instead examine NREIS\u2019s specific services as a vendor manager and a title insurance agent to determine whether any constitute the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">a. <em>NREIS\u2019s vendor management and title examination activities. </em>(i) <em>Preclosing: title examinations and title-related services. </em>The record indicates that national and regional mortgage lenders hire NREIS to provide settlement services needed to close a residential real estate mortgage transaction. When requested, NREIS orders a title examination and receives a report or title \u201cabstract\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for that property from a third-party title examiner such as Connolly Title Services, Inc. (Connolly Title).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> NREIS enters the information it receives into a database in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>generate documents for lenders. NREIS may also obtain other third-party reports or public records that can affect title or ownership of the property, including but not limited to, property appraisals, flood reports, and tax certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">As individually considered activities, title examinations and the preparation of title abstracts generally do not constitute the practice of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although both require training and some understanding of the law, they are commonly performed by competent nonlawyer professionals.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Similarly, the mere ordering of title examinations and title abstracts is not the practice of law. Such activities are routinely done in preparation for conveyancing transactions and require no special legal training. See J.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Stein, Title Examinations and Title Issues, Handling Residential Real Estate Transactions \u00a7 5.1.1, at 5-1 \u2014 5-2 (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. 2d ed. 2007 &amp; Supp. 2009). Thus, it would appear from the limited record before us that NREIS\u2019s ordering of title examinations and abstracts from third parties like Connolly Title is not the practice of law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For similar reasons, the same appears to be true of NREIS\u2019s activities in obtaining other public records and third-party reports such as municipal lien certificates, property appraisals, and flood reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The record, however, leaves open questions as to what happens once NREIS has received a title abstract from a third-party title examiner. NREIS states that it takes the information in the title abstract, enters it into its computer system, and transmits it to its lender clients in the form of another document. NREIS further maintains that it does not provide its lender clients with opinions or advice regarding marketability of title \u2014 services that would constitute the practice of law<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u2014 and that the clients determine how to use the information that NREIS obtains and provides to them. NREIS also states that it does not perform title certifications for lenders,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the record before us does not indicate that, prior to closings, NREIS attempts to resolve title defects or encumbrances. This specific description of the activities performed by NREIS would not appear to constitute the practice of law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, we find no examples of the type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>title-related reports that NREIS sends to its lender clients in the record,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and there is little evidence concerning what, if any, other types or forms of communication exist between NREIS and its lender clients relating to status of title of properties. Moreover, REBA argues that one of NREIS\u2019s deponents said he understood Connolly Title was performing a \u201cplenary search\u201d of the real estate title and \u201cestablishing that there is clear title to the property.\u201d This description implies, despite NREIS\u2019s express assertions to the contrary, that NREIS relies on Connolly Title to furnish a form of legal opinion about title to its lender clients.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As we shall discuss, see Part 5 (b), <em>infra, </em>depending on the circumstances, clearing title may involve the practice of law and interpreting the legal status of a title certainly does so. In light of the fact that we cannot discern from the record the precise nature of the information NREIS provides to its lender clients, we are not able to answer with any degree of confidence whether the services that NREIS, and third parties retained by NREIS, provide to lenders in connection with title examinations encroach impermissibly on the practice of law and thereby qualify as unauthorized legal practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">(ii) <em>Closing: providing necessary documents. </em>In addition to its title-related services, NREIS may obtain or prepare certain documents necessary for the closing at the request of its lender clients. Mainly at issue here are real property deeds and real estate settlement forms such as the Federal HUD-1 or HUD 1A settlement statements.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Drafting and preparing documents for others, including documents with legal implications, does not automatically constitute the practice of law. See <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass, at 181. See also <em>Matter of Chimko, </em>444 Mass, at 749-751 (completing reaffirmation agreement and preparing notice of reaffirmation for pro se bankrupt debtor not practice of law). Whether such activities constitute the practice of law depends to some degree on the type of document, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>legal rights and obligations are being established, whether the document involves providing legal advice or a legal opinion, and whether the document is tailored to address a client\u2019s individual legal needs. See <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>295 Mass, at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Because deeds pertaining to real property directly affect significant legal rights and obligations, the drafting for others of deeds to real property constitutes the practice of law in Massachusetts. See <em>id. </em>(\u201cdrafting documents by which [legal] rights are created, modified, surrendered or secured [is an] aspect[] of the practice of law\u201d).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See also <em>Freitas </em>v. <em>Freitas, </em>349 Mass. 276, 277 (1965) (preparation of deed by real estate broker is \u201ca practice not to be condoned\u201d). There is no evidence before us, however, that NREIS is engaged in the actual drafting of deeds for its lender clients in Massachusetts. What the record does indicate is that NREIS\u2019s clients either supply their own deed when one is required for a mortgage financing transaction, or request that NREIS furnish one. When a deed is requested, NREIS engages a Nevada corporation, North American Deed Company, Inc. (DeedPro), to draft it. DeedPro is not a party to this case and, apparently, no person representing or employed by DeedPro was deposed in connection with the litigation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, there is no evidence before us that NREIS actually has provided a lender client with a deed from DeedPro in connection with a mortgage transaction and associated real estate title transfer in Massachusetts. We conclude, therefore, that on the confined record before us, there is nothing to suggest that NREIS (or DeedPro) is engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in connection with the preparation of deeds, but we are unable to make a more definite or general determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On the other hand, NREIS\u2019s preparation of settlement statements and other mortgage-related forms for its lender clients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>clearly does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law. HUD-1 and HUD-1A settlement statements are standardized forms required under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-2617 (2006), for all federally regulated mortgages. The forms detail all aspects of the mortgage transaction, including costs, charges, fees, interest rates, and amounts due to various parties. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2603(a); 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 3500.8(a) (2010). To draft such a settlement statement, NREIS fills in the various blank spaces on the form with information provided by the lender, as well as information that comes from NREIS regarding its fees. It then transmits the filled-in documents to the lender to be reviewed and finalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Filling out standard government forms for others is not necessarily the practice of law. See <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass, at 185. Many such forms \u201ccan readily be filled out by any intelligent\u201d person. <em>Id. </em>We see little difference between the income tax forms at issue in the <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>case and the federally mandated settlement statements in this case. Although there may be legal consequences that flow from filling out these forms, there is no legal advice or legal opinion being offered, see <em>id., </em>and ultimate control over and responsibility for the content of those forms rests with NREIS\u2019s lender clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">(iii) <em>Postclosing services: recording documents and disbursing loan proceeds. </em>Once NREIS has completed its preclosing activities and after the lender has completed its preparation and review of all documents, NREIS or the lender transmits the lender\u2019s documents to a Massachusetts attorney for the closing.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The closing attorney attends the closing and at its conclusion delivers the completed documents back to NREIS. NREIS employees then review the documents for completeness, make sure the signatures are all there, and send the package of documents to the lender for final review. After the closing, NREIS employees ensure recording of the relevant documents at the appropriate registry of deeds.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Neither reviewing documents to ensure valid execution nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>delivering documents to the appropriate registry of deeds for recording constitutes the practice of law.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> These activities do not themselves require the provision of legal advice or legal opinions, or the application of legal judgment to meet the individual needs of a client. See <em>Matter of Chimko, </em>444 Mass, at 749-751; <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>295 Mass, at 372. While such activities may assist in the creation of legal rights, they are primarily clerical in nature. We are mindful of the important public interest in maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the land recording and registration systems in Massachusetts, but there is no evidence before us that the public welfare is advanced by requiring an attorney to perform or oversee these functions. See <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Corporation Counsel of Boston, </em>360 Mass, at 665 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">NREIS also assists lenders in disbursing mortgage proceeds. As we shall discuss in response to Question 2, closing attorneys have professional as well as statutory obligations to ensure the proper disbursement of mortgage proceeds. Nevertheless, disbursing mortgage funds does not in and of itself qualify as the practice of law, and therefore NREIS\u2019s activities in this regard do not constitute the unauthorized practice of law. It is not so clear, however, whether NREIS\u2019s activities comply with G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 63B, the good funds statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The good funds statute requires a lender-mortgagee, prior to recording the mortgage, to disburse all mortgage proceeds due to the borrower-mortgagor either to the mortgagor directly or to an attorney for the mortgagor or for the mortgagee. G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 63B.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The amount due to the borrower is determined either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>by the settlement statement or \u201cso much thereof as is designated in the loan agreement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">NREIS presumably is permitted to assist lenders as their agent in fulfilling this statutory obligation. See <em>id. </em>(mortgagee must \u201ccause[]\u201d such proceeds to be disbursed to mortgagor or attorney). For purchase money transactions, NREIS states that it assists by providing funds to the closing attorney. For refinancing transactions, however, NREIS disburses all mortgage proceeds itself. In particular, NREIS states that it receives refinancing proceeds from the lender after the closing is completed and the three-day mortgage rescission period has expired. NREIS then disburses the mortgage proceeds and records or confirms the recording of the relevant documents, but the record is not entirely clear as to which happens first or to whom the proceeds are disbursed. It is possible that some of these actions may violate the good funds statute, G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 63B. However, because we do not have any evidence of the actual loan agreements or settlement statements before us, and because we do not know the precise order in which various activities take place, on this limited record, we cannot determine whether this is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">b. <em>NREIS\u2019s issuance of title insurance. </em>In addition to its vendor management services, NREIS issues title insurance commitments and policies to lenders and borrowers as a title insurance agency for underwriters.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> As we described in Part 4 (a) (i), <em>supra, </em>NREIS orders a title examination and abstract from a third party such as Connolly Title. It uses the information in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>title abstract in combination with guidelines provided by the underwriter to fill out one of the underwriter\u2019s title commitment forms. NREIS then issues a title insurance policy consistent with the coverage requirements and exceptions listed in the title commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The issuance of insurance policies generally does not constitute the practice of law in Massachusetts. See, e.g., <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass, at 181-182 (discussing activities of insurance agents in context of practice of law). Insurance policies are examples of those types of common contractual instruments \u201cfraught with substantial legal consequences . . . that in the course of recognized occupations other than the practice of law are often drawn by laymen for other laymen.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 186. Nevertheless, REBA contends that because title examination requires the application of judgment as to what constitutes a defect and so must involve either an analysis of or an opinion on the legal status of title, NREIS\u2019s activities constitute the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Title insurance policies provide protection for buyers and lenders \u201cagainst defects in, or liens or encumbrances on, title.\u201d <em>Somerset Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>420 Mass. 422, 428 (1995). \u201cTitle insurance is neither an agreement to guarantee the state of title, nor a representation of title . . . .\u201d <em>Private Lending &amp; Purch., Inc. </em>v. <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 532, 536 (2002). Issuing title insurance also imposes no general duty on a title insurer to search for or disclose defects in title. See <em>Somerset Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., supra </em>at 430. Instead, title insurance creates a contractual obligation on the part of the underwriter to warranty against encumbrances not specifically excepted by the terms of the policy. See <em>id.; Private Lending &amp; Purch., Inc. </em>v. <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co., supra, </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Corporations have long issued title insurance policies in the Commonwealth. See, e.g., <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Title Ins. Co., </em>238 Mass. 490, 494 (1921). See also G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47, Eleventh (authorizing incorporation of title insurance companies). Moreover, this court has identified \u201cproviding title insurance\u201d as an example of \u201cservices that . . . are not prohibited as unauthorized practice of law when provided by a nonlawyer.\u201d Mass. R. Prof. C. 5.7 (b) &amp; comment [9], 426 Mass. 1412 (1998). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Massachusetts statutory and judicial authority, as well as longstanding custom and practice, thus make it clear that the issuance of title insurance commitments and policies is not the practice of law. See <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass, at 181-182. Accordingly, the activities conducted by NREIS as a title insurance agent do not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">5. <em>Question 2. </em>a. <em>Contracting with Massachusetts attorneys. </em>The second certified question asks \u201c[w]hether NREIS\u2019s activities, in contracting with Massachusetts attorneys to attend [real estate] closings\u201d constitute the unauthorized practice of law. <em>REBA III, </em>608 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">The record includes the following facts pertinent to this inquiry. When a lender contacts NREIS about a mortgage closing, NREIS engages a Massachusetts attorney to represent the lender and attend the closing. It appears that the lender, or at any rate a person or entity other than NREIS, selects the closing date and location. NREIS selects a closing attorney from a list it maintains of approximately seventy-four attorneys. NREIS then provides the attorney with telephone numbers for the parties and information about the delivery of the closing documents. NREIS and its lender client then complete their other preclosing activities. Once the closing documents are ready, including the HUD settlement statement and the mortgage and promissory note prepared by the lender, NREIS or the lender provides the documents, along with the lender-issued closing instructions, to the closing attorney.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The attorney attends the closing and delivers the executed closing package back to NREIS. NREIS and the lender each review the documents after the closing. The attorney is paid to attend the closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">This is the entirety of the relevant record information. No closing attorney engaged by NREIS is party to this lawsuit<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>nor, it appears, has any such closing attorney been deposed in connection with it.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> NREIS maintains that it does not instruct the closing attorneys whom it retains except as necessary to facilitate the relationship between the lender clients and the attorneys, and that it does not tell the attorneys how to conduct the closing or fulfil their legal, professional, and ethical obligations to the lender clients. However, there is little evidence in the record regarding communications between NREIS and its retained closing attorneys or between NREIS\u2019s lender clients and the closing attorneys. There is also no evidence about what, if any, legal work the closing attorneys undertake prior to the closing, and nothing specific about what role they actually play in the closings. Because the record does not inform us about the relationship that exists between the closing attorneys and NREIS, or between the closing attorneys and NREIS\u2019s lender clients, we cannot determine whether, in contracting with these attorneys, NREIS is engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus, we are not able to answer Question 2 directly. Nevertheless, in light of the request for advice that \u201cwould aid in the proper resolution of the issues,\u201d <em>REBA III, </em>608 E3d at 120, we add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">As previously stated, \u201cdirecting and managing the enforcement of legal claims and the establishment of the legal rights of others ... are all aspects of the practice of law.\u201d <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>295 Mass, at 372. Accord <em>Matter of Hrones, </em>457 Mass, at 849-850. On the confined record before us, it does not appear that NREIS is itself actively directing and managing the establishment of legal rights of others in a manner that would constitute the unauthorized practice of law.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Rather, we think the case is closer to one where a party places itself as an intermediary between an attorney and a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">When a third party interposes itself between an attorney and a client, the key question is who exercises and retains control over the attorney. See <em>Joffe </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 47, 53-54 (1980). The practice of law is personal, confidential, and fiduciary. See <em>Matter of Maclub of America, Inc., </em>295 Mass. 45, 49-50 (1936); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>289 Mass, at 613. A third party may facilitate the creation of a relationship between an attorney and a client, and also may pay the legal bills of the client. See <em>Matter of Thibodeau, </em>295 Mass. 374, 377-379 (1936) (automobile association could pay legal fees incurred by association members who engaged attorneys recommended by association where ultimate control over attorneys\u2019 conduct of litigation lay with members). However, there must be a genuine attorney-client relationship, and direction and control over the attorney\u2019s actions cannot rest with that third party.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> See <em>Joffe </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 52-54. See also Mass. R. Prof. C. 5.4 (c), as appearing in 430 Mass. 1303 (1999) (\u201cA lawyer shall not permit a person who recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer\u2019s professional judgment in rendering such legal services\u201d); Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.8 (f), 426 Mass. 1338 (1998) (\u201cA lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>client unless: [1] the client consents after consultation; [2] there is no interference with the lawyer\u2019s independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship; and [3] information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by [Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.6, 426 Mass. 1322 (1998)]\u201d). The degree of interposition and the facts of each individual case play a role in determining whether an inappropriate intermediary relationship exists \u2014 that is, one in which the intermediary, because of the degree of its control over the attorney, is itself deemed to be engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. See <em>Joffe </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 53, quoting <em>Matter of Maclub of Am., Inc., 295 </em>Mass, at 50 (organizations making services of attorneys available to subscribers \u201chave been held to be engaged in the \u2018purchase and sale of legal services\u2019 . . . and thus illegally practicing law where the control of the attorneys rested with the organizations rather than with the subscribers who were the true clients\u201d). See also <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>295 Mass, at 372-373.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">b. <em>Conduct of Massachusetts closing attorneys. </em>Question Two focuses directly on the conduct of NREIS in contracting with Massachusetts attorneys to serve as closing attorneys. We have answered it to the extent that we can on the record before us. However, we consider this question also to be concerned, albeit less directly, with the conduct of the closing attorneys. We add the following observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">As a matter of common and long-standing practice in the Commonwealth, an attorney must be involved in the closing or settlement of real property conveyances, a fact that the parties here do not dispute.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Some States do not require that an attorney conduct these closings. See, e.g., Va. Code \u00a7 55-525.18(B)(1) (Supp. 2010). See also Palomar, War Between Attorneys and Lay Conveyancers \u2014 Empirical Evidence Says \u201cCease Fire!,\u201d 31 Conn. L. Rev. 423, 466-471 (1999). We decline here to follow their lead and overturn our established practice. See <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass, at 186 (\u201cpractices of the community have an important bearing on the scope of the practice of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The closing is where all parties in a real property conveyancing transaction come together to transfer their interests, and where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the legal documents prepared for the conveyance are executed, often including but not limited to the deed, the mortgage and the promissory note.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The closing is thus a critical step in the transfer of title and the creation of significant legal and real property rights. Because this is so, we believe that a lawyer is a necessary participant at the closing to direct the proper transfer of title and consideration and to document the transaction, thereby protecting the private legal interests at stake as well as the public interest in the continued integrity and reliability of the real property recording and registration systems.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Selectmen of Hanson </em>v. <em>Lindsay, </em>444 Mass. 502, 507 (2005); <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>361 Mass. 635, 643 (1972). In other words, many of the activities that necessarily are included in conducting a closing constitute the practice of law and the person performing them must be an attorney.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> See <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>295 Mass, at 372 (establishing legal rights of others and drafting documents by which such rights are established are practice of law). See also <em>LAS Collection Mgt. </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>447 Mass. 847, 850 (2006) (practice of law limited to members of bar in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>protect public welfare); <em>Matter of Keenan, </em>314 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1943) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Implicit in what we have just stated is our belief that the closing attorney must play a meaningful role in connection with the conveyancing transaction that the closing is intended to finalize. If the attorney\u2019s only function is to be present at the closing, to hand legal documents that the attorney may never have seen before to the parties for signature, and to witness the signatures, there would be little need for the attorney to be at the closing at all. See <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Corporation Counsel of Boston, </em>360 Mass, at 665 n.4 (\u201cthe public interest will not be served by requiring that routine duties be performed by attorneys when laymen could adequately and more economically perform the functions\u201d). We do not consider this to be an appropriate course to follow. Rather, precisely because important, substantive legal rights and interests are at issue in a closing, we consider a closing attorney\u2019s professional and ethical responsibilities to require actions not only at the closing but before and after it as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The lender\u2019s closing attorney has a responsibility to his or her client to ensure that the seller (in a purchase and sale transaction) or borrower-mortgagor (in a mortgage financing transaction) is in a position to convey \u201cmarketable title\u201d to the real property at issue.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> At its core, marketable title means title that is \u201cfree from encumbrances beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>Queenin </em>v. <em>Blank, </em>268 Mass. 432, 436 (1929). See <em>Swartz </em>v. <em>Sher, </em>344 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Mass. 636, 638 (1962); <em>O\u2019Meara </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>246 Mass. 136, 138 (1923); <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>117 Mass. 184, 187 (1874); <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>3 Allen 25, 26-27 (1861). Determining marketable title is a multiple step process that demands both investigation of the record at the registry of deeds and analysis of all title-related information relating to the property, with the goal of making sure that the seller \u2014 or, more at issue here, the mortgagor \u2014 actually owns the property to be mortgaged and that there are no other legal claims on the property that might otherwise frustrate or jeopardize the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">As we have previously indicated, the first step of this process, investigation of the record at the registry of deeds and preparation of a title report or abstract, generally does not constitute the practice of law,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and these activities are commonly performed by nonlawyers for real estate attorneys. The second step in this process \u2014 analyzing title abstracts and other records to render a legal opinion as to marketability of title \u2014 does constitute the practice of law in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> See <em>Matter of Chimko, </em>444 Mass, at 749-750 (rendering legal advice and opinions tailored to individualized needs of clients is practice of law); <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>295 Mass, at 372 (same). See also <em>Fall River Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. at 77-84 (discussing obligations of lawyer in certifying marketability of title). A determination of marketable title therefore typically must be performed by an attorney prior to the execution of the mortgage documents at the closing, and also prior to recording them.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We emphasize that the closing attorney possesses an ethical and professional obligation to ensure marketability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>title regardless whether the closing attorney personally performs this analysis.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In addition to marketability of title, a closing attorney has a duty to effectuate a valid transfer of the interests being conveyed at the closing. This includes not only the actual transfer of title on behalf of the attorney\u2019s client, but also the transfer of the consideration for the conveyance \u2014 typically mortgage loan proceeds in the case of the mortgage transactions at issue here. With respect to such loan proceeds, the duty derives in part from rules of professional conduct. See <em>Matter of Franchitto, </em>448 Mass. 1007, 1008 (2007), citing Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15 (a), 426 Mass. 1363 (1998), and G.

As REBA\u2019s deponent described it, title examination normally involves hiring a title examiner, who need not be an attorney, to search registry of deeds and other records.

Continuing Legal Educ. 3d ed. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In fact, the record indicates that NREIS retains attorneys to attend every mortgage loan closing because its lender clients insist that an attorney be present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b553-5\">For a list of documents that may be part of the closing package, see note 31, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In the discussion that follows, while we do not specify in each instance, we are referring to the obligations of the closing attorney for the lender-mortgagee, because of course NREIS is retaining an attorney to represent the lender, not the borrower-mortgagor. Although in some circumstances an attorney for the lender may owe a statutorily imposed duty to the borrower as well as his or her lender client (see, e.g., G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 70, discussed at note 46, <em>infra-, G. L. </em>c. 183, \u00a7 63B, discussed in Part 4 [a] [in], <em>supra, </em>and note 48, <em>infra) </em>the attorney\u2019s professional obligation in the first instance is to represent the client, not all the parties to the transaction. See <em>Page </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>388 Mass. 55, 60-63 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Although G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 46, indicates that corporations are not prohibited from representing themselves and performing legal functions on their own behalf, this court has ruled that corporations may not operate in a pro se capacity with respect to certain activities that constitute the practice of law. See <em>Varney Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>WMF, Inc., </em>402 Mass. 79, 79 (1988) (\u201ccorporation may not be represented in judicial proceedings by a corporate officer who is not an attorney licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth\u201d). We conclude that the same rule should apply with respect to real estate closings \u2014 that is, that corporations engaged, for example, in mortgage lending activities such as NREIS\u2019s lender clients, may only be represented by a licensed attorney in connection with the closing of any mortgage loan transaction. We reach this conclusion in part because the duties and obligations of a closing attorney may extend to parties beyond the lender-client. See notes 45, 48, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> Although it is the borrower-mortgagor\u2019s responsibility to deliver clear title, in practice, lenders and their closing attorneys typically assume the responsibility for ensuring marketability of title. See Brust, Common Practices to Close the Sale, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 8.3.4, at 8-8 \u2014 8-9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\">There is no precise definition of marketable title in Massachusetts, and what constitutes marketable title may differ depending on the wording of documents that are relevant to the transaction, including a purchase and sale agreement when one is involved. See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Meara </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>246 Mass. 136, 138 (1923) (discussing difference between \u201cgood and clear record\u201d title and \u201cgood marketable title\u201d). See also W.P. Graham, Title Insurance, Real Estate Title Practice in Massachusetts \u00a7 4.2(c), at 4-40 \u2014 4-44 (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. 2d ed. 2010) (examining Massachusetts case law relating to different types of marketable title promised in purchase and sale agreements).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">A standard purchase and sale agreement states that the seller will deliver a deed providing \u201cgood and clear record and marketable title\u201d to the buyer. See, e.g., 1 R.A. Dillingham, Buying and Selling a Home, Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Basic Practice Manual Exhibit 5C, at 5-23 (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. 3d ed. 2009). \u201cGood and clear record\u201d title is title \u201cfree from obvious defects, and substantial doubts\u201d in the record, and one for which the record \u201cshow[s] an indefeasible unencumbered estate.\u201d <em>O\u2019Meara </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>246 Mass, at 138. Accordingly, a buyer\u2019s attorney (who stands in the same place as a lender-mortgagee\u2019s attorney in a mortgage loan transaction) owes an obligation to his or her client to determine that the seller\u2019s title meets this standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">See notes 15, 17, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">However, merely identifying title defects and title encumbrances, or making simple recommendations about resolving such issues, does not always constitute the practice of law. See <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Corporation Counsel of Boston, </em>360 Mass, at 665.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The obligation to determine marketability of title thus extends both before and after the actual closing itself up until the moment of recording the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>transfer. The closing attorney, or another attorney connected with the conveyance, must therefore typically analyze marketability of title before the closing and also perform or obtain a title \u201crundown\u201d immediately prior to recording the mortgage documents to ensure that no other encumbrances have been placed on the property from the time of the initial title search. See Bmst, Common Practices to Close the Sale, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 8.5.1, at 8-21. As stated in the text, if the closing attorney himself or herself does not perform these tasks, the closing attorney must ensure that they have been adequately performed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The scope of obligation for determining marketable title has been partially defined by the Legislature. The title certification statute, G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 70, requires an attorney for the lender in a purchase money first mortgage to certify that the mortgagor and mortgagee hold \u201cgood and sufficient record title\u201d and that such certification must include a title examination dating back at least fifty years from the date of the conveyance. The purpose of G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 70, is to ensure that \u201cthe granting of a mortgage [has] vest[ed] title in the mortgagee to the land placed as security for the underlying debt.\u201d <em>Lyon </em>v. Duffy, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 860, 865 (2010), quoting <em>Maglione </em>v. <em>BancBoston Mtge. Corp., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. at 90. The Legislature, however, did not impose the statute\u2019s certification requirements on mortgage refinancing transactions, and we do not do so today as a matter of an attorney\u2019s professional responsibility. Nevertheless, as indicated in the text, closing attorneys representing lender-mortgagees have an obligation to their clients to ensure that all mortgages properly vest title in mortgagees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Analyzing the title to determine marketability also may reveal either title defects or title encumbrances that need to be resolved before the transfer of title can be completed. Resolution of some title problems, such as those that require an appearance before a court, will likely involve the practice of law, while others, such as paying outstanding taxes, mortgages, and liens, may not. See <em>LAS Collection Mgt. </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>447 Mass. 847, 849-850 (2006) (preparing for and representing others in court is practice of law); <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass, at 183 (representing others in court and giving legal advice are practice of law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">See Part 4 (a) (iii), <em>supra, </em>where we discuss the good funds statute. The statute, among other things, stipulates that mortgage proceeds owed to a bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>rower may be disbursed to \u201cthe mortgagor, the mortgagor\u2019s attorney or the mortgagee\u2019s attorney.\u201d G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 63B. If the funds are disbursed to one of the attorneys, that attorney is obligated under the statute as well as professional conduct rules to see to it that such disbursements are properly and timely transferred to the appropriate recipient or recipients. See <em>Matter of Franchitto, </em>448 Mass. 1007, 1008, 1010 (2007) (upholding public reprimand of attorney whose lender client fraudulently failed to fund loans it had engaged attorney to close; attorney violated both disciplinary rules and good funds statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
