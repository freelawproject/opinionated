(Joul\u00e9), employed the defendant, Ranch Simmons, from 2008 to 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both were parties to an employment agreement containing an arbitration provision that purported to cover claims of employment discrimination expressly. Simmons was terminated from her position in July, 2009. Simmons, who claims that her termination was based on discrimination and retaliation by Joul\u00e9, did not file a claim for arbitration under the arbitration provision, but did file a complaint of discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). In response, Joul\u00e9 filed in the Superior Court a complaint and a motion to compel arbitration of Simmons\u2019s discrimination claim. Before us is Joul\u00e9\u2019s interlocutory appeal from the order of a Superior Court judge that in principal part denied Joul\u00e9\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stayed all further proceedings in the Superior Court case pending the outcome of the MCAD proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">We conclude that pursuant to G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 5, the MCAD may conduct its own, independent proceeding based on Simmons\u2019s complaint. With respect to Joul\u00e9 and Simmons, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>if the arbitration provision in Simmons\u2019s employment agreement is valid \u2014 an issue that remains to be resolved \u2014 Joul\u00e9 has a right to compel arbitration of a dispute between it and Simmons concerning her claim. Accordingly, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Joul\u00e9 is in the business of providing staffing and business systems support to companies in various States. Joul\u00e9 hired Randi Simmons for its Boston office in February, 2008, as \u201cselling branch manager.\u201d In accepting the position, Simmons turned down another full-time job offer with another company. At some point after she began to work for the company,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Joul\u00e9 provided Simmons with a document titled \u201cEmployment Agreement with Confidentiality, Non-Competition, and Arbitration Provisions\u201d (employment agreement, or agreement). The agreement contains an arbitration provision, quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Simmons had not received a copy or been informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of the employment agreement before starting her job. The agreement provides that Simmons had a right to consult an attorney prior to signing it, but that she would not \u201cbe offered employment until [she] sign[ed] and retum[ed] this [agreement.\u201d Simmons did not sign the agreement immediately but, rather, delayed until a \u201cspecific request was made for it by the human resources department,\u201d because she \u201cfelt apprehensive and uncomfortable about certain restrictions therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">At the time Simmons was hired and thereafter presented with the employment agreement, she was pregnant, and the baby was bom in due course. Simmons alleges that she was subjected to a hostile work environment and was denied a promotion and salary increase because of Joul\u00e9\u2019s biases against pregnant women and against women with children. She complained about the issue to Kristin Motta Zwickau, the director of Joul\u00e9\u2019s Boston office. On July 30, 2009, Joul\u00e9 terminated Simmons\u2019s employment. On August 25, 2009, Simmons filed a complaint with the MCAD asserting discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 4 (1) and (11A); G. L. c. 149, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u00a7 105D; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. (2006) (Title VII); and retaliation in violation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (4). As previously stated, Simmons did not initiate arbitration proceedings pursuant to the arbitration provision in the employment agreement. On November 19, 2009, Joul\u00e9 filed its complaint and motion to compel arbitration in the Superior Court. Joul\u00e9 requested the court to declare that the agreement was valid and binding on Simmons; that Simmons was required to submit to arbitration any claim against Joul\u00e9 based on the facts alleged in her MCAD complaint; and that Simmons was precluded from acting as a litigant or party in any MCAD proceeding against Joul\u00e9. Simmons opposed the motion to compel arbitration, arguing that the arbitration provision in the agreement was unconscionable and did not unmistakably cover discrimination claims; and that in any event, her MCAD complaint or charge could proceed and she was entitled to \u201cparticipate in the proceeding as the complainant.\u201d The MCAD thereafter filed an emergency motion to intervene that was allowed by a Superior Court judge. After a hearing, a different Superior Court judge (motion judge) accepted the MCAD\u2019s argument that its authority to conduct an investigation and adjudication of Simmons\u2019s claim of discrimination was not affected by the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate, and ordered that Joul\u00e9\u2019s motion to compel arbitration be denied, that the Superior Court action be stayed pending resolution of the MCAD\u2019s proceeding, and that the arbitration provision in the employment agreement did not preclude Simmons from participating as a party in the pending MCAD matter. Joul\u00e9 appealed from the motion judge\u2019s order pursuant to G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 18 <em>(a) </em>(1). We granted the applications for direct appellate review filed by Simmons and the MCAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 251, \u00a7 18 <em>(a) </em>(1), authorizes a party to appeal directly from the denial of an application to compel arbitration. See, e.g., <em>Warfield </em>v. <em>Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>454 Mass. 390, 394 (2009) <em>(Warfield). </em>All parties agree, therefore, that Joul\u00e9\u2019s interlocutory appeal from the motion judge\u2019s order is properly before us. We review the judge\u2019s order de novo. See <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>Dell Inc., </em>454 Mass. 192, 199 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>448 Mass. 836, 844 (2007). See also <em>Warfield, supra </em>at 395 (motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>compel arbitration treated summarily and judge\u2019s order reviewed de novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">a. <em>Effect of the employment agreement\u2019s arbitration provision on the MCAD. </em>We consider first the effect of the arbitration provision on the MCAD\u2019s ability to pursue its investigation and resolution of Simmons\u2019s MCAD complaint. \u201cThe MCAD was established to enforce the Commonwealth\u2019s antidiscrimination laws.\u201d <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 563, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Wilfert Bros. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>543 U.S. 979 (2004) <em>(Stonehill </em>College). The MCAD has the power to investigate claims of discrimination on its own, but also has the authority \u2014 and generally follows this course \u2014 to investigate and pursue complaints filed by individuals. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. In the latter circumstance, although the complaint is filed by the individual, the agency proceeds in its own name. See <em>Stonehill College, supra </em>(in proceeding under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, \u201cit is the MCAD, and not the complainant, that prosecutes the discrimination claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We review briefly the MCAD\u2019s procedure in investigating such complaints. See generally G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. Any individual alleging discrimination in employment (or otherwise), or the Attorney General, may file a complaint with the MCAD. 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(1) (1999). The chairperson of the MCAD then designates a single commissioner to investigate the complaint promptly. 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10. If the investigating commissioner finds no probable cause for crediting the allegations of the complaint, the commissioner issues a lack of probable cause finding and dismisses the complaint. 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.15(7)(b) (2008). If, however, the commissioner determines that probable cause does exist for crediting the allegations, he or she issues a probable cause finding. <em>Id. </em>At that point, the investigating commissioner endeavors to \u201celiminate the unlawful practice complained of through conference, conciliation and persuasion.\u201d 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.18 (2005). If conciliation is unsuccessful it may be terminated, see 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.18(l)(d), and if the investigating commissioner determines that the public interest requires a certification of issues to public hearing, the commissioner issues a complaint in the name of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>MCAD. 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.20(3) (2004). Such a public hearing is conducted by an MCAD commissioner other than the investigating commissioner, or by a designated hearing officer, or by the full commission. 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.21(1) (1999). The case is prosecuted by an MCAD attorney or other staff member, or in some instances by the complainant\u2019s attorney whom the MCAD has designated its agent for the purpose. 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.09(5)(a), (b) (1999). A complainant may be permitted to intervene as a party in the case, in the commissioner\u2019s discretion, and also be allowed to testify at the hearing. 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.20(4) (2004). If, after the hearing, the MCAD finds that the respondent employer has engaged in an unlawful practice as defined in the statute, the MCAD may require the respondent to \u201ccease and desist from such unlawful practice,\u201d and may grant relief specific to the complaining individual such as \u201chiring, reinstatement or upgrading of [the] employee[], with or without back pay ... as, in the judgment of the [MCAD], will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. See 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.22 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Under both Federal and Massachusetts arbitration statutes, it is clear that parties can agree to arbitrate claims of employment discrimination. See <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 26-27 (1991); <em>Warfield, </em>454 Mass, at 395-396; <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>170 F.3d 1, 17-21 (1st Cir. 1999). By its express terms, the arbitration provision in Simmons\u2019s employment agreement is governed both by the Massachusetts Arbitration Act, G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 2 (MAA), and by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (2006) (FAA). For agreements governed by the FAA, the statute\u2019s presumption of arbitrability means that \u201cin applying general state-law principles of contract interpretation to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the scope of the [FAA] . . . due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring arbitration, and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., </em>489 U.S. 468, 475-476 (1989). In <em>Warfield, supra </em>at 398, we acknowledged this point, but also held that, in view of the strong public policy against discrimination in employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ment, any agreement to arbitrate claims of discrimination must be stated clearly and unmistakably.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Even where there is a clear and unmistakable provision in an employment agreement requiring arbitration of discrimination claims, however, it would not affect the MCAD\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. \u201cThe FAA directs courts to place arbitration agreements on equal footing with other contracts, but it \u2018does not require parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so\u2019. . . . \u2018Arbitration under the [FAA] is a matter of consent, not coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Waffle House, Inc., </em>534 U.S. 279, 293, 294 (2002) <em>(Waffle House), </em>quoting <em>Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., </em>489 U.S. at 478, 479. The MCAD is not a party to the employment agreement at issue here, has not agreed to arbitration of Simmons\u2019s MCAD complaint, and cannot be bound by the agreement\u2019s arbitration provision. \u201c[T]he proarbitration policy goals of the FAA do not require the agency to relinquish its statutory authority if it has not agreed to do so.\u201d <em>Waffle House, supra </em>at 294. Accordingly, assuming the validity of the agreement\u2019s arbitration provision,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nothing in it precludes the MCAD from proceeding with its investigation and resolution of Simmons\u2019s discrimination complaint \u2014 including, if the evidence warrants, granting relief specific to Simmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">This conclusion is consistent with, and advances, the broad statutory responsibility and authority of the MCAD to investigate and remedy instances of discrimination in the Commonwealth. See <em>Stonehill College, </em>441 Mass, at 562-563, and cases cited (\u201cWhile the main object of a judicial proceeding under [G. L. c. 15IB,] \u00a7 9[,] is to recover damages for the individual victim of unlawful discrimination, . . . the primary purpose of an administrative proceeding before the MCAD is to vindicate the public\u2019s interest in reducing discrimination in the workplace by deterring, and punishing, instances of discrimination by employers against employees\u201d [citation omitted]). See also <em>Cuddyer </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co., </em>434 Mass. 521, 534 (2001), quoting <em>Lynn Teachers Union, Local 1037 </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>406 Mass. 515, 523 (1990) (\u201cthe MCAD \u2018has been charged with the task of combating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>discrimination in the Commonwealth\u2019 \u201d); <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156,170 (1987) (\u201ccommission is given broad authority to remedy discrimination\u201d); 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13(4) (1999) (\u201cNo waiver agreement signed by any individual shall affect the [MCAD\u2019s] right and statutory duty to enforce [ ] G. L. c. 151B . . . or to investigate any complaint filed before it\u201d). The United States Supreme Court reached the same result in the <em>Waffle House </em>case where an employee alleging handicap discrimination declined to initiate arbitration proceedings mandated by his employment agreement, but instead timely filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under Title VII. <em>Waffle House, </em>534 U.S. at 283, 285. The Court concluded that the EEOC was authorized to bring its own enforcement action against the employer, notwithstanding the arbitration agreement between the employer and employee. <em>Id. </em>at 291-292, 296. It further stated that \u201conce a charge is filed ... the EEOC is in command of the process. . . . Absent textual support for a contrary view, it is the public agency\u2019s province \u2014 not that of the court \u2014 to determine whether public resources should be committed to the recovery of victim-specific relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291-292.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Joul\u00e9 appears to agree both that the MCAD is empowered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>and entitled to pursue investigation of Simmons\u2019s discrimination complaint under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, and also that nothing in the arbitration provision of the parties\u2019 employment agreement does, or could, preclude Simmons from filing a complaint with the MCAD.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Joul\u00e9 argues, however, that beyond filing a complaint with the MCAD, under the arbitration provision, Simmons is barred from being a litigant or party to the MCAD proceeding, and that the motion judge erred in ruling otherwise.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Again, if the arbitration provision in Simmons\u2019s employment agreement is valid (see Part 2[b], <em>infra), </em>we would agree. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>a complainant files a request to intervene, see 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.20(4), she must certify her \u201callegations of discrimination.\u201d 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.20(3)(a) (2004). Thus, in essence, the complainant is required to advance a claim of discrimination in her own name. Allowing Simmons to seek to intervene as a party in the MCAD proceeding and to assert directly her individual claim of discrimination would contravene the requirement of the arbitration provision that she resolve her own disputes with Joul\u00e9 through arbitration. The question whether Simmons may participate in the MCAD proceeding is a different matter. Nothing in the arbitration provision prevents her from testifying before the MCAD, see G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, or from \u201cproviding] information, materials or responses to [Joul\u00e9\u2019s] submissions which are necessary for investigation of the case\u201d to obviate administrative foreclosure in accordance with 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.15(5)(b) (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">b. <em>Stay of court proceedings. </em>It is Joul\u00e9\u2019s position that the motion judge erred in granting the stay of further proceedings in its Superior Court action because, in accordance with <em>War-field, </em>the terms of the arbitration provision are clear and unmistakable, and Simmons lacks any ground sufficient to revoke her agreement to arbitrate. See <em>Warfield, </em>454 Mass, at 398. We agree that the stay should not have been granted, but for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The motion judge assumed in effect that the arbitration provision was valid and, by staying Joul\u00e9\u2019s court action until the MCAD concluded its proceeding, appears to have adopted the premise advanced by the MCAD, namely, that the agency\u2019s proceeding takes precedence over any arbitration. However, \u201cwhen parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative, are superseded by the FAA.\u201d <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Ferrer, </em>552 U.S. 346, 349-350 (2008). In staying further proceedings in Joul\u00e9\u2019s action to enforce the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate, the motion judge in effect placed primary jurisdiction over Simmons\u2019s discrimination-based claims in the MCAD. This was error. If an employer and employee enter into a valid and sufficiently clear agreement to arbitrate any and all disputes relating to discrimination, then the party seeking arbitration of such a dispute is entitled to have the agreement enforced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>448 Mass. 836, 844-849 (2007) (arbitration provision enforced where dispute \u201cfalls squarely\u201d under that provision). Cf. <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. at 23, 35 (employee\u2019s age discrimination claim can be subjected to compulsory arbitration pursuant to arbitration provision in mandated employment-related agreement signed by employee). For the reasons previously discussed, if, as in this case, the MCAD were then pursuing an investigation of the discrimination claim, the agency could proceed notwithstanding the arbitration provision in the parties\u2019 agreement, see <em>Waffle House, </em>534 U.S. at 291-292, and there is no legal bar to having an arbitration and the MCAD proceeding continue concurrently, on parallel tracks.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In sum, Joule would appear entitled to compel arbitration of a dispute with Simmons over her claims of employment discrimination if the agreement\u2019s arbitration provision is valid and meets the \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d requirements of <em>Warfield.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, the motion judge should have considered the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>of Simmons\u2019s challenge to the validity of the agreement\u2019s arbitration provision, namely, that its arbitration provision was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On remand, this challenge must be resolved.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If Simmons\u2019s claim is upheld, then, obviously, arbitration cannot be ordered, and dismissal of Joul\u00e9\u2019s complaint would be in order. But if Simmons does not prevail on her challenge, then Joul\u00e9\u2019s motion to compel arbitration should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the Superior Court denying the motion to compel arbitration is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-12\">Joul\u00e9 Technical Staffing, Inc., is a corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey.

Ctr., Inc., 454 </em>Mass. 390 (2009) <em>(Warfield), </em>we wrote that \u201c[a]n agreement to arbitrate employment discrimination claims represents a limited waiver of rights under G. L. c. 151B. An employee who agrees to arbitrate such a claim of course does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute . . . <em>but does give up the substantial right to seek administrative or judicial remedies\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 398 n.13. The sole issue in <em>Warfield </em>was whether the employee and employer had specifically agreed to arbitrate claims of discrimination within the scope of protection afforded by G. L. c. 151B when they included a general arbitration clause in their employment agreement. See <em>id. </em>at 395-396. We concluded that the employee there had not so agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 402. To the extent that the highlighted language appearing in a footnote may suggest that an employee who <em>has </em>agreed to arbitrate a discrimination claim is precluded from filing a complaint with the MCAD under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, it is incorrect and we do not follow it. See <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Waffle House, Inc., </em>534 U.S. 279, 288-289, 291 (2002) <em>(Waffle House).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\">An argument has been advanced, and addressed by the parties and amici, that pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, the MCAD \u201cadjudicates\u201d complaints of discrimination brought by private complainants and, therefore, that the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Ferrer, </em>552 U.S. 346 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>(2008) <em>{Preston), </em>controls the outcome here. We disagree. <em>Preston </em>involved a contract dispute between an entertainment industry attorney and his television performer client. <em>Id. </em>at 350. The parties\u2019 contract contained an arbitration provision requiring arbitration of any dispute concerning, among others, the contract\u2019s terms, breach, or validity. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff attorney had sought arbitration of the dispute in question, but the defendant client brought suit in State court to enjoin arbitration, arguing that under the California Talent Agencies Act (TAA), the California Labor Commissioner had exclusive original jurisdiction over the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 350-351. The Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim, holding that \u201cwhen parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative, are superseded by the FAA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349-350. The point to emphasize, however, is that in <em>Preston, </em>the Court was considering who was to adjudicate the private parties\u2019 dispute in the first instance, the arbitrator or the administrative agency. See <em>id. </em>at 358-359. The Court distinguished <em>Waffle House, </em>emphasizing that in that case, \u201cthe Court addressed the role of an agency, not as adjudicator but as prosecutor, pursuing an enforcement action in its own name.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359. Indeed, the Court noted, \u201c[e]nforcement of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement in this case does not displace any independent authority the Labor Commissioner may have to investigate and rectify violations of the TAA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359 n.7. Similarly, as we have discussed in the text, the MCAD, proceeding under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, is prosecuting a claim in its own name and rectifying violations of G. L. c. 151B in the public interest. See <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 563, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Wilfert Bros. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>543 U.S. 979 (2004). It is beside the point that the prosecution takes place not before a judge in a court but in the administrative forum in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In its brief, Joul\u00e9 requests that we vacate the Superior Court order and direct on remand that Simmons be ordered to dismiss her MCAD complaint. However, during oral argument before this court Joul\u00e9 agreed that, notwithstanding the arbitration provision in the agreement, Simmons was entitled to file a complaint with the MCAD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The judge\u2019s order states that \u201c[t]he Arbitration Agreement, to the extent enforceable, does not preclude Simmons from being a party to the MCAD action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\">As other courts have noted, there is an inefficiency inherent in having the same core issues be the subject of simultaneous but separate proceedings in two different forums. See, e.g., <em>Marie </em>v. <em>Allied Home Mtge. Corp., </em>402 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 2005). Cf. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 217 (1985) (\u201cthe Arbitration Act requires district courts to compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties files a motion to compel, even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums\u201d). But if an employer decides to initiate arbitration while a related proceeding before the MCAD is ongoing, the decision whether to stay the arbitration proceeding pending the outcome of the MCAD case would appear to be up to the arbitrator. See <em>Marie </em>v. <em>Allied Home Mtge. Corp., supra </em>at 16 nn.11, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Another question raised by such simultaneous proceedings is the impact a settlement of the arbitration or final arbitration award would have on the MCAD\u2019s adjudication or on the type of relief the MCAD may order. See <em>Waffle House, </em>534 U.S. at 297 (\u201cIt is an open question whether a settlement or arbitration judgment would affect the validity of the EEOC\u2019s claim or the character of relief the EEOC may seek\u201d). But, as the Supreme Court also stated, \u201cit \u2018goes without saying that the courts can and should preclude double recovery by an individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>General Tel. Co. of the Northwest </em>v. <em>EEOC, </em>446 U.S. 318, 333 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The record reflects that Simmons refused to pursue arbitration under the employment agreement, and she may take the position that she does not have any \u201cdisputes\u201d with Joul\u00e9. But the arbitration provision provides that \u201cdisputes between [the employee] and Joul\u00e9\u201d are to be resolved by arbitration; this language appears to enable Joul\u00e9 itself to initiate arbitration if it considers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>there to be a dispute, notwithstanding Simmons\u2019s position. The determination whether there is a dispute between the parties presumably would be a matter for the arbitrator. Cf. <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>444 Mass. 366, 373 n.10 (2005) (interpretive assumption \u201cthat an agreement that does not expressly empower the arbitrator to decide issues of the agreement\u2019s interpretation leaves those issues to the courts . . . does not survive <em>Howsam </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 79 [2002]\u201d); <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990), quoting <em>Morceau </em>v. <em>Gould-National Batteries, Inc., </em>344 Mass. 120, 124 (1962) (\u201cquestion of interpretation of the agreement is for the arbitrator\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Simmons contended below \u2014 and argues here \u2014 that in addition to being unconscionable, the arbitration provision does not satisfy the specificity requirements of <em>Warfield, </em>454 Mass, at 398, and therefore does not cover her discrimination claims in any event. The argument fails. The arbitration provision, quoted in full, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>provides in pertinent part that \u201cdisputes between me [Simmons] and Joul\u00e9, its employees and/or its clients <em>relating to my employment and/or termination of my employment (which includes without limitation, claims of discrimination, harassment, hostile work environment, retaliation, </em>or other wrongful termination claims) will be resolved by binding arbitration\u201d (emphasis added). This language makes it \u201cclear and unmistakable,\u201d see <em>War-field, supra, </em>that the arbitration provision applies to employment discrimination claims. We do not agree with Simmons that the reference to waiver of the right to a jury trial in the second paragraph of the arbitration provision (see note 7, <em>supra) </em>renders ambiguous the language quoted here from the provision\u2019s first paragraph. Finally, we understand Simmons\u2019s complaints about the specific arbitration procedures that Joul\u00e9 has prescribed and the difficulty in locating a description of them as relevant to Simmons\u2019s claim of unconscionability, not to whether the arbitration provision meets the <em>Warfield </em>standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In challenging the arbitration provision as unconscionable, Simmons raises a host of claims. Some of these claims, such as that Simmons was forced to sign the employment agreement with the arbitration provision included after she began employment and had turned down other employment opportunities, and that the procedures governing arbitration are hidden in other documents unilaterally subject to change (see note 14, <em>supra), </em>do relate to the issue of unconscionability. Others, however, appear to challenge the conclusion reached by the United States Supreme Court and this court, as stated in <em>Warfield, </em>454 Mass, at 399-401, that claims of employment discrimination can be subject to private arbitration. We leave for the Superior Court judge on remand the separation of these claims and their subsequent resolution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
