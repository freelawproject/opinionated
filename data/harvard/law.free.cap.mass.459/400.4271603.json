As to Joanne, he was found guilty on the theories of extreme atrocity or cruelty and felony murder. The jury found the defendant guilty of Alyssa\u2019s murder on both of those theories and on a theory of deliberate premeditation as well. He was also convicted of one count of aggravated rape of Joanne. The defense at trial was that a third party, most likely the victims\u2019 landlord, committed the murders, and that the police investigation was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>On appeal, the defendant asserts that errors occurred at trial involving the introduction of scientific evidence; the admission of expert testimony by one expert on the results of a test performed by another; and the exclusion of certain evidence related to the victims\u2019 landlord that the defendant contends would have assisted him in presenting both an inadequate investigation defense and a third-party culprit defense. The defendant requests also that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the convictions to a lesser degree of guilt or, in the alternative, to grant him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We reject the defendant\u2019s claims, affirm his convictions of murder in the first degree, and, after review of the entire record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, decline to exercise our power to grant extraordinary relief. Because the defendant was convicted of the rape victim\u2019s murder on theories of both felony-murder and extreme atrocity and cruelty, the judgment on the indictment charging aggravated rape is not duplicative, and that judgment is affirmed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Felder, </em>455 Mass. 359, 370-371 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>441 Mass. 199, 200 n.l (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">1. <em>Facts and procedural background. </em>We recite the facts that the jury could have found, reserving some details for later discussion. During the summer and fall of 2002, the defendant lived with Bobbie Jo Miller, the mother of their infant daughter, in Woburn. In October, 2002, their romantic relationship ended and the defendant moved to a rooming house in Lowell. However, Miller and the defendant continued to have a cordial relationship and he frequently visited their daughter. In the spring of 2003, Miller became friends with Joanne, who lived with her two children on the same street in Woburn. Miller introduced the defendant to Joanne and the three socialized together on occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In November, 2003, Joanne and her children moved into a two-family duplex across the street from where they had been living. The owner of the house, Harinder Singh, his wife, and their children occupied the other unit in the building. The defendant came to the victims\u2019 apartment on a few occasions to assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Joanne with household tasks such as fixing cabinets and connecting the cable television in her new apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">On the evening of January 4, 2004, the defendant called Miller to arrange a visit with his daughter; Miller refused him permission to visit because she suspected he was \u201cunder the influence.\u201d Joanne came to Miller\u2019s house around 7:30 p.m.; she seemed upset and appeared to have been crying. She told Miller that she \u201cneeded to get out of the house,\u201d but left after a few minutes. Joanne was not seen alive after that point. Computer records indicated that she used the Internet until approximately 9:30 p.m. She spoke by telephone with Singh and his wife at approximately 10 p.m. Although they did not talk in person, the defendant telephoned Miller several times that evening from his home, and she telephoned him at approximately 11:30 p.m. The defendant\u2019s home telephone was in use until approximately 11:45 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On January 5, 2004, Alyssa was absent from school and the defendant did not go to work. He told his supervisor and Miller\u2019s mother that he had been up all night fighting with Miller and that he overslept.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He told Miller that he missed work because he was \u201ctired and hung over.\u201d The defendant reported to work as usual on January 6, 2004. Between January 5 and January 7, 2004, Joanne\u2019s car did not move from her driveway and the shades on her house remained drawn. Telephone calls to Alyssa and Joanne were unanswered.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">On January 7, when Joanne did not respond to Miller\u2019s persistent knocking, Miller contacted Joanne\u2019s parents. They entered Joanne\u2019s apartment through the kitchen door, which was open but showed no signs of forced entry. They discovered her partially clad body face down on the living room sofa; she was lying in a pool of blood, dressed only in a black shirt and white sweater that had been sliced open.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Her wrists and ankles bore ligature marks. A rope with duct tape attached was tied around one wrist and there was duct tape on her sweater. Her underwear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>a rolled towel containing her saliva, a comforter, and a pillow were nearby. The medical examiner determined that Joanne had been gagged with the towel, bound, and sexually assaulted. The cause of death was seven stab wounds to the neck, one of which nearly severed a carotid artery, and a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d of blunt force trauma to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Alyssa\u2019s body was found on the floor in an upstairs bedroom, also in a pool of blood. The room showed signs of a severe struggle. Blood spatter and handprints on the wall, defensive wounds on Alyssa\u2019s hands and arms, and blood under her fingernails indicated that she had fought strenuously with her attacker, attempted to escape, and been stabbed at several different locations in the room. Trauma to her face, and damage to the inside of her lip from her braces, showed that she had been punched repeatedly in the face. The medical examiner determined that Alyssa died of stab wounds to the neck that severed both carotid arteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Joanne\u2019s two year old son was found in his crib in his bedroom. He was dehydrated and wearing a heavily soiled diaper, but was otherwise unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Police investigation focused initially on Singh.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, Singh\u2019s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile was excluded as a match to the DNA found in semen on Joanne\u2019s body and clothing. Several days after the discovery of the bodies, police found and developed several rolls of film from Joanne\u2019s apartment. They questioned her friends, particularly Miller, about the individuals in the photographs, a number of which included the defendant. Based on these photographs and interviews, police sought to question the defendant. He agreed to speak with police at his home. He gave conflicting statements about his relationship with Joanne, whom he claimed not to know well; denied having had a sexual relationship with her; and stated that he did not own a vehicle. He had cuts on the knuckles of both hands and was unable to explain their origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">After a hearing, a Superior Court judge ordered the defendant to produce a DNA sample.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The sample resulted in a confirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tory match to DNA in semen found on Joanne and on her clothing. The defendant was arrested following the results of the confirmatory match. Later, testing of blood beneath Alyssa\u2019s fingernails could not exclude the defendant as a contributor to that blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">2. <em>Admission of DNA evidence. </em>The defendant asserts that DNA profile results obtained from evidence found on both victims should not have been admitted. Citing <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 (1993), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 24-26 (1994), he claims that the statistical methods employed by the Commonwealth in interpreting the DNA evidence are unreliable, prejudicial, and irrelevant. Alternatively, the defendant contends that the judge erred by declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the admissibility of the DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">During the course of the investigation, DNA from semen found on the adult victim\u2019s body was compared against DNA profiles of convicted offenders stored in the Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS) database. A DNA match resulting from such a database comparison is known as a \u201ccold hit.\u201d The CODIS database revealed a possible match between the defendant\u2019s DNA profile and the DNA found on the adult victim. Comparison of DNA in a blood sample taken from the defendant after a hearing, and the DNA from the semen on the adult victim\u2019s body, resulted in what is known as a \u201cconfirmatory match.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The DNA expert testified that the likelihood of a random individual having the same profile was one in 101.5 quadrillion in the Caucasian population,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> one in 1.503 quintillion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the African American population, and one in 329.8 quadrillion in the Hispanic population. The DNA expert stated that a quadrillion is one million times the population of the earth. A partial match to the defendant\u2019s DNA was also found in blood under the child victim\u2019s fingernails. That blood sample was small and degraded, yielding a partial Y-STR profile match to the defendant\u2019s DNA at seven of twelve loci.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the defendant could not be excluded from that partial DNA profile, 99.6 per cent of the general Caucasian population could be excluded as contributors to the sample.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude all of the DNA evidence. That motion was denied after a nonevidentiary hearing. The defendant then filed a motion in limine to exclude the Y-STR DNA evidence found under the child victim\u2019s fingernails. A second motion judge denied that motion on the ground that the defendant had not shown that there was disagreement in the scientific community on the validity and reliability of the Y-STR testing used on that sample. At trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude any results from the CODIS database testing, see note 6, supra; that motion was allowed on the Commonwealth\u2019s representation that it did not intend to introduce the results of the CODIS match.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The defendant claims that, even though the jury heard no evidence of the CODIS search and its results,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the admission of the confirmatory match results was error. The defendant contends that there is a significant debate in the scientific community concerning the preferable statistical method for describing the likelihood of a confirmatory match after a cold hit database match. He argues that random match probability (RMP), the statistical method used to determine the probability of a randomly selected individual in the general population having contributed to the DNA profile in the sample, while generally accepted in the scientific community for a \u201cprobable cause\u201d match (a match <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>where a single suspect\u2019s DNA is tested and found to match DNA from a crime scene), is unreliable and more prejudicial than probative when it is used after an earlier cold hit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">There was no error in the first motion judge\u2019s decision that a <em>Lanigan </em>hearing was not necessary and that the DNA evidence was admissible. As that judge stated in denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the use of the DNA analysis involved here is generally accepted within the scientific community. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosier, </em>425 Mass. 807, 813, 815-817 (1997). There is no scientific debate over the methodology by which such DNA matches are obtained or their validity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>443 Mass. 245, 268 (2005). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>458 Mass. 446, 453-454 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim that there is a dispute concerning which statistical measure to use in analyzing the significance of a confirmatory match following a cold hit confuses the purpose of the statistical measures, which are not in conflict.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>feting statistical methods that the defendant discusses, including the RMP (or rarity calculation), are each used (separately or in combination) to describe the significance of such a hit. There is no debate over the calculation involved in each method, what it measures, or its reliability. The scientific debate concerns only which method or combination of methods is most relevant in describing the statistical significance of this type of match. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>887 A.2d 1013, 1022-1025 (D.C. 2005). Statisticians agree that the question of \u201cascertainment bias\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> created by a cold hit match is a significant issue, and that presentation of the significance of the cold hit match must account for ascertainment bias in some manner. See <em>id. </em>As the first motion judge concluded, however, questions of relevancy do not involve the validity or reliability of the testing method. The judge observed that the defendant would be \u201cfree to challenge the relevance of rarity statistics\u201d at trial, and the defendant did so on cross-examination of both DNA experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s argument would eviscerate the purpose for which the Legislature created the CODIS database. The defendant claims, in essence, that the statistical significance of the probability of a given DNA profile in the general population, widely accepted in the scientific community and courts throughout the United States (and bearing no relationship to whether an individual\u2019s DNA profile is in a CODIS database), somehow becomes irrelevant and unreliable when the individual involved was first identified through a CODIS database. Were we to accept the defendant\u2019s argument, DNA evidence from convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>offenders whose DNA is stored in a CODIS database could never be used at trial unless it was obtained without using the CODIS database. Exclusion of DNA evidence from convicted offenders was surely not the result intended by the Legislature in enacting G. L. c. 22E, \u00a7 3, to create a database designed to aid law enforcement personnel in investigating serious crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Having concluded that there was no error in the motion judges\u2019 decisions prior to trial to permit introduction of the DNA evidence, we turn to the admission of the DNA evidence presented at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>450 Mass. 858, 872 n.15 (2008) (judge accorded substantial discretion in deciding whether evidence is relevant, and, if so, whether it should nevertheless be excluded as less probative than prejudicial). Pursuant to the defendant\u2019s third motion to exclude DNA evidence (his only motion with regard to the DNA evidence that was made at trial), all mention of the CODIS database was excluded<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the jury heard only testimony concerning the DNA evidence obtained from the defendant by court order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>454 Mass. 440, 447 (2009) (\u201cAlthough [the CODIS database] \u2018hit\u2019 focused attention on the defendant and led to the Commonwealth\u2019s obtaining a new sample of his DNA which then was sent to the . . . laboratory, it was the comparison by the . . . laboratory of his known DNA sample with the male DNA samples from the crime scene that led to the critical match used at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We have adhered to the rule that test results showing a DNA match should not be admitted without statistical evidence of the likelihood of that match occurring. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218, 222 n.7 (1991). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, </em>455 Mass. 840, 851-855 (2010), we held that DNA evidence that a particular individual could not be excluded as a potential contributor of the DNA at issue should not be admitted without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>accompanying statistical evidence of the likelihood that the test could not exclude other individuals in a given population.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Here, each of the two DNA experts who extracted the DNA profiles (one from the sperm and one from the blood samples) testified at trial. The former stated that the defendant\u2019s DNA matched DNA samples taken from the adult victim, and the latter testified that the defendant could not be excluded from DNA found on the twelve year old victim. As discussed <em>supra, </em>each described in detail the statistical likelihood that a randomly selected individual in the general population could be excluded as a contributor to these samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">3. <em>Chemist\u2019s report. </em>The defendant contends that the admission of testimony by a State police chemist, Eugene Hagan, who examined evidence at the crime scene but was not the expert who conducted the tests at issue, violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to confront and cross-examine witnesses. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 40 (2004). In addition to describing his own investigation, Hagan testified concerning the results of a report prepared by another State police chemist, Thomas Sendlenski, who performed tests on a number of objects found near Joanne\u2019s body. These tests included two methods of screening for the possible presence of semen. Sendlenski found no evidence of semen on the sofa on which Joanne was lying, the pillows near her, or the comforter that an initial responder had used to partially cover her body. The absence of semen on the comforter, in particular, was contrary to the defense theory that the defendant and Joanne had engaged in consensual sexual relations several days before the crime, and that semen from the comforter had been transferred to her shirt when rescue personnel picked it up to cover her.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The defendant did not object to the admission of this testimony; therefore, we review the defendant\u2019s claim to determine whether there was error and, if so, whether the error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 763 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Hagan\u2019s testimony concerning the presence of semen at the crime scene should not have been admitted. We have held that expert opinion testimony based on hearsay does not violate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him, and is admissible, so long as the hearsay is independently admissible and is of a kind customarily relied on by experts in that field as a basis for opinion testimony, and the expert does not testify to the details of the hearsay on direct examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banville, </em>457 Mass. 530, 541-542 (2010). The expert giving the opinion may testify to his or her own actions and observations, the identification of the hearsay material on which he or she relied, the reliance by professionals within his or her area of expertise on such material, and his or her own opinion. <em>Id. </em>The expert is subject to cross-examination on these matters. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 390 (2008) . See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 761-762 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>454 Mass. 721, 732 (2009) .</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Here, Hagan testified that he had reviewed Sendlenski\u2019s report, and that it was the type of report on which chemists are accustomed to rely. Had Sendlenski testified, his findings would have been independently admissible. However, Hagan did not rely on Sendlenski\u2019s findings in presenting his own opinion. Rather, Hagan recited the results of Sendlenski\u2019s tests and presented to the jury Sendlenski\u2019s underlying factual findings. Hagan stated that, although he worked overnight at the crime scene, he left the scene while the tests were being conducted. He described in detail the tests used to detect the presence of semen, and, relying on the report, presented the locations at which semen was or was not found. This testimony was not permissible opinion testimony based on the results of tests performed by another expert. The testimony introduced factual findings through the hearsay notes of a nontestifying expert, and should not have been admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, supra </em>at 762. In addition, the prosecutor emphasized this testimonial hearsay as fact during her closing argument, when she referred to the absence of semen on the comforter to refute the defendant\u2019s argument that he had had consensual sex with Joanne several days before the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Nonetheless, the admission of this evidence could have had little or no effect on the verdicts, and there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Linton, </em>456 Mass. 534, 560 (2010). The properly admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>evidence against the defendant was overwhelming. DNA matching the defendant\u2019s DNA profile was found in semen at two locations in and on the adult victim\u2019s body, and one location on her clothes. The semen on her clothes was on a shirt that that victim had been wearing on the last day she was seen alive, and that had been ripped open in front. The semen had been deposited no more than five to seven days before the sample was taken; a DNA expert testified that it would have been eliminated by physical activity or bathing. The semen had a very rare DNA profile; as stated, see part 2, <em>supra, </em>the probability of a randomly selected, unrelated individual matching it was one in 101.5 quadrillion of the Caucasian population. Similarly, whereas 99.6 per cent of the Caucasian population could be excluded, the defendant could not be excluded from the partial DNA profile from the blood under the child victim\u2019s fingernails. See part 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In addition to the DNA evidence, other physical evidence connected the defendant to the crime. Rope consistent with the type of rope found on the adult victim\u2019s arm was discovered in the truck, customarily driven by the defendant, that was parked outside the defendant\u2019s rooming house. Police recovered bloody jeans from the defendant\u2019s room; the blood matched the defendant\u2019s.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">There was also substantial consciousness of guilt evidence. Police found a letter in the defendant\u2019s room addressed to his daughter, dated January 5, 2004, stating that he had done \u201csome bad things\u201d and was taking \u201cthe easy way out,\u201d but would be watching her from a star. On the night of January 7, 2004, after the victims\u2019 bodies were discovered, the defendant went to visit Miller, stating that he wanted to console her. He had hives on his forehead which appeared when he was angry or nervous. He also had cuts on his hands, and, in Miller\u2019s opinion, he looked \u201cstressed out.\u201d When Miller asked him what was wrong, the defendant said that he had \u201ca lot on his mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Moreover, the erroneously admitted testimony (no semen present on the sofa, the comforter, and the pillows) was not incriminating because it, by itself, did not tie the defendant to the crime. The defendant contends, however, that he would have benefited from the presence of semen on the comforter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>and therefore that the evidence of the lack of semen on the comforter impaired his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">He reasons in that regard that Joanne customarily slept on the couch and used the comforter and pillows found near her body as bedding. The defendant\u2019s counsel suggested in his closing (with no basis in the evidence) that the defendant had consensual sex with Joanne on January 2, 2004, and that semen from that hypothesized sexual encounter remained on the comforter for days afterward. Counsel contended that the semen was transferred to Joanne\u2019s shirt when the comforter was placed over her by initial responders, and that this would explain the presence of the defendant\u2019s DNA on her shirt. But absent the presence of semen on the bedding, this theory became untenable, and the jury were left with the logical alternative that the defendant\u2019s semen was deposited on Joanne\u2019s shirt at the time she was killed. The entire argument fails for lack of any evidentiary support for the theory, there being no evidence whatever that Joanne and the defendant had a consensual sexual encounter on January 2, 2004, or at any other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">4. <em>Evidence of the adequacy of the police investigation. </em>The defendant contends that he was deprived of his constitutional right to challenge the police investigation, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, supra </em>at 753, when the judge excluded certain evidence, detailed <em>infra, </em>regarding Joanne\u2019s landlord, Singh. As stated, Singh was the initial target of the police investigation. The defendant claims that, although police interviewed Singh, searched his house cursorily, and obtained a DNA sample from him, once they learned of the defendant\u2019s DNA profile match they dropped their investigation of Singh and focused only on the defendant. See part 5, <em>infra. </em>The defendant argues that the excluded evidence would have demonstrated to the jury that the police should have investigated Singh more extensively and would have supported the defendant\u2019s claim that the police investigation was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">A defense of inadequate police investigation suggests to the jury \u201cthat the evidence at trial may be inadequate or unreliable because the police failed to conduct the scientific tests or to pursue leads that a reasonable police investigation would have conducted or investigated,\u201d with the result that the police may have missed \u201csignificant evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>innocence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 801 (2009). \u201cUnder the so-called <em>Bowden </em>defense, a defendant [may] challenge the adequacy of a police investigation and may use information concerning third-party culprits to question whether the police took reasonable steps to investigate the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ridge, </em>455 Mass. 307, 316 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 486 (1980). Because any statements introduced as part of such a defense are offered not for their truth, but to prove that the police did not take \u201creasonable steps to investigate,\u201d those statements are not hearsay. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ridge, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 802. Evidence is admissible to show inadequate police investigation, however, only if police learned of it during the course of their investigation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 803. In deciding whether to admit such evidence, the judge must determine \u201cwhether the probative weight of the <em>Bowden </em>evidence exceeds the risk of unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth from diverting the jury\u2019s attention to collateral matters.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The defendant objects first to the judge\u2019s exclusion of statements made by Joanne to her friends and neighbors, which statements were then reported by those individuals to police and to the defendant\u2019s investigator, regarding the relationship between Joanne and Singh. Several individuals told police that Joanne had started a new, \u201chush-hush\u201d romantic relationship with an unidentified male. One friend told police that Joanne had said the man involved was Singh, and that friend suggested that secrecy was required because Singh was married. Another friend said that Singh had promised to build Joanne a deck, had offered to buy her a bed, and that he was \u201ctoo nice\u201d to her. After another individual informed police that Joanne said Singh entertained her on a futon in his basement, where they drank scotch, police obtained Singh\u2019s consent for a search of the basement and found a futon, scotch, and glasses.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">At trial, the Commonwealth moved to exclude all \u201crape shield evidence,\u201d see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B (the rape shield statute),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>and sought to exclude all statements that Joanne was having \u201can affair\u201d with Singh on the grounds that such statements were hearsay and \u201cpotentially\u201d fell within the rape shield statute.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to \u201callow evidence of inadequate investigation\u201d but excluded \u201cthe hearsay statement that the victim was having an affair with the landlord\u201d unless the defendant filed a motion pursuant to the rape shield statute and that motion were allowed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In addition, the judge denied a motion in limine by the defendant seeking to cross-examine a friend of Joanne regarding statements the friend made to the police about Joanne\u2019s relationship with Singh.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We need not determine whether the judge was correct in finding the rape shield statute applicable in these circumstances. The judge acted within her discretion in excluding the statements because they did not meet the balancing requirement set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801-804.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The statements suggesting the existence of an alleged romantic relationship between Joanne and an unidentified male were of extremely dubious probative value and could have distracted the jury, to the Commonwealth\u2019s prejudice. As the judge said, alleged statements that Joanne was having an \u201caffair\u201d did not constitute tips received by police that someone else committed the offense and provided no more than a \u201cfeeble\u201d indication, see <em>id. </em>at 801, that police might have had reason to investigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>such an individual. The innuendo that the unidentified man was Singh was similarly not probative. There was no evidence of any hostility on the part of Singh or motive that he might have had to harm the victims. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>429 Mass. 388, 391-392 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The defendant objects also to the exclusion of evidence in a police report involving an incident between Singh and a former tenant, five months earlier, in which the tenant called police after Singh went to her apartment uninvited. The report stated that, early in the evening on August 16, 2003, Singh telephoned the former tenant and told her that he wanted her out of the apartment. Later that evening, the tenant heard the door open and saw Singh at the bottom of the stairs, yelling at her; he had used his key to enter the apartment. She told him to leave and then called police. Singh left before police arrived, but, when police located him in his back yard, he was so intoxicated that they took him into protective custody for his own safety. Police were familiar with the tenant and Singh because, on numerous previous occasions, each had made complaints against the other (although police did not bring charges in response to any of those complaints). The defendant argued unsuccessfully at trial that the statements should have been admitted, \u201cnot for the truth of the matter, but to show whether the investigating officer had any intensity\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> in pursuing the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Because this information was not relevant to the crimes for which the defendant was on trial, its exclusion was not an abuse of discretion. During a sidebar conference on the question of admission of the information in the police report, the prosecutor stated that Singh went to the tenant\u2019s part of the house to confront the unruly tenant who was engaged in a heated dispute with her boy friend. She offered to introduce evidence to show that the former tenant had a reputation of being difficult, and that the defendant\u2019s description of the incident was not supported by the evidence. These collateral circumstances had no relationship to the offense at issue, and the judge ruled properly that the police report could not be admitted as evidence that police should have devoted more attention to Singh in their investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The exclusion of the friends\u2019 statements and the police report did not prevent the defendant from challenging the adequacy of the police investigation. The judge stated that the defendant would have \u201cfree rein\u201d to pursue his theory of alleged deficiencies in the police investigation, and the defendant pursued this theory vigorously in cross-examination and in closing. He inquired of many of the police officers concerning tests that were not conducted and questions that they did not ask witnesses. He attacked the manner in which DNA and other scientific tests were performed and whether the samples had been contaminated, and brought out on cross-examination of the DNA expert that one in 204 people could have matched the partial DNA profile in the blood under Alyssa\u2019s fingernails.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Despite the exclusions of which the defendant complains, he was permitted to produce other evidence at trial supporting his claim that police should have investigated Singh more carefully. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ridge, </em>455 Mass. 307, 316 (2009) (\u201cThe defendant fails to address the fact that almost all of what he contends he wanted to raise was, in fact, asked\u201d). The defendant cross-examined both Singh and his wife on Singh\u2019s relationship and interactions with Joanne. In closing, the defendant emphasized the asserted failings in the police investigation, taking note not only of the investigative tests that the police did not undertake, but also of the evidence found in Singh\u2019s house and the questions that police did not ask during their investigation of Singh. He argued vigorously that police did not do enough to pursue their investigation of Singh after they obtained the defendant\u2019s DNA test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">5. <em>Third-party culprit evidence. </em>The defendant claims also that the judge\u2019s decision to exclude statements by Joanne and her friends and neighbors concerning her alleged relationship with Singh and the police report detailing Singh\u2019s altercation with the former tenant, as described in part 4, <em>supra, </em>denied him the ability to present adequately a third-party culprit defense that Singh was the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">While a third-party culprit defense is offered frequently in conjunction with a defense of inadequate police investigation and both defenses may rely on the same evidence, the purposes to be served by introducing the evidence differ. Rather than seeking to undermine the strength of the investigation, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>inference to be drawn from third-party culprit evidence is simply that someone else committed the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 800-801 (2009). Although we have accorded wide latitude to judges in determining whether to admit evidence that a person other than the defendant may have committed the crime, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>455 Mass. 811, 824 (2010), that discretion is limited in two respects. First, because the evidence is introduced to prove its truth (i.e., that a third party committed the crime), it may constitute hearsay. If such evidence does not fall within a hearsay exception, we have permitted its introduction \u201conly if, in the judge\u2019s discretion, \u2018the evidence is otherwise relevant, will not tend to prejudice or confuse the jury, and there are other \u201csubstantial connecting links\u201d to the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 305 (2004). Second, the evidence \u201cmust have a rational tendency to prove the issue the defense raises, and the evidence cannot be too remote or speculative.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 22 (1996).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The judge did not abuse her discretion in excluding, in the context of a third-party culprit defense, statements regarding Joanne\u2019s alleged romantic relationship with Singh and the police report describing the incident with Singh\u2019s former tenant. Offered for this purpose, those statements were hearsay. As the judge correctly concluded, and as noted in part 4, <em>supra, </em>the defendant\u2019s offer of proof failed to show any \u201csubstantial connecting link\u201d between Singh and the murders. The evidence was of a highly speculative nature and did not \u201chave a rational tendency to prove\u201d that Singh committed the crime. The judge characterized the affidavit submitted by the defendant\u2019s investigator in support of the introduction of the evidence as \u201ca lot of hearsay,\u201d \u201cuseless,\u201d and \u201cnot even close\u201d to showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Singh was a third-party culprit, and stated that the defendant was not entitled to present \u201ca defense based on rumor.\u201d We agree. The statements lacked probative value and could easily have led to confusion of the jury and unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801 (\u201cfeeble third-party culprit evidence poses a risk of unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>432 Mass. 578, 588-589 (2000) (murder victim\u2019s statements to friend about her fear of third party were hearsay and would be \u201cconfusing\u201d to jury as \u201cno more than an opinion of [his] involvement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Nor did the judge\u2019s exclusion of these statements deprive the defendant of the ability to present a defense suggesting that Singh was the killer. Police officers testified that Singh was interviewed at the police station, that he voluntarily provided DNA samples on police request, and that he allowed police to search his house. An investigating officer described the search and the objects that police took from Singh\u2019s house for testing, including footwear that might have matched shoe imprints found in Alyssa\u2019s room and beverage glasses. The defendant was able to point to the glasses, alcohol, and other evidence found in Singh\u2019s basement and to indicate that police sought this evidence \u201con information received.\u201d Evidence concerning the incident with the former tenant, the promise to build a deck, and the offer to buy a bed was introduced on cross-examination of Singh and his wife.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The defendant argued forcefully in closing that the investigation was inadequate and suggested that Singh was the culprit.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">6. <em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Although the defendant does not raise the issues on appeal, our review of the record indicates that two aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument were improper. Because there was no objection at trial to the first line of improper argument, we review to determine whether a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>occurred. At the end of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the defendant objected to the second of the problematic arguments, and the judge gave a curative instruction immediately thereafter. The defendant did not object to the curative instruction, nor has he raised the point on appeal. Therefore, we again review only to determine whether a likelihood of a miscarriage of justice was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">First, the prosecutor speculated, repeatedly and at length, about what Joanne and her daughter might have been thinking and what actions they might have taken during the commission of the crime. For instance, the prosecutor hypothesized that Alyssa might have come downstairs and seen the defendant raping her mother, then run back upstairs. She debated whether Joanne might have let the defendant into the house, and described in detail the possible thoughts that might have been running through her head, in particular concerning her children, during the rape. Prosecutors must limit the scope of their arguments to facts in evidence and inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beaudry, </em>445 Mass. 577, 580 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Good, </em>409 Mass. 612, 623 (1991). These statements were not supported by any evidence and should not have been permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Second, the prosecutor urged the jury to place themselves in Alyssa\u2019s shoes. The jury should not be asked to put themselves \u201cin the shoes\u201d of the victim, or otherwise be asked to identify with the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>400 Mass. 676, 684 (1987). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grinkley, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 798, 808-809 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 511-512 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 806 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 165, 176 &amp; n. 9 (1981). Generally, the victim\u2019s state of mind is not at issue in a homicide case. Such cases revolve around questions such as the identity of the killer, the killer\u2019s intent, the means employed by the killer, and the like. Asking that the jury focus on the victim distracts attention from the actual issues, and invites the jury to decide guilt or innocence on the basis of sympathy. Nor can this type of argument be justified on the ground that it serves the Commonwealth\u2019s effort to prove that the killing was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, a showing that turns largely on what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>defendant </em>has done. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1983) (factors which jury may consider in deciding whether crime committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty include [1] indifference to or taking pleasure in the victim\u2019s suffering, [2] consciousness and degree of suffering of the victim, [3] extent of physical injuries, [4] number of blows inflicted, [5] manner and force with which blows were delivered, [6] nature of instrument or weapon used, and [7] disproportion between means needed to cause death and those employed).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We conclude that the improprieties in the closing argument, while serious, do not require a new trial. The evidence against the defendant, specifically the DNA evidence, was overwhelming. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kent K., </em>427 Mass. 754, 761 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 501 (1997) (\u201calthough troubling,\u201d improper appeals to sympathy less crucial where \u201cguilt is clear\u201d). Additionally, the judge\u2019s curative instruction on the issue of juror sympathy was forceful and was given immediately following the improper argument, separately from the remainder of the judge\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We have reviewed the entire record and discern no reason to order a new trial or reduce the convictions of murder in the first degree to a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">7. <em>Conclusion. </em>The convictions of murder in the first degree are affirmed. Because the defendant was convicted of the rape victim\u2019s murder on theories of both felony-murder and extreme atrocity and cruelty, the judgment on the indictment charging aggravated rape is not duplicative, and that judgment is affirmed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Felder, </em>455 Mass. 359, 370-371 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, </em>441 Mass. 199, 200 n.l (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Because the victims share a last name, and to protect their privacy given the nature of the crime, we refer to the victims by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Telephone records showed no contact between the defendant\u2019s telephone number and Miller\u2019s number after approximately 11:30 p.m., and no use of the defendant\u2019s telephone from approximately 11:45 p.m. on January 4, 2004, until 9:50 a.m. on January 5, 2004, when he spoke with his supervisor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-12\">These were the same clothes that she had been seen wearing on January 4, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Police also investigated the fathers of Joanne\u2019s children and residents of a local half-way house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\">On January 16, 2004, several days after their first interview of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>ant, police initiated a Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS) database search for a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile matching the foreign DNA found on the victims. The CODIS database is comprised of DNA samples from individuals convicted of offenses in Massachusetts punishable by imprisonment in a State prison. See G. L. c. 22E, \u00a7 3. This search produced a match to DNA taken previously from the defendant. The grand jury then sought a court order to obtain a new sample from the defendant. The defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude the CODIS results. To avoid prejudice to the defendant due to his prior conviction and his status as a level 3 sex offender, the parties stipulated that the police collect DNA from many people, and any mention of the CODIS database was excluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b425-13\">The defendant\u2019s DNA profile matched the samples taken from the adult victim\u2019s shirt and from her genitals, and was the major contributor to the sample taken from within her vagina.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b425-14\">The defendant is Caucasian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Y-STR testing involves testing only the twelve male loci from a given sample.

The Commonwealth contends that, at trial, the defendant objected only to the evidence from the CODIS database, and, by failing to object at trial on the grounds raised in his pretrial motions, waived any objection to admission of the other DNA evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 26 (1998). The defendant argues, however, that the CODIS hit prompted police to obtain the confirmatory match used at trial, and that the statistical methodology required to present the confirmatory match to the jury is interwoven with the number and types of samples in the CODIS database. Moreover, in denying the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to exclude all the DNA evidence, the motion judge (who was not the trial judge) stated explicitly that the defendant\u2019s objection was noted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kee, </em>449 Mass. 550, 553 n.5 (2007) (objection to denial of motion in limine before trial reviewed under harmless error standard where judge stated in denying motion that defendant\u2019s objection was noted and his rights were \u201csaved\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, </em>447 Mass. 737, 746-747 (2006) (objection to denial of motion in limine before trial, while not generally sufficient to preserve appellate rights, may suffice in particular circumstances). Accordingly, we consider the issue preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The defendant points to a number of statistical methods that he alleges are topics of debate within the scientific community. As the District of Columbia Court of Appeals makes clear in a case discussing the same scientific issues, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>887 A.2d 1013, 1022-1025 (D.C. 2005), these statistical calculations do not conflict; they simply measure different things. The random match probability (RMP or rarity) calculation measures how rare a given DNA sample is among the general population. The database match probability calculation states the probability of obtaining a match to a known sample from a particular database. The calculation discussed by Professors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>David Balding and Peter Donnelly, on which the defendant relies, describes the probability, given that some number of other suspects have been eliminated through the database search, that a suspect identified by a cold hit is the source of DNA in a particular sample. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Ascertainment bias describes \u201cthe bias that exists when one searches for something rare in a set database.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra </em>at 1018-1019. For example, if the RMP of a defendant\u2019s DNA profile is one in 100,000 in the general population, a search of a database of 100,000 unrelated DNA profiles will, statistically, produce one match. If the database searched instead contains 200,000 profiles, then two matches will be produced. The larger the database the more matches, and thus the more potential suspects, will be produced. As a result, \u201cthe more populated the database is, the less impressive a match becomes.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra </em>at 1019 n.10. The second and third calculations discussed in note 13, <em>supra, </em>are designed to address the issue of ascertainment bias.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\">We make no comment regarding the necessity of such a ruling. At this time, most courts in other jurisdictions that have considered the issue have held admissible evidence that a defendant was first identified through a match in an offender database.
