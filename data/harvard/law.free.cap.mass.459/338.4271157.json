DiFronzo was denied benefits by the National Union Fire Insurance Company (insurer) after being struck by a motor vehicle in a public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">An administrative judge awarded DiFronzo compensation and medical expenses, and unpaid interest due on each, and ordered the insurer to pay DiFronzo\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The judge concluded that the insurer had defended the claim without \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for so doing, and ordered the insurer to pay both the entire cost of the proceedings and double back benefits<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1) (\u00a7 14 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On appeal, the board reversed the \u00a7 14 (1) penalty of double back benefits and costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> DiFronzo appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>DiFronzo was employed as a laborer on a large-scale construction project in downtown Boston, referred to as the \u201cBig Dig\u201d or Central Artery/Tunnel Project, one element of which involved the conversion of an elevated highway into a subterranean highway. The construction project was divided into \u201cwork zones\u201d from which the public was excluded, but the adjoining streets remained open to the public. Workers on the project regularly crossed the public streets to move between work zones or for other work-related tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">On September 22, 1998, DiFronzo was crossing North Street soon after completing his regular work shift when he was struck by a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the time of the accident, DiFronzo had just finished putting away his tools and was proceeding in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>direction of a work zone on the opposite side of North Street where the employer\u2019s trucks were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Two days after the accident, the insurer conducted a recorded interview with a witness who said he had been speaking with DiFronzo just prior to the accident. In that interview, the witness stated that, after he spoke with DiFronzo for ten to fifteen minutes, DiFronzo \u201csaw his bus and he said [\u2018]I\u2019ve got to go now that\u2019s my bus.[\u2019]\u201d According to the account, DiFronzo then ran out into North Street where he was struck by the motor vehicle. The witness said DiFronzo commuted home from work on that bus route every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">DiFronzo applied for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, but the insurer denied his claim on the basis that DiFronzo had finished his work day and was on his commute home when he was injured. DiFronzo then sought a hearing before an administrative judge of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">At the hearing, the insurer\u2019s prior interview with the witness was entered in evidence. DiFronzo, however, testified that he was crossing North Street at the time of the accident not for the purpose of catching a bus, but to use a two-way radio in one of his employer\u2019s trucks to contact his supervisor. DiFronzo said that he was going to tell his supervisor that the area where he worked was no longer manned, and to ask whether there was any further work to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Based on all the evidence in the case, the administrative judge credited DiFronzo\u2019s version of events. The judge granted DiFronzo total incapacity compensation, reasonable and necessary medical expenses, and interest due on unpaid benefits. The judge also awarded DiFronzo\u2019s counsel an enhanced attorney\u2019s fee and, pursuant to \u00a7 14 (1), assessed to the insurer the whole cost of the proceedings and a penalty of double back benefits for having defended the claim without reasonable grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The insurer appealed to the board. The board affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>award of compensation benefits, recommitted the case on the issue of the attorney\u2019s fees, and reversed the administrative judge\u2019s award of a \u00a7 14 (1) penalty. The sole question now on appeal is whether the board properly reversed the judge\u2019s award of a \u00a7 14 (1) penalty. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The workers\u2019 compensation statute directs that review of a decision of the board is to be in accordance with G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (a)-(d), (/), and (g). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2). We may thus reverse or modify the board\u2019s decision when, inter alia, it is \u201cbased upon an error of law\u201d or is \u201c[arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (c), (g). We accordingly consider \u201cwhether the decision is factually warranted and not \u2018 [arbitrary or capricious,\u2019 in the sense of having adequate evidentiary and factual support and disclosing reasoned decision making.\u201d <em>Carpenter\u2019s Case, </em>456 Mass. 436, 439 (2010), quoting <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 258 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">This case calls for a construction of statutory text. We accord substantial deference to the interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for its administration, although \u201cultimately the \u2018duty of statutory interpretation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>for the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moss\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 704, 709 (2008), quoting <em>Slater\u2019s Case, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 330 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The double back benefits and costs assessed against the insurer by the administrative judge in this case were imposed pursuant to \u00a7 14 (1). That provision instructs that such benefits and costs are to be granted when a proceeding has been \u201cbrought, prosecuted, or defended by an insurer without reasonable grounds.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1). In assessing the present case, both the administrative judge and the board adopted the standard of \u201creasonable grounds\u201d set forth in <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>IGS Store Fixtures, Inc., </em>13 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 21, 24 (1999). In that case, the board applied an objective standard of reasonableness, inquiring whether a \u201ccautious and prudent person\u201d would consider the grounds for bringing, prosecuting, or defending the proceeding to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">DiFronzo and the insurer agree with the board that the statute sets forth an objective rather than subjective standard, and we conclude as a preliminary matter that the board did not err in so construing the statute. The Legislature\u2019s decision to condition \u00a7 14 (1) penalties on the absence of \u201creasonable grounds\u201d implies an objective inquiry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of the Dept. of Personnel Admin., </em>423 Mass. 1017, 1017 (1996) (endorsing objective, rather than subjective, inquiry to determine whether failure to give proper notice was \u201creasonable under the circumstances,\u201d as required by civil service statute, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 38); <em>Choa </em>v. <em>Hotel Oasis, Inc., </em>493 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 2007) (construing statutory reference to \u201cgood faith and. . . reasonable grounds\u201d to mean \u201cgood faith and objective reasonableness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In applying this standard, the board inquired whether a \u201cprudent insurer\u201d would have defended the claim. Such a deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>mination of prudence is inherently contextual, and is informed by the holdings of our prior \u00a7 14 (1) cases. While we have not set forth a definitive standard, we have held that insurers were not without reasonable grounds where \u201c[a] fair question of law\u201d was presented, <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489, 493 (1922), or where an insurer\u2019s argument had \u201csome plausibility,\u201d <em>Meley\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 136, 139 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We turn now to the facts of the case at bar. DiFronzo does not dispute that the insurer conducted a recorded interview in which the witness suggested that DiFronzo had run into the street to catch a bus. The administrative judge nonetheless stated in her decision that the evidence indicating that DiFronzo was still working at the time of the accident was \u201cuncontroverted.\u201d The board, reviewing the opinion of the judge, concluded that the judge\u2019s decision in that respect was in error. We agree. Whatever the judge may have concluded as to the weight of that evidence in light of further testimony and evidence at the hearing, we think the evidence provided adequate grounds for the insurer to present an alternative version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The existence of such support for an alternative narrative, standing alone, does not resolve the question before us. If it were clear that DiFronzo would be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits even if he had, in fact, been crossing North Street to catch his bus, \u00a7 14 (1) penalties would likely be appropriate. We accordingly review the applicable law to determine whether the law was clear that DiFronzo would be due benefits in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">An employee is due compensation when he \u201creceives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, or arising out of an ordinary risk of the street while actually engaged, with his employer\u2019s authorization, in the business affairs or undertakings of his employer.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. Massachusetts courts, like the courts of other States, have grappled with the question of compensability where employees were injured while coming from or going to the workplace. See 1 Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13.01 (2010). In <em>Fumiciello\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 488, 489-490 (1914), for example, we held that a claimant who was hit by a train on his commute was not due compensation because the railroad was not part of, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>connected with, the employer\u2019s plant, and because the employer did not control the railroad. That was true even though the claimant had to cross the railroad to reach the plant. <em>Id. </em>Consistent with such an approach, we have generally held that employees injured on their commute to and from work are not due workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See <em>Haslam\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 101, 101 (2008), quoting <em>Chernick\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 168, 172 (1934) (compensation \u201cdoes not extend to cover employees going to and coming from their work\u201d). See also <em>Gwaltney\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 333, 335 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Injuries occurring on the employer\u2019s premises, however, are generally compensable, even if the employee was injured while arriving or departing. See <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Tin Kee Ng, </em>400 Mass. 131, 134 (1987). See also <em>Milliman\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 451, 452-453 (1936) (\u201cThough the employee when injured was on his way home he was on his employer\u2019s premises where his employment carried him,\u201d and transportation to and from work was incident of employment; compensation was thus due). We have also extended compensability to injuries arising while an employee was arriving to or departing from work on a private passage to which the employer had a right of use \u2014 such as a stairwell, elevator, parking lot, or outdoor passageway. See <em>Mahan\u2019s Case, </em>350 Mass. 777, 777 (1966); <em>Mannering\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 517, 518-519 (1935), and cases cited; <em>Latter\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 326, 327-328 (1921); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 915, 915-916 (1985). Such cases have been distinguished from those in which the relevant injury occurred during a commute on a public way. See <em>Mannering\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 519, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We have not had occasion, however, to address factual circumstances akin to those presented by the version of events suggested by the witness\u2019s recorded statement. Had the administrative judge credited the witness\u2019s account, an unresolved question of law \u2014 whether a public street between two \u201cwork zones\u201d crossed by an employee on his way home constitutes the employer\u2019s \u201cpremises\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation purposes \u2014 would have emerged.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The answer to that question was not clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>when the insurer decided to defend the suit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As such, we think the insurer had a plausible defense based on the recorded statement of the witness. The board did not err in concluding that the imposition of \u00a7 14 (1) penalties should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The insurer in this case had evidence from an eyewitness that would have placed DiFronzo crossing North Street to catch his bus home when he was injured. As the law regarding the eligibility of a person in such circumstances for workers\u2019 compensation was unclear, it cannot be said, under an objective reasonableness standard, that the insurer defended the claim without reasonable grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Decision of the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1), provides that \u201cif a subsequent order requires that additional compensation be paid, a penalty of double back benefits of such amount shall be paid by the insurer to the employee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents took other action, see <em>infra, </em>but the reversal of the penalty of double back benefits and costs is the only matter at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\">As both double back benefits and the costs of the proceeding \u201cshall\u201d be paid by the insurer where the insurer defends a claim without reasonable grounds, we assume that the board\u2019s decision to \u201creverse the \u00a7 14(1) penalty\u201d reversed both the costs and double back benefits. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b359-11\">DiFronzo\u2019s regular work shift ran from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. On the day of the accident, DiFronzo worked until at least 3:35 p.m. and thus had already begun working overtime. He was struck by the automobile at approximately 3:40 p.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b360-10\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">\u201c[I]f any administrative judge or administrative law judge determines that any proceedings have been brought, prosecuted, or defended by an insurer without reasonable grounds: <em>(a) </em>the whole cost of the proceedings shall be assessed upon the insurer; and <em>(b) </em>if a subsequent order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>requires that additional compensation be paid, a penalty of double back benefits of such amount shall be paid by the insurer to the employee....</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">\u201cIf any administrative judge or administrative law judge determines that any proceedings have been brought or defended by an employee or counsel without reasonable grounds, the whole cost of the proceedings shall be assessed against the employee or counsel, whomever is responsible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b361-13\">During the pendency of the recommitment by the board, DiFronzo filed a new claim for permanent and total incapacity benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, and for psychiatric treatment. After a statutory conference pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, the administrative judge awarded DiFronzo ongoing G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, benefits but denied the claim for psychiatric benefits. Both parties claimed a hearing. DiFronzo and National Union Fire Insurance Company (insurer) eventually reached an agreement as to DiFronzo\u2019s benefits and the attorney\u2019s fees that resolved all pending litigation. DiFronzo and the insurer stipulated that all issues to be determined upon recommitment by the board had been resolved, and DiFronzo then pursued his appeal of the board\u2019s decision as to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1), penalties. That appeal is now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">While we affirm the broad outline of the board\u2019s approach, we do not think the board\u2019s adherence to <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>IGS Store Fixtures, Inc., </em>13 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 21, 24 (1999), is wholly sound. That case cited our decision in <em>Coblyn </em>v. <em>Kennedy\u2019s, Inc., </em>359 Mass. 319, 323-324 (1971), for the proposition that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d is synonymous with \u201cprobable cause.\u201d See <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>IGS Store Fixtures, Inc., supra </em>at 24-25. Such interchangeability was suggested in <em>Coblyn </em>in the context of a false imprisonment statute. See <em>Coblyn </em>v. <em>Kennedy\u2019s, Inc., supra </em>at 320, 326. To whatever extent those terms were synonymous in the context of the dispute in the <em>Coblyn </em>case, the same cannot be said of the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Similarly, the insurer could have reasonably argued that DiFronzo was no longer \u201cin the course of his employment\u201d in running to catch a bus home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">DiFronzo cites <em>Zapponi </em>v. <em>Central Constr. Co., </em>334 Mass. 146, 146-150 (1956), in support of his position that the injury was compensable regardless of whether DiFronzo was in fact crossing the street to catch a bus. In that case, an employee of a construction company was injured by the act of a coworker while leaving a work site for the day, and we held that the injury arose out of, and occurred in the course of, his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 146-148. There, however, the injured employee was within the \u201creserved area\u201d of a closed road that was under construction when he was injured, a point that we emphasized in reaching our conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 149-150. That decision does not make compensation in the present case so apparently warranted that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1), penalties would be appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
