Prior to the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>recommitment hearing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before a judge in the Taunton Division of the District Court Department, the plaintiff filed a motion to close that proceeding to the public. After a hearing on the motion, the judge denied the requested relief. The plaintiff petitioned a single justice of this court for leave to appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and the single justice reserved and reported the matter to the full court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The plaintiff alleges that she has a right to privacy in her civil recommitment proceeding, and that the judge erred in denying her motion for closure. We conclude that, as recommitment proceedings pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (c), are presumptively open to the public, and as the plaintiff has not met her burden of showing an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced absent closure, the judge did not err in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiff was indicted in April, 2005, for the murder of her four year old son. After a bench trial in Superior Court, she was found not guilty by means of mental illness or defect in September, 2007. She was thereafter committed to the hospital pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (\u00a3&gt;). In November, 2009, the hospital notified the Commonwealth of its intent to discharge the plaintiff, and the Commonwealth filed a petition for re-commitment. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 <em>(e).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Prior to the hearing, the plaintiff filed a motion to close the recommitment proceeding to the public. The hearing on the motion took place in the Taunton Division of the District Court Department, sitting at the hospital, on March 2, 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the hearing, the judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>We begin by addressing the question whether proceedings under the relevant recommitment provision are presumptively open to the public and, if so, how trial courts should determine when closure is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In the context of criminal proceedings, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right of the public to attend trials. <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>448 U.S. 555, 575-576 (1980). Public access may not be abridged absent \u201can overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\u201d <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">While neither the United States Supreme Court nor this court has yet addressed the question whether the public\u2019s right under the First Amendment extends to civil trials \u2014 and we have not addressed that question as it relates to the free speech provision of the Massachusetts Constitution, see art. 16 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 77 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution \u2014 there is a long-standing presumption in Massachusetts common law that, as a general matter, the public has a right to attend civil trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Justice Holmes, writing for this court in 1884, stated that \u201cit is of vast importance to the public that the proceedings of courts of justice should be universally known.\u201d <em>Cowley </em>v. <em>Pulsifer, </em>137 Mass. 392, 394 (1884), quoting <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>8 T.R. 293, 298 (K.B. 1799). The court went on to observe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">\u201cIt is desirable that the trial of causes should take place under the public eye, not because the controversies of one citizen with another are of public concern, but because it is of the highest moment that those who administer justice should always act under the sense of public responsibility, and that every citizen should be able to satisfy himself with his own eyes as to the mode in which a public duty is performed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-9\"><em>Cowley </em>v. <em>Pulsifer, supra </em>at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The Supreme Court has traced the common-law tradition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>openness of civil proceedings from Seventeenth Century English law to the law of the American colonies. See <em>Gannett Co. </em>v. <em>DePasquale, </em>443 U.S. 368, 386 n.15 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Citing the Court\u2019s discussion of the issue, we have observed that \u201cfree access to civil trials is well established under the common law.\u201d <em>Boston Herald, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, </em>421 Mass. 502, 507 n.7 (1995), citing <em>Gannett Co. </em>v. <em>DePasquale, supra. </em>See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>407 Mass. 879, 884 (1990) (\u201cThe tradition in the Commonwealth is that courts are open to the public\u201d); <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>379 Mass. 846, 855, vacated on other grounds, 449 U.S. 894 (1980), quoting F. Pollock, The Expansion of the Common Law 30 (1904) (\u201cPublic trials have been the rule at common law since the Anglo Saxons conducted their trials \u2018like an ill-managed public meeting\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We therefore tom to the more limited question whether civil recommitment hearings pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 <em>(c), </em>are presumptively open to the public, an issue not addressed by the statute itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In determining whether the public has a right to attend certain criminal proceedings in the constitutional context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the Supreme Court has evaluated whether there has been a tradition of accessibility to the proceeding, and whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the proceedings. See <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986). Although we address the issue as a matter of common law, we find this two-part inquiry useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Early cases in the Commonwealth illustrate that civil commitment proceedings were not formerly afforded the publicity that has, as a general matter, been characteristic of civil trials in Massachusetts. See, e.g., <em>Amherst </em>v. <em>Shelburne, </em>11 Gray 107, 109 (1858) (commitment neither illegal nor irregular despite fact that there was no prior notice to person committed and no recorded order in writing). It is equally clear, however, that lawmakers and courts have moved decisively away from this prior informality and now provide in commitment cases procedural protections characteristic of criminal trials and other civil trials. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The new mental health code adopted in 1971 afforded to persons whose commitment is sought, in matters where a hearing is required, the right to counsel, appointment of counsel for the indigent, notice of the hearing, and a right to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>See St. 1970, c. 888, \u00a7 4; G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 9 (a). See also Walker, Mental Health Law Reform in Massachusetts, 53 B.U. L. Rev. 986, 998 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">This court has since reinforced the procedural protections afforded in these hearings, holding that civil commitment requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hagberg, </em>374 Mass. 271, 276 (1978). We have affirmed also a patient\u2019s right to an emergency hearing if admission resulted from abuse or misuse of the admission process. See <em>Newton-Wellesley Hosp. </em>v. <em>Magrini, </em>451 Mass. <em>Ill, </em>783-784 (2008). And we have strictly interpreted the time within which a commitment hearing must be commenced after the filing of a commitment petition. See <em>Hashmi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 609 (1983). The trajectory of the law as it relates to civil commitment demonstrates that commitment hearings have been increasingly clothed with the procedural protections and formality typical of other civil (and criminal) trials. As such trials are generally open to the public, this supports a conclusion that proceedings pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (c), are also, as a general proposition, open to the public.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Public access to the commitment proceedings underscores the seriousness of a potential deprivation of liberty and combats tendencies toward informality that may threaten an individual\u2019s due process rights. See Commentary to Standard 2.00 of the District Court Standards of Judicial Practice: Civil Commitment (1979) (\u201cOnce removed from traditional physical settings normally associated with courts, participants in many hearings may be tempted to conduct themselves in a manner [that] is not fully consistent with the elements of procedural due process\u201d). Commitment hearings are a matter of public interest. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Bolduc, </em>435 Mass. 608, 615 n.19 (2002) (\u201cthe commitment and treatment of mentally ill persons are matters of public importance\u201d). Likewise, closure encourages skepticism and distrust among the public \u2014 and, indeed, among those whose commitment is sought \u2014 regarding posttrial proceedings after persons have been acquitted by reason of mental illness. See <em>Matter of the Commitment of Edward S., </em>118 N.J. 118, 138-139 (1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>(discussing value of openness given public skepticism of acquittal by reason of mental illness and of posttrial commitment proceedings). We conclude that both the legal evolution of civil commitment proceedings and the likely beneficial effects of public access to such proceedings support a conclusion that civil recommitment hearings held pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (c), are presumptively open to the public.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">As is the case in criminal trials, the right of the public to attend the hearings is not absolute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 107 (2010), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. 187, 193 (1994) (\u201cthe public trial right is not absolute, and in limited circumstances a court may bar spectators from certain portions of a criminal trial\u201d). For criminal trials, we apply the standard established by the Supreme Court in <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 48 (1984), as a means of balancing the interests of the party advocating closure against the public\u2019s interest in having access to the trial. See <em>Boston Herald, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, </em>421 Mass. 502, 506 (1995), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 194. Given the presumption that G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (c), proceedings are open to the public in Massachusetts, as they are in criminal trials, we conclude that the <em>Waller </em>standard should likewise be applied in such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Thus, closure may occur where four requirements are met: \u201c[1] the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, [2] the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, [3] the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and [4] it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>quoting <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra. </em>The essence of the <em>Waller </em>standard is thus that a moving party\u2019s position must be sufficiently compelling to overcome a presumption of openness. The findings required for closure must be \u201cparticularized and supported by the record.\u201d <em>Boston Herald, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, supra </em>at 506, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In adopting the <em>Waller </em>standard, we recognize that the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>disclosure of medical information has the potential to prejudice the therapeutic treatment of a patient. Accordingly, in determining whether the moving party has shown an overriding interest likely to be prejudiced, the judge should take account of any alleged prejudice to a patient\u2019s therapeutic treatment that could come about by virtue of a public proceeding. The plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating that prejudice is likely to occur. We emphasize also that it is within the judge\u2019s discretion to close a limited portion of a proceeding if the <em>Waller </em>standard is satisfied as to that portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">We turn now to the specific arguments made by the plaintiff in favor of closure. The plaintiff apparently has shifted her position during the course of the appeal. While the plaintiff\u2019s brief suggested that the statutory scheme grants her a presumptive right to closure, by the end of oral argument she had moved nearly to the standard we have adopted, i.e., a presumption of openness and a case-by-case balancing of opposing interests to determine whether closure is warranted. The positions taken by the plaintiff and the Commonwealth thus appear now to be quite close. The plaintiff did not explicitly adopt or refer at any point to the <em>Waller </em>decision, but her proposed balancing test appears to reflect the <em>Waller </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">To support her argument that the presumption of openness has been overcome in this case, the plaintiff cites a number of statutes, the first of which is G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 36A.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That statute provides for the privacy of certain reports of examinations and commitment-related papers, \u201cexcept in the discretion of the court,\u201d and for private dockets in cases of persons believed to be mentally ill. Citing this court\u2019s discussion of the legislative history of the provision, the plaintiff argues that the statute evidences a clear legislative concern with the privacy of mentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ill persons. See <em>Borucki </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>407 Mass. 1009, 1010 (1990) (\u201cThe history of the legislation indicates a legislative intent to protect the privacy of persons subjected to mental examinations by courts . . .\u201d). The statute does not, by its terms, provide for the closure of the court room in commitment proceedings. It applies only to the privacy of reports, papers, and dockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Likewise, G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 16, the provisions governing commitment hearings and the commitment of those not guilty by reason of mental illness, with which we are concerned, do not speak to closure. The absence of such a closure provision is particularly notable given that the Legislature has elsewhere provided for closure explicitly. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 38 (hearings related to protection of children, except those pertaining to resuscitation or withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment for children in custody of Department of Children and Families, \u201cshall be closed to the general public\u201d); G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 65 (\u201cThe court shall exclude the general public from juvenile sessions admitting only such persons as may have a direct interest in the case, except in cases where the commonwealth has proceeded by indictment\u201d). Where the Legislature has intended to express a preference for closure, it has thus done so explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The plaintiff contends also that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, which provides that \u201c[a] person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy,\u201d compels closure of the proceeding. That statute provides a private cause of action for invasion of privacy and is not relevant to whether a particular recommitment proceeding is open to the public. Cf. <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>400 Mass. 152, 154 (1987) (remedy for physician\u2019s violation of patient\u2019s privacy is cause of action against physician, not exclusion of evidence at trial). Moreover, \u201c[wjhen the subject matter of publicity is of legitimate public concern . . . there is no invasion of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Boston Herald, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>432 Mass. 593, 612 (2000), citing <em>George W. Prescott </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Register of Probate for Norfolk County, </em>395 Mass. 274, 278 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">On the present record, the judge did not err in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a closed hearing. The plaintiff\u2019s arguments focus largely on statutes of general applicability, which, as discussed, do not compel the closure of the plaintiff\u2019s hearing. The plaintiff also asserts that, to succeed in the recommitment proceeding, she \u201cwill have to provide detailed evidence describing her progress in treatment.\u201d While a plaintiff bears no burden of providing evidence, it is true that such evidence will be presented in many recommitment proceedings. If the plaintiff\u2019s argument in that respect, expressed as it is in general terms, were sufficient, it would allow closure almost as a matter of course, and thus cannot succeed. The plaintiff\u2019s argument that the dissemination of personal information disclosed in treatment \u201cmay have a devastating effect on her treatment,\u201d while a legitimate and serious concern, is not supported by expert opinion or any other evidence. The judge was warranted in finding these assertions insufficient to warrant closure of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The final question is whether the judge was required to make findings in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Explicit in the <em>Waller </em>standard is a requirement that the judge make findings if he or she concludes that closure is warranted. Where a judge denies a motion for closure, findings are also necessary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The reviewing court must be able to determine the basis for the denial. On appeal in such a case, appellate courts will review the record to determine whether, in light of the appropriate standard, the motion judge abused his or her discretion or made any other error of law. Cf. <em>Boston Herald, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sharpe, supra </em>at 601 (holding that the court reviews impoundment orders for abuse of discretion or other error of law). We find no such here.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Civil recommitment proceedings pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (c), are open to the public as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>common law, but may be closed where the <em>Waller </em>standard is satisfied. We decide that in this case the judge did not err in concluding that the plaintiff had not shown an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced absent closure. We remand the case to the county court, with instructions that the order denying the motion for a closed hearing be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Persons found not guilty by reason of mental illness or mental defect can be committed, upon petition to the court having jurisdiction of the criminal case, to a facility for the care and treatment of mentally ill persons, or to the Bridgewater State Hospital, for a period of six months.

As early as 1685, Sir John Hawles commented that open proceedings were necessary so \u2018that truth may be discovered in civil <em>as well as </em>criminal matters\u2019 (emphasis added). Remarks upon Mr. Cornish\u2019s Trial, 11 How. St. Tr. 455, 460. English commentators also assumed that the common-law rule was that the public could attend civil and criminal trials without distinguishing between the two. E.g., 2 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England 103 (6th ed. 1681) (\u201call Causes ought to be heard . . . openly in the Kings Courts\u201d); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *372; M. Hale, The History of the Common Law of England 343, 345 (6th ed. 1820); E. Jenks, The Book of English Law 73-74 (6th ed. 1967). The experience in the American Colonies was analogous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\"><em>Gannett Co. </em>v. <em>DePasquale, </em>443 U.S. 368, 386 n.15 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\">In 1955, the Legislature amended an older version of the mental health law to state, in the context of commitment hearing rights and procedures, that \u201c[t]he court may at its discretion hold a private hearing at a place convenient for the person served.\u201d St. 1955, c. 637, \u00a7 8. When an entirely new mental health statute was adopted in 1971, it included a provision stating that whenever a hearing was required in any court for the commitment or further retention of a person, \u201c[t]he person, or the superintendent of the facility or the medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>director of said state hospital wherein the person is retained, may request either an open or a closed hearing at the facility, said hospital or at the court and the court in its discretion may grant such a request.\u201d St. 1970, c. 888, \u00a7 4. That sentence was struck from the statute in 1973 and replaced with the current language, \u201cThe court may hold the hearing at the facility or said hospital.\u201d St. 1973, c. 569, \u00a7 2. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">We discern no sufficiently specific direction from this series of changes, and the parties have suggested none. Thus, the alterations do not aid in the resolution of the question now before us. As the most recent change removes from the statute any mention of the issue of closure, we assume that the Legislature was content to have the common law govern.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Although the governing law has evolved with respect to this matter, the purpose of evaluating the Commonwealth\u2019s tradition is not to promote ossification of law but to draw on the aggregate experience of courts in finding a particular rule appropriate across varied fact patterns and circumstances. See <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986), quoting <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>457 U.S. 596, 605 (1982) (\u201ca \u2018tradition of accessibility implies the favorable judgment of experience\u2019 \u201d).
