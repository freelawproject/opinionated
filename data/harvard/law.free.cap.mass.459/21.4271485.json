Jansen, for aggravated rape, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that the rape was \u201caggravated\u201d because it was committed by reason of a \u201cjoint enterprise,\u201d see <em>id., </em>involving the defendant, Aaron Kincaid, and Richard Lampron,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who acted collectively through a joint venture. The first indictment effectively charged the defendant, as a joint venturer, with aggravated rape for the penile-vaginal sexual intercourse he committed against the complainant, whom we call Gail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second and third indictments charged the defendant, as a joint venturer, with aggravated rape for the sexual acts committed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Kincaid and Lampron, respectively, against Gail (specifically, the penile-vaginal sexual intercourse by Kincaid and the insertion of a hair tie by Lampron into Gail\u2019s vagina), which the defendant allegedly videotaped. At the trial of these indictments, a Superior Court jury were unable to reach unanimous verdicts, and die judge declared a mistrial. Thereafter, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, therefore, retrial was barred on double jeopardy principles. See <em>Corson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>428 Mass. 193, 196 (1998), and cases cited. Concerning the first indictment, the trial judge granted the motion as it pertained to aggravated rape, but denied the motion insofar as it charged the lesser included offense of rape. The judge granted the motion as to the second and third indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"AqV\">The Commonwealth appealed to the Appeals Court from the dismissal of the second and third indictments and the partial dismissal of the first indictment. The defendant filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, in the county court seeking relief from the judge\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss the first indictment insofar as it charged rape. See <em>Neverson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>406 Mass. 174, 175-176 (1989), and cases cited. A single justice transferred the petition to the Appeals Court, see G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A; <em>Fadden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 376 </em>Mass. 604, 608 (1978), cert, denied, 440 U.S. 961 (1979), and ordered that it be consolidated with the Commonwealth\u2019s pending appeal. In an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to permit Jansen\u2019s retrial on all the indictments against him. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jansen, 76 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1101 (2009). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because there was insufficient evidence of a \u201cjoint enterprise,\u201d we conclude that the Superior Court judge correctly allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss as to the second and third indictments as well as to so much of the first indictment as alleged aggravated rape. We also conclude that because there was sufficient evidence of rape, the judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss that portion of the first indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>alleging rape. We therefore affirm the Superior Court judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We set forth the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). On the evening of Wednesday, September 23, 1998, Gail consumed one or two beers after finishing her \u201cshift,\u201d at around 9 or 10 p.m., at the restaurant where she worked in Lenox. She drove to a bar in Pittsfield, La Cocina\u2019s Pub (La Cocina\u2019s), ordered one beer, and had a conversation with a man she knew, Robert Dwyer (Dwyer).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At some point, Kincaid, Lampron, and the defendant entered the bar<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and sat at a table together. Gail had once lived with Lampron, and had been involved in a tumultuous, romantic relationship with him for about one and one-half years. Gail also knew the defendant, who was a friend of Lampron.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Kincaid approached Gail, and Gail left Dwyer and joined Kincaid at the bar, where they spoke privately for about twenty to thirty minutes. Afterward, Gail and Kincaid went over to the table where Lampron and the defendant were sitting. Gail had difficulty walking over to the table. Her legs were \u201cgiving out,\u201d and she was walking as if she were \u201cdrunk.\u201d The men, Kincaid, Lampron, and the defendant, together with Gail, then left the bar. They all got into an automobile and sped off to a house shared by the three men in Lee (the defendant\u2019s house).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Gail had no memory of leaving the bar or going to the defendant\u2019s house. She recalled waking up in Kincaid\u2019s bed when it was dark and, although she had some awareness, she was confused and was not able physically to move or to resist. She did not feel intoxicated. She remembered Kincaid and Lampron being present in the room and each having sexual intercourse (penile-vaginal) with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Gail regained consciousness at some point the next day when it was light outside. She still was unable physically to move or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>to resist. Kincaid and Lampron took turns having sexual intercourse (penile-vaginal) with her again.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Gail had no recollection of the defendant\u2019s presence in Kincaid\u2019s room during the rapes. Nor did she have any memory of the defendant engaging in any sexual act with her that night or morning. Gail did recall that the defendant drove her back to La Cocina\u2019s where her automobile was parked. She remembered Kincaid telling her, as she was leaving the house with the defendant, that she \u201cshould check herself.\u201d When she arrived at her automobile at La Cocina\u2019s, Gail realized that she left some personal items at the defendant\u2019s house, so she followed him back in her automobile to retrieve those items. Gail had no memory of the drive back or what occurred when she went back into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Later that day, after going home and sleeping for some time, Gail went to the bathroom and found a hair tie<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> inside her vagina. She removed and discarded it in the trash. At some point, she realized that some prescription medication that had been in her purse was no longer there.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">On Friday, September 25, 1998, Gail spoke with police. After doing so, she went home, retrieved the hair-tie, and placed it in a plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">During the investigation, the defendant admitted to a State trooper that he, Kincaid, and Lampron had gone to La Cocina\u2019s and that Gail went home with them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He stated that once he arrived home, he went to his second-floor bedroom and went to bed. The defendant also stated that he had not been involved in any videotaping at the house. The defendant recalled driving Gail back to the parking lot of La Cocina\u2019s the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing revealed that Kincaid\u2019s DNA profile \u201cmatche[d]\u201d the primary DNA profile of the sperm fraction extracted from the hair tie and plastic bag sample,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>which had been turned over to police in February, 1999.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further DNA testing on the hair tie and plastic bag sample could not exclude the defendant as being a possible secondary contributor of the sperm fraction extracted from the sample.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">There was evidence that at least part of the incident had been recorded on videotape. Two witnesses testified at trial that, sometime in September, 1998, Kincaid showed them portions of a videotape<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> depicting Kincaid having sexual intercourse with Gail. The recording was made from the vantage point of a heating vent in the defendant\u2019s bedroom floor.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Gail was lying on her back, nude below the waist, immobile, and had hardly any facial expression. Kincaid wore a mask and looked up at the camera occasionally, but Gail did not. Kincaid ejaculated on Gail, put his penis in her mouth, gave a \u201cthumbs up\u201d to the camera above, and left the room. After Kincaid left the room, Lampron came into view wearing a mask. Lampron took an object (around which the hair tie was placed) and forced it into Gail\u2019s vagina. Gail was not responsive. Lampron looked up to the camera, laughed, and left. One witness heard laughter coming from a source that was not visible on camera. These parts of the videotape were filmed during daylight hours. In addition, other witnesses testified that Kincaid had bragged that he and Lampron had sex with Gail while she was \u201cunconscious\u201d and \u201con a muscle relaxer,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a video camera was involved, and a \u201cbarrette\u201d was used that ended up \u201clodged\u201d in Gail\u2019s vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>Where, as here, the defendant has moved for a required finding of not guilty, and a deadlocked jury resulted in a mistrial, common-law principles of double jeopardy do not bar retrial, provided the Commonwealth \u201cpresented evidence legally sufficient to support a conviction at the first trial.\u201d <em>Corson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>428 Mass. 193, 196 (1998). The question for the appellate court in these circumstances is the same as the question before the trial judge on the motion for a required finding of not guilty and, following mistrial, on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss: whether the evidence produced by the Commonwealth in its case-in-chief was sufficient to convict on the crimes charged.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The evidence may be primarily or entirely circumstantial, provided that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, it \u201cand the inferences permitted to be drawn therefrom [are] \u2018of sufficient force to bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to the persuasion of [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lati</em>more, 378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>264 Mass. 368, 373 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">a. <em>Aggravated rape. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>456 Mass. 52, 60 n.10 (2010), we noted that the \u201c[c]ommission of rape by \u2018joint enterprise\u2019 where the \u2018joint enterprise\u2019 is an element of the crime is <em>distinct </em>from general liability as a joint venturer\u201d (emphasis added). We stated that \u201caggravated rape by reason of joint enterprise is a crime that requires \u2018the united act of two or more individuals to constitute an offence in either.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slate, </em>11 Gray 60, 63 (1858). Here, irrespective of the <em>manner </em>in attaching individual liability, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, supra, </em>there was insufficient evidence that the sexual acts underlying all three indictments amounted to a \u201cunited act\u201d involving the defendant with another.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">With respect to the first indictment, there was no evidence that the defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with Gail, either on or off the videotape, in a \u201cunited act\u201d with Kincaid, Lampron, or both. There was no evidence that any sexual act committed by the defendant was done in the presence of or with the knowledge of Kincaid or Lampron, or that Kincaid or Lampron were willing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>and available to assist the defendant at the time of any sexual intercourse between him (the defendant) and Gail. The evidence, therefore, was not legally sufficient to establish that the defendant acted as part of a joint enterprise with respect to the first indictment, and thus, the <em>aggravated </em>rape aspect of the first indictment cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The evidence was also insufficient to demonstrate, with respect to the second and third indictments, that the Commonwealth met its burden in its case-in-chief of establishing that the defendant engaged in a \u201cunited act\u201d with Kincaid or Lampron, or both. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory as to these indictments was that the defendant\u2019s culpability arose from his operation of the video camera when Kincaid and Lampron engaged in sexual acts, respectively, with Gail. Even if an inference reasonably could be drawn that <em>someone </em>was manually operating the video camera,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> there was no evidence that the defendant, as opposed to Kincaid or Lampron, was the operator.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although there was evidence that the heating vent where the video camera was located was accessible from the defendant\u2019s room, it also was accessible from Kincaid\u2019s room. Further, while there was evidence that may have permitted an inference that the defendant was present in the house while the camera was being operated, there was no evidence from which the jury could infer that the defendant knew that it then was being operated or that he was involved in its operation. While the Commonwealth may satisfy its burden of proof through the use of circumstantial evidence, \u201ca jury may not use conjecture or guesswork to choose between alternative inferences.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dostie, </em>425 Mass. 372, 376 (1997). Because the inferences that the Commonwealth urges may be drawn improperly and would require the use of conjecture, the second and third indictments cannot stand and further prosecution is barred.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>b. <em>Lesser included offense of rape charged in the first indictment. </em>We agree with the Superior Court judge and the Appeals Court in rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence with respect to the lesser included offense of rape as charged in the first indictment. \u201cWhile generally for the crime of rape the Commonwealth must prove that the alleged sexual intercourse occurred by force and without the complainant\u2019s consent, where [as was alleged in this case] the complainant is \u2018wholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting,\u2019 (a) the element of lack of consent is satisfied; and (b) the only force required for proof of the crime is \u2018such force as was necessary to accomplish\u2019 the act of intercourse \u2014 that is, only the force necessary to effect penetration.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, </em>450 Mass. 583, 589 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>105 Mass. 376, 380-381 (1870). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the Commonwealth did not fail to prove both penetration and lack of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u201cPenetration can be inferred from circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>431 Mass. 30, 33 (2000). Here, there was evidence that a hair tie had been inserted into Gail\u2019s vagina on September 23 or September 24, at the defendant\u2019s house. This evidence included testimony that a portion of the videotape showed Lampron inserting an object inside Gail\u2019s vagina. In addition, DNA testing showed that the defendant could not be excluded as a possible secondary donor of the sperm fraction extracted from the hair tie (which Gail had removed from her vagina on September 24) and plastic bag sample. The statistical significance of the DNA testing results was presented to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>jury. See note 13, <em>supra. </em>From this evidence, it was reasonable and possible for a jury to conclude that the defendant had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with Gail on September 23 or September 24. See <em>id. </em>at 32, 33-34 (presence of sperm in victim\u2019s mouth was sufficient to prove oral penetration beyond reasonable doubt); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 637, 642 (1989) (semen, piece of twig, and dirt found in victim\u2019s vagina was sufficient evidence to find penetration beyond reasonable doubt). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>424 Mass. 64, 68 (1997) (inferences need not be necessary, only reasonable and possible). Although Gail acknowledged having had <em>consensual </em>sexual intercourse with the defendant that summer, and the Commonwealth\u2019s expert was unable to say whether the defendant\u2019s semen came from the hair tie or the plastic bag, such matters pertain to the weight of the evidence, not its sufficiency. Indeed, a jury reasonably could infer that the semen recovered from the plastic bag had come from the semen on the hair tie that had been placed into the plastic bag. They also reasonably could infer that the presence of the defendant\u2019s sperm cell DNA on the hair tie removed from Gail\u2019s vagina on September 24 resulted from penetration that occurred on September 23 or 24, and not from the defendant\u2019s consensual sexual encounter with Gail during the summer of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">There also was sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that Gail lacked the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse with the defendant on September 23 or 24. If a complainant is \u201cwholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra, </em>and the defendant is aware of the complainant\u2019s incapacitated state, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra, </em>the element of lack of consent is satisfied.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Here, there was evidence that, in the defendant\u2019s presence, Gail visibly was physically impaired at the bar, as her legs were \u201cgiving out\u201d and she walked as if she were \u201cdrunk.\u201d There also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>was evidence that Gail was unable physically to resist or to move during Kincaid\u2019s and Lampron\u2019s sexual encounters with her, either during the night or daytime; that she felt confused while at the defendant\u2019s house; that she later determined that she was missing prescription medication that she had with her at the bar in her purse; that she later determined that there was a hair tie lodged inside her vagina; and she had no memory of any sexual act with the defendant. From this evidence, a jury reasonably could conclude that, because of the ingestion of alcohol or drugs (or both), Gail was \u201cwholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting\u201d or \u201cso impaired as to be incapable of consenting\u201d to intercourse with the defendant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, supra </em>at 589, 592-593 n.14, during the period she was at the defendant\u2019s house, and that the defendant knew of her incapacity to consent to sexual intercourse when he penetrated her, see <em>id. </em>at 592-593 &amp; n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, we affirm the order of the Superior Court judge allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the second and third indictments, and dismissing only so much of the first indictment as alleged aggravated rape. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 <em>(a), </em>aggravated rape is defined, in pertinent part, as:</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u201cWhoever has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with a person, and compels such person to submit by force and against his will, or compels such person to submit by threat of bodily injury and if either such sexual intercourse ... is committed by a joint enterprise . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The \u201cessence of the crime of rape, whether aggravated or unaggravated, is sexual intercourse with another compelled by force and against the victim\u2019s will [without consent].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCourt, </em>438 Mass. 486, 494-495 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guisti, </em>434 Mass. 245, 248 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, </em>450 Mass. 583, 589 (2008) (in cases where complainant lacks capacity to consent to sexual intercourse only force required is that necessary to effect penetration); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracciola, </em>409 Mass. 648, 652 (1991) (although rape is crime of violence, force used to accomplish rape need not be physical force). By providing for the presence of certain aggravating factors, such as a rape committed by reason of a joint enterprise, the Legislature has ensured that certain rapists will face a \u201cheightened penalty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCourt, supra </em>at 493, 496.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The defendant, William E.
