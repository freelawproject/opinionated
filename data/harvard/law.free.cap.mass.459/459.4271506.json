L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32L-32N, inserted by St. 2008, c. 387, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4, which decriminalized possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, has on certain aspects of our search and seizure jurisprudence. The defendant, Benjamin Cruz, was charged with one count of possession of a class B controlled substance with the intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(a); </em>possession of a class B controlled substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34; and committing a controlled substances violation in a school zone, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. The police seized \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine from the defendant, a passenger in a stopped automobile, after a police officer, detecting the odor of burnt marijuana inside the vehicle, issued an order for the defendant to exit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the crack cocaine, as well as an admission he made to the officer. After an evidentiary hearing, a judge in the West Roxbury Division of the Boston Municipal Court Department allowed the defendant\u2019s motion. The Commonwealth petitioned a single justice of this court arguing that the motion judge erred, as a matter of law, in granting the defendant\u2019s motion. Because we discern no permissible basis on which the police could order the defendant out of the automobile without at least some other additional fact beyond the mere odor of burnt marijuana to bolster a reasonable suspicion of actual <em>criminal </em>activity, we affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>judge\u2019s allowance of the motion to suppress the admission and the crack cocaine, although on slightly different reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts as found by the judge, supplemented by uncontroverted facts from the record of the hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007). On June 24, 2009, Officers Christopher Morgan and Richard Diaz were in the Hyde Square neighborhood of the Jamaica Plain section of Boston.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Patrolling in plain clothes and an unmarked Ford Crown Victoria automobile,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the officers drove down Sunnyside Street at approximately 5 p.m., and saw a vehicle parked in front of a fire hydrant. The vehicle\u2019s windows were rolled down and it was light outside. Inside, the officers could see a driver and the defendant, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. As the officers drove down the street, Officer Diaz saw the driver light a small, inexpensive cigar that is commonly known to mask the odor of marijuana smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Both officers recognized the defendant as a neighborhood resident who lived on Sunnyside Street. Officer Morgan testified that he had previously seen the defendant smoking a marijuana \u201cblunt,\u201d but the defendant was not known to either officer as a dangerous person, involved in any gang-related activity or violence. Neither officer was aware that either the driver or the defendant had ever been arrested. In fact, Officer Diaz had spoken to the defendant, a nineteen year old man, on several previous occasions about remaining out of trouble. Diaz had suggested ways for the defendant to exempt himself from the \u201ccrowd\u201d and encouraged him to do more than \u201changing out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Pulling up next to the car, Officer Morgan asked the driver to explain why he was parked in front of the fire hydrant, a civil motor vehicle violation. See Traffic Rules and Regulations of the City of Boston art. 4, \u00a7 1(6) (2003). The driver replied that he was waiting for his uncle, who lived in a house on Sunny-side Street. While the officers were stopped next to the car, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Officer Morgan saw the defendant smoking a cigar. At this point, both officers got out of their unmarked cruiser and walked toward the car. Officer Morgan approached the driver\u2019s side, and Officer Diaz went to the passenger side. From the driver\u2019s side, Officer Morgan could smell a \u201cfaint odor\u201d of burnt marijuana.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Officer Morgan noticed that the driver was \u201cvery nervous, had trouble breathing\u201d and \u201cit almost looked like he was panicking. \u201d When asked whether he had been smoking marijuana, the driver replied that he had smoked \u201cearlier in the day.\u201d Morgan asked the driver if there was anything inside the car that the officers \u201cshould know about.\u201d The driver responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Meanwhile, Officer Diaz saw that the defendant appeared \u201cnervous\u201d and made little eye contact with Diaz, choosing to look straight ahead or down. Neither officer saw any contraband or weapons within plain view in the car. There was no evidence that either the driver or the defendant made any furtive gestures or threatening movements. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The officers neither cited the driver for parking in front of a fire hydrant nor asked for his license and registration. Neither officer conducted any field sobriety tests to determine whether the driver was presently under the influence of marijuana. Instead, the officers called for backup, and four additional officers arrived on the scene in two marked cruisers. Once backup arrived, and based on \u201cthe odor of marijuana and just the way they were acting,\u201d both the driver and the passenger were ordered out of the car by Officers Morgan and Diaz.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>stepped out of the car, Diaz asked him if he had \u201canything on his person.\u201d In the presence of the six police officers, the defendant told Diaz he had \u201ca little rock for myself\u201d in his pocket. Diaz reached into the defendant\u2019s pocket and retrieved the item, which Diaz estimated to be approximately four grams of crack cocaine. No Miranda warnings were given to either the defendant or the driver before the crack cocaine was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The judge concluded that the police permissibly approached the car because it was parked in front of a fire hydrant, a civil traffic violation. She found, however, that the officers should not have ordered the defendant out of the car. The officers could not have reasonably feared for their safety considering that the stop occurred during daylight, the defendant made no furtive or threatening movements, and the defendant was not known to the officers from previous arrests or a reputation for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Further, the judge concluded that the officers could not have ordered the defendant out of the car based on the odor of burnt marijuana alone. She explained that, since the passage of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L, decriminalizing possession of one ounce or less of marijuana, the odor of burnt marijuana \u201ccoupled with the driver\u2019s statement that he had been smoking earlier in the day\u201d suggested that any marijuana that remained would be less than one ounce.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Finally, the judge found that although G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L, has no effect on the crimes of possession with intent to distribute or operating while under the influence of marijuana, \u201cthere was no probable cause to believe that any of those offenses were being committed.\u201d Without probable cause that the defendant or the driver was committing any criminal offense, she concluded, the police were not justified in ordering the defendant out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The Commonwealth argues that despite the decriminalization of possessing one ounce or less of marijuana, the odor of burnt marijuana may still provide the police with probable cause or, at least, reasonable suspicion that a crime is occurring, which justifies the exit order to the defendant. The Commonwealth further contends that once the defendant was validly ordered to get out of the car, the officer could properly ask whether he had any contraband on his person without the need for Miranda warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u201cWhen reviewing the allowance of a motion to suppress, we show substantial deference to the judge\u2019s legal conclusions . . . but independently review the application of constitutional principles to the facts\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 671-672 (2001). Although we have held in the past that the odor of marijuana alone provides probable cause to believe criminal activity is underway,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we now reconsider our jurisprudence in light of the change to our laws. On November 4, 2008, voters approved St. 2008, c. 387, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4, pursuant to the provisions of art. 48, The Initiative, Part V, \u00a7 1, as amended by art. 81, \u00a7 2, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. This initiative was codified at G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32L-32N, and entitled, \u201cAn Act establishing a sensible State marihuana policy.\u201d This act changed the status of the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana from a criminal to a civil offense. It became effective on December 4, 2008.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our analysis must give effect to the clear intent of the people of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the Commonwealth in accord with art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">a. <em>Initiation of the stop. </em>It is uncontested that the officers validly \u201cstopped\u201d the car for parking in front of a fire hydrant, a civil traffic violation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>381 Mass. 642, 644 (1980) (officer may validly stop a vehicle committing a traffic violation); G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2 (officer may approach parked car committing traffic violation and issue ticket).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Thus, the officers\u2019 presence at the side of the car was appropriate. Detaining a vehicle to issue a traffic citation, however, must \u201clast no longer than reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garden, </em>451 Mass. 43, 46 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 638, 643 (2001). Once the officers approached the car, they were required to complete the parking citation process and, barring other reasons to detain the occupants, leave them free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>from further police restraint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 244 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Because the stop did not end with a written citation and an instruction to the driver to move his vehicle away from the hydrant, further investigation by the officers required additional suspicious conduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>445 Mass. 72, 77 (2005), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 1187 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 243 (\u201cIn order to expand a threshold inquiry of a motorist and prolong his detention, an officer must reasonably believe that there is further criminal conduct afoot, and that belief must be based on \u2018specific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts in light of the officer\u2019s experience\u2019 \u201d). Once in the process of making a valid stop for a traffic violation, officers are not required to \u201cignore what [they] see[], smell[] or hear[].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 468, 471 (1996). When Officer Morgan approached the driver\u2019s side window and detected the odor of burnt marijuana, asking the driver whether he had been smoking marijuana was permissible because the officers could potentially have issued the driver a civil citation pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21D.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">b. <em>The exit order. </em>Not all routine traffic stops justify ordering the driver, much less the passenger, out of a stopped vehicle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There are three scenarios in which an exit order issued to a passenger in a validly stopped vehicle is justified. First, an exit order is justified if \u201ca reasonably prudent man in the policeman\u2019s position would be warranted in the belief that the safety of the police or that of other persons was in danger.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 661 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 212-213 (1995). Second, the officers could have developed reasonable suspicion (based on articulable facts) that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity separate from any offense of the driver. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bostock, </em>450 Mass. 616, 621 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 157-158 (1997). Third, the officers could have ordered the defendant out of the car for pragmatic reasons, e.g., to facilitate an independently permissible warrantless search of the car under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 901 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 174, 177-178 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">We need not address whether the exit order was justified on the basis of officer safety because the Commonwealth does not contest the motion judge\u2019s finding that it was not justified on this basis.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We turn, therefore, to the second permissible basis for issuing the exit order: whether the officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405 (1974) (to justify further investigative detention of passenger when no safety concerns at issue police must reasonably suspect that passenger himself has committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra </em>at 157 (as passenger in stopped vehicle, defendant could reasonably expect to remain free from investigative fray unless his own behavior aroused suspicion of criminal conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the stop\u2019s location, a high crime neighborhood; the defendant\u2019s nervous demeanor; and the occupants\u2019 sharing of a cigar are facts that bolster the suspicion of criminal activity first aroused by the odor of burnt marijuana. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The stop\u2019s location, although potentially relevant to an objective assessment of officer safety, cannot justify reasonable suspicion to believe a person is involved in criminal activity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 122, 125 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 659, 663 (2001) (traffic stop taking place in high crime area must be \u201cconsidered with some caution because many honest, law-abiding citizens live and work in high crime areas\u201d). Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the officers knew that the defendant lived on Sunnyside Street, the very street on which the encounter occurred. Surely the officers could not find it suspicious that the defendant was spending time on his own street. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s nervous demeanor cannot be the grounding factor on which to base suspicion of criminal activity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367, 372 (2007). It is common, and not necessarily indicative of criminality, to appear nervous during even a mundane encounter with police, even though, as a passenger, the consequence of receiving a citation is not personal. Here, even though the defendant may have recognized Officer Diaz, a myriad number of innocent reasons other than hiding criminal contraband may more readily explain why a nineteen year old man would appear nervous while being addressed by a police officer. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKoy, </em>428 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2005) (\u201cNervousness is a common and entirely natural reaction to police presence . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The Commonwealth\u2019s contention that, because the occupants were sharing a small cigar, known to the officers to mask the odor of marijuana smoke, they were also sharing a marijuana cigarette, lacks merit. The Commonwealth\u2019s assertion of such sharing is based on Diaz\u2019s noticing the driver light the cigar as the officers drove down the street and Morgan\u2019s noting the defendant smoking the cigar once the officers had stopped. The judge made no finding whether she credited the inference that the occupants shared the cigar. Further, there was no evidence that the occupants shared marijuana. The driver\u2019s admission to smoking \u201cearlier in the day\u201d does not require, as the Commonwealth argues, the inference that the defendant smoked as well. Even if we assume the occupants shared the cigar, it does not necessarily follow that because the occupants shared one legal item, they shared another illegal substance. We will not infer the defendant\u2019s participation solely from the driver\u2019s admission concerning his own conduct at some point earlier in the day. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>391 Mass. 705, 707 (1984) (suspicion must be based on reasonable inferences; \u201chunch will not suffice\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The last factor on which the Commonwealth relies to justify the officers\u2019 reasonable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity is the \u201cfaint odor\u201d of burnt marijuana. We note at the outset of our analysis that the lesser standard of reasonable suspicion is tied, by its very definition, to the suspicion of <em>criminal, </em>as opposed to merely infractionary, conduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra. </em>Articulable facts, then, must demonstrate a suspicion that the defendant possessed<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> more than one ounce of marijuana, because possession of one ounce or less of marijuana is not a crime. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L. There are no facts in the record to support a reasonable suspicion that the defendant possessed more than one ounce of marijuana.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that, to order a passenger in a stopped vehicle to exit based merely on <em>suspicion </em>of an offense, that offense must be criminal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Here, there could be no suspicion of a criminal offense.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>When the people of this Commonwealth answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 2 on the 2008 ballot,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the offense of possessing one ounce or less of marijuana changed from being a criminal to a civil offense.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L (\u201cNotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, possession of one ounce or less of marihuana shall <em>only </em>be a civil offense . . .\u2019\u2019[emphasis added]). The ballot informed voters that a \u201cyes vote would replace the criminal penalties for possession of one ounce or less of marijuana with a new system of civil penalties.\u201d Information for Voters: 2008 Ballot Questions, Question 2: Law Proposed by Initiative Petition, Possession of Marijuana. The arguments in favor of a \u201cyes vote,\u201d written by the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and presented on the ballot, told voters that the change would remove the threat of various criminal \u201csanctions\u201d for those who possess one ounce or less of marijuana and instead impose a \u201c$100 fine, similar to a speeding ticket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also explained that the police would be \u201cfreed up\u201d by the new law to focus on serious crimes and \u201ctaxpayers would save $30 million a year in arrest costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, arguments against the change in the law warned voters that \u201c[m]arijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>decriminalization is an endorsement of substance abuse and dangerous criminal activity . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We assume that before casting their votes, voters read the arguments \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cagainst,\u201d as well as the new law itself. Because we have the benefit of the written explanation in support of the initiative, the people\u2019s intent in answering Question 2 in the affirmative was clear: possession of one ounce or less of marijuana should not be considered a serious infraction worthy of criminal sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Not only has the penalty scheme for possession of one ounce or less of marijuana changed, as the Commonwealth concedes, but the status of this conduct changed as well. By mandating that possession of such a small quantity of marijuana become a civil violation, not a crime, the voters intended to treat offenders who possess one ounce or less of marijuana differently from perpetrators of drug crimes. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The statute specifically states that \u201cneither the Commonwealth\u201d nor any other relevant authority \u201cmay impose any form of penalty, sanction or disqualification on an offender for possessing an ounce or less of marihuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It then provides examples of prohibited sanctions \u201c[b]y way of illustration rather than limitation,\u201d that are commonly associated with criminal conduct. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>The statute does away with traditional criminal consequences, including the long-term and embarrassing effect that a criminal record has on employment or applying for school loans, demonstrating the intent of the voters to change the societal impact of possessing one ounce or less of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Our conclusion that the status of the offense has changed is supported by the statute\u2019s requirement that offenders under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32L-32N, be treated in accordance with G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21D, which concerns noncriminal disposition violations of municipal ordinances, bylaws, rules and regulations. This statute governs civil violations, not crimes. A \u201cviolation\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>defined as \u201c[a]n infraction or breach of the law; a transgression.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1705 (9th ed. 2009).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Further, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32N, provides a clear directive to police departments handling violators to treat commission of this offense as noncriminal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We conclude that the entire statutory scheme also implicates police conduct in the field. Ferreting out decriminalized conduct with the same fervor associated with the pursuit of serious criminal conduct is neither desired by the public nor in accord with the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Given our conclusion that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32L-32N, has changed the status of possessing one ounce or less of marijuana from a crime to a civil violation, without at least some other additional fact to bolster a reasonable suspicion of actual <em>criminal </em>activity, the odor of burnt marijuana alone cannot reasonably provide suspicion of criminal activity to justify an exit order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>443 Mass. 245, 256 (2005), quoting <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 250 (1991) (\u201cThe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s assertion that our hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ing is simply an extension of our line of cases concerning the reasonable suspicion standard where items that are not criminal to possess in all circumstances, such as hypodermic needles and guns, are at issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>438 Mass. 206, 210 (2002) (\u201cPossessing a hypodermic needle is not necessarily a crime\u201d; licensed physicians and private citizens \u201cmay lawfully possess hypodermic needles\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>423 Mass. 266, 270 (1996) (\u201ccarrying a concealed weapon is not, standing alone, an indication that criminal conduct has occurred or is contemplated\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toole, </em>389 Mass. 159, 163 (1983) (\u201ccarrying a .45 caliber revolver is not necessarily a crime\u201d). These cases are inapposite because, in proper circumstances, possession of a licensed gun or a hypodermic syringe is legal. In contrast, possession of marijuana, in any amount, remains illegal; decriminalization is not synonymous with legalization. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31; G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. Because marijuana remains unlawful to possess, any amount of marijuana is considered contraband. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 365 (\u201ccontraband\u201d defined as \u201c[g]oods that are unlawful to import, export, produce, or possess\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">This brings us to the third scenario in which the officers could have validly ordered the defendant out of the car \u2014 pragmatic reasons. In this case, the Commonwealth argues that the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle, and the exit order was a permissible step to take in order to facilitate the search.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Generally, a warrant is required to conduct a search; several well-recognized exceptions exist. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>406 Mass. 343, 346 (1989). Under the automobile exception, a warrantless search of an automobile is permitted when police have \u201cprobable cause to believe that a motor vehicle on a public way contains contraband or evidence of a crime, and exigent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>circumstances make obtaining a warrant impracticable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 901 (1990), quoting <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 149 (1925).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In contrast, therefore, to the requirement that criminality be suspected to effectuate an exit order under the reasonable suspicion standard, a warrantless search of an automobile may be based on probable cause that contraband is present. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, supra. </em>We have held that the odor of burnt marijuana is sufficient to believe that there is contraband in the car. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garden, </em>451 Mass. 43, 47 (2008). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>387 Mass. 169, 174 (1982), and cases cited (\u201cProbable cause requires more than mere suspicion but something less than evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction\u201d). As the Commonwealth appears to argue, it follows then, that if the police have probable cause to believe that contraband, i.e., any amount of marijuana, exists in the car, the police may then validly conduct a warrantless search (and order any passengers out of the car to facilitate that search).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">At least one court has adopted this reasoning. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smalley, </em>233 Or. App. 263, 265, 270-271 (2010), the Court of Appeals of Oregon determined that, despite the decriminalization of marijuana in small amounts for personal use, when an officer has probable cause, based on the odor of burnt marijuana, to believe that a validly stopped automobile contains any quantity of marijuana, a warrantless search is justified based on the likely presence of contraband. See <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurokawa-Lasciak, </em>237 Or. App. 492, 499 (2010) (\u201cprobable cause to believe a mobile vehicle contained less than an ounce of marijuana justifies a warrantless automobile search because even that noncriminal amount is \u2018contraband\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>We are not persuaded by this reasoning. The standard used to determine the validity of a warrantless search is the same as that used by a magistrate considering the application for a search warrant. See <em>Whiteley </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>401 U.S. 560, 566 (1971). See also <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 156 (when securing warrant not practicable, officers must still demonstrate to court requisite level of probable cause needed to obtain warrant).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In Massachusetts, search warrants are issued by magistrates \u201cauthorized to issue [them] in criminal cases.\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2B.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, this court concluded more than 150 years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">\u201cSearch warrants were . . . confined to cases of public prosecutions, <em>instituted and pursued for the suppression of crime or the detection and punishment of criminals. . . . </em>The principles upon which the legality of such warrants could be defended, and the use and purpose to which, by the common law, they were restricted, were well known to the framers of our constitution. . . . Having this knowledge, it cannot be doubted that by the adoption of the 14th article of the Declaration of Rights it was intended strictly and carefully to limit, restrain and regulate the granting and issuing of warrants of that character to the general class of cases, in and to the furtherance of the objects of which they had before been recognized and allowed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>justifiable and lawful processes, and certainly not so to vary, extend and enlarge the purposes for and occasions on which they might be used . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>13 Gray 454, 456-457 (1859).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Here, no facts were articulated to support probable cause to believe that a <em>criminal </em>amount of contraband was present in the car. We conclude, therefore, that in this set of circumstances a magistrate would not, and could not, issue a search warrant.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> See <em>Whiteley </em>v. <em>Warden, supra </em>(\u201cstandards applicable to the factual basis supporting the officer\u2019s probable-cause assessment at the time of the challenged . . . search are at least as stringent as the standards applied with respect to the magistrate\u2019s assessment\u201d). Because the standard for obtaining a search warrant to search the car could not be met, we conclude that it was unreasonable for the police to order the defendant out of the car in order to facilitate a warrantless search of the car for criminal contraband under the automobile exception.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Our conclusion is in accord with our oft-repeated principle of proportionality. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. 136, 141 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 794 (1985) (\u201cThe degree of intrusiveness that is permitted is that which is \u2018proportional to the degree of suspicion that prompted the intrusion\u2019 \u201d). In these circumstances, without probable cause that a crime is being committed, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>condone such an intrusive measure as a warrantless search. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter P., </em>456 Mass. 254, 274 n.19 (2010) (substantial invasion of privacy only permissible under art. 14 when it is reasonable). It also is supported by the intent of the ballot initiative, which was, in part, to free up the police for more serious criminal pursuits than the civil infraction of low-quantity marijuana possession. See Information for Voters: 2008 Ballot Questions, Question 2: Law Proposed by Initiative Petition, Possession of Marijuana. It is unreasonable for the police to spend time conducting warrantless searches for contraband when no specific facts suggest criminality.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because the exit order issued to the defendant cannot be justified on any of the three permissible bases outlined above, the defendant\u2019s incriminating response to Officer Diaz\u2019s query whether he had \u201canything on his person,\u201d and the subsequent seizure of the crack cocaine itself must be suppressed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, 376 </em>Mass. 502, 505 (1978) (all evidence traceable to statement made before defendant illegally ordered out of car must be suppressed). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>385 Mass. 60, 63 (1982) (evidence obtained as result of unconstitutional police conduct must be excluded from use at trial under \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Accordingly, the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The judge made findings concerning the defendant and the driver of the automobile, but we will refer to the driver only where necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Hyde Square is home to the \u201cMozart Associates,\u201d a street gang.

Today, the court holds the same evidence, even in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>combination with other factors, insufficient to meet not only the probable cause standard but also the lower standard of \u201creasonable suspicion.\u201d According to the court, the justification for this change is the enactment of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32L-32N, which decriminalizes the possession of small amounts of marijuana. That change in our laws, however, does not affect the conclusions that may reasonably be drawn by police whose sense of smell alerts them to the fact that marijuana is, or recently has been, present.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Consistent with art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, a police officer may order a passenger to exit a vehicle when he has \u201ca reasonable suspicion of criminal activity\u201d on the part of that passenger. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bostock, 450 Mass. 616, 621 (2008). Although reasonable suspicion must be based on \u201cspecific, articulable facts and inferences that follow from the officer\u2019s experience,\u201d even \u201c[s]eemingly innocent activities taken together can give rise to reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 139 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 729 (2000). An officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion justifies an inquiry and, if necessary, an exit order to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that criminal activity has occurred or is occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Even though possession of a small amount of marijuana is now no longer criminal, it may serve as the basis for a reasonable suspicion that activities involving marijuana, that are indeed criminal, are underway. The essence of reasonable suspicion is that it justifies an inquiry that may result in establishing that no offense has occurred, or that one may have occurred, but there is insufficient evidence to proceed to probable cause. An inquiry that does not produce evidence that supports going further does not retroactively render unreasonable a suspicion that was reasonable at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Our case law is clear that \u201cthe odor of marijuana is sufficiently distinctive that it alone can supply probable cause to believe that marijuana is nearby.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garden, supra </em>at 48, and cases cited. The advent of decriminalization certainly has had no effect on the distinctiveness of marijuana\u2019s odor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>decriminalization affected the criminal status of numerous other activities involving marijuana. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L. Accordingly, the odor of marijuana permits an officer reasonably to suspect that the parties involved are in possession of criminal quantities of marijuana, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, or are in possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C. In other circumstances, when the suspect party is the individual in the driver\u2019s seat, the odor of burnt marijuana also permits a reasonable suspicion that the individual is operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of marijuana in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (l). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In this case, the officers\u2019 detection of the odor of marijuana provided a basis for a reasonable suspicion that the individuals in the vehicle might be involved in the commission of a crime. Because that suspicion was reasonable, the officers did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights by inquiring further and by requiring him to exit the vehicle. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> Whether the odor is of burnt or fresh marijuana is not meaningful. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>an odor of burnt marijuana may indicate an offense committed at a somewhat earlier time, reasonable suspicion that a crime has been, or is being, committed is present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">I do not agree with the court\u2019s suggestion that whether the vehicle\u2019s engine is running is relevant. The fact that an individual is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle is sufficient to permit a reasonable suspicion (not probable cause) that he is operating or will be operating the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
