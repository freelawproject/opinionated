L. c. 152, \u00a7 23, a general contractor that pays workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee of an uninsured subcontractor is immune from liability for common-law claims the employee may have against that general contractor. A Superior Court judge concluded that \u00a7 23 provided the defendant such immunity from wrongful death and negligence claims commenced by the plaintiff against it, and allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Appeals Court concluded that the allowance of the motion was error. <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Henry C. Becker Custom Bldg. Ltd., </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 507, 512 (2010). Because we conclude that \u00a7 23 applies only where the employee is directly employed by the insured, we vacate the entry of summary judgment for the defendant and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\"><em>Overview of statutory scheme. </em>We begin with a review of the relevant sections of the workers\u2019 compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Employers are required by law to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and suffer penalties for failing to do so. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 25A, 25C. An \u201c[ijnsured\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as \u201can <em>employer </em>who has provided insurance for payment to <em>his employees </em>by an insurer of [workers\u2019] compensation\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (6). An \u201c[e]mployee\u201d is defined, with exceptions not relevant here, as \u201cevery person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4). Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23, \u201c[i]f an employee accepts payment of compensation under this chapter on account of personal injury . . . such action shall constitute a release to the insured of all claims or demands at common law, if any, arising from the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Where an injured worker is an employee of an uninsured subcontractor, the insurance carrier of the general contractor that entered into a contract with that subcontractor is required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>pay the workers\u2019 compensation. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he oft-declared purpose of \u00a7 18 . . . is \u2018to prevent ... [an insured entity such as a general contractor] from escaping the obligation of the compensation act by letting out part of [its] work to irresponsible subcontractors or independent contractors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tindall </em>v. <em>Denholm &amp; McKay Co., </em>347 Mass. 100, 105 (1964), quoting <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>318 Mass. 373, 375 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Also relevant is G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, under which employees have the right to sue liable third parties for their injuries. Until 1971, under the so-called \u201ccommon employment\u201d doctrine, a general contractor was immune from third-party suits filed by employees of subcontractors for personal injuries sustained on the job. See <em>Searcy </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 134, 138-139 (1985). In 1971, \u00a7 15 was amended by St. 1971, c. 941, \u00a7 1, to limit immunity from suit only to situations where \u201c(1) the employer [is] an insured person liable for the payment of compensation, <em>and </em>(2) the employer [is] the direct employer of the employee\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Edward J. Lamothe Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 231, 232 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cContemporary comment . . . shows that the [1971 amendment to] the statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>taken by text and periodical writers as broadly abolishing the . . . \u2018common employment\u2019 doctrine and permitting third-party actions by, or in behalf of, an injured employee against all but his immediate insured employer.\u201d <em>Searcy </em>v. <em>Paul, supra, </em>and authorities cited. In 1983, this court concluded that the amendment to \u00a7 15, as well as provisions enacted in 1971 and 1980 that expanded the right of an employee to recover against third parties, \u201cindicate[d] the Legislature\u2019s intention that the injured employee be fully compensated for his injuries.\u201d <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 351 &amp; n.9 (1983), citing St. 1971, c. 888, \u00a7 1; St. 1971, c. 941, \u00a7 1; and St. 1980, c. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><em>Facts and background. </em>We present the essential undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In 2005, the defendant was the general contractor at a residential construction site in Newburyport. It hired a subcontractor, Great Green Barrier Co. (Great Green), to perform waterproofing work on the residence. An explosion at the site resulted in the death of Timothy B. Wentworth and serious injuries to Timothy\u2019s son, Ezekiel, both of whom were Great Green employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Great Green did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. In 2007, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, the defendant\u2019s insurer agreed to lump-sum settlements of Timothy and Ezekiel\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In 2006, the plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging that the defendant\u2019s \u201cnegligence, gross negligence and/or willful, wanton, or reckless conduct\u201d resulted in Timothy\u2019s death and Ezekiel\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">In its motion for summary judgment, the defendant argued that, under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23, by the acceptance of the lump-sum settlements on behalf of Timothy and Ezekiel, the plaintiff was barred from filing her lawsuit for common-law claims. The judge agreed and, citing <em>Kniskern </em>v. <em>Melkonian, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 461 (2007), and <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Downell, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 1126 (2004), an unpublished memorandum and order of the Appeals Court, allowed the defendant\u2019s motion. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). We construe broadly the workers\u2019 compensation <em>act </em>for the protection of injured workers. <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 637 (1978). See <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 364 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The plaintiff argues, in essence, that, because <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Downell, supra, </em>was erroneously decided, the judge erred in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. She contends that, under the plain language of \u00a7 23, the defendant is not an \u201cinsured\u201d; Timothy and Ezekiel are not the defendant\u2019s \u201cemployees\u201d; and, therefore, the defendant is not entitled to immunity from common-law claims. We agree. Immunity under the act applies to the \u201c[ijnsured,\u201d which is an employer who provides workers\u2019 compensation insurance to <em>\u201chis employees.\u201d </em>G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (6). Here, it is undisputed that Timothy and Ezekiel were not employees of the defendant. We conclude that the plain language of \u00a7 23 does not release a general contractor that pays workers\u2019 compensation benefits to its uninsured subcontractor\u2019s employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Moreover, under the plain language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, the fact that the defendant was required, by \u00a7 18, to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Timothy and Ezekiel is not a \u201cbar to an action at law for damages for personal injuries . . . against any person <em>other than the insured person employing such employee </em>and liable for payment of the [workers\u2019] compensation\u201d (emphasis added). We conclude that the explicit reference to \u00a7 18 makes clear that suits are not barred against general contractors that were obligated, under \u00a7 18, to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits of the uninsured subcontractor\u2019s employees. In sum, the immunity provided under \u00a7 23 does not apply to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Despite this plain language, the defendant makes a number of arguments to support its contention that our interpretation of \u00a7 23 \u201cstretches its plain meaning far beyond the breaking point,\u201d because the Legislature did not intend there to be a \u201c \u2018direct employment nexus\u2019 between the insured and the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>worker under \u00a7 23.\u201d The defendant asserts that because \u00a7 15 does not explicitly reference \u00a7 23, the provisions of \u00a7 15 abolishing the common employment doctrine do not apply; that employers already receive immunity from claims at law under \u00a7 24 and therefore our interpretation makes \u00a7 23 superfluous <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; that case law supports its interpretation of \u00a7 23<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; and that, on certain Department of Industrial Accident forms, the defendant is listed as the \u201cemployer.\u201d We need not belabor the reasons we are unpersuaded. It suffices to say that the arguments ignore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>plain language of the relevant statutory provisions (i.e., G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 15, and 23), and as the Appeals Court pointed out, the defendant\u2019s \u201cview of \u00a7 23 is inconsistent with the objectives of \u00a7 18\u201d to prevent a general contractor from escaping its obligation under the workers\u2019 compensation act by hiring uninsured subcontractors. <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Henry C. Becker Custom Bldg. Ltd., </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 507, 511 (2010). We agree with the Appeals Court that, under the defendant\u2019s interpretation, although the insurer of a general contractor that wilfully or negligently hires an uninsured subcontractor is \u201crequired to pay the uninsured subcontractor\u2019s compensation obligation, the contractor would obtain the benefit of being released from the significantly greater damages it likely would face in a common-law action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511-512. We conclude that the Legislature did not intend such an outcome, because this benefit is not available to general contractors who obey the law and hire insured subcontractors. Our interpretation instead gives a general contractor strong incentive to retain subcontractors who have workers\u2019 compensation insurance because it otherwise has to pay the workers\u2019 compensation benefits and is liable for any common-law damages; it implements the Legislature\u2019s intention fully to protect workers by allowing recovery from third parties, including general contractors who are not the injured worker\u2019s direct employer; and it gives meaning to the statute\u2019s intent that workers\u2019 compensation carriers be reimbursed by liable third parties. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 18; <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Henry C. Becker Custom Bldg. Ltd., supra </em>at 512 (statutory provisions allowing insurer reimbursement from any compensation paid to injured worker by third parties prevent worker\u2019s double recovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The entry of summary judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 18, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">\u201cIf an insured . . . contractor enters into a contract with a subcontractor to do all or any part of the work . . . and the insurer would, if such work were executed by employees immediately employed by the insured, be liable to pay [workers\u2019] compensation ... to those employees, the insurer shall pay to such employees any [workers\u2019] compensation which would be payable to them ... if the independent or sub-contractors were insured persons. The insurer, however, shall be entitled to recover indemnity from any other person who would have been liable to such employees independently of this section; and if the insurer has paid [workers\u2019] compensation . . . , it may enforce, in the name of the employee or in its own name and for its benefit, the liability of such other person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15, as amended by St. 1971, c. 941, \u00a7 1, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">\u201cNothing in [\u00a7 15] or in [\u00a7\u00a7 18 or 24] shall be construed to bar an action at law for damages for personal injuries or wrongful death <em>by an employee against any person other than the insured person employing such employee </em>and liable for payment of the [workers\u2019] compensation ... for the employee\u2019s personal injury or wrongful death and said insured person\u2019s employees\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b791-9\">Although compensation was paid in a lump sum, it was settled under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, not under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48, which governs lump-sum settlements between the \u201cinsurer\u201d and \u201cemployee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, an employee may elect to retain his or her right to assert common-law claims against an employer if, under certain conditions not relevant here, the employee so informs the employer in writing. If the employee does not inform the employer that he or she is exercising that right, it is waived. See generally <em>Saab </em>v. <em>Massachusetts CVS Pharmacy, LLC, </em>452 Mass. 564, 567 (2008), quoting <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>408 Mass. 614, 616 (1990) (employees exchange \u201cguaranteed right of recovery\u201d under workers\u2019 compensation benefits for right to recover for work-related injuries against their employers under common law); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 548 (1980) (no assertion by injured worker that he gave notice of right to sue employer pursuant to \u00a7 24; claim asserted that injuries not covered under the act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b793-11\">The unpublished Appeals Court memorandum and order, <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Donnell, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 1126 (2004), relied on by the Superior Court judge, supports the defendant\u2019s position. Although we find such authority persuasive, it is not precedential. Here we are relying on the statute\u2019s plain language. See generally <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>458 Mass. 561, 566 n.7 (2010), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">The other cases on which the defendant relies are readily distinguishable. In <em>Berger </em>v. <em>H.P. Hood, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 652, 655-656 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>424 Mass. 144 (1997), it is true that the court stated that the \u201cexclusivity provision [of \u00a7 23] is very broad.\u201d However, the issue was whether an employee who received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his direct employer could also recover from that employer\u2019s underinsurance motorist benefits (UM benefits). <em>Id. </em>Thus, it was in the context of addressing the UM benefits that the court concluded that the exclusivity provision of \u00a7 23 was broad enough to include immunity from an action against the direct employer\u2019s motor vehicle insurer. <em>Id. </em>More important for our purposes, however, is that the court held that the direct employer\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary was not entitled to such immunity from claims. <em>Id. </em>at 657. In <em>Kniskern </em>v. <em>Melkonian, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 463-464 (2007), there was a question whether the plaintiff was the defendant\u2019s employee. The court held that the plaintiff\u2019s employment status was established when the plaintiff accepted a lump-sum settlement pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48, which only applies to employees. <em>Id. </em>at 465. Here, as the Appeals Court pointed out, it is undisputed that Timothy and Ezekiel were not the defendant\u2019s employees and the parties reached a settlement pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18. See <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Henry C. Becker Custom Bldg. Ltd., </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 507, 510 (2010) (distinguishing <em>Kniskern </em>case).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
