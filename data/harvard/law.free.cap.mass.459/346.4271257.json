L. c. 254, on real property owned in fee by Richard J. Madigan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The contractors are Trace Construction, Inc. (Trace), and CB Seating, Inc. (CB Seating); the subcontractors, both of whom performed work for Trace, are L.C. Anderson, Inc. (Anderson), and Quinn Brothers of Essex, Inc. (Quinn). The contractors were engaged by Dana Barros Sports Complex LLC (Complex), a company owned by Dana Barros, to perform renovations on premises that Dana Barros Basketball Camp, LLC (Camp) had leased from Madigan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Complex failed to make payments to the contractors for work performed, and the contractors and subcontractors filed notices of liens on the property pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2 (governing contractors\u2019 liens), and G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4 (governing subcontractors\u2019 liens). The Camp also fell behind on lease payments to Madigan, and ultimately surrendered possession of the premises to him. The contractors and subcontractors brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>these actions to enforce the liens against both the Camp\u2019s leasehold interest and Madigan\u2019s fee interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following a jury-waived trial, a Superior Court judge determined that the contractors and subcontractors had established valid liens against the leasehold interest, but denied all claims asserting liens against Madigan\u2019s fee interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The contractors, subcontractors, and Madigan appealed to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We conclude that the contractors have a valid lien on Madigan\u2019s fee interest. We conclude also that any lien that may have been validly created on the leasehold interest was terminated when the Camp\u2019s leasehold was surrendered. We thus reverse the decision of the trial judge that each of the contractors and subcontractors had established liens on the leasehold interest. We affirm the judge\u2019s conclusion that the subcontractors did not establish a lien on Madigan\u2019s fee interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The real property at issue in this case consists of two adjoining parcels of land, one situated in Foxborough and the other in Mansfield, and a 70,000 square foot building located on the parcels. Madigan has owned the property since 1983, and he operated an indoor tennis club in the building until 1989. Madigan thereafter moved his wholesale paper business into the building, operating 7,000 square feet of the building as offices and 50,000 square feet as warehouse space, which was heated, lighted, and outfitted with storage racks. In 1996, he sold his business to Georgia Pacific and leased the premises to that company until 2000. The building then remained vacant until 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Dana Barros, a former professional basketball player, operated a basketball camp prior to his dealings with Madigan, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>had established the Camp in 2002 for that purpose. In 2004, Barros and Madigan held a series of discussions in which Barros told Madigan that he was interested in opening a sports complex on the premises and that he intended to make improvements for that purpose, but did not provide substantial detail prior to signing the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Madigan and the Camp entered into a five-year lease agreement that began on September 1, 2004, and that provided the Camp with an option to renew the lease for two five-year periods. The lease provided that all of the Camp\u2019s \u201calterations, improvements, additions and/or renovations,\u201d with the exception of personal property, equipment, and trade fixtures that were removable \u201cwithout material damage\u201d to the premises, were for Madigan\u2019s benefit and were not the property of the Camp. The Camp was required to obtain Madigan\u2019s written consent for any such alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">After securing the lease, Barros formed the Complex. The Complex entered into a contract with Trace in November, 2004, to perform extensive alterations and improvements to the premises, including plumbing, lighting, HVAC, and electrical work. Trace entered into subcontracts with Anderson and Quinn soon thereafter. The Complex also entered into a contract with CB Seating in January, 2005, for the installation of basketball equipment, gymnasium dividers, and other miscellaneous items.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Trace began performance and sent periodic applications for payment to the Complex. By the time of Trace\u2019s fifth application, the Complex was late in making payment. Trace informed the Complex in a notice dated March 23, 2005, that it would cease work within seven days if the balance remained unpaid. Shortly thereafter, in a letter dated March 30, 2005, Trace informed the Complex that it had ceased work. CB Seating performed in full, completing its work in May, 2005. The contractors and subcontractors each claim unpaid balances for work performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The work on the premises was sufficiently complete for the Camp and the Complex to occupy the premises in the spring of 2005. The Camp had persistent difficulties in making lease payments to Madigan, however, and in April, 2006, Barros executed a \u201cSurrender of Possession\u201d document on behalf of the Camp and Complex and presented it to Madigan. Madigan accepted it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>without objection, and the Camp and the Complex vacated the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Madigan continued to operate the facility as a means of generating income from the property and retained some of the employees who had worked for the Complex for that purpose. Within several months after the surrender, Madigan leased the property to a company known as BOAH, LLC (BOAH). That entity operated a fitness center at the premises for approximately eighteen months, after which time BOAH vacated and Madigan again took back operation of the facility. Madigan continued to operate it at the time of trial while seeking potential buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Each of the contractors and subcontractors filed a notice of contract and statement of account in the Bristol County or Norfolk County registry of deeds as required by the mechanic\u2019s lien statute. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2 (notice of contract requirement for contractors); G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4 (notice of contract requirement for subcontractors); G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 8 (statement of account for all mechanic\u2019s liens). Each also filed and recorded a complaint as required by the statute. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 11. There is no dispute that the contractors and subcontractors have made the appropriate filings for creating a mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">After the contractors and subcontractors filed these complaints, Madigan brought a separate action pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 15A,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for summary discharge of the liens, arguing that, as he was not a party to the contracts with the contractors or subcontractors, the lien could not attach to his fee interest in the property. See <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Trace Constr., Inc., </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 2 (2007). A Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint, concluding that summary discharge was not appropriate and that the contractors and subcontractors were entitled to discovery in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the matter. <em>Id. </em>The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment of dismissal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><em>A </em>jury-waived trial of the contractors\u2019 and subcontractors\u2019 claims was held in the Superior Court in December, 2008. By the time of trial, the issues remaining to be resolved were whether the contractors and subcontractors had established valid liens pursuant to G. L. c. 254 and, if they had done so, what the nature and amounts of those liens were. As stated, the trial judge ruled that the contractors and subcontractors had established valid liens on the leasehold interest of the Camp but that they had not established a lien on the fee interest of Madigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We review the trial judge\u2019s finding of facts for clear error. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>453 Mass. 293, 302 (2009); Mass. R. Civ. P. 52(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 142 (1996). We review the judge\u2019s rulings on questions of law de novo. See <em>T.W. Nickerson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fleet Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>456 Mass. 562, 569 (2010), citing <em>Anastos </em>v. <em>Sable, </em>443 Mass. 146, 149 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">A mechanic\u2019s lien is a creation of statute and can be enforced only by strict compliance with the statute. <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United Cas. &amp; Sur. Ins. Co., </em>440 Mass. 723, 726 (2004). The mechanic\u2019s lien statute contains separate provisions governing the creation of liens in favor of contractors, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2, and liens in favor of subcontractors, G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4. As noted, the contractors and subcontractors each claim liens on the fee interest, and Madigan challenges the judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the liens on the leasehold interest. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">We examine first the contractors\u2019 assertions that they have perfected liens on Madigan\u2019s fee interest. The provision of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute governing contractors\u2019 hens outlines both (1) the persons with whom a hen claimant can contract, and (2) the property that is thereby subject to a mechanic\u2019s hen. Both are addressed in a single statutory sentence, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\u201cA person entering into a written contract with the owner of any interest in real property, or with any person acting for, on behalf of, or with the consent of such owner for [relevant work] shall have a hen upon such real property . . . owned by the party with whom or on behalf of whom the contract was entered into . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2. As Madigan is the owner of a fee interest in the real property at issue, he is the \u201cowner of any interest in real property,\u201d and the contractors would be eligible to claim a lien if the Complex acted \u201cwith the consent\u201d of Madigan in entering into the contracts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Although Madigan does not contest that the earlier portion of the statutory sentence mentions those contracting \u201cwith the consent of\u201d the owner, he claims that the latter part of the sentence \u2014 the part that describes the property subject to the lien \u2014 encumbers only the property of a person \u201cwith whom or on behalf of whom\u201d the contract was entered into. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2. Madigan\u2019s argument implies that, as this latter language does not specifically include the property of owners who gave \u201cconsent\u201d to a contracting party, the lien cannot attach to his fee interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We do not agree. \u201cIt is [an] elementary rule of statutory construction that a statute should not be read in such a way as to render its terms meaningless or superfluous.\u201d <em>Bynes </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 264, 268 (1991), citing <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>410 Mass. 188, 192 (1991). If we were to accept Madigan\u2019s implied construction, the references to persons acting \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cwith the consent of\u201d the owner in the earlier portion of the relevant sentence would be rendered meaningless by their exclusion from the latter portion of that sentence. We conclude rather that the term \u201con behalf of\u201d in the latter portion of the sentence serves to paraphrase the earlier reference to persons \u201cacting for, on behalf of, or with the consent of\u201d the owner. As such, a contractor can establish a valid lien on a property interest when he or she contracts with a person acting with the consent of the owner of that property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>This conclusion is reinforced by reference to the statutory history of the relevant language. Prior to an amendment in 1996, the relevant provision read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">\u201cA person entering into a written contract <em>with the owner </em>of land for the whole or any part of the erection, alteration, repair or removal of a building or structure upon land, or for furnishing material therefor, shall have a lien upon said building or structure and <em>upon the interest of the owner </em>in said lot of land . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2 (1994 ed.). The 1996 amendment thus expanded the class of persons with whom one could contract and whose property interests could be encumbered. See St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 2 (introducing current relevant statutory text). We are mindful of that legislative purpose in interpreting the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">This history also reveals that the language in the latter part of the sentence \u2014 the portion that Madigan claims is restricting \u2014 was added by the Legislature at the same time as the consent language was added in the earlier portion. This makes a harmonious reading of the two provisions more natural than might be the case if, for example, both portions of the sentence had been similarly expanded and a subsequent revision then narrowed the latter portion. We conclude that the contractors can establish a mechanic\u2019s lien on Madigan\u2019s fee interest if Madigan consented to the Complex\u2019s contract for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">We accordingly turn to the question of Madigan\u2019s consent to the contracted work that was the source of the liens at issue. Our cases have explored the meaning of \u201cconsent\u201d in mechanic\u2019s lien statutes on a number of occasions. Factors that have been discussed in those inquiries include the parties\u2019 contemplation of the work at the time of the lease or sale agreement, an expectation or requirement in the lease or sale agreement that work will be performed, and the presence of a potential benefit to the owner from the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">In <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Sayles, </em>101 Mass. 435, 439 (1869),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we held that an owner did not consent to work that was undertaken by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>sublease tenant. The lease in that case provided for particular construction work to be done by the lease tenant, but not for the work eventually undertaken by a sublease tenant that gave rise to the lien. See <em>id. </em>435-436, 439. The fact that the lessor may have been aware of the sublease tenant\u2019s work once undertaken, and that she did not object, did not establish the consent required to create a lien on her interest. See <em>id. </em>at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Likewise, we have held that an owner who entered into a contract to sell real estate did not consent to work undertaken by the buyer prior to the buyer\u2019s receipt of the deed. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Fessenden, </em>106 Mass. 228, 230 (1870). That was true even though the owner knew of the buyer\u2019s intent to build on the land, knew of the progress of work prior to delivering the deed, and did not object. See <em>id. </em>at 229-230. See also <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>160 Mass. 48, 49 (1893) (owner\u2019s knowledge that buyer in possession was undertaking work prior to receiving deed, and owner\u2019s discussion with buyer about furnishing frame for house, did not import consent for purpose of mechanic\u2019s lien statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">By contrast, in <em>Roxbury Painting &amp; Decorating Co. </em>v. <em>Nute, </em>233 Mass. 112, 114, 118 (1919), we held that a mechanic\u2019s lien could be enforced against an owner\u2019s interest as a result of work undertaken by a person who had entered into a contract to buy the property. As in prior cases, the owner\u2019s awareness of the buyer\u2019s intention to undertake work on a house, and the owner\u2019s knowledge of the progress of that work, were not sufficient to establish consent. See <em>id. </em>at 115-116. However, there was evidence that the house was initially in an uninhabitable condition, and that there was an agreement with the owner that the buyer would renovate it to secure the mortgage money needed to pay the purchase price at closing. See <em>id. </em>at 116. The possibility of such an agreement, we concluded, was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>to vacate a verdict ordered for the owner by a Superior Court judge. See <em>id. </em>at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">To conclude that a person has consented within the meaning of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute, we have thus required something more than awareness of an intent to perform work, or awareness of ongoing work, and a failure to object. In the present cases, prior to agreeing to a lease, Madigan and Barros had discussed Barros\u2019s plans to hold his basketball camp in the building, and Barros told Madigan that he planned to renovate the building for that purpose. Madigan visited the site while work was ongoing on a few occasions, and saw the building regularly on his commute to work. He never objected to the renovations. Those facts, standing alone, may well fall short of establishing Madigan\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d under our prior case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">However, the lease also included a provision stating that the premises could only be used as a \u201crecreation facility.\u201d At the time of the lease agreement, the building had been vacant for four years, and its prior use was as a warehouse for storage of paper products, with a core area of office space. Although the use provision in the lease did not strictly require renovation to make the warehouse suitable for use as a recreation facility, the terms did make such renovation exceedingly likely given the then-existing condition of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The lease also provided that any such \u201calterations, improvements, additions and/or renovations,\u201d with the exception of personal property, equipment, and trade fixtures removable without material damage to the premises, were to \u201cremain for [the] benefit of [Madigan] and the demised premises and shall not be deemed the property of the [Camp].\u201d That provision, in combination with the use restriction, made it inevitable at the time of the lease that Madigan would have the option to own the renovations undertaken to convert the space into a recreation facility. Any such improvement also required Madigan\u2019s consent under the terms of the lease \u2014 albeit with the qualification that such consent could not be \u201cunreasonably withheld\u201d \u2014 and, as stated, Madigan never objected, on this basis or any other, to the ongoing renovations.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Finally, Madigan testified that he \u201cpriced the rent relatively low at the time.\u201d He explained that \u201cwe felt that... if [Barros] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>made the investment in the property, we would give him an attractive rent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Madigan\u2019s conduct thus went beyond silent acquiescence in Barros\u2019s undertaking. The provisions of the lease and the pricing agreement evidence contemplation and active encouragement of renovation investments in the property that would, at Madigan\u2019s election, remain for his benefit. We conclude, based on the sum of the evidence, that the work was performed \u201cwith the consent of\u201d Madigan for purposes of G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2, and that the contractors have a valid lien on Madigan\u2019s fee interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We turn now to the subcontractors\u2019 claims of liens on the fee interest, which are governed by G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That section provides that, upon proper filing of notices, \u201cthe subcontractor shall have a hen upon such real property, land, building, structure or improvement owned by the party who entered into the original contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This provision is notably distinct from \u00a7 2, the provision governing contractors, in that the subcontractor\u2019s lien is limited to the property owned by the party who entered into the original contract; it does not extend to the property owned by a person for whom, on whose behalf, or with whose consent the contract was made. As the party who entered into the original contract \u2014 the Complex \u2014 was not a fee owner, the subcontractors\u2019 lien, by the terms of the statute, does not extend to the fee interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The subcontractors urge us to interpret \u00a7 4 as allowing liens on all of the property on which a lien can be created in \u00a7 2. We decline. Section 4, like \u00a7 2, was revised in 1996. See St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5. Whereas the older version of \u00a7 4 granted subcontractors a lien \u201cupon the building or structure, and upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>interest of the owner,\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4 (1994 ed.), the current statute grants a lien \u201cupon such real property, land, building, structure or improvement owned by the party who entered into the original contract.\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4. That change, undertaken at the same time as the revision of \u00a7 2, did not extend the class of property eligible for subcontractors\u2019 liens as far as the property eligible for contractors\u2019 liens in \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Legislature may well have chosen to treat subcontractors differently as a result of subcontractors\u2019 more attenuated relationship with the owner of property, or with the understanding that subcontractors would enjoy broader protection by virtue of their claims against the general contractor. Whatever the rationale, we will give effect to the plain meaning of the text where, as here, the chosen language does not produce an illogical result. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We now address the judge\u2019s conclusion that the contractors and subcontractors established valid liens on the Camp\u2019s leasehold interest, a conclusion that Madigan challenges on appeal. A threshold question with respect to any such lien is whether a valid lien on the leasehold would survive the surrender of the lease to Madigan. We conclude that it would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">As a general matter, a lien on a leasehold is extinguished when the rights of the lessee expire. See Annot., Enforceability of Mechanic\u2019s Lien Attached to Leasehold Estate Against Landlord\u2019s Fee, 74 A.L.R.3d 330, \u00a7 7[a] (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010). By contrast, where the leasehold is conveyed from one tenant to another, a leasehold remains in existence and will continue to be encumbered; the statute states this latter principle explicitly with respect to mechanic\u2019s liens. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>distinction between these two circumstances may be ambiguous where, as here, a leasehold is surrendered<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">That ambiguity can be resolved by determining whether the surrender of the lease is most accurately characterized as voluntary or involuntary. See <em>Applebee\u2019s Northeast, Inc. </em>v. <em>Methuen Investors, Inc., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. <em>777, </em>781, 784 (1999). With respect to the Camp\u2019s performance under the lease, the trial judge found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201c[I]n addition to being unable to pay contractors all that was owed, the payment of rent under the lease became a matter of difficulty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201cIn a relatively short amount of time, Camp . . . had defaulted resulting in Madigan drawing down on a letter of credit in the amount of $75,833 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cFinally, it was apparent that Barros could no longer continue meeting expenses for the Complex and vacated the premises in March or April of 2006.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The judge thus found that the Camp had defaulted on the payment terms and that the subsequent surrender followed from Barros\u2019s inability to meet the expenses of the Complex. These findings are consistent with the \u201cconstant shortfall\u201d in rent payments described by Madigan in his testimony and the language of the lease regarding default, and we find no error in the judge\u2019s findings in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">The judge did not find a collusive scheme between Madigan and Barros to construct the Complex and subsequently evade the lienholders; rather, \u201c[fjrom the inception of his dealings with Barros, Madigan\u2019s main hope was that Barros would succeed at the Complex and continue to pay rent for the duration of the lease and the option periods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Given the Camp\u2019s default on its rent obligations, the Complex\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>apparent inability to continue to pay its expenses, and the absence of a collusive agreement between Barros and Madigan, we think the judge erred in his conclusion that the surrender of the lease should be considered voluntary. The fact that the parties agreed to a surrender of the lease, rather than having Madigan provide a notice of default, observe a five-day waiting period, and thereafter provide a notice of termination, does not change the substance of the transaction in this case. See <em>Applebee\u2019s Northeast, Inc. </em>v. <em>Methuen Investors, Inc., supra </em>at 784 (\u201cThe fact that the termination was carried out cooperatively, without litigation or other controversy, is not material where plain grounds for forfeiture existed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Quinn argues that Madigan\u2019s operation of the facility after the surrender supports a conclusion that the leasehold was voluntarily surrendered. In light of the absence of evidence of collusion, we do not think that Madigan\u2019s subsequent estimation that the most profitable use of the property was its continued use as a recreation facility compels a finding that the prior surrender of the lease was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Any lien that may have been validly created on the leasehold interest thus terminated with the end of the lease. As a consequence, we do not reach the parties\u2019 dispute regarding the claimed validity of the contractors\u2019 and subcontractors\u2019 liens on the leasehold at the time of the relevant filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Finally, Trace and Anderson allege that they have established liens on the individual improvements to the real property. Trace notes that \u00a7 2 provides that a lien claimant \u201cshall have a lien upon such real property, land, building, structure or improvement owned by the party with whom or on behalf of whom the contract was entered into. . . .\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2. Section 4 contains similar language. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4 (\u201cthe subcontractor shall have a lien upon such real property, land, building, structure or improvement owned by the party who entered into the original contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">That language, in describing \u201csuch\u201d real property, land, structure, or improvement, refers back to the prior recitation of those items in the provision defining the type of work eligible for a mechanic\u2019s lien. The eligible work includes the \u201cerection, alteration, repair or removal of a building, structure, or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>improvement to real property.\u201d G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2. See G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4. We think the statute is best read as preserving a parallel reference to the real property on which work may be performed, and not as extending mechanic\u2019s liens beyond real property to the individual items furnished in construction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">To hold otherwise, moreover, would have the potential to disrupt the secured transactions regime elaborated in art. 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as codified in Massachusetts law. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 et seq. Had the Legislature intended to implement a change of that magnitude, it would have made such an intent clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that contractors Trace and CB Seating hold valid liens on Madigan\u2019s fee interest in the subject property, and that no other valid liens are held by the contractors or subcontractors in these cases. Accordingly, the judgments that Trace, CB Seating, Quinn, and Anderson have established valid liens on the leasehold interest are reversed, and the orders pertaining to the sale of the leasehold are vacated. We remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b367-17\">The property in question has been owned by Madigan since 1983. In 2004, Madigan conveyed the property to Oxford Road Realty Trust, of which Madigan is trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b367-19\">As discussed <em>infra, </em>Dana Barros Basketball Camp, LLC (Camp), is an entity formed and controlled by Barros.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">O\u2019Connor Door Corporation\u2019s motion to intervene in one action was allowed by a Superior Court judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The judge accordingly ordered the leasehold sold and the proceeds distributed in accordance with G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Madigan appealed the portions of the judge\u2019s decision in which the judge decided that (1) an alleged misnomer in the notices and filings was not fatal to the contractors\u2019 and subcontractors\u2019 claimed liens; and (2) the surrender of the leasehold was voluntary. We do not reach the former issue because it is moot in light of our related conclusions in this case. The latter issue is discussed <em>infra. </em>Madigan argued in the alternative that the judge ruled properly that the contractors\u2019 and subcontractors\u2019 liens were limited to the leasehold interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">That section provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u201cIf any person in interest, including but not limited to an owner, . . . claims [that] <em>...(b) </em>it appears from the notice of contract or a statement of account that the claimant has no valid lien by reason of the character of, or the contract for, the labor or materials or rental equipment, appliances or tools furnished and for which a lien is claimed, . . . such person may apply to the superior court for the county where such land lies . . . for an order . . .

L. c. 254, \u00a7 15A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The Superior Court judge concluded that the reference in the statute to \u201cany interest in real property\u201d was limited to the Camp\u2019s or Complex\u2019s leasehold interest and did not extend to the fee interest. The judge concluded further that the reference to \u201csuch owner\u201d was limited to owners entering into a written contract. On that basis, the judge concluded that the lien could not attach to Madigan\u2019s fee interest. We do not find support for such a restrictive reading of facially broad language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">While G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 2, requires that the contractor enter into a \u201cwritten contract\u201d for the work that gives rise to a mechanic\u2019s lien, it does not require that the owner\u2019s consent be written.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Much of the case law reviewed here dates from the late Nineteenth Century. At that time, the relevant section of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute allowed for liens where labor or materials were furnished \u201cby consent of\u201d the owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>property, and we construed the meaning of \u201cconsent\u201d in our cases. See Gen. St. 1860, c. 150, \u00a7 1; Pub. St. 1882, c. 191, \u00a7 1; Rev. L. c. 197, \u00a7 1 (1902). In 1916, the mechanic\u2019s lien statute was amended to provide separate sections for mechanic\u2019s liens for labor and mechanic\u2019s liens for contractors, and the latter did not mention consent. St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. The 1996 amendments reinserted \u201cconsent\u201d as a basis for a contractor\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien, and we are again asked to construe that term within the meaning of the statute. See St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">General Laws c. 254, \u00a7 4, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\u201cWhoever furnishes labor, including subcontractor construction management services, or who furnishes material, or both labor and material. . . under a written contract with a contractor, or with a subcontractor of such contractor, may file or record in the registry of deeds ... a notice of his contract....</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\u201cUpon filing or recording a notice, as hereinbefore provided, and giving actual notice to the owner of such filing, the subcontractor shall have a lien upon such real property, land, building, structure or improvement owned by the party who entered into the original contract as appears of record at the time of such filing . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">That section provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u201cIf the person for whom the labor has been performed or furnished or the material has been furnished dies or conveys away his estate or interest before the commencement of a civil action to enforce a lien, it may be commenced and prosecuted against his heirs or against the persons holding the estate or interest which he had in the land at the time when the labor or material was performed or furnished.

Whether the use of the term \u201csurrender\u201d can be read as Quinn suggests, the substance of the transaction \u2014 not the terminology \u2014 controls the outcome in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">It is notable, in that regard, that although the description of the eligible work also included the \u201cfurnishing [of] material\u201d for the work, the mechanic\u2019s lien is not extended to such material.
