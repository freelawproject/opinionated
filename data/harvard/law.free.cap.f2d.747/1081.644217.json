Claimant\u2019s private psychiatrist submitted three reports describing claimant\u2019s limitations and claimant testified to pain and nervousness. The Administrative Law Judge (AU) noted claimant trembled at the hearing, exhibited \u201can obvious physical discomfort,\u201d and \u201cappeared in mental distress.\u201d He found \u201cclaimant\u2019s demeanor and testimony\u201d \u201cfully credible\u201d and concluded claimant was disabled due to a severe mental condition. The Appeals Council on its own initiative reviewed the case and reversed, finding no severe impairment. This became the final decision of the Secretary. Since the Appeals Council disposed of the case at the second stage of its sequential evaluation process, <em>see Goodermote v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>690 F.2d 5, 6-7 (1st Cir.1982), it did not consider vocational factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-20\">Claimant\u2019s principal arguments are that (1) the Appeals Council\u2019s own regulations precluded it from reviewing the AU\u2019s decision and (2) the Appeals Council decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-21\">1. Whether the Appeals Council was authorized to review the AU\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-22\">Plaintiff argues the Appeals Council violated its own regulations by initiating review. The pertinent regulations are 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.969, 404.970, which read, in material part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-4\">\u201c\u00a7 404.969 <em>Appeals Council initiates review.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-6\">Anytime within 60 days after the date of a hearing decision or dismissal, the Appeals Council itself may decide to review the action that was taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-7\">\u201c\u00a7 404.970 <em>Cases the Appeals Council will review.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-9\">(a) The Appeals Council will review a case if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-10\">(1) There appears to be an abuse of discretion by the administrative law judge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-11\">(2) There is an error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-12\">(3) The action, findings or conclusions of the administrative law judge are not supported by substantial evidence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-13\">(4) There is a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-14\">The Appeals Council referred to \u00a7 404.-970(a)(3), lack of substantial evidence. Plaintiff argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not unsupported by substantial evidence \u2014 plaintiff\u2019s testimony as well as one of his doctor\u2019s evaluations supported it\u2014 and that therefore the Appeals Council was not authorized to review the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-15\">While plaintiff\u2019s position has found some support in dicta, <em>Wood v. Schweiker, </em>537 F.Supp. 660, 667 (D.S.C.1982) (suggesting Appeals Council\u2019s power to review is limited to the four situations enumerated in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970); <em>see also Bohr v. Schweiker, </em>565 F.Supp. 610, 611 (E.D.Penn.1983), the eighth circuit, as well as a district court, have rejected it. <em>Baker v. Heckler, </em>730 F.2d 1147 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Taylor v. Heckler, </em>576 F.Supp. 1172, 1174 (N.D.Calif.1983). The latter courts have given deference to the Secretary\u2019s construction of the regulations, have noted that a restrictive interpretation of \u201cown motion\u201d review could interfere with the Secretary\u2019s monitoring of the department and the administration of claims, and have concluded that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970\u2019s enumeration of situations when the Appeals Council \u201cwill\u201d review a case is not exclusive of all the situations when, under 20 C:F,R. \u00a7 404.969, the Appeals Council \u201cmay\u201d undertake further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-17\">Generally, in an intra-agency appeal, the agency has all the powers it would have had in making the initial decision unless it limits the issues by notice or regulation. <em>See </em>3 Davis Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 14:19 (1980). Clearer language is needed before we would find an agency meant to give up its powers, and thus we agree with the eighth circuit\u2019s interpretation of the regulations. Hence, even though the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, the Appeals Council did not violate its regulations by initiating review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-18\">2. Substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-19\">We conclude that the Secretary\u2019s decision that claimant has no severe impairment is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-20\">Claimant has a second grade education. He does not speak English. According to the Secretary\u2019s own neurologist, who found claimant could not stand for more than six hours, claimant cannot return to his former occupation which required eight hours of standing. Mental illness places further restriction on claimant\u2019s vocational capacity. Claimant\u2019s private psychiatrist concluded that claimant\u2019s interests and activities were moderately severely to severely constricted and that his ability to perform work where contact with others would be minimal was fair to poor. The report from the Secretary\u2019s examining physidan did not include a residual functional capacity form and did not evaluate the degree of restriction of activities, constriction of interests, or ability to work in contact with others. Hence, the Secretary\u2019s finding that \u201cthere is no apparent constriction of interests or restriction of daily activities\u201d is entirely unsup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>ported. We think that a person whose interests, activities, and ability to work with others are restricted in the manner stated in the only report on the matter cannot be said to have no severe impairment. At a minimum, the Secretary was required to proceed further in the sequential evaluation process, to consider vocational factors, and to indicate what jobs, if any, claimant could perform. The Secretary also should have stated reasons for rejecting the AU\u2019s credibility determination. <em>General Dynamics v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>599 F.2d 453, 463 (1st Cir.1979) (an \u201cALJ\u2019s decision to give or deny credit to a particular witness\u2019s testimony should not be reversed absent an adequate explanation of the grounds for the reviewing body\u2019s source of disagreement with the ALJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded with directions to remand to the Secretary for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
