The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Robert L. Carter, <em>Judge, </em>found \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS\u201d \u2022 to be a \u201csuggestive\u201d term entitled to trademark protection; and it subsequently found defendant liable for trademark infringement under section 32(1) of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1) (1982). In addition, the court noted that the infringer\u2019s practices also violated state unfair. competition law. The judgment awarded a permanent injunction and $252,982.52 in damages (including $81,718.67 paid in commissions by the infringer to- its selling agent), plus prejudgment interest at 9% from October 9, 1981, and $25,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees. We reverse and remand for further findings with respect to the protection of the trademark and to defendant\u2019s liability under New York state unfair competition law.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-19\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b160-20\">In the shadow of the energy crisis of 1973, the OPEC oil price increases, and the resultant impairment of the United States economy and individual standards of living, the United States government, aided by private industries, editorial opinion and numerous other sources, made a tremendous effort to impress the importance of energy saving and conservation on the American public. This campaign took many forms, from the publication of Department of Energy \u201ctips\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Department of Agriculture Energy Management Checklists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was a National Energy Plan,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a Federal Energy Administration \u2014 later the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ment of Energy<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 and an enormous effort at all levels of government to promote energy efficiency. Examples of the public and private interest in energy efficiency include the federal imposition of the 55-mile per hour speed limit, the introduction of smaller and lighter automobiles, and public acceptance of hundreds of other new or neglected products and measures designed to conserve electricity, home heating oil, gas, and all other forms of energy \u2014 housing insulation, heating insulation, window shades, lamp adaptors and dimmers, storm windows and doors, shower heads, caulking strips, wood stoves, fewer window openings to the north, greater use of solar energy, to mention just a few examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Not surprisingly, this national movement was partially focused on the use in winter of warm clothing to permit the lowering of temperatures in homes, office buildings, factories, government buildings, and so on \u2014 as perhaps epitomized by the President\u2019s appearing on national television in his cardigan sweater. Clothing makers, as well as purveyors of household items such as sheets, blankets, comforters, blanket throws and drapes, took to advertising their products as \u201csaving energy,\u201d \u201cenergy saving,\u201d and the like. Department stores and clothing stores did likewise in reference to, among other things, sweaters, underwear, robes, gowns, nightshirts, children\u2019s sleepers, boots and so-called body warmers or wraparounds, which doubled as comforters. For example, the \u201cBundle-Up\u201d was advertised as an \u201call purpose energy saver ... to keep warm,\u201d providing \u201csuperior insulation ... and cozy warmth.\u201d The consumer was urged to \u201cturn your thermostat down, conserve energy and still be comfortable.\u201d Numerous examples of such advertising were offered in evidence but not received by the district court. Any peruser of mail order catalogues has seen numerous advertisements like these for roughly the last ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Facts in This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">20th Century Wear, Inc. (20th Century), is a New York corporation in the wholesale business of importing and selling women\u2019s pajamas and nightgowns to retailers, mail order and discount houses and other merchandisers. Sanmark-Stardust, Inc. (San-mark), is a New York corporation \u2014 incidentally situated in the building next to 20th Century\u2019s \u2014 that deals in many other forms of clothing in addition to women\u2019s pajamas and nightgowns.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">20th Century markets its pajamas in the customary form of a transparent plastic bag containing the garment and various tags. Sewn onto the collar of the garment is a tag bearing the name \u201c20th Century\u201d in blue, and below that the phrases \u201cguaranteed washable\u201d in red and \u201c100% cotton\u201d in blue. Three hang tags accompany the product. One of them includes a picture of a woman with her hands on her hips modeling the packaged garment, a printed description of the garment, and the slogan \u201cfor the style of your life\u201d printed in red. The second tag contains the cotton producers\u2019 well-known \u201cCotton Boll\u201d logo, the phrases \u201cA Natural Fiber\u201d and \u201cAs Seen on the Today Show,\u201d and the 20th Century name. The third insert has a red background and white border with bold print \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS\u201d in white with the trademark notice. The writing appears diagonally across the rectangular tag. A bold line appears under the last two letters of \u201cENERGY\u201d and the first five letters of \u201cSAVERS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office accepted the mark \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS\u201d for registration on March 17, 1981, for use with pajamas, nightgowns, dusters (three-quarter length cotton robes), and loungewear. It required, however, that 20th Century disclaim exclusive use of the words \u201ccozy\u201d and \u201cwarm\u201d apart from the mark as registered. <em>See </em>Registration No. 1,148,448 (Int\u2019l Class 25, 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.1(25) (1984)) (\u201cNo claim is made to exclusive use of \u2018cozy\u2019 and \u2018warm\u2019 apart from the mark as shown.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Beginning in July, 1981, and continuing until October 19, 1981, Sanmark sold wom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>en\u2019s pajamas and nightgowns under the \u201cSheila Anne\u201d label and used a tag bearing the words \u201cCozy Warm CONSERVES-ENERGY\u201d in connection therewith. Like many other pajama wholesalers, Sanmark\u2019s products are also packaged in transparent cellophane wrapping. The collar tag lists the name \u201cSheila Anne\u201d in blue print lettering, and underneath, in smaller lettering, \u201cpre-shrunk,\u201d \u201cguaranteed machine washable,\u201d and \u201c100% cotton,\u201d with the size indicated in red. The Sanmark transparent plastic bag also contains three hang tags. One describes the garment and depicts a woman with her hands on her hips modeling the garment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The second insert, in white and blue, contains the cotton producers\u2019 logo and the phrase \u201cMade of A Natural Fiber.\u201d The third insert has a white border and blue background with the phrase \u201cCozy Warm\u201d in red under which, in white, is the phrase \u201cCONSERVES-ENERGY\u201d underscored with a red line. The writing appears diagonally across the rectangular tag in type that is virtually the same size, style, and format as the type used by 20th Century. Even the hyphen, which is grammatically unnecessary, simulates the distinctive type style of the hyphen in 20th Century\u2019s mark. A bold line, similar to that used by 20th Century, appears under the last three letters of \u201cCONSERVES\u201d and the first four letters of \u201cENERGY.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The district court held Sanmark liable for trademark infringement. The court began by noting that the opposing parties sell to many of the same customers, generally shops, stores, and clothing chains, and that 20th Century\u2019s sales fell off when Sanmark began selling its Sheila Anne pajamas and nightgowns. Turning to trademark. law, the court stated that the registered trademark \u201cdoes not bring women\u2019s pajamas and nightgowns to mind, and requires \u2018imaginative <em>\\sic </em>] thought and perception,\u2019 <em>Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, Inc. </em>[295 F.Supp. 479, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1968)], to relate the mark to women\u2019s sleepwear.\u201d Accordingly, purporting to follow <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 4, 11 (2d Cir.1976), the district court held that the mark was suggestive, not descriptive, and entitled to protection without regard to whether the mark had acquired a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The court also concluded that there was a likelihood of confusion between San-mark\u2019s trade dress and mark and those used by 20th Century. The court, by visual examination of the packaged products, found that an appreciable number of ordinary, prudent purchasers were likely to be confused or misled into believing that San-mark\u2019s garments were 20th Century\u2019s. According to the court, \u2022 Sanmark\u2019s \u201cCozy Warm CONSERVES-ENERGY\u201d is confusingly similar to 20th Century\u2019s registered trademark, and \u201cthe imitative trade dress compounds the confusion.\u201d But while the court found a violation under section 32(1) of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), it did not find a federal false designation of origin violation under section 43(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). In the court\u2019s view, a claim of false designation of origin could not stand, because Sanmark had clearly marked its products as a Sheila Anne design. The court then stated that \u201cwhile it is clear that\u201d Sanmark and its selling agent, Domino Industries, \u201care guilty of unfair competition under New York law, ... since [20th Century was given] complete relief under federal stat-. utes, the violation of New York law adds nothing to [20th Century\u2019s] entitlement to recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">1. <em>Trademark Infringement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Section 32(l)(a) of the Lanham TradeMark Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1)(a), provides a federal cause of action for trademark in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>fringement when a \u201ccolorable imitation of a registered mark ... is likely to cause confusion.\u201d Success depends on \u201cwhether there is any likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are likely to be misled, or indeed simply confused, as to the source of the goods in question.\u201d <em>Mushroom Makers, Inc. v. R.G. Barry Corp., </em>580 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1116, 99 S.Ct. 1022, 59 L.Ed.2d 75 (1979). This court has repeatedly held that a finding of infringement turns on an assessment of several factors including the strength of the senior user\u2019s mark, the similarity of the marks, the similarity of the products and the trade dress, actual confusion, the junior user\u2019s good faith, and the sophistication of the buyers. <em>See, e.g., Spring Mills, Inc. v. Ultracashmere House, Ltd., </em>689 F.2d 1127, 1129 (2d Cir.1982); <em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., </em>287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 820, 89 S.Ct. 36, 7 L.Ed.2d 25 (1961); <em>see also Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc. v. Canarsie Kiddie Shop, Inc., </em>559 F.Supp. 1189, 1195 (E.D.N.Y.1983). In this case, we address the strength of the mark \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS,\u201d and remand for further findings on whether the mark has acquired secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">As Judge Friendly\u2019s opinion in <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, </em>537 F.2d at 9, points out, there are four different levels of trademark protection: (1) generic (not entitled to protection even with proof of secondary meaning),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) descriptive (entitled to protection with proof of secondary meaning), (3) suggestive (entitled to protection without proof of secondary meaning), and (4) arbitrary or fanciful (enjoying \u201cthe rights accorded to suggestive terms as marks\u2014 without the need of debating whether the term is \u2018merely descriptive,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 11). The difficulty, of course, lies in determining what level of protection a particular mark deserves. This determination in turn depends upon the particular context of the mark\u2019s use, the context of its time of use, and the context of its group of users. <em>See Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, </em>537 F.2d at 9; <em>see also McGregor-Doniger, Inc. v. Drizzle, Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1126, 1131 (2d Cir.1979). Making such a determination \u2014 pigeonholing or labeling \u2014 has always been a slippery business, as Cardozo reminded us so many times. <em>See, e.g., Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., </em>300 U.S. 577, 586, 57 S.Ct. 524, 528, 81 L.Ed. 814 (1937); <em>Techt v. Hughes, </em>229 N.Y. 222, 246, 128 N.E. 185, 193 (1920); Cardozo, <em>Mr. Justice Holmes, </em>44 Harv.L.Rev. 682, 689 (1931), <em>reprinted in Selected Writings of Benjamin N. Cardozo </em>83 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">This case involves the distinction between suggestive and descriptive terms, a distinction, Judge Friendly noted, \u201cthat the courts have had great difficulty in defining.\u201d <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, </em>537 F.2d at 10. A useful standard, however, can be stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">A term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of goods. A term is descriptive if it forthwith conveys an immediate idea of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of the goods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\"><em>Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, Inc., </em>295 F.Supp. 479, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1968), <em>quoted in Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, </em>573 F.2d at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">We hold that \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS\u201d is a descriptive term. The district court mischaracterized the mark because it failed to consider how the meaning of the words \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS\u201d had changed over time. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>assumed that a step of the imagination is needed to connect the concept of energy saving to women\u2019s pajamas and concluded that the mark is \u201csuggestive\u201d rather than \u201cdescriptive.\u201d And it may be true that such a step would have been needed, say, in 1973 or 1975. But by 1981, the connection between \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS\u201d and the warming quality of plaintiff\u2019s pajama no longer required imagination, since many people were using this kind of language to describe clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">As one of the leading commentators reminds us, a term can be descriptive in two ways. It can literally describe the product, or it can describe the purpose or utility of the product. Under the first branch, \u201cif qualities, ingredients, effects or other features of the product are indicated naturally and in ordinary language, so that the consumer understands its significance without any exercise of the imagination, the words are descriptive.\u201d 3 R. Callmann, <em>supra </em>note 6, \u00a7 18.05, at 17. Under the second brand, Callmann distinguishes among three subcategories of marks that describe the product\u2019s purpose or- utility: (1) marks describing the problem or condition that the trademarked product is designed to remedy or otherwise deal with; (2) marks that describe the use to which the product or service is put; and (3) marks that describe the effect that the product or service is supposed to produce after it is used. <em>Id. </em>at 27. He notes that courts generally hold that marks in the first two subcategories are descriptive, but that some courts have improperly tended to hold that marks in the third subcategory are not descriptive of goods or services. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 27-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Had this suit been brought before the energy crisis, we might well have concluded that the mark was suggestive. But by the time of the alleged infringement, \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS\u201d fell on the descriptive rather than the suggestive side of a shifting line and as such was not entitled to protection absent proof of secondary meaning. \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS\u201d defies Callmann\u2019s subcategorization. It does describe the quality of warming that wearing the flannel pajamas or nightwear involves, and hence the effect of such wearing, since the use of flannel pajamas presumably permits one to turn down the heat somewhat lower at night. It also describes the problem or condition \u2014 energy waste \u2014 with which the product deals, however indirectly. Numerous clothing businesses and hundreds, if not thousands, of other businesses as a result of the energy crisis began using \u201cenergy saving\u201d and \u201ccozy warm\u201d to describe or extol the virtues of their products. In the wake of this common usage, the public was so well educated to the concept of something \u201ccozy warm\u201d as an \u201cenergy saver\u201d that consumers did not have to engage in any sort of multistage reasoning process to link the term to the virtues of any number of products, including but not limited to flannel pajamas and nightgowns. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 18.09, at 55 (\u201c[cjonsumer reaction to the mark, at the time in question, is the test\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 721, at 85 (Tent. Draft No. 8 1963) (\u201cThe test [for descriptiveness] is the meaning attached to the designation by prospective purchasers ____\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">This usage is seen more readily perhaps by noting that the class of products for which 20th Century was given a registered mark<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> included dusters and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>loungewear, not merely pajamas and nightgowns. Any clothing made for warmth\u2014 bathrobes, gowns, \u201cbody warmers\u201d or the like \u2014 thus falls within the scope of the registered trademark. As we have said, makers of all kinds of warm clothing had sought to capitalize on the connection in the public\u2019s mind between wearing warm clothing and saving energy. Comforters, blankets, sheets, bathrobes and numerous other products associated with the human way of sleeping are and have been advertised as energy saving because they are \u201cwarm,\u201d \u201ccozy,\u201d \u201csnuggy,\u201d \u201ctrapping body heat,\u201d \u201cthermal,\u201d \u201csnuggle soft\u201d and \u201csnuggle warm,\u201d \u201cwarm as a bunny hug from top to toe,\u201d \u201ctoasty to your toes.\u201d Three advertisements illustrate our point.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">THALHIMERS</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Fashion Stores</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">announces the opening of the 60\u00b0 SHOP Step into Thalhimers\u2019 new 60\u00b0 Shop, our warm answer to this coming winter\u2019s chilly problem.

Trademarks identify the source of a product and hence protect the source\u2019s good will. <em>See United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., </em>248 U.S. 90, 97, 39 S.Ct. 48, 50, 63 L.Ed. 141 (1918); <em>Field Enterprises Educational Corp. v. Cove Industries, </em>297 F.Supp. 989, 994 (E.D.N.Y.1969); 3 R. Callmann, <em>supra </em>note 6, \u00a7 18.-03, at 7. Descriptive terms deserve less protection than suggestive terms both because descriptive terms normally do not distinguish among similar products and because such terms \u201cshould not be monopolized by a single use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The common usage of \u201ccozy warm\u201d and \u201cenergy savers\u201d suggests that the terms cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>used to distinguish 20th Century\u2019s clothing. In addition, exclusive use of the term might unfairly \u201cmonopolize\u201d common speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">All the foregoing assumes, of course, that the phrase \u201cCozy Warm ENERGY-SAVERS\u201d in connection with women\u2019s flannel pajamas has not acquired secondary meaning. As noted above, the mark still deserves protection if plaintiffs can show \u201cthat the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.\u201d <em>Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., </em>305 U.S. 111, 118, 59 S.Ct. 109, 113, 83 L.Ed. 73 (1938). The record shows that 20th Century entered proof of secondary meaning at trial. Thus, appellant argues that even if we hold that the mark is descriptive we should find that the mark deserves protection because it has acquired secondary meaning. We remand, however, for an assessment of the evidence of secondary meaning by the district court. We note first that \u201cproof of secondary meaning entails vigorous evidentiary requirements,\u201d <em>Ralston Purina Co. v. Thomas J. Lipton, Inc., </em>341 F.Supp. 129, 134 (S.D.N.Y.1972), and that 20th Century has the burden of showing that the term had acquired secondary meaning in the summer of 1981 when Sanmark first began using its phrase on hang tags, <em>see Saratoga Vichy Spring Co., Inc. v. Lehman, </em>625 F.2d 1037, 1043 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Le Sportsac, Inc. v. Dockside Research, Inc., </em>478 F.Supp. 602, 608 (S.D.N.Y.1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In assessing whether 20th Century has satisfied this heavy burden, there are many forms of evidence that help show secondary meaning, including how long the mark has been used, <em>see Saratoga Vichy Spring Co. v.

Robertson, </em>269 U.S. 372, 380, 46 S.Ct. 160, 162, 70 L.Ed. 317 (1926), a concept that also included \u201cpassing off one\u2019s goods as those of another\u201d and imitation of the trade dress of another.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Under the common law one who marketed goods, the physical appearance of which was a copy or imitation of the physical appearance of the goods; labels, wrappers, containers, styles or designs of another, appropriated the other\u2019s \u201ctrade dress\u201d at least where the copied or imitated features had acquired generally in the market a special significance or secondary meaning identifying the other\u2019s goods; there was a likelihood of confusion among prospective purchasers; and the imitated features were not \u201cfunctional.\u201d Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 741, 742 (1938); <em>Wirtz v. Eagle Bottling Co., </em>50 N.J.Eq. 164, 166, 24 A. 658, 659 (1892). It will be recalled that the district court in this case found that Sanmark\u2019s trade dress (consisting of the various colored tags) was \u201cimitative\u201d and \u201ccompound[ed]\u201d the confusion caused by imitation of the registered mark. It also found that 20th Century\u2019s \u201cdistinctive\u201d packaging was known to Sanmark before Sanmark\u2019s use and that Sanmark\u2019s trade dress \u201cmirror[ed]\u201d 20th Century\u2019s. Thus, the district court found that Sanmark \u201cadopted its mark and trade dress for no other reason than to obtain a free ride on the good reputation of its successful competitor.\u201d <em>Spring Mills, Inc. v. Ultracashmere House, Ltd., </em>689 F.2d 1127, 1134 (2d Cir.1982). These findings were based on two preliminary findings \u2014 first, that \u201ca cursory visual examination of the packaged product, with their tags and inserts intact, makes clear that even a prudent purchaser would have difficulty in distinguishing the source of the two products\u201d; and, second, that because these were competitors selling identical products in the same market, the court could infer Sanmark\u2019s actual knowledge of the trademark and \u201cdistinctive packaging prior to its use of the mark.\u201d Were this all there was to the case, affirmance on the basis that Sanmark was engaged in the tort of unfair competition would be possible. This is true even though the court linked the trademark and the trade dress phases of the case and we are reversing the former, especially since the district court found not only that the mass merchandising marketing environment in which these products were sold made distinctiveness in trade dress crucial, but that 20th Century and Sanmark were selling similar products to the same customers. Unfortunately, neither the facts nor the law are so clear as to permit such a disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">As to the facts, we have the finding that Sanmark\u2019s \u201cSheila Anne\u201d tag in \u201cbold blue letters,\u201d affixed to the collar of the garment meant that Sanmark had clearly marked its product as a \u201cSheila Anne\u201d design. Thus, even though \u201can impression has been created which makes it difficult for a prudent consumer to distinguish the two products,\u201d the court held that there was no false representation of origin warranting application of section 43 of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Yet, section 43(a) is not limited in scope to providing protection only against verbal misrepresentations or deceptions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, section 43(a) has been broadly construed to provide protection against deceptive marking, packaging, and advertising of goods and services in commerce. <em>Keebler Co. v. Rovira Biscuit Corp., </em>624 F.2d 366, 372 (1st Cir.1980).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>To maintain an action under section 43(a) for trade dress infringement, a plaintiff must allege that a competitor\u2019s product design or packaging is likely to confuse consumers as to the product source \u2014 such a design or packaging falsely designates its origin. <em>See Warner Bros. v. Gay Toys, Inc., </em>724 F.2d 327, 329 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Keebler Co., </em>624 F.2d at 378. The district court\u2019s decision that there was no false representation of origin warranting application of section 43(a) is thus inconsistent with its finding \u201cthat an appreciable number of \u2018ordinarily prudent purchasers\u2019 [citation omitted] are likely to be confused or misled into believing that defendant\u2019s garments are plaintiff\u2019s.\u201d Either the packaging was such as to confuse customers as to its source or it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Were section 43(a) the only law on which 20th Century\u2019s claim of trade dress infringement rested, a resolution of the paradox just discussed would be unnecessary, because so far as we can see 20th Century abandoned in this court any claim under section 43(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But the paradox persists because the district court did not reach the question of how the resolution of 20th Century\u2019s trade dress infringement claims would fare based upon New York law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This trade dress issue, like the trademark infringement issue, must therefore be remanded to the district court, where at least three preliminary issues must be addressed prior to its resolution under New York law. First, the court must determine whether, under New York law, a finding of secondary meaning is essential to successful maintenance of an action for trade dress infringement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Second, should the district court find that proof of secondary meaning is required under New York law for protection against trade dress infringement, the court must then determine the legal relevance of its finding that Sanmark consciously intended to copy 20th Century\u2019s trademark and trade dress \u2014 in effect, the court must decide whether and to what extent Sanmark\u2019s conscious intent to confuse is probative of 20th Century\u2019s claim that its trade dress had acquired secondary meaning. Last, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>though most courts have found, under both section 43(a) and New York unfair competition law, that only proof of a likelihood of confusion is required to obtain injunctive relief for unfair competition, some courts have held that proof of actual confusion is required to obtain a damages remedy. <em>See, e.g., Warner Bros. v. Gay Toys, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 76, 79 (2d Cir.1981); <em>Skil Corp. v. Rockwell International Corp., </em>375 F.Supp. 777, 783 (N.D.Ill.1974). The district court found, on a \u201ccursory visual examination,\u201d that \u201ceven a prudent purchaser would have difficulty in distinguishing the source of the two products.\u201d If the court finds that proof of actual confusion is required under New York law for 20th Century to obtain a disgorgement of Sanmark\u2019s profits, the court will then have to determine whether or not actual confusion occurred.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Judgment reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-12\">.

But section 33(a) also provides that a defendant in an infringement action may prove \"any legal or equitable defense or defect which might have been asserted if such mark had not been registered.\u201d A party can also challenge exclusivity by way of petition for cancellation under sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tion 14 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064, \"either in a separate and independent action or as a counterclaim in an infringement suit.\u201d <em>Keebler Co. v.

In an infringement action, the defendant has the burden of rebutting the presumption of plaintiff's right to exclusive use of a registered mark by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Dan Robbins &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Questor Corp., </em>599 F.2d 1009, 1013-14 (C.C.P.A.1979).

We hold, however, that in the absence of evidence that the Patent and Trademark Office registered the mark because of its secondary meaning, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f), registration does not shift the burden of proving a lack of secondary meaning onto the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><em>. </em>Proof of a product\u2019s popularity should not be equated with proof of secondary meaning. <em>See Saratoga Vichy, </em>491 F.Supp. at 151.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\">. We do not interpret the district court's findings with respect to the issue of likelihood of confusion as to source as including an implicit finding of secondary meaning. While confusion as to source is the fundamental inquiry in any infringement action, the elements that plaintiff must prove in a suit involving a suggestive term differ from those in a suit over a descriptive term. Proof of confusion as to source can be divided into two more specific showings: whether the public is unlikely to distinguish the source of the allegedly infringing product from that of the infringed product and whether the public makes the connection between the trademark and the plaintiff-source. The connection between mark and source is assumed in the case of a suggestive or arbitrary term. Secondary meaning performs the role of establishing that connection here, in the case of a descriptive term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\">.

Sanmark has argued at length that the use of a tape recording to refresh the witness Seymour Sunshine\u2019s recollection, even though the recording was made without Sunshine\u2019s knowledge or consent, was erroneous. The argument is that 20th Century\u2019s attorney violated legal ethics when he surreptitiously recorded a conversation with Sunshine. <em>Model Code of Professional Responsibility </em>DR1-102(A)(4), 7-102(A)(7), (8) (1981); <em>Model Rules of Professional Conduct </em>Rule 8.4(a), (c) (1983); ABA Comm, on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 337 (1974). However, the use of unethically obtained evidence merely to refresh recollection is not prohibited by the Federal Rules of Evidence. Permitting the use of unethically obtained evidence to refresh recollection not only avoids miring the court in side issues, <em>cf. </em>8 Wigmore \u00a7 2183 (McNaughton rev. 1961), but also furthers one of the trial\u2019s primary purposes, to uncover the truth: the canons of ethics do not determine what will jog a witness's memory. Even evidence obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights has been used to refresh recollection. <em>United States v. Baratta, </em>397 F.2d 215, 221-22 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 939, 89 S.Ct. 293, 21 L.Ed.2d 276 (1968). The court must ensure, however, that the witness actually has a present recollection and that otherwise inadmissible evidence does not slip in inadvertently for its truth. The courts and Congress have devised two safeguards for this purpose. <em>See </em>J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, 3 <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>612-12 to -13 (1982). First, the trial judge has broad discretion to organize or limit the use of evidence to refresh recollection. <em>United States v. Baratta, supra, </em>at 222; J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <em>supra; </em>3 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 765 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). Second, Rule 612 of the Federal Rules of Evidence gives opposing counsel the right to inspect at trial whatever is used to refresh recollection, to cross-examine the witness on it, and to introduce relevant portions into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">On retrial, the district judge in this case should be careful to separate what the witness remembered from what was played on the tape. Reliance on the tape recording without having the witness repeat in his own words what he remembered, although the witness repeatedly disclaimed remembering details of the earlier conversation, is not proper. Even when a witness appears hostile and evasive, the witness\u2019s bare assertions that he \u201csuppose[dj\u201d the tape refreshed his recollection, or that he \"may have said\u201d something on the tape, do not suffice to bring in all of the recorded excerpts for their truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">While the apparent misuse of the tape to substitute for the witness\u2019s own recollection may not amount to reversible error, because it does not affect any party\u2019s \"substantial right,\u201d <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a); <em>De Laval Turbine, Inc. v. West India Industries, Inc., </em>502 F.2d 259, 263-64 (3d Cir.1974), the district court should permit opposing counsel to examine the parts of the tape not used to refresh the witness\u2019s memory. While Rule 612 only requires th\u00e1t the documents actually used to refresh recollection and relevant to the witness\u2019s testimony be turned over to the adverse party, <em>see United States v. Wright, </em>489 F.2d 1181, 1189 (D.C.Cir.1973), and the rule of completeness codified in Rule 106 only applies when the writing or recorded statement is \"introduced\u201d into evidence, we think that in fairness and under the spirit of the Rules the better practice is to permit opposing counsel to examine a tape where it has been unethically obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">In addition, both 20th Century and Sanmark argue that the district court erred in its assessment of attorney\u2019s fees under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117. But because we remand for further proceeding concerning liability, it is premature to review these attorney\u2019s fees issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
