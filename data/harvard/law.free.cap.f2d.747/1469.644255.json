ROBINSON, III, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1546-16\">A corollary to the doctrine of sovereign immunity exempts the United States from liability for interest absent its express consent thereto.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole issue on this appeal is whether the District Court dishonored that precept when, in assessing an attorneys\u2019 fee against the United States, it effected a 30 percent upward adjustment of the lodestar<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to compensate the attorney for delay in receipt of payment. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-17\">We sustain the adjustment alternatively on two grounds. First, we conclude that the language of the statute authorizing allowances of attorneys\u2019 fees against the United States in employment-discrimination cases waives its sovereign immunity with respect to the delay component of the fee award. Second, we find that component validated by a line of cases relaxing the traditional rigor of the sovereign-immunity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-19\">In 1976 and again in 1977, Tommy Shaw, a black employee of the Library of Congress, submitted complaints of job-related racial discrimination to the Library\u2019s Equal Employment Office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1978, after the Library remained resistant to these complaints, Shaw\u2019s counsel engaged in administrative proceedings and during the course thereof entered into negotiations which culminated in a settlement agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As part of the settlement, the Library agreed to promote Shaw retroactively with back-pay provided the Comptroller General first determined that the Library had authority to do so without a specific finding of racial discrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Comptroller General, however, held that the Library lacked pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>er under the Back Pay Act of 1966<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to pursue that course.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1547-5\">Dissatisfied with this turn of events, Shaw sued in the District Court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and ultimately prevailed on his position that the Library had authority to afford the relief specified in the settlement accord.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a result of Shaw\u2019s victory, the court ordered that he be awarded litigation costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> withholding, however, determination of the dollar amount thereof until after further proceedings and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Copeland v. </em>Marshall,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> then pending <em>en banc.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>By this time, primary responsibility for prosecution of Shaw\u2019s claim had devolved upon new lawyers, but the efforts of his earlier counsel before the Library and in the District Court had involved considerable time and energy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After our decision in <em>Copeland </em>was announced, counsel moved for an allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> requesting compensation at the rate of $85 per hour for 103.75 hours of work on Shaw\u2019s behalf during the course of those proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1547-15\">Largely dismissing the Library\u2019s challenges to both the hourly rate and the number of hours claimed by Shaw\u2019s counsel,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the District Court computed a lodestar of $8,435,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> based on 99 hours of work at the $85 proposed hourly rate, excluding from its calculation 4.75 hours which counsel devoted to research in an abortive effort to impart a class-action aspect to Shaw\u2019s administrative complaints.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court then reduced the lodestar by 20 percent to reflect the quality of counsel\u2019s representation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Lastly, and most importantly for this appeal,, the court increased the lodestar by 30 percent to compensate counsel for the delay in actual payment for the legal services he had rendered.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1547-16\">This case should have ended in August 1978, or at the latest in November of that year. If [Shaw\u2019s counsel] had been com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>pensated at about that time, he could have invested the money at an average yield of not less than 10% per year. It is the fault of neither [Shaw] nor [counsel] that payment was not made sooner. It is reasonable to assume that if payment is made promptly, counsel will receive his reimbursement by December 1, 1981. Accordingly, the accompanying order reflects an upward adjustment of 30% for delay.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1548-4\">Then, offsetting the 30 percent increase in the lodestar by the 20 percent reduction in the lodestar, the District Court granted a net 10 percent addition to the lodestar<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and, accordingly, awarded counsel a fee of $9,278.50.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Library has appealed,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> arguing that the 30 percent upward adjustment for delay infringes the rule that interest may not be assessed against the United States in the absence of waiver.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1548-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-6\">The issue posed on appeal is hardly one of first impression. In <em>Copeland v. </em>Marshall,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we declared <em>en banc </em>that the United States can be held liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> for attorneys' fees in an amount augmented to compensate for the lag attending payment. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1548-12\">The delay in receipt of payment for services rendered is an additional factor that may be incorporated into a contingency adjustment. The hourly rates used in the \u201clodestar\u201d represent the prevailing rate for clients who typically pay their bills promptly. Court-awarded fees normally are received long after the legal services are rendered. That delay can present cash-flow problems for the attorneys. In any event, payment today for services rendered long in the past deprives the eventual recipient of the value of the use of the money in the-meantime, which use, particularly in an inflationary era, is valuable. A percentage adjustment to reflect the delay in receipt of payment therefore may be appropriate.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number>We have subsequently reaffirmed this principle<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and, indeed, have upheld an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the United States that in fact was adjusted upward to compensate for delay.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1549-5\">Despite the seemingly clear applicability of these precedents, however, we do not rest our disposition on stare decisis alone. Whether an upward delay adjustment in an attorneys\u2019-fee award satisfies the rigorous requirements of the sovereign-immunity doctrine is an issue we have dealt with only peripherally,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and one we have never squarely addressed. We recognize, too, the jurisdictional implications of any legal bar created by that doctrine, and acknowledge the existence of decisions of this circuit arguably in conflict with <em>Copeland </em>and its progeny on this point.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We therefore opt to consider the Library\u2019s argument much as if it were presented upon a clean slate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-10\">The initial inquiry, of course, is whether the District Court\u2019s 30 percent augmentation of the lodestar for delay in payment of the fee constitutes \u201cinterest\u201d against the United States within the contemplation of the rule invoked by the Library. Shaw characterizes this component of the fee award as a proper ingredient of a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee, in contradistinction to interest.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The only way to determine whether this addition to the lodestar is condemned by the traditional interest rule is to ascertain what that rule prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-11\">Perhaps the clearest example of interest appears when a court, after calculating the amount of a monetary judgment, adds a percentage of that amount to compensate the claimant for loss of use of the money during the period between the claimant\u2019s initial entitlement to the money and the day the judgment is rendered.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Here the long-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>established rule refuses to view the sovereign as having consented to the addition, even though consent to suit on the claim has been established.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The same results follow court-awarded sums which, though not interest calculated in the classic manner, nonetheless are functionally equivalent to interest. Thus the Supreme Court has rejected a contention that an increase in an assessment by the Court of Claims against the United States, made as compensation for loss of use and occupation of a mining claim appropriated by the United States years earlier, was \u201ccompensation\u201d rather than interest.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that because \u201cthe loss of the use of the money results from the failure to collect sooner a claim held to have accrued when the company\u2019s property was taken, that which the company seeks to recover is, in substance, interest.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We ourselves recently held an \u201cinflation adjustment\u201d in awards of back-pay to federal employees amounted to interest against the United States because it served \u201cthe same general end of compensating the recipient for differences in the worth of her award between the date of actual receipt and the date as of which the money should have been paid.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1550-13\">In the case at bar, the District Court\u2019s 30 percent addition to the lodestar was designed to reimburse Shaw\u2019s counsel for the decrease in value of his uncollected legal fee between the date on which he concluded his legal services and the court\u2019s estimated date of likely ac.tual receipt.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> By the court\u2019s own description, the addition was based on a rough determination of the \u201caverage yield\u201d of the amount of the fee if invested at 10 percent per annum for three years.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We think the adjustment falls well within the contours of the interest concept. Only by ignoring applicable case-law as well as as the real nature of the disputed adjustment could we find anything other than an assessment of interest against the United States.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We proceed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>then, to the Library\u2019s contention that the District Court\u2019s action in this regard disregards the dictates of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-6\">The United States cannot be subjected to monetary liability save pursuant to a waiver of its sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Moreover, the scope of such a waiver is to be strictly construed.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The instant case involves a corollary of these principles, which for convenience we term the \u201cinterest rule.\u201d By this rule, the United States may not be held liable for interest absent an express waiver of its immunity.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The question we face here is whether Congress has waived that immunity with respect to an allowance of interest as part of an attorneys\u2019 fee awarded, as here, under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-7\">The relevant section of Title VII provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-8\">[i]n any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the [Equal Employment Opportunity] Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs, and the Commission and <em>the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private </em>person.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1551-14\">A private person, of course, may be held liable for interest as an ingredient of a Title VII attorneys\u2019-fees award,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and this section subjects the United States to liability for \u201ccosts the same as a private person,\u201d and authorizes assessment of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d We conclude that Congress thus has waived the immunity of the United States from liability for interest as a component of an attorneys\u2019 fee allowed under Title vn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-16\">The statutory waiver is express, and its range is defined in unmistakable language. To say that a private person, but not the United States, is liable under Title VII for interest as an element of an attorneys\u2019 fee would rob the unambiguous statutory language of its plain meaning. It would defeat the statutory imposition upon the United States of a liability for costs, and the statutory inclusion of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs,\u201d identical to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>that of a private party in similar circumstances. The scope-setting statutory words \u2014 \u201cthe same as a private person\u201d\u2014 mark out the United States\u2019 liability for attorneys\u2019 fees as well as costs in the traditional sense. Our responsibility as judges is to enforce this provision according to its terms.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1552-4\">We think Congress articulated its goal clearly enough by providing for governmental liability \u201cthe same as a private person.\u201d Conceivably, Congress might have attempted to effectuate its purpose by legislation listing each item of costs, including interest, for which the United States might' be held accountable. That approach, however, could well have led to the discovery of interstices among the enumerated items, especially since the courts would have had to obey the rule requiring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity;<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> its adoption, consequently, would not likely have achieved the congressional objective, manifest here, that the United States be treated no differently from private parties in similar circumstances.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It seems to us that, despite the availability of alternative statutory schemes waiving immunity from interest liability, there is simply no more direct and effective way to ensure complete parity between the United States and other litigants with respect to costs than to say so in so many words. That Congress did so in this section, we conclude, evinces an \u201cexpress\u201d waiver within the meaning of the interest rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-9\">Congress obviously understood the broad sweep of language which makes the United States just as liable as \u201ca private person.\u201d In the Federal Torts Claims Act,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> which later we discuss further,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Congress made the United States liable for certain torts \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> but immediately curtailed the obvious import of this language by providing that the United States \u201cshall not be liable for interest' prior to judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> It is difficult to understand why Congress bothered to exclude pre-judgment interest if the imposition upon the United States of liability \u201cto the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances\u201d was insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>cient to constitute an express waiver of liability for that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-5\">That the attorneys'-fee section of Title VII does not actually use the word \u201cinterest\u201d does not, in our view, make the waiver any less express. Notwithstanding the long history and wide variety of verbal articulations of the interest rule, we have not uncovered a single case supporting the proposition that a waiver of sovereign immunity is not express merely on that account.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> In fact, several decisions weigh against that position. The Supreme Court has held that Congress may satisfy the requirements of an analogous rule \u2014 that the United States is not bound by its own statutes unless expressly named therein<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> \u2014without identifying the United States in so many words.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Additionally, this circuit recently has held,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> when construing a purported waiver of governmental immunity from liability for attorneys\u2019 fees under the <em>Alyeska </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> that the words \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees\u201d are not \u201cmagic words\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> that Congress must use to satisfy the requirement that the waiver be \u201cspecific, if not explicit.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> On the basis of such close precedent, as well as common sense, we believe that \u201cinterest\u201d is not a \u201cmagic word\u201d the recital of which is prerequisite to a waiver of sovereign immunity respecting the interest component of an attorneys\u2019 fee award. Surely if Congress were to enact a comprehensive and unambiguous statute abrogating entirely and for all purposes the sovereign-immunity doctrine, we would not resuscitate the United States\u2019 immunity with respect to interest merely because Congress did not specifically enumerate \u201cinterest.\u201d Rather, we would construe such a provision as an express waiver of interest immunity and implement it accordingly, and in reality we do no more here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-10\">We underscore our more general view that an insightful approach to the problem before us is undermined, if not entirely precluded, by logomachic applications of the interest rule. Courts bear this observation out by consistently avoiding a wooden or formulaic definition of express waiver when referring to the interest rule. This circuit itself has declined to fashion a rigid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>concept of express waiver,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and the courts have not perceived a need to establish any particular verbal formulation thereof. Rather, they have variously required, if anything at all,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> an \u201cexpress\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> waiver, a \u201celearcut\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> waiver, a \u201cspecific\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> waiver, and \u201cexplicit\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> waiver, an \u201cunequivocal\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> waiver, a \u201cplain\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> waiver, a \u201cmanifest\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> waiver, an \u201caffirmative\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> waiver, an \u201cunambiguous\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> waiver, or a waiver described by a combination of these adjectives. There is nothing talismanic in the word \u201cexpress,\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> and we would distort the interest rule were we to inform its application by resort to any intuitive call for clarity of legislative expression thought peculiarily to lurk in the recesses of the word, or any other term used analogously as an ostensible criterion by which claimed waivers are to be judged. Rather, our use of the interest rule is instructed more appropriately by reference to the touchstone of the sovereign-immunity doctrine: \u201cthat the liability of the United States ... is a matter of federal law, and its extent and the procedures for imposing it must be sought in the statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has echoed this view, declaring that the standard for gauging asserted waivers of sovereign immunity as express or not is whether the statute \u201ccan fairly be interpreted\u201d as mandating governmental liability.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Giving this counsel the respect it is due, we think a disclaimer of waiver here would impart to the concept of express waiver an understanding more limited and formalistic than necessary to achieve the objectives underlying the interest rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-16\">This conclusion is reinforced by the resolve of several courts, recognizing the need for perspective when applying the rule requiring strict construction of sovereign-immunity waivers, to vigorously resist the tendency of the rule to become increasingly demanding by force of its own inertia.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> As one court has put it, the strict-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>construction rule \u201cis not entitled to be made a judicial vise to squeeze the natural and obvious import out of ... a statute or to sap its language of its normal and sound legal meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has reiterated the essence of this view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1555-5\">The exemption of the sovereign from suit involves hardship enough where consent has been withheld. We are not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction where consent has been announced.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1555-6\">When dealing with the interest rule, we see as much need for perspective to avoid strangulation of legislative intent by an unwarranted use of judicial force.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> We think Congress spoke clearly enough when, with respect to attorneys\u2019 fees, it ordained for the United States a liability \u201cthe same as a private person.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> We hold that Congress thereby waived the immunity of the United States from liability for interest as part of a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-8\">Even were we to find Title VII\u2019s attorneys\u2019-fee section inadequate as an express waiver, we would affirm the District Court\u2019s fee award on the basis of a substantial body of caselaw relaxing the traditional rigor of the sovereign-immunity doctrine when a statute measures the liability of the United States by that of private persons. The doctrine espoused by these eases, while spanning numerous and diverse statutory schemes, has attained prominence in litigation under the Suits in Admiralty Act.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> It is, accordingly, with this legislation that we commence our examination of the doctrine for purposes of ascertaining its applicability to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-11\">As originally framed, the Act provided that the United States could be held liable for harm inflicted by its merchant vessels \u201c[i]n cases where if such vessel were privately owned or operated, or if such cargo were privately owned or possessed, a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Congress later amended the Act by adding, as a third clause, the phrase \u201cor if a private person or property were involved,\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> thus underscoring the Act\u2019s plain command that governmental liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>in admiralty be equivalent to that of private persons in similar circumstances.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Federal courts have interpreted this language broadly to effectuate the congressional purpose evident therefrom.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has explicitly rejected application of the customary rule of strict construction and held instead that \u201c[tjhese liberal provisions indicate that the language used in the [Act] should have its broad and ordinary meaning and should not be interpreted in a restricted ... sense.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1556-4\">Later decisions by other federal courts have reiterated the theme that Congress intended, and that the Act should accordingly be interpreted, to make governmental liability \u201ccoextensive\u201d with that of private parties.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> They have rebuffed attempts to inject \u201cunintended\u201d or \u201cirrational\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> refinements into the Act, and have construed the language \u201csensibly, naturally, [and] ... literally.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> One court has even held that the United States is liable as a private person in new causes of action imported into admiralty law subsequent to passage or amendment of the Act.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> In short, federal courts generally have refused to wield the rule of strict construction to defeat the plain and natural meaning of the Act\u2019s command that liability of the United States be identical to that of private counterparts.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1556-9\">Buttressing the exception to the strict-construction rule prevalent in Suits in Admiralty Act cases, federal courts also have liberally construed other similarly broad statutory waivers of sovereign immunity. For example, the Federal Torts Claims Act<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> waives the immunity of the United States in unqualified language, imposing upon it liability for certain kinds of tortious conduct \u201cto the same extent as a private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>individual under like circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has placed liability on the United States for activities which, as a practical matter, are never privately undertaken because it has felt compelled to implement the \u201cbroad and just purpose which the statute was designed to effect,\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> namely, to treat the government as any private person would be treated. Similarly, when the question arose whether the Act allowed the United States to be sued as a third-party defendant in an action for contribution initiated by a joint tortfeasor, the Court refused to read \u201cfine distinctions\u201d into the Act.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Far from accepting a rule of strict construction, it specifically rejected an attempt to restrict the scope of the Act\u2019s broad language, which clearly put the United States on the same footing as a private party.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> The Court quoted favorably a statement to which we earlier adverted: <footnotemark>96</footnotemark> \u201c[t]he exemption of the sovereign from suit involves hardship enough where consent has been withheld. We are not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction where consent has been announced.\u201d <footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1557-5\">This same broad construction has been brought to bear on the Public Vessels Act,<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> which provides that \u201c[a] libel in per-</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-14\">sonam in admiralty may be brought against the United States ... for damages caused by a public vessel of the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>99</footnotemark> It too has been given the interpretation borne by the plain and ordinary meaning of its language.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Though this provision is less explicit than those of the Suits in Admiralty and Tort Claims Acts with respect to the comparative responsibilities of the United States and private persons, the Supreme Court has interpreted it \u201cto impose on the United States the same liability ... as is imposed by the admiralty law on the private shipowner,\u201d <footnotemark>101</footnotemark> noting that \u201ccongressional adoption of broad statutory language authorizing suit was deliberate and is not to be thwarted by an unduly restrictive interpretation.\u201d <footnotemark>102</footnotemark> The Court has since reaffirmed this holding,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> and federal courts generally have construed the scope of governmental liability under the Public Vessels Act in' terms similar if not identical to those by which they have delineated liability under the Suits in Admiralty Act.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> A recent Supreme Court decision interprets and reconciles these statutes without recourse to or even mention of the strict-construction rule.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1557-15\">Another example is furnished by the recent Equal Access to Justice Act, a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>strikingly similar to the Title VII section here at issue in its provision that the United States shall be liable for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses \u201cto the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.\u201d <footnotemark>106</footnotemark> While one circuit has found that this provision does not permit the award of interest,<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> others have declared categorically that the United States\u2019 liability thereunder is the same as private-party liability,<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> and generally have interpreted the statutory language to effect its \u201cplain, clear and common meaning.\u201d <footnotemark>109</footnotemark> In light of the extension of such similar doctrine to such a variety of statutes,<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> it cannot reasonably be disputed that the numerous decisions articulating this exception represent not scattered and aberrant caselaw, but a well-established and coherent line of precedent.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1558-11\">We think our approach in this case is fully consistent with the purposes of the rule of strict construction. This rule serves as a tool to calibrate judicial interpretation of purported waivers of sovereign immunity so as to minimize the risk of erroneous imposition of governmental liability under statutes that are ambiguous in scope, or are otherwise susceptible to expansion beyond the boundaries contemplat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>ed by Congress.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> Strict construction thus ensures that any waiver of sovereign immunity will be a legislative and not a judicial act.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> When, however, Congress proclaims that the liability of the United States shall be the same as for a comparably-situated private individual \u2014 by enacting either an explicit provision to that effect or a sweeping waiver of immunity \u2014 the strict-construction rule poses a grave threat to effectuation of congressional purpose, and hence it should not be and is not applied. In such eases, courts interpret the waiver according to the plain and ordinary meaning of its language. The strict construction rule does not authorize judges to act as \u201cself-constituted guardian[s] of the Treasury [to] import immunity back into a statute designed to limit it.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1559-4\">Having determined that the doctrine we invoke constitutes a purposeful as well as an entrenched exception to the strict-construction rule, it remains only to consider whether the interest rule cedes a similar exception in cases involving statutes such as the Title VII section here under scrutiny. We conclude that it does, notwithstanding that almost all decisions articulating the doctrine have done so solely at the expense of the strict-construction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-8\">Apart from the absence of caselaw contradicting or disallowing application of the doctrine in interest-rule cases, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Standard Oil Company v. United </em>States<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> adds weight to the conclusion that the principle of liberal construction applies as much to the interest rule as it does to other manifestations of sovereign immunity. There the Court held the United States liable for interest despite the absence of an express waiver therefor, and solely on the ground that by acting as a private insurer it had without more consented to be treated as a private insurer.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> This rationale bears a close resemblance to that underpinning the exception at issue, thus counseling inclusion of the interest rule within its ambit. We recognize, too, that the interest and strict-construction rules achieve similar objectives within the realm of sovereign immunity. Each operates hand-in-glove with the general rule that the United States cannot be held monetarily liable without its consent. The interest rule ensures that the United States will incur liability for interest only at the will of Congress, while the strict-construction principle operates similarly, though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>more broadly, to curtail judicial extension of governmental liability beyond the range of likely congressional intent. Consequently, just as the stricbconstruction rule is obviated by statutes effecting sweeping waivers of immunity or otherwise equating governmental liability with that of private persons, so do we decline to use the interest rule in the case at bar as an instrument for insertion of unintended qualifications and refinements into an otherwise plain and unambiguous statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-4\">The applicability of this doctrine in interest-rule cases thus established, we must, finally, determine whether the statutory provision upon which the District Court grounded its assessment of the disputed attorneys\u2019 fee against the United States fits within the confines of the exception, and we hold that it does. When Congress declared that \u201cthe United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person,\u201d it revealed unmistakably its intention to subject the United States to treatment no different from that accorded private parties in equivalent circumstances. Title VII\u2019s attorneys\u2019-fee provision thus measures the waiver of immunity in terms essentially identical to those in statutes already held to be governed by the doctrine.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> We conclude, as a result, that the contours of this mandate must be delineated by ordinary and reasonable, not express or strict, judicial construction. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-10\">Under such an interpretation, we think it manifest that the attorneys\u2019-fee section implements the overarching congressional purpose to accord \u201c \u2018[ajggrieved [federal] employees or applicants ... the full rights available in the courts as are granted to individuals in the private sector under title VII.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Since claimants in private-sector Title VII cases may garner interest as one component of an attorneys\u2019-fee award \u2014 itself defined as a part of \u201ccosts\u201d <footnotemark>119</footnotemark> \u2014 we cannot sanction a variant doctrine of liability for the United States. We find that the District Court did not err when it fashioned an assessment of interest against the United States.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1560-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-12\">We affirm, on the alternative grounds explicated, the District Court\u2019s decision to allow a 30 percent upward adjustment in the lodestar to compensate counsel for the delay in receipt of payment for the legal services he rendered under Title VII. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>modify the court\u2019s order to correct a mathematical error in its computation of the lodestar,<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> and remand solely in order that the court may confirm that Shaw\u2019s counsel is not being paid twice for the delay he experienced.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> If, in calculating the lodestar for counsel\u2019s services, the court utilized an hourly rate which reflected a reasonable charge to clients who pay their attorneys when billed, the court\u2019s order as modified will stand, and the Library must remit to counsel $2,524.50, the portion of the court\u2019s attorneys\u2019-fee award contested on appeal.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> If, instead, the lodestar was based on a reasonable hourly rate for services rendered under a fee-shifting statute, that rate has already taken into account the pecuniary disadvantage resulting from the lengthy wait for payment, and the court\u2019s upward adjustment to the lodestar therefore was inappropriate since it would result in double payment for the delay in receiving his money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1546-11\">.

Op. at 1, 4-5. This distinction apparently takes on dispositive significance. We note that any prospectivity here is fictional, for an award under a fee-shifting statute benefiting' only a party prevailing in litigation can never be made prospectively. More importantly, we cannot see why the moment in time at or as of which compensation for delayed receipt of payment is calculated should matter; for us, it is the <em>reason </em>why the fee is adjusted upward that is vital. Addition of a delay factor to the lodestar serves only to compensate the attorney for loss of the use of earned money from the time of rendition of services to the time of receipt of the fee. See text <em>supra </em>at note 28, quoting <em>Copeland v. Marshall, supra </em>note 2, 205 U.S.App.D.C. at 403, 641 F.2d at 893. The dissent itself, in distinguishing the delay factor from interest, characterizes the delay factor thus: \"an attorney embarking on services for which he or she anticipates payment ultimately, but not promptly, may factor in the expected delay.\u201d Dis. Op. at 1. By this we can only assume that our colleague means that the increase is to compensate for a supposed possibility of delayed payment, and consequently for deprivation of the use of the fee money during the period of delay. We are unable to distinguish between that and compensation for the use, forbearance or detention of money \u2014 the common understanding of interest. If the delay factor sounds like interest, acts like interest and, most of all, compensates exactly as interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>would, we feel constrained to treat it as interest for purposes of the sovereign-immunity rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b1551-10\">.

Most of the cases invoking the interest rule to disallow interest against the United States have done so with respect to two types of statutes.

This proposition is further buttressed by the many decisions relaxing the standard of strict construction traditional under the sovereign-immunity doctrine in cases involving federal instrumentalities statutorily authorized \"to sue and be sued.\u201d The Supreme Court has sustained this departure from the doctrine at least partly in the view that the United States, when acting as an ordinary person or businessman, should be amenable to the normal incidents of litigation as a private party would be. See <em>Standard Oil Co. v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 76, 79, 45 S.Ct. 211, 212, 69 L.Ed. 519, 521 (1925). The Court has endorsed this exception even as applied to corporations or instrumentalities not explicitly empowered to sue and be sued, see <em>Keifer &amp; Keifer v. Reconstruction Fin. Corp., </em>306 U.S. 381, 389, 59 S.Ct. 516, 518, 83 L.Ed. 784, 789 (1939), and has relied upon such authorization, when it has existed, as support for its conclusion that Congress intended that the governmental entity be treated as if a private party. See <em>FHA v. Burr, </em>309 U.S. 242, 245, 60 S.Ct. 488, 490, 84 L.Ed. 724, 728-729 (1940). As the Court has noted, \"the unqualified authority to sue and be sued placed [the Government] upon an equal footing with private parties as to the usual incidents of suits in relation to the payment of costs and allowances.\" <em>Reconstruction Fin. Corp. v. J.G. Menihan Corp., </em>312 U.S. 81, 85-86, 61 S.Ct. 485, 487, 85 L.Ed. 595, 598 (1941). For these reasons, the Court has discarded the rigorous standards of the sovereign-immunity doctrine and admonished that such an authorization is to be \"liberally construed.\" <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>309 U.S. 495, 501, 60 S.Ct. 659, 661, 84 L.Ed. 888, 892 (1940). The proposition for which these cases stand is that a federal entity, intended by Congress to act or be treated as a private party, should be subject to all of the ordinary incidents of litigation pursuant to a broad construction of the relevant statutory waiver of immunity from suit. Especially in light of the Court\u2019s extension of governmental liability to include an award of interest, see <em>Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra, </em>we are convinced that this line of precedent strongly supports our decision to construe the Title VII provision here at issue according to the plain and ordinary meaning of its language. See text <em>infra </em>at notes 118-120.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"112\">\n<p id=\"b1559-5\">. Cf. <em>United States v.

See text <em>supra </em>at notes 61-74; see also <em>Navajo Tribe v. United States, supra </em>note 75, 586 F.2d at 200-201. Several courts have so framed the strict-construction requirement complementing the interest rule that only an extension of governmental liability beyond the plain and literal language of the authorizing statute is proscribed. E.g., <em>Price v. United States, </em>174 U.S. 373, 375-376, 19 S.Ct. 765, 766, 43 L.Ed. 1011, 1013 (1899). In other cases, often involving the interest rule, disallowance of governmental liability was attributable to a reluctance to read a specific basis of liability into vague or general statutory language. E.g., <em>Blake v. Califano, supra </em>note 32, 200 U.S.App.D.C. at 30, 626 F.2d at 894. These separate lines of cases, abjuring both liberal judicial construction of unclear statutory provisions and judicial extension of liability beyond the plain boundaries of statutory language, are both aspects of the more general policy of containing assessments of governmental liability not already marked out by legislative action. Neither, however, mandates reversal of the order on appeal. See note 42 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"114\">\n<p id=\"b1559-10\">. <em>Indian Towing Co. v.

See note 46 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"120\">\n<p id=\"b1560-8\">. Our dissenting colleague says that our holding creates a statutory anomaly by treating Title VII lawyers better than their federal-sector clients inasmuch as interest would be payable as part of attorneys\u2019-fee awards but, under <em>Blake v. Califano, supra </em>note 32, not on backpay awards. See Dis.Op. at 6. We find this argument unpersuasive for several reasons. First, we cannot treat the interests of Title VII lawyers and clients as anything other than mutually dependent. Our holding ensures that Title VII claimants will better be able to compete for the time and energies of more experienced counsel, <em>Copeland v. Marshall, supra </em>note 2, 205 U.S.App.D.C. at 405, 641 F.2d at 895, and thus furthers the interests of clients in the most effective representation on their claims. Second, the supposed anomaly is attributable to the interest rule itself and its diverse operation in the context of the statute, a problem which Congress apparently did not anticipate. Lastly, a different holding would create its own anomaly \u2014 that private-sector clients, whose lawyers can obtain interest adjustments to lodestar amounts, see note 46 <em>supra, </em>would receive better treatment than federal-sector clients, a result clearly at odds with the fundamental objective of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 to establish parity between federal and private-sector employees. See <em>Chandler v. Roudebush, supra </em>note 118, 425 U.S. at 841, 96 S.Ct. at 1949, 48 L.Ed.2d at 420 (quoting S.Rep. No. 415, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1971)). It would seem strange indeed to wield the interest rule in contravention of a natural reading of the attorneys\u2019 fee section simply to ensure that interest is defeated equally for attorneys\u2019 fees as for back-pay-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"121\">\n<p id=\"b1561-8\">.

Furthermore, I believe today\u2019s decision will confound, not assist, district court judges as they labor to fathom and follow this court\u2019s proliferating instructions regarding allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees against the United States. I therefore dissent from the majority\u2019s position on the government\u2019s liability for interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-7\">On September 9, 1982, when we heard oral argument on appeal, we faced, and our charge was to reconcile, two not fully consistent lines of decision. One line, long-established, forbids the award of pre- or post-judgment interest payable by the United States, absent deliberate waiver by Congress of the sovereign\u2019s immunity. <em>See Holly v. Chasen, </em>639 F.2d 795 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 822, 102 S.Ct. 107, 70 L.Ed.2d 94 (1981); <em>Blake v. Califano, </em>626 F.2d 891 (D.C.Cir.1980), and decisions cited therein. The other, newer line contemplates an adjustment for delay in receipt of payment when counsel fees are awarded, pursuant to statute, as part of costs. <em>See Copeland v. Marshall, </em>641 F.2d 880, 893, 906 n. 61 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc); <em>National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense, </em>675 F.2d 1319, 1328-29 (D.C.Cir.1982). The difference between interest and a delay factor can be more than semantic. Interest, as that term is commonly used, is calculated retrospectively, at the completion of the period during which it accrues. A delay factor, as <em>Copeland </em>suggests, may figure as a contingency adjustment, applied prospectively to the lodestar. Just as an attorney setting an hourly rate in a contingent fee case may factor in the risk that the cause may not prevail, so too an attorney embarking on services for which he or she anticipates payment ultimately, but not promptly, may factor in the expected delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-13\">When a statute provides for payment of an attorney\u2019s fee by a private sector defendant, there is no need to grapple with delay in payment as a factor distinct from interest, for private defendants are not immune from the payment of pre- or post-judgment interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the sovereign is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>the payor, however, precedent we are not at liberty to upset demands disallowance of interest add-ons unless Congress otherwise orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-4\">Recently,- in <em>Murray v. Weinberger, </em>741 F.2d 1423, at 1432-1434 (D.C.Cir.1984), a panel of this court attempted to chart a course between the interest-is impermissible/delay-factor-is-permissible lines of decision. <em>Murray, </em>argued on April 13, 1984, intercepted the instant case; it appeared to provide definitive instructions on the two inquiries the district court should make in ruling upon a request for a fee award adjustment to account for delay in payment. Under <em>Murray, </em>the court must determine first whether the rate incorporated in the lodestar already takes into account an anticipated time lag between rendition of services and receipt of payment. Second, if \u201cthe reasonable hourly rate incorporated into the lodestar did not reflect an increment for the expected delay in payment,\u201d the court should next inquire \u201cwhether recalculation of the lodestar utilizing current, market rates instead of historic rates, is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1433. I do not find in the statute before us, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) (1982), the conscious waiver of sovereign immunity entrenched decisional law contemplates. <em>See, e.g., Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>462 U.S. 680, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 3277, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983), <em>cited in Nichols v. Pierce, </em>740 F.2d 1249, 1256 nn. 38, 42 (D.C.Cir.1984) (courts must take care not to enlarge waiver of sovreign immunity beyond what language of statute requires); <em>In re: Hamilton Jordan, </em>745 F.2d 1574, at 1576 (D.C.Cir. Indep.Couns. Div. Oct. 16, 1984); <em>Phillips v. United States, </em>346 F.2d 999, 1000 (2d Cir.1965) (\u201cspirit proper to judicial consideration\u201d of alleged sovereign immunity waiver \u201cis not one of generosity and broad interpretation\u201d). I would therefore adhere to the letter of the <em>Murray </em>instructions and reject the large, \u201cinterest is permissible,\u201d postscript the majority, espouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-8\">Although Congress has not provided for an interest add-on, and precedent does not place me at liberty to read into the statute an instruction or waiver Congress might have included had it thought about the matter, I am also bound by the more recent decisional line \u2014 opinions permitting delay factor supplementation of an attorney\u2019s fee, even when the fee is payable by the sovereign. Our recent <em>Murray </em>opinion relieves me of the- reconciliation task confronting the panel when this appeal was new. The adjustment <em>Murray </em>permits serves the \u201cimportant objective\u201d of \u201c[ejase of administration,\u201d <em>Murray, </em>at 1433, and promises to simplify, not complicate, the chore we commit to the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would not go beyond <em>Murray </em>without a direction to do so from Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-9\">I. The No-Interest Rule</p>\n<p id=\"A_3\">Nothing in the majority\u2019s labyrinthian opinion genuinely demonstrates that Congress so much as adverted to the no-interest rule when it enacted .the statute in question. For all its intricacy, the majority opinion builds on a hunch: if Congress had adverted to the matter, it would have (or should have) waived immunity. I sympathize with the policy judgment the majority advances. But I cannot agree that the legislature \u201cplainly\u201d resolved an immunity waiver issue never even framed in the course of its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-10\">The delay calculation made by the district court, as the majority holds, was an interest computation. The district court applied a 10% per annum rate to the base award, determined that three years would separate the time when the fee should have been paid and its actual payment, and increased the award accordingly. This calculation resembles in all relevant respects the one our court disapproved in <em>Holly v. Chasen</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case the interest rate em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>ployed was 6%, and the term over which interest was to accrue was indefinite, running from the judgment date to the date of payment. But the differences in the interest rates (10% versus 6%) and in the terms to which they were applied (three years versus an open-ended period) are not sufficient grounds for typing the award here as something other than interest. In both cases, augmentation of the award involved a <em>retrospective </em>calculation that placed upon the government the cost of an actual delay. A calculation of this order, by any name, is inescapably in the nature of \u201cinterest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-5\">Contemporary conditions and equitable considerations cast doubt on the soundness of the no-interest rule governing judgments against the United States. The majority\u2019s painstakingly embroidered opinion is comprehensible only as a labor sparked by that doubt. This circuit recently has stated, however, that the entrenched character of the no-interest rule militates against alteration by the judiciary. Our court has maintained that change, in view of the long-prevailing, rigorously-applied rule, lies within the province of Congress. <em>See Holly v. Chasen, </em>639 F.2d at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-6\">In <em>Blake v. Califano, </em>we ruled that a Title VII back pay award against the government may not be augmented by prejudgment interest. .Similarly, the <em>Holly </em>court held that interest may not be added to an attorney\u2019s fee payable by the United States pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E) (1982). Both decisions underscore that waiver of the no-interest rule \u201ccannot be by implication or by use of ambiguous language,\u201d <em>Holly v. Chasen, </em>639 F.2d at 797; Congress, we have emphasized, must signal the authorization advertently and with clarity. <em>See Blake v. Califano, </em>626 F.2d at 894-95 &amp; n. 7.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Invited to reconsider <em>Blake </em>and allow a Title VII plaintiff to recover pre-judgment interest on a back pay award against the federal government, we adhered to our prior holding and stated: \u201cWhen Congress amended Title VII in 1972 to bring the federal government under its provisions, Congress evinced no intention to waive sovereign immunity as to interest awards.\u201d <em>Segar v. Smith, </em>738 F.2d 1249, at 1296 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-9\">Taken together, <em>Blake, Segar, </em>and today\u2019s decision announce that Congress distinguished sharply and consciously between attorneys for Title VII litigants against government defendants, and the litigants themselves, the actual victims of discrimination. An interest calculation can augment the attorney\u2019s fees, but not the client\u2019s recovery. The majority attributes this unusual design to Congress because it was the legislature\u2019s \u201coverarching ... purpose\u201d to accord aggrieved federal employees the full Title VII rights available to individuals in the private sector. Majority opinion at 1484. The right .available to individuals in the private sector to claim interest on back pay awards, however, cannot be secured to federal employees in cases brought in this circuit without overruling <em>Blake, </em>and now the relevant <em>Segar </em>holding as well. The majority thus settles for second best. It leaves the litigant without interest, takes care of the lawyer only, and pretends interest for the lawyer is in full harmony with <em>Blake </em>and <em>Segar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1563-10\">Client and lawyer are on the same footing vis-a-vis interest on Title VII awards in private sector employment, the majority concedes. A Congress that thought about the problem at all, I believe, would have placed client and lawyer on the same footing as to interest awards in the federal sector as well. Though the majority strives mightily, it cannot convincingly explain why Congress would deliberately opt to treat awards to clients and lawyers differently by allowing lawyers, but not clients, to collect interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>The statute before us authorizes \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d as part of costs, and provides that the United States \u201cshall be liable for costs the same as a private person.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) (1982). The majority holds that the United States has thereby waived not only its immunity as to <em>costs </em>(in this instance, including attorneys\u2019 fees) for which Congress made express provision, but also, <em>sub silentio, </em>its immunity as to <em>interest on those costs.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cCosts,\u201d as treated in the majority\u2019s opinion, are thus accorded a uniquely expansive interpretation. It is established, for example, that a waiver of immunity with respect to a monetary award for discrimination in employment is not a waiver with respect to interest on that award. <em>Blake v. Califano. </em>Similarly, a waiver of immunity with respect to liability on a contract is not a waiver with respect to interest on that liability. <em>Eastern Service Management Co. v. United States, </em>363 F.2d 729, 733 (4th Cir.1966); <em>Economy Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. United States, </em>470 F.2d 585 (Ct.Cl.1972). And in the adjustment of mutual claims, the government is entitled to interest on amounts owed to it, but is not obligated to pay interest on amounts it owes. <em>United States v. North American Transportation &amp; Trading Co., </em>253 U.S. 330, 336, 40 S.Ct. 518, 521, 64 L.Ed. 935 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-4\">Enlarging an immunity waiver with respect to \u201ccosts\u201d to include interest on costs draws on nothing inherent in the concept of \u201ccosts.\u201d \u201cCosts\u201d is a term of specific and narrow content; in federal adjudication, the word \u201ccosts\u201d has never been understood to include any interest component. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 (1982); <em>see also </em>10 C.

Its availability depends on the substantive law (state or federal( that governs the controversy. <em>See General Motors Corp. v.

I therefore fail to spy in a statute allowing \u201ccosts\u201d and specifically qualifying an attorney\u2019s fee as part of \u201ccosts,\u201d a clear, affirmative intention by Congress to displace the traditional principle that the sovereign is immune from the payment of interest on those costs. <em>Cf. Parker v. Lewis, </em>670 F.2d 249, 250 (D.C.Cir.1982) (Title VII attorneys\u2019 fee awards against Secretary of Transportation should be determined with expedition because Secretary, \u201cas an officer of the government, cannot be charged with interest\u201d) (citing <em>Holly v. Chasen).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1564-7\">The majority maintains most insistently that in rendering the United States liable for costs (including attorneys\u2019 fees) \u201cthe same as a private person,\u201d Congress unquestionably intended to waive the sovereign\u2019s immunity with respect to interest on costs. <em>But see Arvin v.

The terse statutory phrase (\u201cthe same as a private person\u201d) on which the majority dominantly relies, coupled with sporadic and laconic judicial precedent in private sector cases,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> simply do not add up to the deliberate waiver of sovereign immunity that prior decisions emphatically require.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Cf.

And see <em>Parker v. Lewis, supra, </em>p. 1473. In truth, we have never focused on the no-interest rule in this context before, because the government did not rely on or even refer to the rule in prior cases.

I now state why I believe the court's August 24, 1984, decision in <em>Murray v. Weinberger </em>renders it unnecessary to do more in this case than remand with directions to follow the instructions supplied in <em>Murray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1566-8\">II. Delay in Payment Instructions in</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-9\">\n<em>Murray v. Weinberger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-10\">In <em>Copeland, Holly, </em>and a few cases thereafter, this court indicated that a delay factor adjustment to the lodestar may be appropriate, even in litigation involving federal government defendants. The court stated in <em>Copeland: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>641 F.2d at 893; <em>see also id. </em>at 906 n. 61.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Along similar lines, the court in <em>Holly, </em>after rejecting an interest award, said: \u201cWe suggest ... that the possibility of a substantial delay in the payment of a fee is a factor which counsel may wish to bring to the court\u2019s attention when submitting his application for compensation.\u201d 639 F.2d at 798. Quoting the <em>Copeland </em>language set out above, the <em>Murray </em>panel instructed the district court that delay could be taken into account in either of two ways. <em>Murray, </em>at 1432-1434. Significantly, neither way involved the interest calculation eschewed in <em>Holly </em>but approved by my colleagues in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>The delay in receipt of payment for services rendered is an additional factor that may be incorporated into a contingency adjustment. The hourly rates used in the \u201clodestar\u201d represent the prevailing rate for clients who typically pay their bills promptly. Court-awarded fees normally are received long after the legal services are rendered. That delay can present cash-flow problems for the attorneys. In any event, payment today for services rendered long in the past deprives the eventual recipient of the value of the use of the money in the meantime, which use, particularly in an inflationary era, is valuable. A percentage adjustment to reflect the delay in receipt of payment therefore may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>I reiterate here <em>Murray\u2019s </em>two instructions, starting with the one the <em>Murray </em>panel labeled \u201c[fjirst.\u201d The court in <em>Murray </em>explained that if the expected wait for payment \u201cis reflected in the lodestar figure itself, an additional enhancement for delay would not be appropriate\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-6\">First, the court should determine whether the hourly rates incorporated into the lodestar ... contain [delay] increments ____ The basic hourly rate used in the lodestar figure [in Murray] was the rate prevailing in Title VII litigation, where lengthy delays often attend the payment of attorney\u2019s fees____ According to the fee applicants\u2019 affidavits ..., the attorneys\u2019 hourly rates for billing concurrently ... were substantially lower than the rates they charged pursuant to awards for attorney\u2019s fees under fee-. shifting statutes, where lengthy delays are typically expected____ Thus the lodestar figures may already include adjustments for delay in payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1567-11\"><em>Murray, </em>at 1432-1433 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-12\">Only when the basic hourly rate incorporated into the lodestar did not \u201cinclude[ ] a component for the delay which would have been expected in the payment of fees,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1433, does <em>Murray </em>authorize a further inquiry. With an eye on the \u201cpressing need for simple rules in attorney\u2019s fee cases,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1433, the <em>Murray </em>court countenanced use of \u201ccurrent market rates instead of historic rates\u201d in calculating lodestars, <em>id., </em>if that would produce a reasonable fee \u201cwithout generating a windfall for the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1433. There the matter would end under <em>Murray v. Weinberger, </em>for \u201cwhere the hourly rate used in computing the lodestar is based on present hourly rates a delay factor has implicitly been recognized and no [further] adjustment for delay should be allowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense, </em>675 F.2d at 1329).</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-15\">III. Application of <em>Murray </em>to the Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-16\">In calculating the fee for Shaw\u2019s attorney Shalon Ralph, the district court, for the most part, followed the formula this court specified in <em>Copeland. </em>The district court first computed a lodestar of time and rate. It found that ninety-nine hours of Ralph\u2019s effort could be attributed to issues on which Shaw succeeded. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940-41, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (where plaintiff achieves only partial success, fee awarded must exclude compensation for services rendered in connection with any unsuccessful claim). It then determined that an $85 hourly rate was appropriate for an attorney of Ralph\u2019s experience working on problems of employment discrimination in 1978 and 1979.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>not consider, however, as <em>Murray </em>now requires, whether the $85 rate prevailed for clients who paid their bills promptly or whether it \u201cincluded a component for the delay which would have been expected in the payment of fees\u201d in cases of this genre. <em>Murray, </em>at 1432; <em>see id. </em>at 1428 n. 21, 1433 n. 46 (lodestar rates of $80 to $95 per hour for 1978 to 1981 may have included a delay element where attorney billed plaintiff $50 per hour at time services were rendered); <em>cf. </em>majority opinion note 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-4\">Next, the district court determined that the lodestar should be reduced by 20% because the court judged the representation only 80% efficient. Correctly anticipating in this regard guidance our court just supplied in <em>Murray, </em>the district court declined to make any upward adjustment for the risk Ralph assumed by taking on a case in which part of the fee was contingent on victory.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Murray, </em>at 1430-1432 (upward adjustment for risk of losing on merits is unwarranted to the extent that lodestar itself comprehended allowance for contingent nature of fee payment; or fee arrangement with client substantially reduced attorney\u2019s risk of nonpayment; or risk of not prevailing was unexceptional).</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-5\">Finally, the court increased the award to account for the three-year delay between the time Ralph should have been paid and the time he might finally expect payment. The court stated first that the case should have ended in 1978, upon or shortly after execution of the administrative settlement agreement, not in late 1981, after a court proceeding that attentive counsel on both sides might have avoided. Next, the court reasoned that if Ralph had been compensated in 1978 he could have invested the money at an average yield of at least 10%. Therefore, the court announced, its judgment would reflect an upward adjustment of 30% for delay.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That adjustment was an impermissible award of interest. I would instruct the district court, as <em>Murray </em>does, that, <em>if </em>it finds the basic hourly rate did not include a delay component, it may consider whether the use of current market rates might produce a reasonable fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-9\">Augmenting the inquiries <em>Murray </em>prescribed, and limiting the prospect <em>Murray\u2019s </em>plan held for a uniform, manageable approach in the district court, the majority\u2019s opinion seemingly allows anything at all reasonable to go in the name of interest. No particular computation is instructed. Each judge has \u201cbroad latitude\u201d to choose from a range of- rates, concepts, and approaches, running from the simple to the compound, so long as the court\u2019s sizable discretion is not \u201cabused.\u201d <em>See </em>Majority opinion note 22. <em>Murray\u2019s </em>effort to accommodate, not overturn, decisional lines, to promote \u201c[ejase of administration,\u201d and, most of all, to \u201csimplify the task of the district court,\u201d <em>Murray, </em>at 1433, has been undermined by today\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>For the reasons stated, I would return this case to the district court with a direction to follow to the letter the delay in payment analysis and instructions set out in <em>Murray v. Weinberger.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1561-11\">. Private sector decisions, when they adjust for the time of payment, grant interest <em>or </em>a delay factor, but not both. Decisions in private sector cases accepting some type of multiplicative lodestar adjustment to account for delay include: <em>Brown v. Gillette Co., </em>536 F.Supp. 113, 123-24 (D.Mass.1982); <em>Black Gold, Ltd. v. Rockwool Indus., </em>529 F.Supp. 272 (D.Colo.1981); <em>Kennedy v. Lemoi, </em>529 F.Supp. 140, 144-45 (D.R.I.1981). None of these decisions tacked on pre-judgment interest as well. At least one private sector Title VII decision allowed computation of the lodestar using current rather than historical hourly rates and did not otherwise adjust the lodestar for delay. <em>Chrapliwy v.

Nor can I distinguish <em>Holly </em>based on the conduct of the government in the two cases. <em>Holly </em>did not reach the question whether a penalty, computed in the same manner as interest, could be imposed if the government exploited delay deliberately to whittle down an award. Like <em>Holly, </em>the case before us reveals no design to shrink a fee. The district court found the delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>in resolving the back pay controversy unnecessary, but it stated that the time lapse might have been avoided by more effective representation on either side of the case. <em>Shaw v.

Although this case involves only pre-judgment interest, the logic of the majority opinion, riveted on the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) words \u201cthe same as a private party,\" extends to post-judgment interest as well. In Title VII litigation, costs include attorneys\u2019 fees. According to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 (1982), \u201ccosts\u201d are included in the judgment. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (1982), a private defendant is liable for post-judgment interest on the amount of the \"judgment.\u201d In combination, these two provisions render a private defendant liable for post-judgment interest on costs. <em>But cf. infra </em>note 7. If the United States is to be treated precisely as a private defendant, as the majority here argues, it follows that the United States is now exposed to both pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on Title VII attorneys\u2019 fee awards.

An award of costs against the United States is included in the \u201cjudgment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 (1982); payment of costs by the United States is addressed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (1982), which makes reference to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 (1982).

Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>487 F.2d 672 (9th Cir.1973). Furthermore, unlike the Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit apparently does allow interest on costs. <em>See Harris v. Chicago Great Western Ry., </em>197 F.2d 829, 836 (7th Cir.1952). Therefore, even if attorneys\u2019 fees are considered part of the costs rather than part of the judgment, interest on fees is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVqx\"><em>Carpa, Inc. v. Ward Foods, Inc., </em>cited by the <em>Copperweld </em>court for the \"no interest on costs\u201d position, has since been overruled. <em>Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., </em>701 F.2d 542 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc). Either approach, however, supports my position. If costs (including attorneys\u2019 fees) are to be treated for interest purposes in the same way as the underlying monetary award, this circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Blake, supra, </em>reaffirmed in <em>Segar, supra, </em>compels us to deny prejudgment interest on attorneys' fees in Title VII cases. If costs (including attorneys\u2019 fees) are categorized separately and are subject to their own, discrete \"no-interest\u201d rule (a rule sparing even private defendants), as the now-overruled <em>Carpa </em>decision maintained, then it is of no help to appellee to argue that the statute provides for reimbursement \u201cthe same as against a private person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1565-15\">. Nor can I derive from <em>Standard Oil Co. v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 76, 45 S.Ct. 211, 69 L.Ed. 519 (1925), featured in the majority opinion at 31, genuine support for the majority\u2019s view. There, the United States went into the business of insuring vessels against war risks, adopting the form of contract used by private underwriters, and reaping a large profit from the venture. <em>See United States v. Worley, </em>281 U.S. 339, 342, 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>S.Ct. 291, 293, 74 L.Ed. 887 (1930). The High Court soon clarified that <em>Standard Oil </em>was an exceptional case, turning on the commercial character of the insurance business in which the government was engaged, and is not a precedent appropriately extended outside its precise context. <em>United States v. Worley, </em>281 U.S. at 341-44, 50 S.Ct. at 292-94.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1566-6\">. Congress has several times waived the United States' immunity with respect to interest. <em>See, e.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411 (1982) (expressly authorizing prc- and post-judgment interest payable by the United States in tax refund cases); <em>see also </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 (1982), <em>cited in Holly, </em>639 F.2d at 797 as 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 724a (1976) (same statutory section before recodification). These provisions supply obvious models Congress might have followed had it considered waiving the sovereign\u2019s traditional immunity in the situation presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-12\">Elsewhere Congress has reiterated the general rule that interest cannot be allowed against the United States absent <em>express </em>waiver. \"Interest on a claim against the United States shall be allowed in a judgment of the United States Claims Court only under a contract or Act of Congress expressly providing for payment thereof.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516 (1982). \"The United States shall be liable, respecting provisions of [the Federal Tort Claims Act], in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment .\u25a0...\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674 (1982). While the Federal Tort Claims Act refers to state law to supply rules of decision, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1346(b) (law of place where act or omission occurred), it appears that Congress wished to make it unmistakably clear that the traditional federal sovereign immunity rule, not state law, governs pre-judgment interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1567-13\">. The <em>Copeland </em>court noted that a delay factor adjustment may be unwarranted when the hourly rate used in the lodestar \"is based on <em>present </em>hourly rates,\" as distinguished from \"the lesser rates applicable to the time period in which the services were rendered.\u201d <em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 893 n. 23 (emphasis in original); <em>see National Ass\u2019n of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense, </em>675 F.2d 1319, 1329 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>cf. Environmental Defense Fund v. EPA, </em>672 F.2d 42, 60 (D.C.Cir.1982) (limiting lodestar adjustment coupling \"public benefit\u201d and \"delay in receipt of [Toxic Substances Control Act attorneys\u2019 fees]\u201d in part because lodestar was calculated on the basis of current hourly rates). <em>Murray </em>developed Copeland\u2019s exposition of. this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1567-18\">. It is significant that the court determined $85 per hour would have been an appropriate rate in 1978 and 1979 when the work was performed, rather than in late 1981 when the fee was awarded. <em>See supra </em>note 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1568-6\">. A retainer assured Ralph $30 per hour \"win, lose, or draw.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Library of Congress, </em>No. 79-0325, slip op. 9 (D.D.C. Nov. 4, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1568-7\">. The,court declared that the 20% reduction of the lodestar to reflect deficiencies in the quality of representation and the 30% increase for delay yielded a net adjustment upward of 10%. A 20% adjustment down followed by a 30% adjustment up, however, yields a net upward change of only 4% (0.8 X 1.3 == 1.04). The district court might have more closely approached, although not reached, a net upward adjustment of 10% had it contemplated <em>compound </em>interest at 10% per annum <em>(e.g., </em>annual compounding at 10% against a base of 0.8 would equal 1.0648). My point, misperceived in the majority opinion's note 22, is a small one, and surely does not involve any attribution to the district court of a design to \"penalize [ ] counsel.\" I do not suggest that legal doctrine forbids an additive method of computing percentage change or mandates compound interest when additive computation is not employed. I discern in the district court's additive approach to percentage change \u2014 an approach wholly unexplained in the district court\u2019s opinion \u2014 nothing at all complex or subtle. I detect only an unintended \"mathematical mistake,\u201d an oversight no more remarkable than the $20 multiplication error the majority discovered in the district court\u2019s very same calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1568-11\">. In preferring the complex to the simple in styling a solution to a case so modestly presented by the parties, and in precipitating an apparent circuit split, <em>see Arvin v.
