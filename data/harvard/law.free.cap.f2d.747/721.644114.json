That decision reversed an earlier decision of the Utah Public Service Commission (\u201cUtah Commission\u201d) ordering the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railway Company (the \u201cRio Grande\u201d) and the Salt Lake, Garfield and Western Railway Company (the \u201cSalt Lake\u201d) to reduce the tariff on certain intrastate coal movements and to pay reparations for the period from March 28, 1981, onwards. Without applying to the Utah Commission for rehearing, the railroads petitioned the ICC for review of the order \u201con the grounds that the standards and procedures applied by the State Commission were not in accordance with the provisions of ...\u201d the federal statute. Staggers Rail Act of 1980 \u00a7 214(e), 94 Stat. 1895, 1914-15 (1980) (codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(c) (Supp. V 1981)). The Rio Grande and Salt Lake have intervened in support of the ICC, the Utah Commission in support of Utah Power. We hold that the ICC had jurisdiction to review the Utah decision, and uphold the ICC\u2019s reversal of the Utah Commission, but we remand to the ICC to supplement the record on certain cost figures relevant to determining the appropriate rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">The rate at issue in this dispute is that to be charged for the volume movement of bituminous coal by unit train from Valley Camp Mine at Clear Creek, Utah, to Utah Power\u2019s Gadsby Plant at Salt Lake City, Utah. The Rio Grande handles the coal for all of the 118 mile, round trip journey, except for the last half-mile which traverses the tracks of the Salt Lake.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Union Pacific Railroad (UP) provides switching services necessary to connect the other two railroads. The entire movement is intrastate.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">On March 27, 1981, relying on section 229 of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Utah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Power filed separate complaints with the Utah Commission and the ICC. Utah Power alleged that the railroads carrying this coal traffic had market dominance over the transportation of coal from Valcam, Utah to Gadsby, Utah,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the existing applicable rate of $5.97 per ton (Rio Grande Tariff No. 4166) was unreasonably high. Ruling that the Utah Commission had initial jurisdiction over the intrastate rate, the ICC dismissed the complaint filed with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Utah Power pursued its complaint before the Utah Commission, which conducted a full inquiry regarding the rate. The Utah Commission had previously represented to the ICC that it would follow federal standards and procedures in accordance with the Staggers Act, and on this representation the Utah standards and procedures had been <em>provisionally </em>certified by the ICC as acceptable state procedures.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 21, 1982, the Utah Commission issued its Report and Order ruling that the railroads had market dominance over the transportation to which the rates at issue applied, that the Rio Grande was revenue <em>adequate, </em>and that subject rates were unreasonably high. <em>In the Matter of UTAH POWER &amp; LIGHT CO. versus The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co., Union Pacific Railroad Co., and Salt Lake, Garfield and Western Railway Co., </em>No. 83-035-06, <em>Report and Order </em>(Public Service Commission of Utah, Dec. 21, 1982) (hereinafter \u201cUtah Commission Report and Order\u201d) (Joint Appendix (\u201cJA\u201d) 86). The Utah Commission ordered the railroads to reduce the rates and to pay reparations to Utah Power. The decision was to take effect thirty days from the date of service of the decision unless a prior stay was granted. At ho time did any party file an application for rehearing with the Utah Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">On January 14, 1983, the railroads requested the Utah Commission to stay the Order until March 2, 1983. Utah Power opposed the request on the ground that no party had applied for rehearing of the Commission\u2019s decision. On January 19, 1983, the Utah Commission granted the railroad\u2019s requested extension without comment on the rehearing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">On January 19, 1983, the Rio Grande and the Salt Lake petitioned the ICC for review of the Utah Commission\u2019s decision pursuant to \u00a7 214(c) of the Staggers Act, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-14\">Any rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] of chapter 105 of this title may petition the Commission to review the decision of any State authority, in any administrative proceeding in which the lawfulness of an intrastate rate, classification, rule, or practice is determined, on the grounds that the standards and procedures applied' by the State were not in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. The Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>sion shall take final action on any such petition within 30 days after the date it is received. If the Commission determines that the standards and procedures were not in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle, its order shall determine and authorize the carrier to establish the appropriate rate, classification, rule, or practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Staggers Rail Act of 1980 \u00a7 214(c), 94 Stat. 1895, 1914-15 (1980) (codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(c) (Supp. V 1981) (hereinafter section 11501(c)). The Utah Commission moved the ICC to dismiss the petition, arguing that because the Rio Grande and Salt Lake had failed to exhaust their state administrative remedies by petitioning for rehearing before the Utah Commission, the ICC was without jurisdiction to review the decision of the Utah Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">After the initial filing of the railroad\u2019s petition, the ICC requested the Rio Grande and Salt Lake to provide a missing page of an appendix to its petition. After the page was filed, the ICC notified counsel for the railroads that its filing was deemed complete as of January 28, 1983 and that the ICC, being required to take final action within 30 days, would act on the petition by February 25, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In a decision dated February 25, 1983, but not served until March 2, 1983, the ICC affirmed the Utah Commission\u2019s holding of market dominance, reversed its decision on the revenue adequacy of the Rio Grande, and the unreasonableness of the rate, and held that the rates in issue were reasonable. <em>Petition of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. and Salt Lake, Garfield and Western Railway Co. for Review of a Decision of the Public Service Commission of Utah Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11501, </em>No. 39060 (I.C.C. Feb. 25, 1983) (hereinafter \u201cICC Decision\u201d) (J.A. 584). On March 8, 1983, the ICC served the cost appendix to its March 2, 1983 decision (JA 596). In that appendix, the ICC explained its earlier decision to reverse some of the cost findings of the Utah Commission on disputed issues, and to affirm others.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Utah Power then petitioned this court for review of the ICC\u2019s decision on a number of grounds. Petitioner now argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the ICC exercised jurisdiction unlawfully because the railroads had failed to exhaust their state administrative remedies; that the ICC violated its statutory mandate and lost jurisdiction when it allegedly failed to serve its decision within 30 days; that the ICC exceeded its appellate jurisdiction by unlawfully conducting a <em>de novo </em>review of the record compiled before the Utah Commission; and that the ICC\u2019s cost calculations were not supported by substantial evidence and constitute an abuse of discretion. We agree only that some of the cost calculation's are questionable, and thus remand the case to the ICC for a fairly limited re-examination of its determination as to the reasonableness- of the railroads\u2019 existing rate. Otherwise we affirm the decision of the ICC. In particular, we hold that the Utah Commission\u2019s decision was properly overturned for its failure to follow federal standards on revenue adequacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">II. Threshold Jurisdictional Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">A. <em>The Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">One \u201clong-settled rule of judicial administration [is] that no one is entitled to <em>judicial </em>relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed <em>administrative </em>remedy has been exhausted.\u201d <em>Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 50-51, 58 S.Ct. 459, 463, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938) (citing cases) (emphasis added); <em>see Porter v. Investors Syndicate, </em>286 U.S. 461, 471, 52 S.Ct. 617, 620, 76 L.Ed. 1226 (1932). Utah Power here seeks to invoke this rule and thus to deny jurisdictional legitimacy to the railroads\u2019 resort to the ICC. The ICC maintains that it had an \u2022adequate jurisdictional foundation for its review of the Utah decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">1. <em>The Staggers Act Certification Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">On the exhaustion issue, we have great difficulty with the ICC\u2019s sweeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>assertion in this case that federal preemption completely forecloses any necessity of the ICC giving consideration to a state rehearing requirement. We do not conclude that federal preemption in the Staggers Act can be extended to such limits. Rehearing is a normal feature of administrative action\u2019 and when properly applied for, and responded to, can work to substantially reduce subsequent litigation. We do not interpret the Staggers Act as ruling out all necessity to apply for rehearing in state cases. In the course of enacting the Staggers Act, Congress expressly rejected a sweeping federal preemption of the state regulatory role. Such preemption was originally provided for in the bill that became the Staggers Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but the attempt to oust the states completely from some regulatory role in intrastate rates was defeated. Instead, a compromise resulted which guaranteed that \u201c[ijntrastate rail movements [in most cases] will continue to be regulated by state regulatory agencies with uniformity and consistency.\u201d 126 Cong.Rec. H8548 (daily ed. Sept. 9, 1980) (statement by Rep. Staggers). Rehearing is a normal, though not universal, feature of such state regulation. The legislative compromise was recorded in the Conference Report: \u201cstates may only regulate in these areas if they are certified under the procedures of [section 11501].\u201d H.Rep. No. 96-1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 106 (conference), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3978, 4110, 4138. Thus, the states\u2019 authority to regulate depends upon ICC certification of their regulatory procedures \u2014 which might include rehearing procedures \u2014 in order to ensure that federal standards established by and in accordance with the Staggers Act will be applied uniformly in determining intrastate rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">We also reject the attempt by the ICC to find some support for its assumption of jurisdiction purely on the fact that \u201cUtah\u2019s intrastate rate regulation has been only <em>provisionally </em>certified.\u201d ICC Brief at 27 (emphasis in the original). This contention simply does not wash. In so contending the ICC attempts to inflate the scope of its own discretionary authority to a degree wholly unsupported by the Staggers Act. First of all, the Act does not provide explicit authority for a <em>provisional </em>certification. The purpose of the ICC in \u201cprovisionally\u201d certifying was to act timely in order to bring complying states immediately under federal jurisdiction on intrastate rates, in the meantime depriving the state agencies of some of the benefits of a final certification by leaving open the capability of the ICC subsequently to reject certification if it should finally determine that the State Commission\u2019s standards and procedures were deficient. In the interim, though, the State Commission\u2019s standards and procedures must be considered to have been \u201ccertified.\u201d A provisional certification is still a certification. It is <em>not </em>a partial certification. We find the conditional certification of the Utah standards and procedures to be valid. <em>See Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Co. v. ICC, </em>720 F.2d 958, 962 (7th Cir.1983). The ICC in so acting was filling a void in the Staggers Act which permitted the agencies involved to carry out its basic intent and purpose that intrastate rail operations would conform to federal standards and procedures. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Finally, we must reject the ICC\u2019s view of the certification process. The ICC appears to assert that even if it had certified an express rehearing petition requirement, it could nevertheless ignore a party\u2019s failure to comply with such a requirement, as any other course \u201cwould render review of certified states\u2019 procedures in individual appeals impossible.\u201d ICC Brief at 27-28. We disagree that ICC review under such circumstances would become impossible. Because we hold, <em>infra, </em>that in the circumstances of this case the ICC was justified in exercising jurisdiction under section 11501(c), it is not necessary to address further the ICC\u2019s contention that it could ignore such a rehearing requirement if it were clearly stated and subsequently certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>2. <em>The Exhaustion Requirement in the Staggers Act Setting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In many cases administrative remedies must be exhausted if litigants are to gain judicial review in federal courts, although that is not a hard and fast rule, even for review by <em>courts. </em>In any event, however, and contrary to the contentions of Utah Power, exhaustion by rehearing is not required in this case. We find several reasons for concluding that the railroads were not compelled to exhaust the state agency rehearing option prior to seeking ICC review.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">First, to the extent that local law controls the issue, the Utah statute does not impose any firm exhaustion requirement. The applicable Utah statute, Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 54-7-15 (1953) as amended,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Rule 19<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Utah Commission indicate that those rehearing provisions are only a prerequisite for further <em>court </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">First, the topical heading of the statute so states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">\n<em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 54-7-15:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">Review or rehearing by commission \u2014 Application \u2014 Procedure\u2014Prerequisite to court action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">1981 Utah Laws 1126, 1132, ch. 215, \u00a7 5. The topical heading \u201c[prerequisite to <em>court action \u201d </em>(emphasis added) indicates the intent of the legislature, because the heading was part of the Act as enacted by the Utah Legislature and was <em>not </em>inserted by the revisor, codifier, or publisher. <em>See id. </em>Consistently, the body of the.Utah statute also refers to <em>court action. See supra, </em>n. 7. A \u201clegal action\u201d most frequently refers to a suit in court. At best \u201clegal action\u201d is ambiguous; interpreting it in line with the topical heading and the express reference to proceedings \u201cin any court,\u201d we conclude that the Utah Act relates the rehearing only to subsequent \u201ccourt actionfs].\u201d Quite obviously, an ICC proceeding is not a \u201ccourt action.\u201d Also, the Utah statute is permissive rather than mandatory, providing that a party affected by an order of the Commission <em>\u201cmay </em>apply [to the Utah Commission] for review or rehearing.\u201d In addition, failure timely to apply for rehearing does not, under decisional Utah law, preclude a subsequent administrative proceeding that makes a <em>substantive </em>attack on a Commission decision. <em>Bowen Trucking, Inc. v. Public Service Commission, </em>559 P.2d 954, 956 (Utah 1977) <em>(citing Sale v. Railroad Commission, </em>15 Cal.2d 612, 104 P.2d 38, 40-41 (1940)). The terms of the Utah statute thus do not require an application for rehearing as an absolute precondition <em>even </em>to <em>state administrative </em>proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-18\">Nor does Rule 19<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Rules of Practice of the Utah Commission create the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>asserted exhaustion requirement. The relevant subsections of the Rule only provide <em>time limits </em>for filing rehearing petitions with the Utah Commission and petitions for writs of certiorari to the Utah Supreme Court. Such petitions control access to the Utah Supreme Court, not the ICC. In addition, consistent with the Utah statute, the Utah Commission\u2019s topical heading to subsection (f) of the Rule is entitled \u201cJudicial Review.\u201d In sum, neither the Utah Legislature in the Act, nor the Utah Commission in its regulations, ever intended to prescribe the jurisdiction of the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Furthermore, it is important to recognize that Utah has only such limited <em>authority </em>to limit the jurisdiction of the federal Commission as the Staggers Act may attach to its statutory and regulatory procedures. While in some instances the Utah statutes and agency rules might be construed under federal law to lead to circumstances in which the ICC might refuse to take jurisdiction, that jurisdiction in the last analysis is dependent on federal statutes, regulations and decisional law. Under federal law and the ICC\u2019s practice, petitioners to the ICC from decisions of state agencies are not necessarily required to exhaust state administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">On the applicability of exhaustion here, Utah Power is confused. When a party in federal court seeks <em>judicial </em>review of the decision of an <em>administrative </em>agency it is well established, subject to some exceptions, that the party must generally exhaust any administrative remedy available to it. <em>See, e.g., Myers v. Bethlehem Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 50-52, 58 S.Ct. 459, 463-465, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938) (citing cases). This rule has been applied to attempts to invoke the powers of the <em>courts </em>against state administrative agencies from early on. <em>See Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railway Co. v. Board of Public Works, </em>172 U.S. 32, 38, 19 S.Ct. 90, 92, 43 L.Ed. 354 (1898). The requirement originated out of considerations of equity jurisdiction, in which the party seeking an injunction against the decision of a state agency without availing himself of an opportunity to apply for rehearing was deemed to have an adequate remedy at law: \u201cNo court of equity will ... allow its injunction to issue [unless the petitioner] has no adequate remedy by the ordinary processes of the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">In contradistinction, though, when an affected party attempts to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal <em>administrative </em>agency to review a decision of a state <em>administrative </em>agency the same limitations stemming from the limits on a <em>court\u2019s </em>equity jurisdiction or authority are not applicable in the absence of statute, regulation, or decisional law. In such cases, the jurisdiction of the federal agency, and thus the application of the exhaustion doctrine, turn on the particular statute and its legislative history. In cases where the statute, or regulations thereunder, do not require exhaustion, courts may look to the statutory role of the state agency and tailor the exhaustion rule to fit the role assigned to that state agency. <em>See Patsy v. Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 502 n. 4, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 2561 n. 4, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982); <em>State of Texas v. United States, </em>730 F.2d 409, 414 (5th Cir.1984) (ICC review under section 11501(c) of the Staggers Act not limited to final decisions of state agencies).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">The applicable federal statute here provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-10\">Any rail carrier ... may petition the [ICC] to review the decision of any State authority, in <em>any </em>administrative proceeding in which the lawfulness of an intrastate rate ... is determined, on the grounds that the standards and procedures applied by the State were not in accordance with the provisions of [the Staggers Act].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(c) (emphasis added). The decision of the Utah, Commission is a decision of a \u201cstate authority,\u201d and the Rio Grande seeks ICC review of that decision without having applied for rehearing. The federal statute does not specifically limit the jurisdiction of the ICC to final decisions of state agencies or require exhaustion of administrative remedies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Exhausting available rehearing options would often be consistent with sound administration, would in many instances avoid unnecessary litigation, would allow deference to state administrative expertise, and would recognize administrative autonomy in proper cases. Nothing in the Staggers Act, however, specifically requires complete exhaustion of available state administrative rehearing remedies as a precondition to ICC review, and the ICC itself has imposed no such requirement. <em>See State of Texas, supra, </em>730 F.2d at 409. In our view, any overly rigid exhaustion requirement would be sharply inconsistent with one of the central purposes of the Staggers Act \u2014 facilitating swift federal review of <em>final </em>decisions by state commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">While the ICC may in some cases apply reasonable exhaustion requirements, we cannot fault its decision to review this state administrative decision as presented. The extensive consideration of the issues by the Utah Commission, and the vigorous defense before this court by the Utah Commission of- its very detailed decision, adopting all the arguments advanced by Utah Power,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> indicate that any request for rehearing would be denied. This case thus comes within the well-recognized exception</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">to the exhaustion requirement that does not require a party to engage in a futile proceeding. Where application for rehearing is a mere formality in an administrative proceeding, judicial relief may be sought without exhausting such procedure if the order challenged is definitive and deals with the merits in controversy. <em>Levers v. Anderson, </em>326 U.S. 219, 66 S.Ct. 72, 90 L.Ed. 26 (1945); <em>see Athlone Industries, Inc. v. Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>707 F.2d 1485, 1488-89 (D.C.Cir.1983) (When the prior position of the agency indicates that an application for rehearing would be futile, it is not necessary to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief); <em>Etelson v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>684 F.2d 918, 923 (D.C.Cir.1982) (Two strong factors supporting a conclusion that a litigant need not exhaust administrative remedies are that a form of his claim was raised before the agency and that \u201cthe agency has demonstrated its disinclination to respond favorably to [the] claim.\u201d). Any administrative purposes favoring exhaustion generally were satisfied here when the Utah Commission considered the matter in extenso, made its ruling, stated the reasons for its decision, and adhered to them without deviation in this proceeding. As in <em>State of Texas, supra, </em>exhaustion here would have been futile and could have served \u201cno useful purpose.\u201d 730 F.2d at 414. In conclusion, Utah Power will not be allowed to exalt what is at best an ambiguous rehearing requirement into an absolute bar to ICC jurisdiction in this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>B. <em>The ICC\u2019s Alleged Delay in Serving its Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The Staggers Act provides that when an appeal from a state agency decision is taken to the ICC, \u201c[t]he Commission shall take final action on any such petition within 30 days after the date it is received.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(c). Utah Power argues that because the <em>date of service </em>was not within 30 days of the filing of the completed petition, that deprived the ICC of the right to decide the merits of the petition. We disagree with the factual assumptions upon which Utah Power bases its contention, and necessarily therefore with its conclusion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>In addition, we could not support such an extreme sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">In this case, the railroads filed an <em>incomplete </em>petition on January 19, 1983. According to the briefs, the incompleteness was corrected by the subsequent filing of one additional page by mail on January 28, 1983. The ICC\u2019s <em>official record </em>indicates it was filed by the railroads, <em>by letter, </em>on \u201c2/2/83\u201d (JA 03). Furthermore, the \u201cRecord before the Utah [Public Service Commission]\u201d was not filed until \u201c2/8/83\u201d (JA 03). The ICC\u2019s decision is <em>dated </em>February 25, 1983, but it was not <em>served </em>until March 2, 1983 (JA 04). Upon these facts, we must concur with the ICC that time did not start to run against the ICC \u00fantil the complete petition was filed, on January 28 at the earliest. It would be folly to start the running of the prescribed time for decision before a complete petition is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">As to when the period <em>ended, </em>Utah Power points to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10327(i) of the Staggers Act, which provides that \u201can action of the Commission ... is final on the date on which it is served ____\u201d In response, the ICC relies on <em>Union Pacific Railroad v.

Appellant urges that the Tenth Circuit case was wrong. Brief for Utah Power at 22. We disagree. We too interpret section 10327(i) only to provide the date when time will start running for the purpose of computing the time limits for rehearing and review.

Delay to that extent is not before us, and we are not disposed to render a curbstone opinion thereon.

The ICC Review of the Utah Commission Proceedings: Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">A. <em>The Standards for ICC Review of State Commission Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUW\">In its central attack on the ICC decision, Utah Power argues that the ICC exceeded the scope of its authority in purportedly conducting a <em>de novo </em>review of the proceedings and decision of the Utah Commission. \u201c[J]ust as a reviewing court whose function is similar to that of the ICC under \u00a7 11501(c) in the sense that both bodies are charged with ensuring that an agency follows the governing statute,\u201d asserts Utah Pow;er, \u201cthe ICC was not intended to act \u2018as though it were conducting a trial <em>de novo.\u2019 New York v. United States, </em>331 U.S. 284, 335 [67 S.Ct. 1207, 1234, 91 L.Ed. 1492] (1947).\u201d Utah Power Brief at 29. In support of its argument, Utah Power seizes on a reference to the ICC\u2019s role under section 11501(c) as \u201cquasi-appellate,\u201d <em>Illinois Central Gulf Railroad v. ICC, </em>702 F.2d 111, 114 (7th Cir.1983), and also relies upon the recent opinion of the Sixth Circuit in <em>Kentucky Utilities Co. v. ICC, </em>721 F.2d 537 (6th Cir.1983). Finally, petitioner contends that because the statute requires completion of ICC review within 30 days, Congress in requiring such prompt deei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>sions could not have intended the ICC to conduct a searching and thorough inquiry of state proceedings and decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The statutory standard of review governing the ICC in this case is set forth in section 11501(c), <em>supra. </em>In authorizing the ICC to review the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the rate, that provision establishes a broad basis for appeal because it permits petitioners to attack <em>any </em>\u201cstandard[] or procedure\u201d applied by the state for noncompliance with the applicable provisions of the Staggers Act. In addition, as the ICC ably points out, Utah Power and the Utah Commission \u201cignore[] the statutory language\u201d which requires that the ICC delve substantially further into the matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">Section 11501(c) does more than direct the ICC to review state decisions to see that the \u201cstandards and procedures\u201d applied are \u201cin accordance with\u201d the federal statute. If the ICC finds that the state applied incorrect \u201cstandards and procedures,\u201d it must also <em>\u201cdetermine ... the appropriate rate\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The ICC obviously could determine that the \u201cappropriate\u201d rate was neither that proposed by the railroad (if the rate were shown to be unreasonably high) nor that ordered by the state (if that &lt;Jid not represent the maximum reasonable rate by the Commission\u2019s standards). This is clearly a fact-based determination. Thus the ICC is not confined to the purely appellate role of reversing a lower tribunal\u2019s rate decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">ICC Brief at 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The exact scope of the ICC\u2019s authority over the decisions of state commissions is not spelled out in the statute. The legislative history leaves little doubt, however, that the ICC was vested with powers to act as broadly as it would have enjoyed had it been the administrative agency of first instance. The Conference Report on the Staggers Act first refers to the House Amendment to section 11501, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">[I]t amends section 11501 by adding new provisions which provide that only State authorities whose standards and procedures have been certified by the Commission may exercise jurisdiction over intrastate rail rates, classifications, rules and practices. Intrastate rail transportation not subject to the jurisdiction of a certified State authority is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. In no event may a State authority exercise jurisdiction over general rate or inflation-based rate increases. Decisions of State authorities may be appealed to the Commission if not in accordance with this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">H.Rep. No. 96-1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 106 (conference), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4110, 4138. The Conference Committee adopted the House amendment in major part and to the congressional intent expressed in section 11501 added this further gloss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">The conference substitute adopts the House amendment, except that the <em>Commission\u2019s power to adjust intrastate rates is retained in the event that actions by certified states impose a burden on interstate commerce. </em>The conferees\u2019 intent is to ensure that the price and service flexibility and revenue adequacy goals of the Act are not undermined by state regulation of rates, practices, etc., which are not in accordance with these goals. Accordingly, the Act preempts state authority over rail rates, classifications, rules and practices. States may only regulate in these areas if they are certified under the procedures of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-12\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">Congress thus vested the ICC with a broad mandate to examine closely the decisions of even certified state agencies. Otherwise, the Commission could be in no position to determine if action by an individual state had imposed a burden on interstate commerce, or whether state regulation of rates or practices had undermined the price, service flexibility, or revenue adequacy goals of the Act. The ICC was given this broad power of oversight in order to guarantee that the nation's railroads would be regulated uniformly by national standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>The Staggers Act regulatory structure can only be properly understood when viewed against the background of the initial attempt in Congress to oust the states from <em>any </em>regulatory role; The resulting compromise guaranteed states that were certified to apply the national standards and regulations that they would have the initial opportunity to engage in intrastate ratemaking. In this case, the ICC\u2019s dismissal of the railroad\u2019s initial petition gave this initial opportunity to the Utah Commission. This first opportunity that resides in the states must be taken seriously by the ICC. When a state agency has acted, however, the authority of the ICC in its reviewing capacity is expansive, bounded only by the limitations of the Staggers Act and the traditional tests of administrative rationality-</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Considerations of judicial deference to the expertise of an administrative agency, which will often stay a court\u2019s hand when reviewing the work of an agency, do not argue strongly here for ICC deference to the state\u2019s expertise. This is a purely statutory matter. Congress was sufficiently convinced of the ICC\u2019s expertise in the area of all rail regulation, intrastate and interstate, to empower the Commission initially to review intrastate rates where a state had either abdicated its authority entirely by opting out of the certification process, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(b)(4)(B),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or had failed to act with sufficient speed, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(d). The deference which the ICC renders to any state regulatory commission will depend upon the state\u2019s conformance to national standards and regulations in accordance with the Staggers Act, and on years of professional performance and the soundness of its decisions. Automatic deference is not written into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Nor does the 30 day statutory time limit on ICC review support Utah Power\u2019s attempt to limit the scope of ICC review. This argument is not without a surface appeal, but it is clear that Congress by requiring rapid remedial action was simply seeking to correct a past record of egregious delays that significantly burdened interstate commerce. Charges of substantial delays in correcting inadequate intrastate rates were made during the Act\u2019s progress through Congress, and the need for correcting such delays was keenly recognized. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 96-1035, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 61 (1980) (disparity between intrastate and interstate rates cost rail carriers $400 million in 1977 alone).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thirty days is admittedly a short period of time within which to tackle and resolve some regulatory problems, but the ICC has been regulating railroads for almost 100 years, and is highly skilled in the rate area. To make certain that the ICC will be in a position to act expeditiously upon difficult rate issues, the Act requires that the Commission maintain up-to-date standards, procedures, and data for establishing revenue levels, and annually determine the revenue adequacy for all rail carriers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, it was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Commission\u2019s expertise in the area of revenue adequacy which allowed it so quickly and accurately to understand the deficiency in treatment of the issue by the Utah Commission. In sum, construing the 30 day time limit as indicating a Congressional intent to impose a limitation on the scope of review of the ICC would read far too much into that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Our holding places us in agreement with the Third Circuit in <em>Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. v. ICC, </em>723 F.2d 346 (3d Cir.1983), which rejected an attempt to read into section 11501 a narrower power of review in the ICC over the action of state agencies. \u201cWe cannot agree,\u201d wrote the court, \u201cthat Congress intended that state regulatory authorities exercise a measure of discretion in the interpretation of federal standards and procedures under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">We hold that the phrase \u201cstandards and procedures\u201d in section 11501(c) refers to standards and procedures promulgated and interpreted in decisions and orders of the ICC as well as those standards or procedures expressly incorporated in the Interstate Commerce Act. <em>On questions of law as to whether state authorities have complied with these standards or procedures, the Commission\u2019s review is plenary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 354-55 (emphasis added). We agree with the foregoing and also consider that the ICC, while conducting a section 11501 review, may choose to limit its review to the record complied before the state agency, or start over if it considers the case so requires. The single restraint imposed by Congress is that the process must be completed within 30 days. We will not imply a substantive limitation when Congress failed to prescribe one.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>We recognize the ICC\u2019s inability to bring certification of all state regulations and procedures to a quick conclusion for those states that have applied, and its slow progress in the development of specific national standards. But the Staggers Act provides its own definite national standards which can be applied, and a statute is not necessarily in need of agency regulations to make any of its statutory standards operative. An agency may elect to proceed by adjudication. We are also aware, however, that this is an era of great tumult in regulatory approach, a time of rapid change and innovation. The Staggers Act ordered some monumental changes in carrier regulation. In establishing the 30-day time table, Congress may not have accurately evaluated the extreme magnitude and difficulty of the task it was placing on the Commission with respect to its <em>initial </em>state certifications. Nonetheless, the ICC retains the authority and obligation to delve into state proceedings to ensure that the statutory standards of the Staggers Act are followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">B. <em>The Scope of Judicial Review of ICC Decisions Under Section 11501(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The ICC decision in this case reviews an established pre-existing rate, rather than a proposed rate, and also determined the appropriate rate. In the latter respect, the ICC states that it did not \u201cprescribe\u201d a rate, but rather \u201cmerely reversed the prescription [of the Utah Commission], allowing a return to the <em>status quo ante.\u201d </em>ICC Brief at 32-33. Here, the Commission\u2019s argument continues,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApP\">the Commission merely reversed a [Utah Commission] decision that had found the [Rio Grande-Salt Lake] rate unreasonably high, allowing a return to the <em>presumptively </em>reasonable rate that had prevailed beforehand. But the ICC did <em>not </em>mandate that the present rate be charged until the Commission rules otherwise. That would have been a prescription.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_x\"><em>Id. </em>at 33 (initial emphasis added). This distinction between an \u201cappropriate\u201d rate under section 11501(e) and a \u201cprescribed\u201d rate calls into play the difference between judicial and legislative action as articulated in <em>Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, </em>284 U.S. 370, 52 S.Ct. 183, 76 L.Ed. 348 (1932). The rate here had been agreed to and applied by the railroads and Utah Power for almost two years following the order of the Utah Commission. Section 11501(c), <em>supra, directs </em>the ICC to \u201cdetermine and authorize the carrier to establish the <em>appropriate </em>rate.\u201d The ICC made an effort to comply with that statutory requirement when, after study of the rate base, it ruled: \u201cwe determine that the <em>appropriate </em>rate ... is ... $5.97 per ton.\u201d ICC Decision at 10 (JA 593) (emphasis added). In this respect, we note the ICC\u2019s statement in its brief that the Commission has not yet interpreted the \u201crelationship, if any, between the \u2018appropriate rate\u2019 to be authorized under Section 11501(c) and \u2018reasonable rates\u2019 as used\u201d elsewhere in the statute. ICC Brief at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Courts reviewing ICC decision must approach every case that involves ratemaking with an attitude of deference towards the Commission\u2019s expertise in the area. The Supreme Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">The process of rate making is essentially empiric. The stuff of the process is fluid and changing \u2014 the resultant of factors that must be valued as well as weighed. Congress has therefore delegated the enforcement of transportation policy to a permanent expert body [the ICC] and has charged it with the duty of being responsive to the dynamic character of transportation problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-11\"><em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway v. Wichita Board of Trade, </em>412 U.S. 800, 806, 93 S.Ct. 2367, 2374, 37 L.Ed.2d 350 (1973) (quoting <em>Board of Trade v. United States, </em>314 U.S. 534, 546, 62 S.Ct. 366, 372, 86 L.Ed. 432 (1942)); <em>see American Trucking Association, Inc. v. United States, </em>642 F.2d 916, 920 (5th Cir.1981). We have thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>traditionally approached the ICC\u2019s conclusions aware of our tripartite obligation to scrutinize the Commission\u2019s action for evidence of compliance with the law, for support in the record, and for reasoned decision making. <em>See, e.g., Consolidated Rail Corp. v. ICC, </em>646 F.2d 642, 647 &amp; n. 12 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1047, 102 S.Ct. 587, 70 L.Ed.2d 488 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The scope of our review of the ICC\u2019s decisions under its Staggers Act section 11501(c) jurisdiction is defined by the above-stated standards. Congress envisioned section 11051(c) as providing <em>both </em>for federal review of state decisions, and for an ICC rate-determination function. <em>See supra. </em>Traditionally, since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision three decades ago in <em>North Carolina v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 507, 65 S.Ct. 1260, 89 L.Ed. 1760 (1945), the rule has been that ICC preemption of state authority must be strictly scrutinized. That pre-Staggers Act standard, however, is no longer controlling, because Congress has now explicitly granted the Commission authority over intrastate rates. <em>Congress </em>has preempted state regulation to the extent prescribed by the Staggers Act. The old <em>North Carolina </em>standard is obsolete, and the proper standard is one deferential to the economic expertise of the ICC. <em>See Kentucky Utilities Co. v. ICC, </em>721 F.2d 537, 542-43 (6th Cir.1983); <em>cf. Indianapolis Power &amp; Light Co. v. ICC, </em>687 F.2d 1098, 1100 (7th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We therefore approach this ICC decision with some deference, and review it only for its consistency with the Staggers Act, support in the record, and articulation of reasoned decision making.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">IV. Substantive Issues in Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"A53\">A. <em>Revenue Adequacy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Central to our inquiry are the determinations of' the Utah Commission with regard to the revenue adequacy of the Rio Grande and the Salt Lake. The ICC had already found the Rio Grande to be revenue <em>inadequate </em>and the revenue adequacy of the Salt Lake to be irrelevant. The Utah Commission disagreed and ruled that the Rio Grande was revenue <em>adequate. </em>Utah Commission Report and Order at 9, 20 (JA 94, 105). With respect to Utah Power\u2019s contention that its evidence proved the Rio Grande to be' revenue adequate, it is a complete reply to rely on the finding of the ICC that the Rio Grande was revenue inadequate. In <em>Ex Parte No. 439, Railroad Revenue Adequacy </em>\u2014 1981 <em>Determination, </em>Appendix (I.C.C. Nov. 18, 1982), the ICC determined under the Staggers Act that railroads with 16.5 percent or higher return on investment had an adequate return in 1981; that the Rio Grande during that year had a return on investment of 8.09 percent and was therefore \u201cconsidered revenue inadequate.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Ex Parte No. 416, Railroad Revenue </em>Adequacy\u2014<em>1980 Determination, </em>365 I.C.C. 285, 287, 288 (1981) (inadequate); <em>Ex Parte No. 393, Standards for Railroad Revenue Adequacy, </em>364 I.C.C. 803, 826 (1981), <em>aff'd Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad v. ICC, </em>691 F.2d 1104 (3d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Western Coal Traffic League v. United States, </em>462 U.S. 1110, 103 S.Ct. 2463, 77 L.Ed.2d 1340 (1983) (determinations for 1979) (same). In refusing to accept the determination of the ICC that the Rio Grande was revenue <em>inadequate, </em>the Utah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Commission violated its obligation to comply with federal standards and procedures, in the form of federally announced general standards and a decision rendered by the ICC in conformance with the Staggers Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The determination and revision of revenue adequacy standards is expressly made a federal responsibility. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10704(a)(2);<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101a(3).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> To carry out its statutory mandate, the Commission annually determines the revenue adequacy of railroads. These determinations of revenue adequacy are not mere suggestions to the state agencies: they constitute federal standards, which must be accepted by the states. The determination by the ICC of the revenue adequacy of Class I railroads in general, and the Rio Grande in particular for the relevant year, constitutes a federal \u201cstandard\u201d which is binding on state agencies. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(c); <em>see Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, supra, </em>723 F.2d at 554-55. It is difficult to imagine a regulatory regime more nightmarish than one in which <em>&amp; </em>railroad, for ratemaking purposes, would be judged revenue adequate in State A, but revenue inadequate in State B. Solely on the determination by the Utah Commission that the Rio Grande was \u201crevenue adequate,\u201d which was contrary to the determination of the ICC \u2014 and therefore to the Staggers Act \u2014 the reversal of the decision of the Utah agency by the ICC is fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">B. <em>The ICC Rate Determination: Contested Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Once the ICC decided to reverse the Utah Commission, the last sentence of section 11501(c) (emphasis added) came into play:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuK\">If the Commission determines that the standards and procedures were not in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle, its order <em>shall determine and authorize </em>the carrier to establish the <em>appropriate </em>rate, classification, rule or practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">Congress\u2019 use of the word \u201cshall\u201d imposes a duty on the ICC. This mandate to first <em>determine </em>and then to <em>authorize </em>the <em>appropriate </em>rate was followed by the ICC in its order:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">\n<em>Determination of Appropriate Rate</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-14\">Under 49 U.S.C. 11501(c), when we determine, as here, that the standards and procedures applied by the State authority are not in accordance with Federal law, we must determine and authorize the carrier to establish the appropriate rate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>By statute we must take final action within 30 days after receipt of the underlying petition for review. The [Utah Commission] held a full hearing to establish the appropriate rate and we have reviewed portions of the record as considered pertinent and submitted by the parties, and the decision in its entirety. Based upon our revised figures for variable costs, after correcting errors in the cost computation used by the [Utah Commission], we conclude that the assailed rate level of $5.97 per ton, which was in effect October 1,1980, is 208.7 percent of variable costs, as explained in detail in the attached appendix. We have held rates to be reasonable where they resulted in a similar range of ratios, especially where considerations of revenue adequacy are significant. See, among other cases, No. 37014, <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., et al. </em>(not printed), served March 30, 1979 (209 to 235 percent of variable costs); and <em>Trainload Rates on Radioactive Materials, Eastern Railroads, </em>362 I.C.C. 756, 775 (1980), <em>aff'd mem., </em>646 F.2d 642 (D.C.Cir.1981) (213.8 to 225.7 [sic 255.7] percent of variable costs).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\">Here, as stated earlier, the class I[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>] defendant [Rio Grande], realizes a return on investment below what is necessary for revenue adequacy. Balancing the goals reflected in Title 49 of the United States Code, especially in section 11501 and its history, the evidence before us, and practical considerations, we <em>determine that the appropriate rate, </em>authorized at the October 1, 1980 level, subject to intervening increases, <em>is the rate of $5.97 per ton.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">ICC Decision at 10 (JA 593) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">At oral argument, ICC counsel contended that the Commission could remand to the state agency. While this interpretation of the Act has not been briefed or fully argued, relying solely on the wording of the Act, we cannot agree. Indeed the ICC\u2019s own decision in <em>Petition of Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company for Review of a Decision of the Public Service Commission of Indiana Pursuant to. 49 U.S.C. 11501, </em>No. 38946 (I.C.C. June 17, 1983), speaking to the same contention, stated: \u201cWe cannot remand the case to the state authority but must establish an <em>appropriate </em>rate in the same decision within the 30-day time period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Beyond the statutory terms of section 11501(c), and the ICC\u2019s concession in <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville, supra, </em>there is an additional reason to reject the suggested approach of a remand to the state commission: the principal object of the Act is to protect the public. Both the Utah Commission and the ICC agree that these railroads exercise market dominance over this particular traffic. Utah Power, a public utility, is thus a captive customer. We cannot imply from the statute a procedure that would leave the public and Utah Power as hostages to the successful resolution of methodological debates between the federal and state agencies. The disagreements in approach between the ICC and the Utah Commission \u2014 or any other state commission for that matter \u2014 may continue for years. The wrangle may in fact be endless. To allow the ICC to simply reverse the state agency and remand the rate proceeding to the state agency is to invite a repeat performance with an only slightly altered script. In many, if not most, instances, railroads might be placed at the risk of having their intrastate rates fixed at the low threshold figure. Thus one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the evils the Staggers Act seeks to remedy would still continue. It is not the intent of the Staggers Act that threshold rates should constitute the <em>maximum </em>reasonable rates for intrastate traffic and require interstate rates to take up the slack in producing revenue that is adequate for sound operations; rather it seems the Act contemplates that intrastate and interstate rates should, in general, approximate parity. Furthermore, while the Utah Commission and the ICC pirouette around the technical niceties of rate-making, Utah Power must run a power plant and the public must pay the cost plus a reasonable profit. One overriding purpose of the Staggers Act is to provide reasonable rates for <em>everybody </em>in very short order. That purpose is frustrated if the ICC is allowed to assume only the duty of dispensing of regulatory imprimatur. If it finds fault with a state decision, the Commission must correct that fault, and it must do so within the 30 day period within which the statute commands that \u201cfinal action\u201d on the petition must be taken. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">However, we cannot affirm the decision by the ICC to allow the original rate to stand unless the Commission\u2019s \u201cunderlying cost calculations are substantiated in the record.\u201d <em>San Antonio, Texas, supra, </em>631 F.2d at 837. Because we have some doubt that certain of the ICC\u2019s cost calculations have fully adequate evidentiary support in the record, we remand the case to the ICC so that it may reexamine the data and then \u201cdetermine and authorize the appropriate rate\u201d that it finds to be justified under applicable federal standards and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Utah Power poses a number of distinct cost-based challenges to the ICC\u2019s handling of rate inquiry. The Utility argues that the ICC\u2019s cost appendix is fundamental to its decision, because the variable costs associated with the traffic are critical to a determination of the revenue/variable cost ratio of the movement, which is in turn central to an inquiry into the determination of the appropriate rate. Utah Power asserts that the appendix contains at least three crucial errors regarding cost calculations \u2014 errors which allegedly undermine the ICC\u2019s declaration that the rate in issue was appropriate. Specifically, the Utility asserts that ICC\u2019s reversal of three of the Utah Commission\u2019s cost findings were clearly erroneous: (1) the cost of interchange switching (per car); (2) the cost of UP\u2019s switching expense (per car); and (3) the cost of origin switching at the mine. Utah Power further argues (4) that the ICC completely failed to review an \u201calternate holding\u201d of the Utah Commission \u2014 \u201cthat the rates at issue are excessive even if the railroads are not revenue adequate.\u201d Utah Power Reply Brief at 33. Finally, the Utility asserts (5) that the ICC misunderstood the scope of the Salt Lake\u2019s role in this movement, deciding erroneously that the Rio Grande\u2019s role as \u201cpredominant\u201d carrier rendered the analysis of the revenue position of the Salt Lake irrelevant. We consider these contentions in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">1. <em>Rio Grande Interchange Switching</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">One issue is the cost of Rio Grande yard crews at Salt Lake City, who receive the consist from the road crews after the trip from the mine and move the loaded coal cars to the Union Pacific. Railroad crews are prohibited by law from operating for more than 12 hours in a single day, and the round trip from Salt Lake City to the mine and return generally takes about 12 hours. Thus a relief Rio Grande crew is frequently needed to deliver the consist to the UP (JA 531-32).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Utah Power contends that 10 other coal cars destined for other consignees are frequently added to the 35 that are normally destined for Utah Power\u2019s Gadsby Plant, and that the added cost of switching these extra cars should not be allocated to the movement of the coal ears consigned to Utah Power. Out of 13 movements in the record that were checked, it appears that only four consisted solely of 35 cars in the Rio Grande train destined for Utah Power; the other nine trains initially' included 10 additional cars destined for another consignee. On this evidence, the Utah Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>mission refused to include <em>any </em>of the cost of the relief crew in the rate it ordered because of the allegation that the relief crew was only required because of the additional 10 cars of another shipper. There is testimony, however, that <em>the relief crew did not do anything with the ten added cars </em>(JA 271). In any event, a relief crew was required after 12 hours and the movement from the mine was always operating close to the maximum time limit. Under such circumstances, recognizing the frequency with which train delays occur, even where operating conditions are closer to ideal, it was reasonable for the Rio Grande to provide a relief crew. It was also not necessary for the regular train crew to work a full 12 hours. Twelve continuous hours was the absolute statutory time limit for operating train crews; there is good reason, though, for safety reasons, that operating train crews should not <em>always </em>be pushed to the maximum time limit. Therefore, we find that the reasonable cost of the relief crews was validly included in computing the rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The costs associated with the number of locomotives used in switching coal cargoes between railroads are also at issue. The railroads argued before the ICC that the determination by the Utah Commission of these switching costs was inappropriate because it should have considered the <em>actual </em>number of locomotives used in the switching, not the <em>average </em>number of units used, as had been the case at the Utah Commission (JA 124). Utah Power did not challenge this point, but argued further that the railroads\u2019 figures were still fatally flawed in that the carriers would \u201cassign the entire cost of those locomotives to [Utah Power\u2019s] coal traffic when the cause of the additional cost is the additional cars for other shippers that are sometimes part of the [Rio Grande] train\u201d (JA 190). Utah Power contended that [\u201ct]he additional costs should be assigned to the additional cars that cause the delay\u201d (JA 190-91). If, as stated above, the' relief crew did nothing with the 10 cars, the Utility\u2019s point is flawed. The exact proportional amount may not be easily discernible, but doubtlessly the major portion of the cost of the coal movement must be attributed to Utah Power. The ICC\u2019s response professed an inability to resolve this particular question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaP\">In view of the partial evidence from the Utah proceeding available, we are not able to affirmatively comment on this issue. Based upon our customary procedures whereby use of locomotive units differing in number from the Rail Form A average may be reflected, we accept petitioners\u2019 adjusted cost as the best available evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">ICC Decision, Appendix at 3 (JA 598). On this factual record we are unable to declare with certainty that either party is correct on this issue, but we are certain that the locomotive costs that are properly allocable to the movements in issue have not been precisely determined. The difference in the amounts in dispute may be <em>de minimis </em>but it seems appropriate, when the case is being remanded, to obtain accurate evidence. On remand the ICC should further investigate the facts relevant to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">2. <em>The Union Pacific Switching Charge \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Utah Power challenges the inclusion of the Union Pacific\u2019s <em>charge, </em>rather than its <em>cost, </em>for switching loaded coal cars from the Rio Grande to the Salt Lake and the empty cars from the Salt Lake to the Rio Grande for the next trip. The Utility contends that the switching arrangement between the railroads is reciprocal, and that the switching charge will not be imposed in the near future. Therefore, Utah Power concludes, only the actual variable cost of the movement may properly be included. Utah Power contends that the actual cost to the Rio Grande of the reciprocal switching arrangement with the Utah Power was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">In our view, it was proper to include the \u201ccharge.\u201d If we understand the arrangement, it is the \u201ccharge\u201d imposed that must be satisfied by supplying services of equivalent value. That being the basis of the arrangement between the railroads, we see no reason to depart from it because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>payment in reciprocal services. The cost to the Rio Grande is real even if the method of payment is by the provision of equivalent service rather than by check. Whether the charge will be imposed in the near future is irrelevant to the decision which this case requires. As to whether the Rio Grande\u2019s reciprocal switching services offset those of the UP, the Rio Grande and Utah Power each contends that the other did not produce evidence to substantiate its position. On remand the ICC may, in its discretion, further investigate the facts relevant to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">3. <em>Origin Switching</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Utah Power contends that none of the origin switching cost (roadway maintenance cost at Clear Creek) was substantiated, and therefore that none should be allowed. The ICC assigned only 30 percent of these total costs to the Rio Grande\u2019s operation. The ICC decision states that it is impossible to determine the parties\u2019 differences because adequate evidence had not been introduced in the record. ICC Decision, Appendix at 2 (JA 597). \u25a0 However, based upon what was termed a \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d of the testimony of the mine officer that origin switching occurred on tracks \u201cpredominantly owned\u201d by the mining company, the ICC concluded that 30 percent was a \u201cfair approximation\u201d of the costs that could reasonably be allocated to the Rio Grande. <em>Id. </em>We are uneasy with the ICC\u2019s indication that the record does not contain adequate evidence on this issue. In determining a rate, the ICC cannot simply throw up its hands on what may be a crucial inquiry. Consequently, on remand this issue may be opened for Utah Power to submit evidence and for the Rio Grande to respond. If no additional evidence is introduced, Utah Power may be found to waive any objection to this item and the ICC may determine that 30 percent of the costs was properly allocated to the rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Utah Power also questions this cost, contending that the mine operators made a massive <em>loan </em>to the railroad for rehabilitation of the tracks to the mine, upon which loan the Utah Commission \u201ccould justifiably have relied in [totally] excluding this item of costs from the costs of the movement.\u201d Utah Power Reply Brief at 31. The terms of the loan are not set forth. The fact that costs may have been paid by the proceeds from a loan, however, does not in any way alter the fact that costs were incurred. Ordinarily loans must be repaid. Thus, such costs should not be eliminated in computing the rate merely because they may have been paid from the proceeds of a loan. On remand, the ICC may reopen the record to any evidence that may indicate the circumstances, or the terms of the loan, that might justify the exclusion of the costs to which the proceeds from the loan were applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">4. <em>The Alleged Rate Excessiveness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Utah Power also rests on the Utah Commission\u2019s alternative holding that the Rio Grande rates at issue were excessive even if the railroads were not revenue adequate. The Utah Commission concluded on the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-11\">17. ... Even if [the Rio Grande and the Salt Lake] did not have adequate revenues, however, they would not be free to charge higher rates for traffic than we have ordered. The rate level we are permitting (181.2% of variable costs) is generous to the railroads, and provides for a considerable subsidy for other traffic. Congress did not intend that a railroad\u2019s revenue inadequacy would justify any rate. <em>Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Report of the Committee on Conference on S.1916, </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 92 (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">Utah Commission Report and Order at 20-21 (JA 105-06). This conclusion rests completely on the reasonableness of a rate level permitting a return of 181.2 percent of variable costs of the transportation in question, as those costs were computed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>the Utah Commission. On this point the decision of the ICC states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-4\">Constant costs do not appear in the [Utah Commission] decision. To reiterate from our earlier observations, we do not endorse [the] approval of the double-rate-of-return device (181.2 percent factor) as applied to the variable cost to determine the maximum rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">ICC Decision, Appendix at 5 (JA 600). While \u201cthe double-rate-of-return\u201d standard might develop a rate that was reasonable under some circumstances, there is no justification for applying it rigidly as the <em>maximum </em>reasonable rate. Clearly, rates in excess thereof can still be found to be reasonable. The Utah Commission thus acted unlawfully when it applied a rigid double-rate-of-return <em>standard </em>\u2014particularly when that standard was used as a device to rule unreasonable a rate that the Utility and the railroads had agreed upon and which the Utah Commission had ordered filed two years earlier. This was not a <em>proposed </em>rate, but was an existing rate that the parties agreed to and without objection the Utah Commission had ordered published. <em>In the Matter of the Application of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railway Company to Publish Freight Tariff 4166, </em>No. 79-398-07 (Public Service Commission of Utah, 1979); <em>see </em>ICC Decision at 5 (JA 588).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Under such circumstances, the issue presented to the Utah Commission was whether the <em>existing </em>rate was <em>unreasonable, </em>not whether the state agency could fashion a lower rate that would in its view be borderline reasonable. In this respect, it seems that the Utah Commission has refused to recognize one lesson that the enactment of the Staggers Act sought to impress upon state agencies with respect to their regulation of intrastate rates: that the old home-town preferential rates that operated to deny railroads adequate revenue, and shift a substantial part of the burden of adequately supporting railroad operations to interstate traffic, were to be abolished. If state agencies in prescribing rates could hold all intrastate rates to mere bare-bones reasonableness \u2014 which they might, given the local demands on state agencies \u2014 railroads would still face revenue problems as costs and rates became outmoded and rates forced by competition were insufficient. Also, the delay factor in implementing new rates, which will always exist to some degree, could tend to keep intrastate traffic from paying an <em>equal share </em>of the cost of the necessary service it receives. This could lead to acute problems of revenue adequacy for railroads such as the Rio Grande, which apparently derives such a large portion of its revenue from intrastate operations. The Staggers Act mandates that the ICC prevent these abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">ICC precedents support its decision in this case. The Utah Commission found the rate excessive and ordered its reduction to one embodying 181.2 percent of variable costs. Utah Commission Report and Order at 20 (JA 105). The existing Rio Grande rate, according to the ICC, represented \u201c208.7 percent of variable costs____\u201d ICC Decision at 10 (JA 593). In contrast to the decision of the Utah Commission holding such percentage to provide an \u201cexcessive\u201d return, the ICC has determined that where considerations of revenue adequacy were significant, rates within the area of the Rio Grande\u2019s 208.7 percent <em>were reasonable. </em>For instance, a rate of 209-235 [sic 255] percent of variable costs was held reasonable in <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Railway, </em>No. 37014 (1979).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> While such determinations do not constitute <em>fixed </em>federal standards that must be followed by state agencies in setting every intrastate rate, they do establish a general range of rate reasonableness that must be respected by state agencies. The rates set by the Utah Commission here were <em>substantially below </em>the range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>rates found to be reasonable by the ICC and under current ICC decisions were not the maximum reasonable rates as asserted by the Utah Commission. We cannot find unreasonable a rate that is within the range established by applicable federal precedents. Thus, we disagree with the Utah Commission that the rate at issue exceeded a reasonable maximum. Between the approaches of the two Commissions, we find that of the ICC to be more in keeping with the Staggers Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">5. <em>The Salt Lake\u2019s Revenue Adequacy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The ICC did not consider the revenue adequacy of the Salt Lake, allegedly because Utah Power did not question the Commission\u2019s decision that the Rio Grande was the \u201cpredominant\u201d carrier and that the Salt Lake\u2019s revenue adequacy could not be a \u201cdeterminative\u201d factor. ICC Brief at 37-38. We cannot fully agree with the substance of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The complete trip from the Gadsby Plant to the mine at Clear Creek and return takes approximately 12 hours for the Rio Grande train crew. Before and after such trips, the Salt Lake breaks the consist into two parts and moves it a line-haul distance of 0.37. miles (round trip 0.75 miles). These complete operations by the Salt Lake, while they cover only a short distance, take almost <em>eight hours. </em>Furthermore, the coal movement for Utah Power represents approximately 75 percent of Salt Lake\u2019s total car traffic, and approximately 50 percent of its ton miles. Utah Power Reply Brief at 36. In this movement the Salt Lake operates as a \u201cline-haul carrier\u201d rather than a switching operation. In view of the amount of time involved in this operation, we have some difficulty with the ICC not reaching the possible effect of the revenue adequacy of the Salt Lake \u201cbecause it found [Salt Lake\u2019s] role in the rail movement here to be a minor one.\u201d ICC Brief at 37. We require the ICC on remand to consider the revenue adequacy and costs of the Salt Lake, and to give those factors such weight in determining the final rate as may be justified. We recognize that the ICC did accept Utah Power\u2019s development of Salt Lake\u2019s costs for purposes of its decision. ICC Decision, Appendix at 4 (JA 599). We cannot be sure, however, of the extent that the rate might be modified if the ICC considers the revenue adequacy of the Salt Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">V. Conclusion: The Obligation of the ICC Upon Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">We fully agree with the ICC that the \u201ccost appendix, as <em>dicta, </em>even if replete with error, could not affect the fundamental rationality of reversing the [Utah Commission\u2019s] rate-reducing prescription order.\u201d ICC Brief at 39. The ICC\u2019s obligation, however, extends beyond setting forth the errors of the state commission. As we have stated, <em>supra, </em>the ICC must determine the appropriate rate and authorize the carrier to establish it. This responsibility the Commission may not evade. In this respect, the Commission\u2019s decision is somewhat suspect, and we therefore remand the case to the ICC for reconsideration of the appropriate rate, and for a determination of whether any reparations are required in light of that reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">While we remand in part, we recognize that there is considerable rationality in the ICC merely determining that $5.97 per ton was an \u201cappropriate rate\u201d when the parties had agreed to that rate, the Utah Commission had ordered it filed, the parties had, without objection, operated under it for almost two years, and the Utah Commission in finding it to be excessive had refused to follow federal standards and procedures with respect to revenue adequacy as determined by the ICC. Of course, the present situation is thus not one that usually arises under the statute which ordinarily involves an ICC review of a <em>proposed </em>intrastate rate initiated by the carrier, opposed by the shipper and ruled on initially by the state agency. Here the ICC has dealt with a pre-existing rate that was lawfully established and placed in effect, and which was subsequently attacked on a fundamentally incorrect basis. Nonetheless, the finding that the rate is reasonable appears to rest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>in some part upon significantly incomplete data. Thus, a partial remand is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We sympathize with the time pressures on the ICC that were institutionalized by the Staggers Act. But the statutory obligations and deadlines within which its duties must be performed cannot be avoided. We agree with the Third Circuit\u2019s conclusion that Congress did not intend that \u201cthis brief period authorizes the ICC to issue orders lacking in reasoned explanation.\u201d <em>Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., supra, </em>723 F.2d at 357; <em>see Kentucky Utilities, supra, </em>721 F.2d at 545 (\u201cIt is not persuasive to argue that the statute cannot apply simply because it is burdensome.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Subject to the limitations stated above, we affirm the decision of the ICC to reverse the decision of the Utah Commission, but remand the case on the issue of the evidentiary support for the reasonableness of the rate for further review, reconsideration and decision by the ICC within 30 days of the service of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\">.

Because we are at the beginning stages of interpreting the Staggers Act I consider it advisable to comment on what in my opinion are erroneous concepts in the concurring opinion on the established doctrine of exhausting administrative remedies. Contrary to the assertion in the concurring opinion, Utah does not contend that it has the right, apart from any federal law, to give or take away the jurisdiction of the ICC. Utah merely contends that when their State Commission procedures were approved by the ICC as conforming with federal standards <em>under the Staggers Act </em>that the rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>roads were required to exhaust the approved state <em>administrative </em>rehearing provision before the decision of the Utah Commission could be considered final and subject to review by the ICC. This is <em>not </em>a far fetched argument; and it is wide of the mark for the concurrence to state that no federal court in reviewing an ICC decision ever judicially created an \"exhaust state remedies requirement.\" The federal courts did not need to, because, as the current Fifth Circuit decision in <em>Texas v. United States, </em>730 F.2d 409 (5th Cir.1984), quotes the ICC as stating that <em>generally the ICC did require </em>exhaustion of state administrative remedies, i.e.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">The ICC stated in its opinion that it <em>generally requires </em>railroads to exhaust their remedies before state agencies, if the state\u2019s procedures are consistent with federal procedures.

The concurrence tries to worm out of this ICC statement by asserting that the rehearing requirements can be avoided because the certification of the state <em>procedures </em>was only \"provisional.\u201d That is a quibble. The ICC did <em>certify </em>the state procedures, and while the certification continues <em>it is a certification, </em>but of course that does not operate to override contrary federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\"><em>Porter v.

As stated above that is the ICC\u2019s general policy. <em>It is a very salutary rule. </em>It makes it possible for a state commission to correct its own errors and stop the parties from running to the federal courts and clogging up their calendars every time there is some minor error in a state administrative decision. As Justice Brennan remarked concurring in <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Ass\u2019n v. McNary, </em>454 U.S. 100, 121 n. 5, 102 S.Ct. 177, 188-9 n. 5, 70 L.Ed.2d 271 (1981), the \u201cexhaustation of administrative remedies ... reflects principles of avoidance of unnecessary litigation____\u201d Federal common law generally requires exhaustion of administrative remedies. The oft-cited decision of <em>Myers v. Bethlehem Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938), and cases cited at 51, n. 9, 58 S.Ct. at 463, n. 9, hold \u201d... it is a long settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief ... until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\" This rule is as applicable to state administrative agencies as to federal administrative agencies. <em>Cf. Porter v. Investors Syndicate, supra; First Natl. Bank v. Weld County, </em>264 U.S. 450, 453, 44 S.Ct. 385, 386, 68 L.Ed. 784 (1924); <em>Pacific Livestock Co. v. Oregon Water Bd., </em>241 U.S. 440, 36 S.Ct. 637, 60 L.Ed. 1084 (1916); <em>Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, </em>211 U.S. 210, 29 S.Ct. 67, 53 L.Ed. 150 (1908) (a similar railroad rate case involving an intrastate rate and the state regulatory agency). This procedural rule may apply \u201d[e]ven where the statutory requirement of exhaustion is not explicit ...\" <em>Patsy v. Florida Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 502 n. 4, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 2561 n. 4, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Utah\u2019s argument is thus not made out of whole cloth; my disagreement with its application here, as stated above, is grounded upon the existence of a certain well recognized exception to the general rule, and there are a number, but Utah\u2019s contention does have some partial validity. One exception to the exhaustion rule, which as stated above is controlling here, is based on the <em>futility </em>of further state proceedings because the Utah Commission throughout has continued to stand by its decision on all issues. The statement in the concurring opinion concerning possible <em>delay </em>is not overlooked, but where the rate continues in effect during litigation, as opposed to a <em>proposed </em>rate, the potential harm to the railroad is minimal. Another reason stated above is that Utah\u2019s rehearing provision is not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">The statement in the concurring opinion which implies that some benefit might result to \"a state favoring a state remedy exhaustion requirement before a federal forum proceeds <em>[if it </em>] <em>so indicatefd] by the vote of its representatives in Congress,\" </em>is pure unworkable fantasy. Concurring op., p. 3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AeU\">And the further statement in the concurring opinion that federal courts deferring judicial review until state administrative proceedings have run their full course were \"not tailored to fit the <em>prompt </em>ICC administrative superintendence Congress ordered\" is too general. It has only limited relevance to this case. The ICC <em>did </em>order the State Commission to handle this case in the first instance. A different situation would exist where delay during state agency litigation would deprive a railroad of needed revenue from a <em>proposed </em>rate, but that is not this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">. And as above indicated the official record of the ICC states that the \u201cDATE OF FILING/ SERVICE\u201d of the \"LETTER: Transmitting corrections in item #1 [Petition] above.\u201d, was \u201c2/2/ 83.\u201d (JA 3).

At the time of the ICC decision in Ex Parte No. 388, State Intrastate Rail Rate Authority, 47 Fed.Reg. 5786 (Feb. 9, 1982) only 36 states were certified to exercise jurisdiction over intrastate railroad rates under \u00a7 214 of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">. While this case involves a pre-existing rate, the necessity for quick resolution of intrastate rate disputes can be envisioned by the facts of this case. At oral argument counsel for Utah Power stated \"that coal freight revenues account for 48% of [the Rio Grande\u2019s] total revenues and they have been constantly increasing over the last 10 years____\u2019\u2019 Since the Rio Grande only operates in two states, Colorado and Utah, and, as counsel remarked, the coal is mined in both states, most of the revenue from coal traffic is undoubtedly based on intrastate rates, the principal population, industrial centers and coal mines being located where they are. Under such circumstances, with the railroad being dependent on intrastate coal freight revenues for such a large part of its income, and having been determined by the ICC to be revenue inadequate, it is extremely important that such revenues adequately contribute to the railroads\u2019 income. To accomplish this result, the level of intrastate rates may be a very vital factor to the \"sound\u201d operation of the Rio Grande.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b809-13\">. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10704(a)(2) <em>&amp; </em>(4) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-14\">(2) The Commission shall maintain and revise as necessary standards and procedures for establishing revenue levels for rail carriers providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under that subchapter that are adequate, under honest, economical, and efficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>management, to cover total operating expenses, including depreciation and obsolescence, plus a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business.

This view of the Staggers Act appears to place us somewhat at odds with that of the Sixth Circuit in <em>Kentucky Utilities Co. v. ICC, </em>721 F.2d 537 (6th Cir.1983). There the court criticized the ICC for \"recreat[ing]\u201d section 11501(c) into a <em>\"de novo </em>rate hearing not subject to previously articulated standards,\u201d stating that the \u201cfickle methodology of the ICC\u201d had been an abdication of the Commission\u2019s Congressionally-imposed duty. <em>Id. </em>at 544. Thus, under \u00a7 11501(b)(3)(B), the state standards in effect at the time of the enactment of the Staggers Act still controlled. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-13\">Thus, the ICC had no warrant to consider its own \"interim guidelines\" as the controlling, certified standard. It should not be understood by this holding, however, that the [Kentucky Railroad Commission] decision is totally beyond review by the ICC. Properly understood, the Court here merely finds that the ICC\u2019s dereliction of its initial responsibility under the Staggers Act to formulate a polestar ratemaking standard for use in certified state standards has established the standards employed by the KRC as the applicable rate formula herein, limiting the scope of the Commission's inquiry to the issue of whether the Kentucky standards were applied \u201cin accordance with the provisions of this subtitle.\" \u00a7 11501(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">721 F.2d at 544. We cannot agree with such construction of the Staggers Act, which denies the oversight responsibility of the ICC so clearly envisioned by the Congress. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s view ignores the statutory duty of the states to comply with federal \u201cstandards and procedures,\u201d and would require of the ICC an expertise in the techniques and theories of the 50 states. In addition, we note that the Staggers Act <em>itself </em>establishes certain standards that must</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>be followed. <em>See Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, supra, </em>723 F.2d at 354-55. The ICC may enforce such statutory standards in \u00a7 11501(c) proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b812-5\">. Our position here might diverge slightly from that of one other Court of Appeals. Oddly, the Third Circuit has held that the Staggers Act did <em>not </em>change the <em>North Carolina </em>standard. <em>Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. v. ICC, </em>723 F.2d 346, 353 (3d Cir.1983). The Third Circuit held, however, that <em>North Carolina </em>requires only that \"the ICC must ... make the basis for its preemption order clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that the ICC had done so. We believe that the Third Circuit\u2019s view rests on an incorrect view of the impact of the Staggers Act, which <em>did </em>fundamentally alter the review situation between the state authorities and the ICC. States previously were free to do as they pleased, so long as they did not discriminate against interstate commerce. Now, states are required to follow federal rules exclusively. Previously, the presumption was against preemption; that is no longer the case. We note, however, that even if the Third Circuit standard applies, little would be changed. In our view, the requirement of a clear statement of the Commission's reasoning essentially coincides with the traditional requirements of reasoned decision making to which we must hold the Commission here. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b813-6\">.

As to the issue analyzed in that section, I state my position separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">In his discussion under the heading \u201cExhaustion of Administrative Remedies,\u201d Judge MacKinnon ultimately settles on the view that the futility exception applies in this case. <em>See supra </em>p. 729. My view of the matter is less complex. I see no need to consider \u201cexceptions\u201d; the Railroads, I think it clear, confronted no relevant exhaustion rule in the first place. I write separately to describe the straighter path I follow on this threshold issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">As an opening argument, Utah Power &amp; Light Co. (UPL) asserts that \u201c[t]he ICC lacked jurisdiction to review the Utah PSC\u2019s Decision because [the Railroads] failed to exhaust their remedies before the Public Service Commission of Utah.\u201d Brief of Petitioner at 12. Specifically, UPL claims that, for want of a rehearing petition filed with the Utah PSC, we must reverse the ICC\u2019s decision. The Railroads\u2019 failure to ask the PSC to reconsider its decision, UPL maintains, left the ICC powerless to proceed. In support of this alleged jurisdictional lockout, UPL cites solely provisions of Utah law: Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 54-7-15<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Rule 19 of the Rules of Practice of the Utah PSC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is topsyturvy argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">The ICC\u2019s jurisdiction is not Utah\u2019s to give or take away. And exhaustion requirements are imposed by the legislature that controls the reviewing authority whose jurisdiction is invoked, or by a tribunal superior to that authority, or by the authority itself, not by the forum of first resort whose determinations are subject to review. Concretely, Congress, not Utah\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>lawmakers, determines the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction. Congress again, and sometimes the federal courts that review ICC decisions or the ICC itself, may delineate avenues complainants must exhaust before approaching the ICC. But it is not Utah\u2019s prerogative, or that of any of its sister states, to dictate rules on recourse to the ICC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">UPL\u2019s inversion of state/federal lines of authority has occasioned some confusion in the parties\u2019 briefing. Two examples should suffice to clear the air on this fundamental matter. A person in state custody may petition a federal court for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1982), but he or she may not do so without exhausting state court remedies. <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). A person suing a state official in a federal court for an alleged deprivation of a federal right, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, need not exhaust or even begin to pursue state remedies. <em>Patsy v. Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982). In both cases, federal law determines the jurisdiction of the federal forum and the existence <em>vel non </em>of an exhaustion requirement. A state favoring a state remedy exhaustion requirement before a federal forum proceeds may so indicate by the vote of its representatives in Congress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A vote in the state\u2019s own legislature for exhaustion of state remedies as a precondition to a challenge in a federal forum, however, would be unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">In the matter at hand, the ICC entertained the Railroads\u2019 petition pursuant to the authority (jurisdiction) conferred upon the Commission by Congress. The jurisdiction-conferring provision, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11.-501(c), reads in pertinent part: \u201cAny rail carrier ... may petition the Commission to review the decision of any State authority, in any administrative proceeding in which the lawfulness of an intrastate rate ... is determined.\u201d The Utah PSC rendered a decision adverse to the Railroads in an administrative proceeding to determine the lawfulness of an intrastate rate. The Railroads, in compliance with ICC procedure, petitioned the Commission to review that decision. Congress required no more. <em>See Texas v. United States, </em>730 F.2d 409 (5th Cir.1984). The federal legislature said nothing of applying for rehearing before the PSC or pursuing any other state avenue for relief from the PSC\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Nor has any federal court, in reviewing an ICC decision, ever created an \u201cexhaust state remedies\u201d or \u201cexhaust state remedies further\u201d requirement. <em>See Florida v. United States, </em>282 U.S. 194, 51 S.Ct. 119, 75 L.Ed. 291 (1931); <em>North Carolina v. ICC, </em>347 F.Supp. 103 (E.D.N.C.1972), <em>aff'd mem., </em>410 U.S. 919, 93 S.Ct. 1362, 35 L.Ed.2d 582 (1973); <em>North Carolina v. United States, </em>128 F.Supp. 718, 724 (E.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>N.C.) (assertion that ICC is \u201cwithout jurisdiction to order increase of intrastate rates until remedies under state law had been exhausted\u201d is \u201c[cjertainly ... without merit\u201d; \u201c[t]he Commission in discharging the duties imposed upon it by Congress may not be delayed by proceedings before state courts or commissions\u201d), <em>aff'd mem., </em>350 U.S. 805, 76 S.Ct. 45, 100 L.Ed. 723 (1955).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The federal courts\u2019 refusal to impose on the ICC\u2019s administrative authority a total-exhaustion-of-state-remedies requirement is hardly surprising. It is true that, as a matter of federal law, federal courts have generally denied requests to enjoin the enforcement of state administrative decisions where the grievant has not pursued adequate and available state administrative remedies. <em>See </em>C. Weight, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4233 (1978). That form of temporary abstention, however, is inapposite to ICC oversight of intrastate rates. Congress considered placing the entire regulation of intrastate rates in the hands of the ICC. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1035, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 61, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3978, 4006; 126 Cong.Rec. 18,298 (1980). It ultimately chose to give the ICC a unique, expedited oversight role in establishing intrastate rates while maintaining a requirement of initial, but not totally exhaustive, resort to state PSCs. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,501. The expedited ICC <em>administrative </em>control for which Congress provided is not comparable to <em>judicial </em>review of agency action; the equity, comity, and restraint considerations that have led federal courts to defer federal judicial review until state proceedings have run their full course, <em>see Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., </em>211 U.S. 210, 229, 29 S.Ct. 67, 70, 53 L.Ed. 150 (1908), are not tailored to fit the prompt ICC administrative superintendence Congress ordered. Thus, the only even barely plausible support UPL can muster for its \u201cstate law controls access to ICC\u201d argument is that the ICC itself so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">UPL\u2019s reasoning runs this way. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 permits a state commission to exercise jurisdiction over intrastate rates only \u201cif such State authority exercises such jurisdiction exclusively in accordance with [federal prescriptions].\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,501(b)(1). Within 120 days after the effective date of the Staggers Act state authorities seeking to continue exercising jurisdiction over intrastate rates had to submit their intrastate rail carriage regulatory standards and procedures to the ICC. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11,501(b)(2). Within ninety days after receipt of a state authority\u2019s standards and procedures, the ICC had to decide whether to certify the state authority as an agency for intrastate rail transportation regulation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11,501(b)(3)(A). A state authority denied certification \u201cmay not exercise any jurisdiction over intrastate rates\u201d; one granted certification may exercise jurisdiction using \u201cits standards and procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11,501(b)(4)(A). \u201cThe ICC certified the Utah PSC under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501 to exercise jurisdiction over intrastate rail traffic in accordance with the PSC\u2019s rules of practice,\u201d UPL reports. Brief of Petitioner at 7-8. The PSC\u2019s rules provide for rehearing petitions. Therefore, UPL concludes, for want of a rehearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>petition addressed to the Utah PSC, the Railroads may not complain about the PSC\u2019s decision to the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The assertion that the ICC approved a PSC rehearing petition as a precondition to its own jurisdiction is vulnerable on several counts. First, the ICC\u2019s certification of the Utah PSC\u2019s intrastate rate regulation, remains <em>provisional. </em>The ICC simply accepted the state\u2019s representation that it \u201cinten[ded] to exercise jurisdiction consistent with the law.\u201d <em>State Intrastate Rail Rate Authority, </em>364 I.C.C. 881, 883 (1981); <em>see also Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Co. v. ICC, </em>720 F.2d 958, 959 (7th Cir.1983). The Commission deferred close inspection of state standards and procedures and has not yet rendered considered determinations on the consistency of state prescriptions with federal law. <em>See id. </em>at 959-60. Second, even after final certification, a state commission\u2019s practices will remain subject to adversary testing in proceedings before the ICC to review state decisions. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,501(c) (railroads petitioning for ICC review may challenge state standard or procedure alleged to be inconsistent with governing federal law).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Finally and predominantly, the overriding purpose of the Staggers Act provisions on federal-state relations was to insure that federal goals (price and service flexibility and revenue adequacy) would not be \u201cundermined by state regulation.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 106 (1980) (Conference Report). A court would disserve that purpose were it to embrace the position UPL espouses. The Utah PSC\u2019s rate reduction and award of reparations would stand without ICC oversight based on an utterly fanciful assumption\u2014 that the ICC in fact adverted to and adopted Utah\u2019s local law on PSC rehearing petitions, thereby rendering that fragment of state law an impenetrable barrier to access to the ICC\u2019s ultimate superintendence.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">To be sure, although a rehearing petition requirement before a party repairs to a review forum risks delay, that risk may be counterbalanced by significant benefits. For example, a rehearing request affords the tribunal of first resort a chance to correct its own errors and to improve the quality of the record the review forum will receive. <em>Cf. Athlone Industries, Inc. v. Consumer Products Safety Commission, </em>707 F.2d 1485, 1488-89 (D.C.Cir.1983) (dis-' cussing exhaustion of administrative remedies generally). But such a requirement, when imposed, should reflect a considered judgment that, in the particular context,, the gain is significant enough to brook the delay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is safe to say that no such judgment was made here \u2014 not by Congress, the federal judiciary, or the ICC, the only authorities empowered to make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">Instead, when Congress settled on the Staggers Act provisions reducing the authority of state regulatory bodies while increasing the IGC\u2019s monitoring role in intrastate regulation, delay was a paramount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>concern. <em>See Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. v. ICC, </em>723 F.2d 346, 354 &amp; n. 19 (3d Cir.1983); H.R.Rep. No. 1035, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 61, 130 (1980) (House Report). Congress was also mindful that the regulatory standards and procedures of the several states differed substantially from one another and from those of the Commission; Congress sought to reduce the disparity and to promote consistent-practices. <em>See id. </em>at 128; <em>see also Indianapolis Power &amp; Light Co. v. ICC, </em>687 F.2d 1098, 1100 (7th Cir.1982); 126 Cong.Rec. 18,298 (1980) (statement of Rep. Broyhill introducing predecessor to current section 11,501). In view of these concerns, I am confident that the ICC correctly rejected the Utah PSC\u2019s rehearing requirement as a reason for closing its door to the Railroads\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-10\">. Section 54-7-15 provides: \"Before any party ... who is dissatisfied with an order or decision of the [state] commission may commence legal action, the aggrieved party or person shall first [apply for rehearing].\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 54-7-15 (1953 &amp; Supp.1981). This section, headed \"Review or rehearing by commission \u2014 Application-Procedure-Prerequisite to <em>court </em>action\u201d (emphasis supplied), sets out the first component of the in-state review process; the following section, headed \"Certiorari \u2014 Findings conclusive \u2014 Exclusive jurisdiction of Supreme Court,\u201d continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-11\">Within thirty days after the application for a rehearing is denied, or if the application is granted, within thirty days after the rendition of the decision on rehearing, the applicant or any party to the proceeding deeming himself aggrieved by such order or decision rendered upon rehearing may apply to the [Utah] Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-16\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 54-7-16 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-17\">. PSC Rule 19 provides that an interested party may apply for PSC rehearing and sets out rules for the rehearing process. <em>See </em>Rule 19 of the Rules of Practice of the Public Service Commission of Utah \u00a7\u00a7 19.1, 19.2-.5. It further provides that \"within thirty days after the rendition of the decision on rehearing, any party to the proceeding deeming himself aggrieved by such order or decision, may apply to the [Utah] Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 19.6, and concludes by designating the record on review in the state supreme court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 19.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b821-5\">. It is, of course, a state\u2019s prerogative to specify rules, including administrative exhaustion requirements, governing access to the state\u2019s own tribunals. That, from all appearances, is precisely and only what Utah did in its PSC Rules of Practice and Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 54-7-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Congress authorized the ICC to hear the complaints of rail carriers, but not of shippers, regarding state-prescribed intrastate rates. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,501(c) (1982). Therefore, UPL, if discontent with the PSC\u2019s decision, would be obliged to seek relief within Utah, and in accordance with Utah procedure, as set out in PSC Rule 19 and Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 54-7-15. By contrast, UPL has petitioned this court for review of the ICC\u2019s decision, without asking for an ICC rehearing, because the federal law governing judicial review of ICC decisions requires no administrative rehearing petition. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10,327(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b821-10\">. Congress has written' into federal statutes a variety of prior-resort-to-state-forum requirements. <em>See, e.g., </em>Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, \u00a7 14(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633(b) (1982); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7 706(c), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(c) (1982). Each of these statutes provides that when a state or local agency has authority to grant or seek relief against the prohibited discrimination, a grievant may not pursue federal relief before pursuing state remedies for 60 days, or until the termination of state proceedings, whichever comes first. <em>See Oscar Mayer &amp; Co. v. Evans, </em>441 U.S. 750, 99 S.Ct. 2066, 60 L.Ed.2d 609 (1979) (ADEA); <em>Love v. Pullman Co., </em>404 U.S. 522, 92 S.Ct. 616, 30 L.Ed.2d 679 (1972) (Title VII). States may not tack onto this deferral rule procedural requirements of their own. <em>See, e.g., Oscar Mayer &amp; Co., supra </em>(grievant is not required to commence state proceedings within time limits specified by state law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b822-4\">. UPL twice incorrectly states that Judge Wilkey\u2019s opinion in <em>Carolina, C. &amp; O. Ry. v. ICC, </em>593 F.2d 1305, 1312-13 &amp; n. 43 (D.C.Cir.1979), recognizes \"that state administrative remedies [must] be exhausted before seeking ICC review.\u201d Brief of Petitioner at 18; <em>see </em>Reply Brief at 8-9. Judge Wilkey quoted a legislative report containing an offhand reference to exhaustion; his opinion characterized Congress' intent with respect to .the quoted reference as \u201cless obvious.\u201d He added that \"[o]f course, the precise effects of Congress\u2019 less obvious intentions ... are for another day.\u201d Moreover, the statutory provisions addressed in <em>Carolina, </em>the predecessor of current 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11,501(d), is not the one at issue here. Section 11,501(d), relating to railroad petitions to increase rates, provides, not for total exhaustion of state remedies, but only for a 120-day period in which state commissions have exclusive jurisdiction. After 120 days, a railroad may switch to the federal track immediately without awaiting even an initial state commission decision. Significantly, the <em>Carolina </em>opinion is the only case UPL cites in support of its bold but erroneous statements that this court (or any other federal tribunal) regards full exhaustion of state administrative remedies, including rehearing petitions, as a \"must\u201d before the ICC listens to a railroad\u2019s complaint about an intrastate rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">. The insubstantiality of UPL\u2019s reliance on PSC\u2019s provisional certification is all the more apparent when one compares the time-pressured temporary authorization that the ICC accorded to dozens of state agencies with the status of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Even after long consideration by bench and bar, promulgation by the Supreme Court, and an opportunity for Congress to act, a Federal Rule can be tested, in an adversary proceeding, for consistency with the Rules Enabling Act. <em>See Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co., </em>312 U.S. 1, 9-10, 61 S.Ct. 422, 424-25, 85 L.Ed. 479 (1941).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\">. Analogously, Congress has declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-9\">Except as otherwise expressly required' by statute, agency action otherwise final is final for the purposes of [judicial review] whether or not there has been presented or determined an application for ... any form of reconsideration!,] or, unless the agency otherwise requires by rule and provides that the action meanwhile is inoperative, for an appeal to superior agency authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 (1982) (Administrative Procedure Act). In some specific contexts, Congress has imposed a blanket agency rehearing petition prerequisite to judicial review of agency orders. <em>See </em>Federal Power Act, \u00a7 313, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825/ (1982). In others, it has required an agency rehearing petition only as to objections not earlier urged before the agency. <em>See </em>National Labor Relations Act, \u00a7 10(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1982).
