For the reasons stated below, the district court\u2019s order of dismissal is reversed, and the case remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-16\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-17\">On February 10, 1984, Mirella Adelman filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in federal district court, on behalf of her adult son, Daniel Lindsey Adelman, who is an adjudicated incompetent. David Graves, the named defendant, was appointed Daniel\u2019s temporary guardian in January 1982. As guardian, Graves had Daniel involuntarily committed to Harris County Hospital, and later to the Texas Research Institute of Mental Science. In her <em>pro se </em>complaint, Mirella Adelman alleged that Daniel had been falsely imprisoned and she sought Daniel\u2019s release from the hospital,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the lifting of an injunction obtained by Graves to bar Mirella Adelman\u2019s visits to Daniel, and relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for alleged violations of Daniel\u2019s civil rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to defendant Graves\u2019 response, the district court dismissed the complaint, <em>sua sponte, </em>after finding that Mirella Adelman did not have standing to represent Daniel because Daniel was an adult represented by a temporary guardian. This Court finds that the district court had authority to appoint a guardian ad litem or next friend, or to make any other order necessary to protect Daniel\u2019s interest in this litigation under Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(c). Consequently, the district court improperly dismissed the case with prejudice, without first determining whether Daniel\u2019s interests were adequately protected. The order below is accordingly reversed, and the case remanded for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>ther proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">The district court dismissed the instant complaint upon finding that Mirella Adelman lacked \u201cstanding to proceed in this action on behalf of Daniel L. Adelman.\u201d We construe this order to me\u00e1n that the district court found Mirella Adelman lacked the capacity to sue on her son\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, we are presented only with the narrow question of whether the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint with prejudice was proper. This Court concludes that dismissal with prejudice was inappropriate in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">In federal court, the issue of capacity to sue on behalf of an incompetent person is governed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(c). Rule 17(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-7\">Whenever an infant or incompetent person has a representative, such as a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other like fiduciary, the representative may sue or defend on behalf of the infant or incompetent person. If an infant or incompetent person does not have a duly appointed representative he may sue by his next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQn_\">On first blush, because Graves represented Daniel as his temporary, guardian, it might appear that no one but Graves could sue on Daniel\u2019s behalf. Graves correctly points out that the court\u2019s power to appoint a guardian ad litem or next friend<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under 17(c) is limited when the minor or incompetent has a legal representative. 6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 1570, at 774 (1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-12\">But the courts have consistently recognized that they have inherent power to appoint a guardian ad litem [or next friend] when it appears that the minor\u2019s [or incompetent person\u2019s] general representative has interests which may conflict with those of the person he is supposed to represent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\"><em>Hoffert v. General Motors Corp., </em>656 F.2d 161, 164 (5th Cir.1981) <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 961, 102 S.Ct. 2037, 72 L.Ed.2d 485 (1982); 6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-14\">Mirella Adelman\u2019s complaint on behalf of Daniel directly alleged that Graves failed in his representative capacity as Daniel\u2019s guardian. Taken at face value, the complaint showed a conflict of interest between Graves and Daniel Adelman. At that point, it was incumbent upon the district court to determine whether Daniel\u2019s interests were adequately protected by Graves\u2019 representation. 6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>at 775-76. Such an inquiry should be made on the court\u2019s own motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Roberts v. Ohio Casualty Insurance Co., </em>256 F.2d 35, 39 (5th Cir.1958). Appointment of a guardian ad litem or next friend is discretionary under Rule 17(c), provided that the district court enters a finding \u201cthat the interests of the [incompetent person] are adequately protected in the event it does not make such appointment.\u201d <em>M.S. v. Wermers, </em>557 F.2d 170, 175 (8th Cir.1977). <em>See Noe v. True, </em>507 F.2d 9, 11-12 (6th Cir.1974). No such findings were made in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-15\">In <em>Roberts v. Ohio Casualty Insurance Co., </em>this Court stated the general approach a district court should follow once it determines that a minor is inadequately repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>sented. That approach is equally valid when determining the need for representation of an incompetent person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Rule 17(c) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-6\">\u201cThe court <em>shall </em>appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action <em>or shall </em>make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcO\">Rule 17(c) does not make the appointment of a guardian ad litem mandatory. If the court feels that the infant\u2019s [or incompetent person\u2019s] interests are otherwise adequately represented and protected, a guardian ad litem need not be appointed. <em>Wescott v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>4 Cir., 1946, 158 F.2d 20. But the rule does not mean that a trial judge may ignore or overlook such a fundamental requirement for the protection of infants [or incompetent persons], We spell out the rule to mean: (1) as a matter of proper procedure, the court should usually appoint a guardian ad litem; (2) but the Court may, after weighing all the circumstances, issue such order as will protect the minor [or incompetent person] in lieu of appointment of a guardian ad litem; (3) and may even decide that such appointment is unnecessary, <em>though only after the Court has considered the matter and made a judicial determination that the infant [or incompetent person] is protected without a guardian.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">256 F.2d at 39 (emphasis added). <em>See also Noe v. True, </em>507 F.2d at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">While making these determinations the district court should consider that access to the courts by aggrieved persons should not be unduly limited, particularly, as in the instant case, where an incompetent person raises allegations of violations of his rights attributable to his custodians, and further alleges a failure to act on the part of his legal guardian. <em>See Seide v. Prevost, </em>536 F.Supp. 1121, 1132 (S.D.N.Y.1982); <em>Child v. Beame, </em>412 F.Supp. 593, 599 (S.D.N.Y.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">This Court does not hold that Mirella Adelman necessarily must be appointed as Daniel\u2019s representative in this litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is within the district court\u2019s discretion to determine Daniel\u2019s need for representation, and who may best fill that need. <em>See Developmental Disabilities Advocacy Center, Inc. v. Melton, </em>689 F.2d 281, 285 (1st Cir.1982); <em>M.S. v. Wermers, </em>557 F.2d at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">We hold only that the district court\u2019s primary concern in the instant case must be to assure, under Rule 17(c), that Daniel\u2019s interests in vindicating his statutory and constitutional rights are properly protected. Accordingly, the order of dismissal is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-13\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">. We construe this request to be a request for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1063-13\">. These alleged violations include allegations of physical and sexual abuse of Daniel at the institution where he was committed, as well as allegations of overmedication at the institution which resulted in physical injuries to Daniel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">. The complaint made it clear that Daniel Adelman was the real party in interest. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 17(a). As the real party in interest, Daniel clearly had standing to assert the instant claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">. Technically, an incompetent plaintiff sues by a \"next friend,\" while an incompetent defendant defends by a \"guardian ad litem,\u201d but the duties and powers of the representative are identical regardless of which title is applied. <em>Dacanay v. Mendoza, </em>573 F.2d 1075, 1076 n. 1 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1064-17\">. This is particularly true, where the pleadings challenging the guardian\u2019s representation were filed <em>pro se, </em>as they were in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">. We do note however that Mirella Adelman appears to have had the capacity to represent Daniel at the time this case was dismissed. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(b) and 1983 Tex.Sess.Law.Serv., ch. 755 at 4553; Tex.Prob.Code Ann. \u00a7 113; Tex.Prob.Code Ann. \u00a7 31 (providing for suits brought by a next friend on behalf of an infant or incompetent). <em>See also Slade v. Louisiana Power and Light Co., </em>418 F.2d 125 (5th Cir.1969) <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1007, 90 S.Ct. 1233, 25 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970); <em>Quada v. Quada, </em>396 S.W.2d 232, 234 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Texarkana 1965, no writ); <em>McGinnis v. McGinnis, </em>267 S.W.2d 432 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014San Antonio 1954, no writ).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">. Graves argues that the request for habeas corpus relief is moot because Daniel is now released from the hospital, and that any conflict between Daniel and his guardian is moot because a new guardian has been appointed! Any claims Daniel has against Graves are not moot. Moreover, it is not clear from the record that the request for habeas relief is moot. <em>See Justin v. Jacobs, </em>449 F.2d 1017 (D.C.Cir.1971). Consequently, we leave these issues to the district court to determine on remand. Graves further argues that he did not act under color of state law while acting as Daniel\u2019s guardian. Consequently, he argues, no section 1983 claims can properly be brought against him. Graves\u2019 arguments go to the merits of this action which are not before this Court at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
