GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b560-22\">The issue presented in this appeal is whether a farmer who files a petition under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1146 (1982), but fails to submit a reorganization plan within 120 days from filing is thereafter vulnerable to a liquidation plan filed by a party in interest to the chapter 11 proceeding. We conclude that a bankruptcy court may confirm a liquidation plan in such a situation, and therefore we affirm the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> judgment approving the bankruptcy court\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> confirmation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-23\">The appellant, Button Hook Cattle Company, is a family corporation engaged in the business of raising crops and cattle. On July 19,1982, Button Hook filed a chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy court. Although the petition indicates that Button Hook intended to file a reorganization plan, it failed to do so within 120 days after filing the petition<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and did not seek an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>extension. Thereafter, on December 21, 1982, the appellee, Commercial National Bank and Trust Company, Button Hook\u2019s principal creditor, filed a creditor\u2019s plan of reorganization which called for the sale of all of the debtor\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">On January 24,1983, Button Hook filed a motion to dismiss the chapter 11 proceeding. The bankruptcy court denied the motion, finding that Button Hook failed to show cause for the dismissal or that it would be in the, best interest of creditors and the estate to dismiss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Button Hook did not appeal the denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Button Hook then filed an objection to the proposed liquidation plan, arguing that the Bankruptcy Court exempts farmers from involuntary liquidations under chapter 11. The court rejected this argument, reasoning that a farmer who files a voluntary chapter 11 petition is subject to the same benefits and risks that other chapter 11 debtors face, including the risk that if he fails to file a plan within the exclusive 120-day period, a creditor may thereafter propose a liquidation plan. Following a hearing at which the creditors voted in favor of the liquidation plan, the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">On appeal, the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that liquidation plans can be confirmed over the objection of farmer-debtors, noting that the Code section which allows creditors to file liquidation plans in chapter 11 proceedings, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1123(b)(4), has no exception for farmer-debtors. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Button Hook persists in its argument that the Code implicitly exempts farmers from chapter 11 liquidation proceedings. It relies on three Code sections to support its argument. First, section 303(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> precludes the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition against a farmer under both chapters 7 and 11. The parties do not dispute that Button Hook is a farmer within the meaning of the Code. Second, section 1112(c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prohibits the involuntary conversion of a chapter 11 case to a chapter 7 liquidation if the debtor is a farmer. Finally, Button Hook emphasizes that section 1112(e)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> prohibits a bankruptcy court from doing indirectly what it cannot do directly: converting a farmer\u2019s chapter 11 proceeding to a chapter 7 liquidation, without the farmer\u2019s consent, by means of a liquidation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">In a recent decision, <em>In re Jasik, </em>727 F.2d 1379 (5th Cir.1984), the Fifth Circuit examined the same arguments that Button Hook presents in this case and held that chapter 11 liquidation plans may be confirmed over the objection of farmer-debtors. As in this case, the farmer-debtors in <em>Jasik </em>filed a chapter 11 petition but did not submit a reorganization plan within the first 120 days, after which the bankruptcy court confirmed a liquidation plan over their objection. <em>Id. </em>at 1380-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">The <em>Jasik </em>court examined the legislative history of section 1121, which gives the chapter 11 debtor the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan within the first 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>days but which allows other parties in interest to file a plan thereafter if the debtor fails to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1381. Congress drafted section 1121 in response to a problem it saw in the earlier law. Under chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, only the debtor could propose a business reorganization plan. This arrangement gave the debtor \u201cundue bargaining leverage, because by delay he * * * [could] force a settlement out of otherwise unwilling creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 231, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5963, 6191). As Congress explained, by granting creditors authority to propose a plan if the debtor has failed to do so within the first 120 days, section 1121(c) \u201cserves to eliminate the potential harm and disadvantages to creditors and democratizes the reorganization process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1382 (quoting <em>Bankruptcy Act Revision, </em>Serial No. 27, Part 3, <em>Hearings on H.R. 31 and H.R. 32 before the Subcomm. on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the Comm, on the Judiciary, </em>94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Moreover, Congress envisioned that creditors would propose liquidation plans in chapter 11 proceedings but did not except farmer-debtors from such plans. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1123(a)(5)(D), (b)(4)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; Sen.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 119, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5905. We do not believe that this failure to except farmers was a mere oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The Bankruptcy Code does give farmers special <em>defensive </em>protection by excepting them from involuntary chapter 7 liquidations, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(a), and involuntary conversions to chapter 7, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1112(c). However, as the <em>Jasik </em>court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-14\">[N]owhere in the statutory language or in legislative history is there evidence of any congressional intent to confer on a farmer the <em>offensive </em>capability to initiate a Chapter 11 proceeding which both stays collection by creditors and allows him, by refusing to file, to block the submission of a plan of liquidation. To the contrary, Congress has expressed the intent that debtors in voluntary bankruptcy should not be able, by merely withholding affirmative action, to suspend creditors\u2019 rights indefinitely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">727 F.2d at 1381 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">We agree with the <em>Jasik </em>court that farmers are treated the same as other chapter 11 debtors in determining who can file a reorganization plan. <em>See id. </em>at 1382. Under section 1121(c)(2), if the farmer fails to propose a plan within the first 120 days, any party in interest may file a plan, including a liquidation plan, that may be confirmed over the farmer\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">Button Hook relies on <em>In re Blanton Smith Corp., </em>7 B.R. 410 (Bankr.M.D.Tenn.1980), to support its position that a bankruptcy court may not confirm a liquidation plan over a farmer-debtor\u2019s objection. In that case the court stated, without explanation, that a creditor cannot compel a farmer\u2019s liquidation under chapter 7 or chapter 11. <em>Id. </em>at 414. There is a split among the bankruptcy courts on this question. <em>Compare In re J.F. Toner &amp; Son, Inc., </em>40 B.R. 461 (Bankr.W.D.Va.1984) (liquidation plans may be confirmed over farmer-debtor\u2019s objection) <em>and In re Tinsley, </em>36 B.R. 807 (Bankr.W.D.Ky.1984) (same) <em>with In re Lange, </em>39 B.R. 483 (Bankr.D.Kan.1984) (li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>quidation plans can only be confirmed with consent of farmer-debtor) <em>and In re Blanton Smith Corp., </em>7 B.R. at 414 (same). We have considered these cases and find the reasoning in <em>Jasik </em>the most persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision approving the bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\">.
