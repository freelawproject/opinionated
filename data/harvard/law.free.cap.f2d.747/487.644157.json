Cassidy now appeals from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> judgment approving the bankruptcy court\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> confirmation of a liquidation plan over Cassidy\u2019s objection. For reversal, Cassidy argues that because farmers enjoy a favored status under the Bankruptcy Code, when a farmer files a voluntary chapter 11 petition a bankruptcy court may not confirm a liquidation plan without the farmer\u2019s consent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A8R\">When Cassidy filed its chapter 11 petition in July 1982, it indicated that it intended to file a reorganization plan. It failed to do so within 120 days from the date of filing, however, and did not seek an extern sion. Thereafter, on December 21, 1982, Commercial National Bank and Trust Company, Cassidy\u2019s principal creditor, filed a creditor\u2019s plan of reorganization which called for the sale of all of Cassidy\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"AWb\">The proceedings, rulings, and arguments in the bankruptcy and district courts were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>nearly identical to those outlined in a ease we have decided today, <em>In re Button Hook Cattle Co., </em>747 F.2d 483 (8th Cir.1984). The same issues are raised on this appeal. In <em>In Re Button Hook Cattle Co. </em>we examined the same issue presented in this case: whether a farmer who files a chapter 11 petition but fails to submit a reorganization plan within 120 days from filing is thereafter vulnerable to a liquidation plan filed by a party in interest to the chapter 11 proceeding. We held there that in such a situation a bankruptcy court may confirm a liquidation plan over the objection of the farmer-debtor. Our decision in <em>In re Button Hook Cattle Co. </em>governs this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision approving the bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AZaV\">.
