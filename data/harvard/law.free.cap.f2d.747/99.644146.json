Telesca, <em>Judge, </em>dismissing for lack of standing its suit against defendant' SCM Corporation (\u201cSCM\u201d) for discharge of excessive pollutants into a tributary of Wolcott Creek in Wolcott, New York, in violation of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251-1376 (1982) (the \u201cAct\u201d). In an opinion reported at 580 F.Supp. 862 (1984), the court held that Sierra lacked standing to bring suit under \u00a7 505 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365, because Sierra neither alleged that it suffered an appropriate \u201cinjury in fact\u201d nor identified any of its members alleged to have suffered such injury. On appeal, Sierra argues principally that, as an organization committed to preventing unpermitted pollution of the aquatic environment, it has been given standing by the Act to bring suit, and that any requirement that it identify a Sierra Club member injured by SCM\u2019s alleged pollution would violate that member\u2019s First Amendment rights to privacy and freedom of association. SCM cross-appeals, urging that if we conclude that plaintiff has standing, we should reverse the district court\u2019s denial of SCM\u2019s motion under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(b)(1)(B) to dismiss on the ground that state proceedings on the same facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>have deprived the federal court of jurisdiction. For the reasons below, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we therefore dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">According to the complaint, Sierra is a national nonprofit conservation organization with more than 300,000 members dedicated to protecting natural resources, including water. SCM, through its Durkee Famous Foods Division (\u201cDurkee\u201d), owns and operates an onion and potato processing plant in Wolcott, New York. SCM has a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System/State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES/SPDES\u201d) permit, issued pursuant to \u00a7 402 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342, allowing it to discharge limited amounts of pollutants. The complaint alleged that SCM had repeatedly discharged into a tributary of Wolcott Creek pollutants in volumes exceeding those allowed by its permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Sierra predicated federal jurisdiction on \u00a7 505 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365, which authorizes a citizen to bring a suit in the district court \"on his own behalf\u201d against a person alleged to be in violation of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sierra set out its interest in the present suit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-14\">Members of the Sierra Club reside in New York, in the vicinity of the unnamed tributary of Wolcott Creek into which Defendant\u2019s wastes are discharged, or own property or recreate in, on or near' the unnamed tributary of Wolcott Creek. The quality of the nation\u2019s waters and the waters of the State of New York directly affects the health, economic, recreational, aesthetic, and environmental interest of the Sierra Club\u2019s members. The interests of Sierra Club\u2019s members have been, are being and will be adversely affected by the Defendant SCM Corporation \u2014 Durkee Famous Foods Division\u2019s failure to comply with its NPDES/SPDES permit requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlM\">(Complaint 1\u00cd 7.) Sierra requested declaratory and injunctive relief; the imposition on SCM of civil penalties of $10,000 per day of violation, payable to the government; and an award to Sierra of costs, including fees for attorneys, witnesses, and consultants.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">SCM moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>lacked jurisdiction by reason of the conclusion of state proceedings on the same facts. It asserted that prior to the present suit, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (\u201cNYDEC\u201d) had commenced an administrative proceeding against SCM resulting in the entry against SCM of a consent order resolving all of the violations alleged in Sierra\u2019s complaint. SCM argued that Sierra\u2019s action was thus precluded by \u00a7 505(b)(1)(B) of the Act, 83 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(b)(1)(B), <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>which provides that a private civil action may not be maintained if the appropriate state agency has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action in state or federal court to require compliance with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The district court denied SCM\u2019s motion to dismiss, in an opinion reported at 572 F.Supp. 828 (1983), and a number of procedural maneuvers followed. SCM sought certification of the jurisdiction issue for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Sierra responded with a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of SCM\u2019s liability. SCM then served on Sierra a set of \u201cInterrogatories Related to Standing,\u201d requesting identification of each Sierra Club member who resided, owned property, or recreated in the vicinity of the tributary; or whose health or economic, recreation, or aesthetic interests had been adversely affected by its pollution. For each person listed in response, SCM asked the dates and places of the uses made of the tributary and the manner in which SCM\u2019s conduct had affected those uses. Sierra did not answer the interrogatories, but instead sought a protective order and moved for partial summary judgment on the standing issue. Sierra contended that the interrogatories were burdensome and irrelevant and would be moot upon the granting of Sierra\u2019s motions for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In support of its motion on the standing issue, Sierra submitted the affidavit of its litigation coordinator, stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that more than 2,200 members of Sierra resided within 70 miles of the Durkee plant and that one Sierra member resided in Wolcott. Sierra also submitted copies of its bylaws and other materials describing its activities and the manner in which it decided to undertake litigation. In response, SCM argued that, as Sierra apparently did not intend to come forth with any factual showing of injury to itself or to identify any of its members claimed to suffer injury as a result of the alleged pollution, Sierra\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of standing should be denied, and summary judgment on that issue should be entered in favor of SCM., At oral argument, Sierra argued that it had standing because it was interested in preserving the environment, that harm to Sierra was shown simply by the failure of SCM to comply with the Act; and that Congress had given any person with an interest such as that of Sierra a right to sue any person alleged to have violated the Act. Sierra indicated that it did not intend to identify any of its members who might have been harmed by the alleged violation. After hypothesizing the burdens to any member so identified and subjected to discovery proceedings, counsel for Sierra responded as follows to probing by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">THE COURT: But there is no question that you haven\u2019t identified the parties who are harmed, nor do you intend to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">MR. ROISMAN: Let me be clear about this Your Honor. Our position is that the parties who have been harmed do not have to be identified for any legitimate purposes the defendant has____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">(Transcript of hearing, February 23, 1984, at 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The district judge rejected Sierra\u2019s arguments and ruled that it lacked standing to bring the suit. Relying on <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), the court concluded that since \u201cplaintiff has failed to show that any particular member of its organization has or may be adversely affected in any specific way by defendant\u2019s actions,\u201d Sierra\u2019s assertions of injury in fact were unsupported. 580 F.Supp. at 865. Accordingly, the court denied Sierra\u2019s motions for summary judgment. On the premise that \u201cit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>would be a poor utilization of judicial resources to allow plaintiff yet another chance to come forward with\u201d factual support, the court dismissed the complaint. <em>Id. </em>Sierra promptly appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">On appeal, Sierra contends that Congress intended \u00a7 505 of the Act to confer standing on an organization such as Sierra to bring suit on the basis of its institutional interest in the preservation of the environment and that that institutional interest constitutes \u201cinjury in fact\u201d within the meaning of standing doctrine. It also contends that any requirement that it disclose the names of members directly injured by the alleged pollution would violate the First Amendment rights of those individuals to privacy and freedom of association. SCM has cross-appealed, contending that the district court should have granted its motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in light of the NYDEC consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">For the reasons below, we conclude that a genera] interest in environmental preservation as shown here by Sierra does not constitute injury in fact or satisfy the standing requirements of the Act. Any contention that Sierra is excused from making a proper showing of injury in fact by reason of the First Amendment rights of its members has been waived by Sierra\u2019s failure to make such an argument in the district court. We thus affirm the dismissal of the complaint for lack of standing. We dismiss SCM\u2019s cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">A. <em>The Standing Requirement of \u00a7 505</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The doctrine of standing in the federal courts delimits the persons who are permitted to challenge the legality of an act. The doctrine is informed by constitutional, prudential, and legislative concerns. The constitutional limits on standing are grounded in the requirement of Article III that the federal courts adjudicate only actual cases or controversies, <em>e.g., Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 37-38, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1923-1924, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), and such limitations require that the would-be plaintiff show injury in fact, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthat he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,\u201d <em>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. 91, 99, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1607, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979). Prudential concerns may further limit the class of those permitted to sue, as where \u201cthe judiciary seeks to avoid deciding questions of broad social import where no individual rights would be vindicated,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 99-100, 99 S.Ct. at 1607-1608, and thus requires that the plaintiff\u2019s injury be \u201cpeculiar to himself or to a distinct group of which he is a part, rather than one \u2018shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 100, 99 S.Ct. at 1608 (quoting <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975)). . Finally, Congress may grant a right to sue to those who meet the constitutional limitations on standing but who might otherwise be barred by prudential limitations. <em>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. at 100, 99 S.Ct. at 1608. Congress may not, however, \u201cabrogate the Art. Ill minima: A plaintiff must always have suffered \u2018a distinct and palpable injury to himself,\u2019 ... that is likely to be redressed if the requested relief is granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. at 2206, and citing <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. at 38, 96 S.Ct. at 1924); <em>accord Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 472-73, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758-59, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Sierra contends that it has standing under \u00a7 505 of the Act. Evaluation of its contention requires consideration of whether the Act evinces an intention by Congress to confer standing on groups such as Sierra and whether such a bestowal, if inferrable, is consistent with the Article III minima.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Section 505(a) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cany citizen may commence a civil action on his own behalf\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>against a person alleged to have violated the Act. Section 505(g) provides that the term \u201ccitizen,\u201d as used in \u00a7 505(a), \u201cmeans a person or persons having an interest which is or may be adversely affected.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(g). The legislative history of this provision, discussed in greater detail below, reveals that Congress intended these provisions to confer standing in accordance with the principles set out in the then-recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972) <em>(\u201cMorton\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In <em>Morton, </em>Sierra sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the proposed construction of recreational facilities in a quasi-wilderness park area. It brought its suit against the United States Secretary of the Interior under \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (1982), which provided that \u201c[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d The injury alleged by Sierra was that the development of the recreational facilities \u201cwould destroy or otherwise adversely affect the scenery, natural and historic objects and wildlife of the park and would impair the enjoyment of the park for future generations.\u201d <em>Morton, </em>405 U.S. at 734, 92 S.Ct. at 1365. The Court had no doubt that this type of <em>harm </em>\u2014 i.e., injury to aesthetic and environmental well being, as contrasted with injury to economic interests \u2014 could amount to \u201cinjury in fact\u201d sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 10 of the APA. 405 U.S. at 734, 92 S.Ct. at 1365. It concluded, however, that Sierra had not shown injury in fact because it had failed to allege that it or any of its members used the park or would be affected in any of their activities or pastimes by the proposed development. The Court stated that \u201cthe \u2018injury in fact\u2019 test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734-35, 92 S.Ct. at 1365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The <em>Morton </em>Court recognized that an organization whose members were injured could sue on their behalf; but it ruled that an organization whose members were not injured but merely interested could not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">[A] mere \u201cinterest in a problem,\u201d no matter how longstanding the interest and no matter how qualified the organization is in evaluating the problem, is not sufficient by itself to render the organization \u201cadversely affected\u201d or \u201caggrieved\u201d within the meaning of the APA. The Sierra Club is a large and long-established organization, with a historic commitment to the cause of protecting our Nation\u2019s natural heritage from man\u2019s depredations. But if a \u201cspecial interest\u201d in this subject were enough to entitle the Sierra Club to commence this litigation, there would appear to be no objective basis upon which to disallow a suit by any other bona fide \u201cspecial interest\u201d organization, however small or short-lived. And if any group with a bona fide \u201cspecial interest\u201d could initiate such litigation, it is difficult to perceive why any individual citizen with the same bona fide special interest would not also be entitled to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">The requirement that a party seeking review must allege facts showing that he is himself adversely affected does not insulate executive action from judicial review, nor does it prevent any public interests from being protected through the judicial process. It does serve as at least a rough attempt to put the decision as to whether review will be sought in the hands of those who have a direct stake in the outcome. That goal would be undermined were we to construe the APA to authorize judicial review at the behest of organizations or individuals who seek to do no more than vindicate their own value preferences through the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 739-40, 92 S.Ct. at 1368-69 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Shortly after the Supreme Court decided <em>Morton, </em>Congress passed the Clean Water Act. The standing provision of \u00a7 505 was fashioned by a Conference Committee, and the report of the Committee stated \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>understanding of the conferees that the conference substitute relating to the definition of the term \u2018citizen\u2019 reflects the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of <em>Sierra Club v. </em>Morton.\u201d S.Conf.Rep. No. 1236, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 146, <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3776, 3823, <em>and in </em>1 Senate Comm. on Public Works, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., <em>A Legislative History of the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, </em>at 281, 329 (1973) [hereinafter cited as \u201cLegislative History\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The floor debate in the House regarding the Conference Report elaborated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">The House bill \u2014 H.R. 11896 \u2014 severely restricted the citizen suit provision in its definition of the term \u201ccitizen.\u201d This is noted on page 134 of the House committee\u2019s report ... as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">Subsection (g) defines the term \u201ccitizen\u201d to mean (1) a citizen of the geographic area having a direct interest which is or may be affected and (2) any group of persons which has been actively engaged in the administrative process and has thereby shown a special interest in the geographic area in controversy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">But the conferees, quite properly, abandoned this restrictive language in favor of language defining a citizen as \u201ca person or persons having an interest which is or may be adversely affected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">This language is based on section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 702, and the interpretation given to that section by the Supreme Court in <em>Sierra Club v. </em>Morton____ The case was decided in April 1972, 3 weeks after H.R. 11896 passed the House in March 1972 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">In Sierra Club, the Supreme Court held that under the APA \u201cthe party seeking review\u201d must himself be \u201camong the injured\u201d by the action or inaction complained of. Most importantly, the Court held that noneconomic injury to an environmental interest is sufficient to meet the APA test____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">The conferees followed the Court\u2019s opinion. A citizen suit may be brought under the conference agreement by those persons or groups which are among those whose environmental \u2014 that is, esthetic, conservational, ... \u2014 interest is or may be injured by a violation of the act or a failure to perform a duty under the act which is the basis of the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">1 Legislative History, <em>supra, </em>at 249-50 (remarks of Rep. Dingell).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">The legislative history thus leads to the conclusion that \u00a7 505(g)\u2019s definition of \u201ccitizen\u201d as a \u201cperson or persons having an interest which is or may be adversely affected,\u201d means those who can claim injury in fact within the meaning of <em>Morton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">Sierra urges us to reach the contrary conclusion on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that, in adopting \u00a7 505, Congress rejected the earlier House proposal that was more restrictive, and that a statement by Senator Muskie, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution, suggested that a person need only have an interest in the matter in litigation in order to bring suit. We have considered all of the arguments made by Sierra and find none of them persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-17\">The fact that the Conference rejected the House version, which would have permitted suits only by citizens of the geographic area who were directly affected or by groups that had been involved in administrative proceedings with respect to the challenged activity, did not mean that the Conference abandoned all restrictions. The Conference report and the floor statement set forth above plainly demonstrate that Congress was adopting the constraints set forth in <em>Morton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-18\">Sierra\u2019s contention that Senators Muskie and Bayh \u201csummarized the essence of Section 505 as it was agreed to in conference\u201d (Sierra brief on appeal at 30) is likewise flawed. In support, Sierra quotes to us the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Mr. BAYH____ Would an interest in a clean environment which would be invaded by a violation of the [Act] or a permit thereunder \u2014 be an \u201cinterest\u201d for purposes of this section?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF\">Mr. MUSKIE. That is the intent of the conference ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\"><em>(Id.; </em>ellipses in brief). Senator Muskie\u2019s oral response did not end there, however. He stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">That is the intent of the conference, as I am sure the Senator from Indiana well knows. The conference report states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al4\">\u201cIt is the understanding of the conferees that the conference substitute relating to the definition of the term \u201ccitizen\u201d reflects the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Sierra Club v. Morton (No. 70-34, April 19, 1972).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">In the Sierra Club case, the Supreme Court was asked to interpret section 10 of the Administrative Procedures [sic] Act \u2014 5 U.S.C., section 702 \u2014 which contains wording similar to that of section 505(g) of the conference bill. The Supreme Court emphasized that \u201cthe <em>interest alleged to have been injured </em>may reflect aesthetic conservational and recreational as well as economic values.\u201d The Court also said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">\u201cAesthetic and environmental well-being, like economic well-being, are important ingredients of the quality of life in our society, and the fact that particular environmental interests are shared by the many rather than the few does not make them less deserving of legal protection through the legal process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">Thus it is clear that under the language agreed to by the conference, a noneconomic interest in the environment, in clean water, is a sufficient base for a citizen suit under section 505.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">Further, every citizen of the United States has a legitimate and established interest in the use and quality of the navigable waters of the United States. Thus, I would presume that a citizen of the United States, regardless of residence, would have an interest as defined in this bill regardless of the location of the waterway and regardless of the issue involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">1 Legislative History, <em>supra, </em>at 221 (emphasis added). Taken in context, we regard Senator Muskie\u2019s remarks as endorsing the view that Congress was incorporating into \u00a7 505 Morton\u2019s view of standing, <em>i.e., </em>that although the interest might be noneconomic, the plaintiff had to show that his own interest Was injured. Further, Senator Muskie made this view unmistakably clear in a written statement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-14\">In <em>Sierra Club, </em>the Supreme Court held that under the A.P.A. the <em>party seeking review must itself be among those injured </em>by the action or inaction complained of____ Thus <em>under the language agreed to by the Conference a citizen suit may be brought only by those persons or groups which are among those whose interest </em>(whether environmental or economic) <em>is or may be injured </em>by the violation of the Act which is the basis of the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">1 Legislative History, <em>supra, </em>at 161, 179 (written remarks of Senator Muskie to Senate upon presentation of Conference Report; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">If there were a conflict between the remarks of a single legislator and the statement in the legislative committee\u2019s formal report on enactment of the provision, we would regard the formal report as controlling. <em>See Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 311, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1722, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). Here we regard both the Conference report and the views of Senator Muskie as consistently demonstrating that standing under \u00a7 505 was intended to be limited to those who can show that their interest, whether environmental or economic, is or may be injured by the alleged violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">This interpretation of \u00a7 505 is supported by the ruling of the Supreme Court in <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Association, </em>453 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981). There, in construing \u00a7 505, the Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>it is clear that the citizen-suit provisions apply only to persons who can claim some sort of injury ____ \u201cCitizen\u201d is defined in the citizen-suit section of the [Act] as \u201ca person or persons having an interest which is or may be adversely affected.\u201d \u00a7 505(g), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(g). It is clear from the Senate Conference Report that this phrase was intended by Congress to allow suits by all persons possessing standing under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). See S.Conf.Rep. No. 92-1236, p. 146 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 16-17, 101 S.Ct. at 2624-2625.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that Sierra could establish standing under \u00a7 505 only by showing actual injury within the meaning of <em>Morton, </em>by, for example, providing a concrete indication that Sierra or one or more of its members used the Wolcott Creek tributary or would be affected by its pollution. Sierra has, however, refused to come forward with any such showing, asserting only that it has members residing within a 70-mile radius of the tributary and one member living in Wolcott, and preferring to rest its standing claim on its contention that an injury to its interests is established by any violation of the Act. Here, as in <em>Morton, </em>\u201c[t]he Club apparently regardfs] any allegations of individualized injury as superfluous, on the theory that this was a \u2018public action involving questions as to the use of natural resources, and the Club\u2019s longstanding concern with and expertise in such matters were sufficient to give it standing as a \u2018representative of the public.\u2019 \u201d 405 U.S. at 736, 92 S.Ct. at 1367 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court squarely rejected this basis for standing, and we are constrained to do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">B. <em>The First Amendment Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">Sierra argues in this Court that it should be excused from having to identify any of its members whose interests have been or may be injured by the alleged violations on the grounds that such disclosure would pose an unreasonable burden by subjecting the members to depositions and court appearances and would thereby offend the members\u2019 First Amendment rights to privacy and freedom of association. This contention need not detain us long, since Sierra did not raise it before the district court. Neither Sierra\u2019s motion for a protective order permitting it to delay answering or objecting to the interrogatories served on it by SCM nor its arguments to the district court on the motions for summary judgment made any suggestion that Sierra was asserting a constitutional privilege. Sierra argued only questions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>burden and relevance. The First Amendment contentions have thus been waived. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Di Stefano, </em>555 F.2d 1094, 1100 n. 5 (2d Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Rollins, </em>522 F.2d 160, 165 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 918, 96 S.Ct. 1122, 47 L.Ed.2d 324 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">C. <em>Appellate Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Finally, Sierra appears to urge that if we agree with the district judge's view that it has not shown standing, we should give Sierra an opportunity to provide additional information about its members in order to meet the injury in fact requirements. We decline to grant Sierra this relief. Sierra never indicated to the district judge that it would provide such information if the judge ruled that that was the only condition on which Sierra would be allowed to pursue this litigation. Indeed, on explicit questioning by the court during the oral argument of the summary judgment motions, Sierra\u2019s counsel confirmed the court\u2019s understanding that Sierra would refuse to provide such information. Nor did Sierra alter its stance after the court ordered the entry of summary judgment against it, by seeking a modification of the order to provide that Sierra could disclose the required information and thus pursue the suit. Instead, a week after the .order was entered, Sierra filed this appeal. We have little doubt that had Sierra requested such a modification of the order the district court would have granted it. Such an order, however, would not have been appealable, and we regard Sierra\u2019s strategy of bypassing its opportunities to obtain relief in the district court and requesting such relief on appeal as an attempt to circumvent the final-judgment rule. We decline to reward such an attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint is affirmed. The cross-appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">. Section 505 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365, provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\u00a7 1365.

Sierra relies heavily on the decision in <em>RITE-Research Improves the Environment, Inc. v. Costle, </em>650 F.2d 1312, 1319-21 (5th Cir.1981), for the proposition that the Act gave it standing to sue for any violation. The statements on which Sierra relies were based largely on the reasoning of the Third Circuit in the <em>Sea Clammers </em>case, which was thoroughly rejected by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>453 U.S. at 14-17, 101 S.Ct. at 2623-2625.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Sierra also argues that the Act confers upon it the status of a \"private attorney general\u201d who need not show injury in order to bring suit. This argument misunderstands the role of a private attorney general by confusing the question of the nature of the plaintiffs interest with the issue of whether injury to that interest has been shown. The Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Sea Clammers </em>that private attorneys general differ from other plaintiffs not because they need not show injury, as Sierra contends, but because their \"injuries are \u2018noneconomic\u2019 and probably noncompensable.\u201d 453 U.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. at 2624. The Court made clear that even private attorneys general must show injury in fact, stating that \"Congress intended the limitations imposed on citizen suits to apply to all private suits under the [ ] Act[ <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-15\">. Compare <em>Morton, </em>in which Sierra had refused to show injury in fact, with <em>United States v.

The Supreme Court recognized SCRAP\u2019S standing, noting that the group claimed that its members used the area recreationally. <em>Id. </em>at 683-90, 93 S.Ct. at 2413-17.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
