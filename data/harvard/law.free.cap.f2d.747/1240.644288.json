Both cases involve whether research on and disclosure of the potential carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic effects of the herbicides is required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4331-4335 (1976) (NEPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">The district court enjoined portions of both the BLM spraying program for the Eugene District of Oregon in <em>Save Our Ecosystems v. Clark </em>(SOS) and the USFS program for the State of Oregon in <em>Merrell v. Block </em>(Merrell). We affirm the district court\u2019s holdings in the two cases that the USFS and the BLM violated NEPA and the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). However, we modify the injunctions to enjoin all spraying until the agencies comply with NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-15\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-16\">\n<em>A. SOS v. Clark.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-17\">In 1978 the BLM prepared a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) entitled \u201cVegetation Management With Herbicides: Western Oregon, 1978-1987.\u201d The statement discussed the environmental impacts of a ten-year program of herbicide spraying,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> intended to destroy undergrowth thereby increasing the growth rate of conifers. The PEIS was to be supplemented annually by an environmental assessment (EA), upon which would be based the decision whether to spray in the succeeding year, and, if so, how the spraying would be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-18\">In 1979 an organization called Southern Oregon Citizens Against Toxic Sprays <em>(SO-CA!S) </em>filed suit to enjoin the BLM from spraying in the Medford District. In that case, Judge Frye enjoined the spraying because the BLM had failed to prepare a \u201cworst case analysis\u201d (WCA) under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1981). That decision was affirmed by this court. <em>See Southern Oregon Citizens Against Toxic Sprays v. Clark, </em>720 F.2d 1475 (9th Cir.1983) <em>(SOCATS).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-19\">In response to the district court decision in <em>SOCATS, </em>the BLM prepared a worst case analysis of its spraying program for the Eugene district. The plaintiffs in this case challenge its adequacy. Judge Belloni agreed with plaintiffs, but limited the injunction to prohibiting aerial spraying in a portion of the district and granted defendant\u2019s motion to stay the injunction pending appeal. We vacated the stay and reinstated the original injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-20\">\n<em>B. Merrell v. Block.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-21\">The <em>Merrell </em>case arises out of the USFS spraying program for its forests in Oregon, a program very similar to that of the BLM. In 1978 the Forest Service prepared a PEIS on \u201cVegetation Management With Herbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>cides\u201d covering the Pacific Northwest Region.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The PEIS was to be supplemented annually by an EA. Soon after spraying commenced in 1979, numerous and serious health problems were reported in the Five Rivers Valley, including spontaneous abortions, birth defects in humans and animals, and various other illnesses. The EPA began an investigation into these problems, but the Forest Service declined requests by the county health department and board of commissioners to delay the spraying.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Forest Service conducted no research of its own into these problems and, in its 1981 EA, concluded that the continued use of the herbicides would have no significant impact on the human environment and declined to prepare an EIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">In 1981 Paul Merrell, a resident of the Five Rivers area of the Suislaw National Forest, filed a suit seeking an injunction against further spraying in that national forest. In response to cross-motions for summary judgment Judge Belloni held that the Forest Service could not rely solely on research done incident to the EPA registration of the chemicals under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 136-136y (FIFRA), and that the Forest Service must address the health effects of using the herbicides in the area to be sprayed. As in <em>SOS, </em>Judge Belloni enjoined only a portion of the spraying program and denied the motions of 42 additional individuals and organizations to intervene. They sought to broaden the injunction to prevent spraying in the areas where they lived (the injunction was limited to the area where the plaintiffs lived).</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\">\n<em>I. SOS v. Clark.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-12\">\n<em>A. Worst Case Analysis.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-13\">\n<em>1. NEPA Requires Analysis of Uncertain Risks.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-14\">CEQ regulations require an EIS to contain a \u201cworst ease analysis\u201d when \u201cthe information relevant to adverse impacts is essential ... and is not known and the overall costs of obtaining it are exorbitant or ... the information ... is important and the means to obtain it are not known____\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1981).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1319-17\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.27(b)(5) (1981) requires a similar analysis, although it is not specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>cally labelled a \u201cworst case analysis.\u201d NEPA requires an impact statement for \u201cmajor federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment ....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C) (1976). The CEQ defines \u201csignificantly\u201d to include considerations of both context and intensity, and states th\u00e1t \u201cintensity\u201d includes \u201c[t]he degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.27(b)(5) (1981). <em>See Foundation for North American Wild Sheep v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em>681 F.2d 1172, 1182 n. 47 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">These regulations are binding on the BLM and entitled to substantial deference by the courts. <em>Andrus v. Sierra Club, </em>442 U.S. 347, 358, 99 S.Ct. 2335, 2341, 60 L.Ed.2d 943 (1979). They are not new requirements, but rather are a codification of prior case law that required analysis of the costs of proceeding without more and better information. <em>SOCATS, </em>720 F.2d at 1478.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">On their face these regulations require an ordered process by an agency when it is proceeding in the face of uncertainty. First, the agency must determine whether the information is important or essential<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and whether it can be obtained. If it cannot be obtained or if the costs of obtaining it are exorbitant, the agency must do a worst case analysis weighing the need for the action against all possible adverse impacts. The agency must consider the range of worst possible effects and the likelihood of these effects occurring. It must also consider the costs of proceeding without the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-10\">The BLM acknowledges that the issue of <em>whether </em>a WCA is required has been determined by our decision in <em>SOCATS, </em>where we held that the BLM must prepare a worst ease analysis bottomed on the assumption that its herbicides are not safe. We noted that scientific uncertainty existed regarding the carcinogenacity of the herbicides and that \u201c[wjhen uncertainty exists, it must be exposed.\u201d 720 F.2d at 1479. This is not all that is required, however. Besides exposing the <em>fact </em>of uncertainty, because of that uncertainty, a spectrum of possible events must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-11\">The CEQ interprets its regulation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-12\">The purpose of the analysis is to carry out NEPA\u2019s mandate for full disclosure to the public of the potential consequences of agency decisions, and to cause agencies to consider those potential consequences when acting on the basis of scientific uncertainties or gaps in available information. The analysis is formulated on the basis of available information, using reasonable projections of the worst possible consequences of a proposed action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>For example, if there are scientific uncertainties and gaps in the available information concerning the numbers of juvenile fish that would be entrained in a cooling facility, the responsible agency must disclose and consider the possibility of the loss of the commercial or sport fishery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1321-5\">In addition to an analysis of a low probability/catastrophic impact event, the worst'case analysis should also include a spectrum of events of higher probability but less drastic impact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">46 Fed.Reg. 18032 (Monday, March 3, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">In <em>Sierra Club v. Sigler, </em>695 F.2d 957 (5th Cir.1983), the Fifth Circuit required the Army Corps of Engineers to prepare a worst case analysis hypothesizing a massive oil spill in Galveston Bay. In a detailed analysis of the procedural history of the regulation, the court upheld the regulation under NEPA and said that \u201c \u2018CEQ\u2019s interpretation of NEPA is entitled to substantial deference.\u2019 \u201d 695 F.2d at 972, quoting <em>Andrus v. Sierra Club, </em>442 U.S. 347, 358, 99 S.Ct. 2335, 2341, 60 L.Ed.2d 943 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">The court emphasized that the mere fact that the possibility of an event occurring is remote or unlikely does not obviate the necessity to do a worst case analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGp\">All parties agree that a total cargo loss <em>could </em>occur and <em>could </em>wreak catastrophic environmental damage in the Bay. While this damage is a \u201csignificant adverse effect,\u201d there is considerable uncertainty about its likelihood, scope, and consequences; information on it is certainly important, if not essential, to the Corps\u2019 decision, yet that information is beyond the state of the art. However, there is a body of data with which a reasonable worst case analysis can be made that is not unreasonably speculative. Remoteness does not bar a worst case analysis so founded and should instead be weighed by the Corps when it applies the worst case analysis in its decisionmaking process. The Corps must at least consider information relevant to a \u201csignificant\u201d effect of a proposal, if that information is both \u201cimportant\u201d to that decision and not based on \u201cunreasonable speculation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1321-13\">695 F.2d at 974. <em>See also SOCATS, </em>at 1479-80.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-14\">Both the CEQ regulation and other NEBA cases contemplate analysis of a \u201cspectrum of events.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> . With these requirements in mind, we examine the WCA prepared by the BLM in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-15\">\n<em>2. Adequacy of the WCA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-16\">The WCA prepared by the BLM is brief and cursory, and proceeds from an entirely wrong assumption. The BLM admits that no level of exposure to the herbicides has been proven safe, but assumes in the WCA that \u201ca point is reached at which it becomes clear that no human health ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>feet will occur.\u201d Judge Belloni said, \u201cPlainly, the worst result that can occur as a result of proceeding in the face of uncertainty as to whether a herbicide causes cancer is that it <em>does </em>cause cancer.\u201d Slip op. at 5. We agree. We observed in <em>SO-CATS </em>that, \u201cThe possibility that the safe level of dosage for herbicides is low or nonexistent creates a possibility of \u2018significant adverse effects on the human environment.\u2019 ... This potential calls for a worst case analysis.\u201d 720 F.2d at 1479, quoting 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">The BLM argues that the analysis plaintiffs say is necessary would be pure guesswork because no credible data exist to support the proposition that cancer can occur at any dose. This contention is specious in light of the evidence presented by plaintiffs\u2019 experts and the holding of <em>SO-CATS </em>that \u201c[t]he agency may not omit the analysis only because it believes that the worst case is unlikely.\u201d 720 F.2d at 1479; <em>see also Sigler, </em>695 F.2d at 974 (\u201cthat the possibility of a total cargo loss by a supertanker is remote does not obviate the requirement of a worst case analysis\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The duty of an agency is to analyze the costs and environmental effects of the worst case and its costs and <em>then </em>to provide its assessment of the likelihood of the event occurring. The district court was correct in finding the WCA deficient.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>\n<em>B. Public Comment Period for the WCA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">The BLM provided five days for public comment on the WCA before it made its final decision. It argues that the WCA was part of the EA and, accordingly, need be made available only at some time prior to the final decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">We agree with the district court that a longer comment period is required. As we stated in <em>SOCATS, </em>\u201c[T]he label of the document is unimportant.\u201d 720 F.2d at 1480. For procedural purposes, we must examine the purpose which the document serves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">The BLM uses the annual EA to supplement its ten-year programatic EIS. Rather than using the EA simply to determine whether to prepare an EIS, the EA serves as the decisionmaking document to assess the environmental costs of each year\u2019s spraying program. The EA is an especially significant document where, as here, the WCA is included in it. <em>See SOCATS, </em>720 F.2d at 1480. When an EA is the functional equivalent of an EIS, it is subject to the same procedures. <em>See National Indian Youth Council v. Andrus, </em>501 F.Supp. 649, 657 (D.N.M.1980), <em>aff'd </em>664 F.2d 220 (10th Cir.1981). Judge Belloni was correct in holding that the WCA was subject to the minimum 45-day comment period for draft EIS\u2019s contained in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1506.10(c) (1983).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-11\">\n<em>11. Merrell v. Block.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-12\">\n<em>A. NEPA Requires Research on the Environmental Effects of the USFS Program.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-13\">Judge Belloni found that \u201c[wjhen USFS and BLM completed their EAR\u2019s [environmental assessment reports or EA\u2019s] they did not do any actual research on the health effects of using the listed herbicides in the area. Instead, they simply relied on research already completed by EPA when that agency registered the chemicals under FIFRA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-14\">The Forest Service argues that Judge Belloni\u2019s decision requires it to do original research on the use of the herbicides and that such a requirement is beyond the scope of a court\u2019s authority under NEPA. Neither of these contentions is accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-15\">Judge Belloni did not specify <em>what </em>the Forest Service must do, rather, he held that it could not rely solely on EPA registration under FIFRA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Forest Service could appropriately consider EPA\u2019s data on the herbicides in the specific context of the area in which it proposes to spray; it could require the chemical companies, such as amicus Monsanto, to provide the data and necessary research on their herbicides for similar analysis; it could commission studies or undertake its own research or any combination of these options that would satisfy its obligations under NEPA to provide an adequate analysis of the effects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>its spraying program in the targeted area.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">\n<em>1.' Reliance on EPA Registration is Improper.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">The EPA registration process for herbicides under FIFRA is inadequate to address environmental concerns under NEPA, particularly where, as here, the registration is only conditional. Conditional registration is a recognition that less than complete data exists. FIFRA does not require or even contemplate the same examination that the Forest Service is required to undertake under NEPA. FIFRA registration is a cost-benefit analysis that no unreasonable risk exists \u201cto man or the environment taking into account the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136(bb).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">Reliance on EPA data is clearly improper under this court\u2019s holdings in <em>Oregon Environmental Council v. Kunzman, </em>714 F.2d 901 (9th Cir.1983) and <em>SOCATS. </em>In <em>Kunzman </em>we held that the Forest Service\u2019s spraying of carbaryl over populated areas violated NEPA where the PEIS and EA failed to address adequately the health effects of \u201cspraying on people living or working in or near the areas sprayed.\u201d 714 F.2d at 904. We held that the Forest Service could not rely on EPA registration under FIFRA, citing Judge Skopil\u2019s opinion in <em>Citizens Against Toxic Sprays v. Bergland, </em>428 F.Supp. 908, 927 (D.Or.1977). 714 F.2d at 905. We also relied on 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.27, discussed <em>supra </em>Section IA1, as an alternate ground for requiring a worst case analysis in <em>SOS v. Clark.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1324-7\">We said in <em>Kunzman </em>that, while the PEIS does briefly discuss the health risks of carbaryl, it does not consider the supposedly carcinogenic effects of an attendant by-product of carbaryl, nitrosocarbaryl ____ The licensing of pesticides containing carbaryl does not \u201creflect a conclusion that a pesticide is safe under <em>any </em>condition,\u201d as the federal appellees assert in their brief. One agency cannot rely on another\u2019s examination of environmental effects under NEPA____ \u201cThus, the mere fact that a program involves use of substances registered under FIFRA does not exempt the program from the requirements of NEPA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1324-15\">714 F.2d at <em>905 </em>(citations omitted, emphasis added). We followed this decision in <em>SO-CATS, </em>stating that \u201c[t]he BLM must assess independently the safety of the herbicides that it uses.\u201d <em>\u2018SOCATS, </em>at 1480.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-16\">\n<em>2. The Forest Service Must Do Research If No Adequate Data Exists.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-17\">We recognized in <em>SOCATS </em>that an agency may be required to do independent research on the health effects of a herbicide. This is not a new requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-18\">In <em>Foundation for North American Wild Sheep v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, </em>681 F.2d 1172 (9th Cir.1982), this court held an EIS inadequate because it failed to address the effect on bighorn sheep of opening a road when those effects were uncertain. We said, \u201cthe very purpose of NEPA\u2019s requirement that an EIS be prepared for all actions that may significantly affect the environment is to obviate the need for such speculation by insuring that available data is <em>gathered </em>and analyzed prior to the implementation of the proposed action.\u201d 681 F.2d at 1179 (emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>Warm Springs Dam Task Force v. Gribble, </em>621 F.2d 1017 (9th Cir.1980), we held that an agency cured the defect in its EIS by <em>commissioning </em>a study about the effects of a newly discovered fault system on <em>that </em>dam. 621 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>at 1025-26. Other courts have imposed similar requirements on agencies. <em>See, e.g., Rankin v. Coleman, </em>394 F.Supp. 647, 658 (highway project enjoined for inadequate EIS on effects and alternatives; alternatives must be \u201caffirmatively studied\u201d), mod. 401 F.Supp. 664 (E.D.N.C.1975); <em>Montgomery v. Ellis, </em>364 F.Supp. 517, 528 (N.D.Ala.1973) (\u201cNEPA requires each agency to undertake research needed adequately to expose environmental harms and, hence, to appraise available alternatives\u201d) (project enjoined pending preparation of an adequate EIS); <em>Brooks v. Volpe, </em>350 F.Supp. 269, 279 (\u201cNEPA requires each agency to indicate the research needed to adequately expose environmental harms\u201d), supplemented, 350 F.Supp. 287 (W.D.Wash.1972), aff<em>'d, </em>487 F.2d 1344 (9th Cir.1973); <em>Environmental Defense Fund v. Hardin, </em>325 F.Supp. 1401, 1403 (D.D.C.1971) (interpreting section 102(2)(A) as making \u201cthe completion of an adequate research program a prerequisite to agency action____ The Act envisions that program formulation will be directed by research results rather than that research programs will be designed to substantiate programs already decided upon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">Furthermore, in <em>SOCATS </em>and in <em>Warm Springs </em>we recognized that such a duty also flowed from the worst case analysis regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-7\">If the information relevant to adverse impacts is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and is not known and the overall costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant, <em>the agency shall include the information </em>in the environmental impact statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1325-8\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(a) (emphasis added). Only if the costs are exorbitant or the means of obtaining the information is beyond the state of the art is the agency excused from compliance and allowed to perform a worst case analysis. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Forest Service presents no evidence and makes no argument that the costs are exorbitant or that research is impossible. Rather, it argues that it cannot be forced to do it. Section 1502.22 clearly contemplates original research if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-11\">Federal agencies routinely either do their own studies or commission studies of the particular area in which a proposed project is to be located. Almost every EIS contains some original research. And, almost every time an EIS is ruled inadequate by a court it is because more data or research is needed. The Forest Service does not, and indeed cannot, cite any case which holds that an agency is not obliged to do research to comply with NEPA. The Forest Service cannot abdicate its responsibilities by relying on another agency. It must evaluate the impact of its own actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-12\">\n<em>B. Preparation of a Joint EIS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-13\">Plaintiffs argue that 4\u00d3 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.-5(a) requires the preparation of a joint EIS by the EPA, BLM, and USFS. This argument is unpersuasive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-14\">Section 1501.5 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-15\">(a) A lead agency shall supervise the preparation of an environmental impact statement if more than one Federal agency either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-16\">(1) Proposes or is involved in the same action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-17\">(2) Is involved in a group of actions directly related to each other because of their functional interdependence or geographical proximity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1325-18\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-19\">Although both the BLM and the Forest Service are engaged in forest spraying programs, the programs are in separate areas. The EPA\u2019s function is clearly distinct. We are unwilling to find that the district court erred in refusing to mandate a joint EIS. This is not to say that the agencies and the public might not be better served were a joint EIS prepared. The programs of the BLM and the Forest Service are similar. The geographic areas in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>some instances are close. The terrain and conditions in the BLM and forest service areas may be very similar. Neither agency can ignore the program by the other. To the extent the program of one affects the other or the effects of the programs are cumulative neither agency can avoid assessing the impact of its program on the other. Joint participation by the EPA as a resource, consultant and expert would indeed be beneficial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">\n<em>III. Scope of the Injunctions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">Judge Belloni consolidated <em>SOS v. Clark </em>and <em>Merrell v. Block </em>when considering the scope of the injunctions. We do likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">We are puzzled by the limited scope of the injunctions in these cases. Judge Belloni limited the injunctions in both cases in two ways, by limiting the territorial scope of the injunctions and by restricting the injunctions to aerial spraying (allowing ground spraying to go forward).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">Irreparable damage is presumed when an agency fails to evaluate thoroughly the environmental impact of a proposed action. <em>See Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Coleman, </em>518 F.2d 323, 330 (9th Cir.1975). Only in a rare circumstance may a court refuse to issue an injunction when it finds a NEPA violation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, the policies underlying NEPA \u201cweight the scales in favor of those seeking the suspension of all action until the Act\u2019s requirements are met____\u201d <em>Alpine Lake Protection Society v. Schlapfer, </em>518 F.2d 1089, 1090 (9th Cir.1975). The \u201crare circumstance\u201d arose in <em>American Motorcyclist Association v. Watt, </em>714 F.2d 962 (9th Cir.1983) (AMA), where the court found more harm would result to the environment from granting the injunction than by refusing to grant it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See also Alpine Lake, </em>518 F.2d at 1090 (refusing to grant injunction because \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d meant more harm could occur to forest from disease if injunction not granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-13\">We find no such justification here that would excuse a total ban on spraying. The district court should have enjoined the spraying programs of the BLM and USFS in their entirety until NEPA requirements were fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-14\"><em>IV. A ttorneys </em>\u2019 <em>Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-15\">Plaintiffs in both cases seek fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504. In deciding whether fees should be awarded against the government in this case we are guided by our decision in <em>SO CATS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-16\">Relitigation of a previously decided issue is a strong factor weighing against the government in determining substantial justification. In <em>SO CATS </em>we held that the government was on notice that its reading of section 1502.22 was untenable after the appellate decision in <em>Sigler. </em>In accord with that decision, we hold that plaintiffs in <em>SOS v. Clark </em>ar\u00e9 entitled to attorneys fees for legal services rendered at least from the date of that decision (January 20,. 1983). Although prior adverse litigation is ordinarily the most im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>portant factor to consider, other relevant factors may warrant an award from an earlier date. <em>See, e.g., Environmental Defense Fund v. Watt, </em>722 F.2d 1081-1086 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">In <em>Merrell v. Block, </em>the Forest Service has known that reliance solely on EPA registration under FIFRA was improper since Judge Skopil\u2019s decision in <em>Citizens Against Toxic Sprays, Inc. v. Bergland, </em>428 F.Supp. 908, 927 (D.Or.1977) (\u201cthe mere fact that a program involves the use of substances registered under FIFRA does not exempt the program from the requirements of NEPA\u201d). Plaintiffs seek fees for this appeal only; their entitlement to fees before the district court is the subject of a separate appeal now pending before this court. We hold only that plaintiffs are entitled to fees on appeal because the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified before this court. We express no view as to the propriety of fees for the district court litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">We remand to the district court to tak\u00e9 such further evidence as may be necessary to determine the amount of fees to be awarded. <em>See, e.g., Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir.1975). In light of allegations made in respect to information withheld despite FOIA requests, the district court should consider such evidence in that regard as may have bearing on the government\u2019s <em>bona fides </em>and may affect the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s holdings that the WCA prepared by the BLM (in <em>SOS v. Clark) </em>and the EA prepared by the Forest Service (in <em>Merrell v. Block) </em>were inadequate. We affirm the district court\u2019s holding in <em>SOS v. Clark </em>that a 45-day comment period was applicable to the WCA and that no joint EIS was required. The district court erred, however, in limiting the scope of the injunctions in both cases: the entire spraying programs of both agencies should be halted until they comply with NEPA.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The district court shall award attorneys\u2019 fees in both cases for services below and on appeal, in amounts to be determined by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-14\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1318-13\">. The herbicides proposed for use by the BLM were 2,4-D, Silvex, Simazine, Atrazine, Diuron, Tordon, Dalapon, Banvel, Krenite, and Roundup. <em>FINAL EIS, </em>Summary. Silvex was later dropped from the program after EPA suspended its registration because it was contaminated with dioxin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">. The PEIS was prepared after Judge Skopil enjoined the use of 2,3,4-T, and Silvex by the Forest Service because of dioxin contamination. <em>See Citizens Against Toxic Sprays v. Bergland, </em>428 F.Supp. 908 (D.Or.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1319-7\">. The results of the EPA studies were not made available to plaintiffs in this case despite requests by plaintiffs under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1976) (FOIA). Although Judge Belloni denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend their complaint to allege violation of FOIA, plaintiffs have not appealed this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-8\">Plaintiffs have requested leave to augment the record on appeal to introduce certain documents supplied by the EPA in response to a FOIA request after the judgment was entered by the district court. Because we grant plaintiffs the relief they seek in the matters to which the documents relate, we have denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to augment the record on appeal. The denial is without prejudice to plaintiffs\u2019 right to offer the documents as evidence before the district court on remand as they may be relevant to attorneys' fees or other matters before the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1319-9\">. The regulation requiring a worst case analysis provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1319-18\">\n<em>Incomplete or unavailable information.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1319-19\">When an agency is evaluating significant adverse effects on the human environment in an environmental impact statement and there are gaps in relevant information or scientific uncertainty, the agency shall always make clear that such information is lacking or that uncertainty exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1319-20\">(a) If the information relevant to adverse impacts is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and is not known and the overall costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant, the agency shall include the information in the environmental impact statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1319-21\">(b) If (1) the information relevant to adverse impacts is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and is not known and the overall costs of obtaining it are exorbitant or (2) the information relevant to adverse impacts is important to the decision and the means to obtain it are not known (e.g., the means for obtaining it are beyond the state of the art) the agency shall weigh the need for the action against the risk and severity of possible adverse impacts were the action to proceed in the face of uncertainty. If the agency proceeds, it shall include a worst case analysis and an indication of the probability or improbability of its occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1319-22\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1320-7\">. We need not determine whether the information in this case should be classified as \"essential\" or \u201cimportant.\" Because the information in this case is \"significant,\" we go no further. The literal language of the WCA regulation seems to distinguish \u25a0 between \"essential\u201d and \"important\u201d information both in regard to when information must be provided and when a WCA must be prepared. Reading this regulation in conjunction with general NEPA law and other CEQ regulations,'it becomes clear that no such distinction was intended by the CEQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-8\">Section (b)(1) requires a WCA when the information is essential and the costs exorbitant. Section (b)(2) requires a WCA when the information is important and the means for obtaining it are beyond the state of the art. However, Section 1508.27(b) requires that uncertainty be discussed whenever the information is \"significant.\u201d This would encompass both \"essential\u201d and \u201cimportant.\" Furthermore, it would make no sense in light of the purpose of the regulation, to make the duty to prepare a WCA turn on the <em>reason </em>for which the information is unavailable. If significant information cannot be produced because the costs are exorbitant or the methods beyond the state of the art, a WCA must be prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-14\">Similarly, the duty to gather information and do research under section 1502.22(a) should not turn on whether the information is \"essential\u201d or \"important.\u201d As we hold, in <em>Merrell infra, </em>Section IIA, general NEPA law requires research whenever the information is \"significant.\u201d As long as the information is \"important,\" \"significant,\" or \"essential,\u201d it must be provided when the costs are not exorbitant in light of the size of the project and/or the possible harm to the environment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1321-10\">. For example, even one chance out of 10,000 that a catastrophic event (such as nuclear disaster) would occur is relevant information to a decisionmaker. Even if an event is unlikely, if responsible scientific critics present opposing points of view as to the possible environmental effects of a project, the agency has an obligation to respond to those views. <em>See Environmental Defense Fund v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, </em>325 F.Supp. 728, 759 (E.D.Ark.1971), <em>aff\u2019d </em>470 F.2d 289 (8th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 931, 93 S.Ct. 2749, 37 L.Ed.2d 160 (1973) Grad, 2 Treatise on Environmental Law 9-93 (1982). <em>See also </em>Anderson, <em>NEPA In the Courts </em>210 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1321-11\">. The \"range of alternative\u201d analysis required under NEPA is not unlike the WCA regulation that requires analysis of a spectrum of events. NEPA requires the consideration of a range of alternatives to the proposed action, including the no-action alternative. \u201cThe EIS discussion of alternatives must make clear the reasons for the agency's choice, address the environmental effects of the alternatives, compare them,' explain how future options may be narrowed by present decisions, and respond to the recommendations of responsible critics.\u201d Rogers, <em>Environmental Law </em>793-94 (1977) (footnotes omitted), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-18\">A worst case analysis could discuss, for example, a 1% chance of event X, a 10% chance of event Y and a 20% chance of event Z, while an EIS for leasing might discuss the effects of leasing 0, 10,000, and 50,000 acres.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">. We do not imply that the contents of the WCA prepared by the BLM should not be <em>part </em>of the amended WCA. The amended WCA, of course, should contain a discussion of events of low probability and catastrophic effect as well as events of higher probability but less catastrophic effect. For example, noting that although data is incomplete, a person applying the herbicide who accidentally received a massive dose could become seriously ill is clearly appropriate. The possible effects of the unlikely event of a spill on the BLM personnel may be important to the decisionmaker as well as the possible effect of the calculated dose on the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">The record in <em>Merrell </em>reveals that it is the <em>policy </em>of the BLM to avoid discussion of the toxicity of the herbicides it uses. The BLM <em>Field Guide to Policies and Procedures Required for Vegetation Management With Herbicides in Western Oregon </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-7\">[tjopics which address issues of herbicide toxicity and/or human health effects should be avoided. Such subject matter is more appropriately discussed by expertise in other Federal or State agencies. Simply stated, our position is: <em>that so long as herbicides are registered and approved for forestry use by EPA, BLM may appropriately use such chemicals within specified procedural safeguards.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">ECR at 283, <em>Merrell v.

More and more chemicals are added to our environment daily without adequate information about the long-range effects on health and environment. The EPA, in effect, acknowledges that data on the herbicides in this case are inadequate since the registration is conditional under an exception to the normal registration process. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(c)(7). The Government describes the procedure as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-11\">FIFRA provides a mechanism for the registration of pesticides with less than a full complement of testing data by means of the conditional registration amendments of 1978. The conditional registration provisions of section (3)(c)(7) [7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(c)(7) ] give the Agency discretionary authority to conditionally register pesticide products in certain situations even though certain data required under section 3(c)(5) have not been generated____ In effect, the Agency is considering that all registrations are conditional until the data gaps identified by the Registration Standard are filled and the products are \"reregistered\u201d under the Standard. Since 1979, virtually all registrations ... have been issued as conditional registrations with the stipulation ... that the registrant agrees to submit and/or cite all data required [under 3(c)(5) ] when the Agency issues a similar data request [to other registrants]. The registered products which were reregistered prior to 1978 are also subject to the Registration Standard review____ These products will also be subject to 'reregistration' once all the data gaps have been satisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1322-15\">CR 31; Defendants\u2019 Summary Judgment Memorandum at 8-9 . in <em>Merrell v.
