Their estates, along with the estates of four oth\u00e9r battered children, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Commissioner of the South Carolina Department of Social Services, members of\u2019 the State Board of the Department of Social Services, members of the board of the Richland and Anderson County Departments of Social Services, and various state employed case workers. The plaintiffs alleged that the State, acting through its employees, violated the children\u2019s fourteenth amendment rights by failing to intervene and provide protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The Brown and Clark cases were heard by different district courts. In the Brown case the district court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, 570 F.Supp. 91. The district court in the Clark case converted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss to summary judgment motions and ruled for the Commissioner and the board members, 570 F.Supp. 114. The Clark court, however, refused to grant summary judgment on behalf of the case workers. Under Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b) the Clark court entered final judgment for the Commissioner and the board members and the two eases were consolidated for appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The issue now before us on appeal is whether the defendants\u2019 failure to provide affirmative protection to the plaintiffs\u2019 decedents creates a cognizable \u00a7 1983 claim. We conclude that at the time of the alleged violation a constitutional right of affirmative protection was not clearly established and that, therefore, good faith immunity was available to the defendants. Accordingly, we affirm the lower courts\u2019 ruling in the Brown case and affirm the grant of summary judgment in the Clark suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">SYLVIA BROWN</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">The plaintiff alleged that Sylvia Brown\u2019s plight first became known to Richland County social workers on February 28, 1979, when the then four month old child was admitted to the Richland Memorial Hospital with a fractured skull. A C.A.T. scan revealed a \u201chealing subdural hematoma.\u201d The attending physician immediately became concerned about the possibility of physical abuse by Sylvia\u2019s parents. This suspicion, the plaintiff contends, was confirmed after Mrs. Brown and her boyfriend visited Sylvia at the hospital. Hospital social workers received a report that during the visit Mrs. Brown\u2019s boyfriend held the child by the head and neck, and slapped the child in a rough manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">The following week, a Richland Hospital social worker reported the case to the Rich-land County Department of Social Services and requested a child protection investigation. After an initial review of the case, the Department of Social Services allegedly reached an agreement with Mrs. Brown requiring her to reside with Sylvia at the home of Sylvia\u2019s grandmother. Under the agreement, if Mrs. Brown returned home with her child, Sylvia would be placed in the custody of the Department of Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Services. In addition to this agreement, the Department also decided that an \u201cintensive follow-up and in-home supervision\u201d would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">According to the plaintiff, over the course of the next two months the Department caseworkers failed to supervise adequately the family and carry out the recommendations of department officials and Sylvia\u2019s attending physician. The plaintiff claims that Department caseworkers visited Mrs. Brown\u2019s house only twice, and on both of those occasions Sylvia was living alone with her mother. Despite the agreement, no action was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On May 11, 1979, Sylvia was brought dead on arrival to the Richland Hospital. An autopsy revealed that brain hemorrhaging had occurred three times in the previous three weeks \u2014 the last hemorrhage apparently took place only minutes before Sylvia died. After initially disclaiming responsibility,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Brown pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">MICHAEL CLARK</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">On February 28, 1980, the principal of New Prospect Elementary School informed the Anderson County Department of Social Services that the older brother of Michael Clark showed signs of child abuse. A caseworker from the Department immediately met with Michael\u2019s brother. The child was bruised about the face and told the caseworker that his father had hit him on several occasions. After conferring with teachers at the school, the caseworker concluded that a meeting with Mrs. Clark was necessary. Between March 6, 1980, and April 28, 1980, the caseworker and the Department attempted repeatedly to contact Mrs. Clark. Letters and telephone calls went unanswered, and seven visits to various addresses failed to locate the Clark family. After sixty days the Department classified the case as \u201cunfounded\u201d and officially closed the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">On June 23, 1980, Michael Clark was beaten to death by Mrs. C\u00edark\u2019s boyfriend, Wayne Drawdy. Drawdy was subsequently tried and convicted for the child\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">The South Carolina Child Protection Act, S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 20-7-480 <em>et seq., </em>requires state and county board members \u201cto [establish] an effective reporting system and ... an effective system of service throughout the State to safeguard the well-being and development of endangered children ----and save them from injury and harm.\u201d S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-7-480.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute charges the South Carolina State Department of Social Services with responsibility for coordinating child protection services throughout the state. Specifically, the Department is required to 1) monitor and eval-. uate the child protection services provided by the counties and localities; 2) establish a central registry for child abuse reports; 3) coordinate referrals of child abuse cases; and 4) conduct training programs for local agency staffs. S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-7-640(C), (D); \u00a7 20-7-660(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Under the statute the reporting system that the Department of Social Services must oversee consists of two elements: county departments and local child protection agencies. The statute mandates that the latter \u201cbe adequately staffed with persons trained in the investigation of suspected child abuse and neglect and in the provision of services to abused and neglected children and their families.\u201d S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-7-650(B). The statute empowers the local agency to \u201cpetition the Family Court ... to intervene\u201d on behalf of the child should the agency deem it necessary, but the statute does not expressly require the agency to intervene. S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-7-650(J).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">In both the Clark and Brown eases, the plaintiffs argued before the lower court that the statute created a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the state and victims of suspected child abuse by imposing an affirmative duty on the state government \u201cto save [suspected victims] from harm.\u201d Relying primarily on our decision in <em>Fox v. Custis, </em>712 F.2d 84 (4th Cir.1983), the Clark and Brown estates contended that this \u201cspecial relationship\u201d gave rise to a right under the fourteenth amendment to affirmative protection by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">In the Clark ease, the district court agreed with the plaintiff that where \u201can individual [has been] legally entrusted to the care or protection of governmental officials,\u201d a failure to protect could constitute a deprivation of life without due process and thereby violate the fourteenth amendment. J.A. at 330-33. But the court concluded that because there was no \u201cclearly established case law\u201d defining the \u201cgeneral due process\u201d requirements of the Child Protection Act and providing \u201creasonable notice of possible liability,\u201d the commissioners and the board members were entitled to good faith immunity under <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Accordingly, the court granted the Commissioners\u2019 and board members\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">In the <em>Brown </em>case, the district court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to allege a federal or constitutional claim upon which relief could be granted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The fourteenth amendment, the court held, only created a right to affirmative protection by the state in those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>instances where legal custody or direct supervisory control of the victim lay in the hands of the state. Because the appellant\u2019s complaint never alleged that the state had assumed custody or direct supervisory control of Sylvia Brown under the Act, the court dismissed the suit as to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">On appeal, the appellants argue that the courts below erred in both granting summary judgment for the Commissioner and the county and board members in <em>Brown </em>and in dismissing the suit in <em>Clark. </em>The appellants\u2019 contentions, we believe, hinge on two \u201cthreshold\u201d issues: whether the fourteenth amendment affords the appellants a right to affirmative protection by the state, and if such a right presently exists, whether .it was established clearly enough at the time the alleged deprivation occurred to avert the application of good faith immunity under <em>Harlow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act only protects against action under color of state law that \u201csubjects ... any citizen ... or other person ... to the deprivation of any rights ... secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United States. <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 146-47, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2695-96, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979); <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976); <em>Fox v. Custis, </em>712 F.2d 84, 87 (4th Cir.1983). Thus, \u201cthe first inquiry in any \u00a7 1983 suit ... is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of [such] a right.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>443 U.S. at 140, 99 S.Ct. at 2692. This inquiry, in turn, \u201cinvolves \u2018isolating the particular constitutional infringement complained of\u2019.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>712 F.2d at 87, <em>quoting Martinez v. California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 284 n. 9, 100 S.Ct. 553, 558 n. 9, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">In this case the appellants argue that the decedents possessed a constitutional right to protection by the government from harm inflicted by their parents or those acting as their parents. Specifically, the appellants assert that the State\u2019s failure to intervene effectively deprived Michael Clark and Sylvia Brown of liberty rights secured by the fourteenth amendment. As an initial matter, therefore, our inquiry must focus on the extent to which we can now assert that a right of affirmative protection exists. But our analysis must not stop there; we must also determine the precise time at which such a right \u2014 if it presently exists\u2014 can be said to have emerged. <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). For this a careful review of recent case law is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">The most relevant line of cases dates from 1976. The alleged violations occurred in 1979. Thus our examination of the case law must be aimed at determining the extent to which a clearly defined right had emerged from this shifting line of cases as of 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">The current debate over affirmative duty and constitutional tort stems in large part from a prisoner petition case decided by the Supreme Court in 1976. In <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), an inmate of the Texas Department of Corrections sued prison officials for failing to provide adequate medical treatment for a back injury suffered while performing a prison work assignment. The prisoner\u2019s claim was brought under \u00a7 1983, and alleged that prison officials had subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment. The Court held that although the record failed to support the prisoner\u2019s claims, prison officials could not act with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the medical needs- of prisoners without violating the eighth amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-14\">We therefore conclude that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>prisoners constitutes the \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\u201d <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>supra, [428 U.S. 153] at 182-183, 49 L.Ed.2d 859, 96 S.Ct. 2909 [2925] (joint opinion), proscribed by the Eighth Amendment. This is true whether the indifference is manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner\u2019s needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed. Regardless of how evidenced, deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious illness or injury states a cause of action under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-d\">429 U.S. at 104-05, 97 S.Ct. at 291. The Court reasoned that because the prisoner was unable \u201c \u2018by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, to care for himself\u2019 \u201d, it was only \u201cjust\u201d that \u201c \u2018the public\u2019 \u201d be required to care for him. <em>Id. </em>at 103-04, 97 S.Ct. at 290-91, <em>quoting Spicer v. Williamson, </em>191 N.C. 487, 490, 132 S.E. 291, 293 (1926). In the Court\u2019s view, therefore, the government had an \u201cobligation to provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by incarceration.\u201d <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 103, 97 S.Ct. at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We followed <em>Estelle </em>in several similar eighth amendment \u00a7 1983 prisoner cases. <em>See Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>632 F.2d 1096 (4th Cir.1980); <em>Davis v. Zahradnick, </em>600 F.2d 458 (4th Cir.1979); <em>Withers v. Levine, </em>615 F.2d 158 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 849, 101 S.Ct. 136, 66 L.Ed.2d 59 (1980). In all of these cases, we limited the imposition of an affirmative duty of care on the government to prison settings where eighth amendment concerns were involved and state employees had acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Thus, as of 1980, affirmative duty and constitutional rights had found a common ground in this circuit only in the prison setting. The government\u2019s duty to protect applied only to those <em>incarcerated </em>by the state, for only those individuals could be subjected to an eighth amendment violation. A look at the cases that quickly followed <em>Estelle </em>\u2014 cases which expanded the right to affirmative protection \u2014 underscores by comparison just how narrow the right was in 1980. It is to those cases that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">The first major <em>post-jEstelle </em>decision was decided by the Supreme Court in 1980. In <em>Martinez v. California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 100 S.Ct. 553, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980), the Court was asked to address the question of whether the government had an affirmative duty under the fourteenth amendment to protect a private citizen from the actions of a parolee. Martinez, a fifteen year old girl, had been murdered by a \u201cmentally disturbed sex offender\u201d who had been sentenced to one to twenty years, but paroled after five. The State of California conceded that the parolee was a known risk when he was let out. Legally, the attacker was still in the custody of the state when he killed Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">The Court ruled that Martinez had failed to allege a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983. Yet rather than addressing directly the issue of whether Martinez had a constitutional right to protection under the fourteenth amendment, the Court chose to decide the case on the narrow grounds that Martinez had failed to establish proximate cause. The parolee, the Court pointed out, was not \u201can agent of the parole board,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 285, 100 S.Ct. at 559, and the murder had occurred five months after the parolee\u2019s release. <em>Id. </em>Under these circumstances, the Court concluded, the causal connection between the action of the parolee and that of the State was too attenuated to hold the government liable,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">But in the final paragraph, the Court clearly left open the possibility that in another setting the fourteenth amendment right asserted by Martinez might be upheld in a \u00a7 1983 suit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>We need not and do not decide that a parole officer could never be deemed to \u201cdeprive\u201d someone of life by action taken in connection with the release of a prisoner on parole. But we hold that at least under the particular circumstances of this parole decision, appellants\u2019 decedent\u2019s death is too remote a consequence of the parole officers\u2019 action to hold them responsible under the federal civil rights law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 285, 100 S.Ct. at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In 1981 the Second Circuit attempted to resolve the question left open by <em>Martinez. </em>In <em>Doe v. New York City Department of Social Services, </em>649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.1981) two young girls filed suit against the State of New York after they were beaten and sexually abused by their foster father. The girls, who were technically in the custody of the New York City Commissioner of Welfare, alleged that the State had violated an affirmative duty of protection\u2014 guaranteed under the fourteenth amendment \u2014 when it failed to inspect and recertify the foster home to which the claimants had been assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Without expressly mentioning the fourteenth amendment, the court held that the State could violate a \u201cconstitutionally protected <em>liberty </em>or property interest\u201d by failing to protect an individual who had been placed in the government\u2019s \u201ccustody or care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In its discussion the court cited <em>Estelle v. Gamble </em>and other eighth amendment prisoner cases. <em>Id. </em>This citation was significant, for it marked the first time that the eighth amendment analysis had been applied to a traditional fourteenth amendment claim involving liberty and property interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">One year later, in 1982, the Seventh Circuit also addressed the issue left open in <em>Martinez. </em>Although the court ultimately ruled against the plaintiff,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it significantly expanded the reasoning in <em>Doe. </em>In <em>Bowers v. DeVito, </em>686 F.2d 616 (7th Cir.1982), a schizophrenic, with a history of criminal violence murdered Marguerite Bowers one year after being released from an Indiana State Mental Hospital. Bowers\u2019 estate filed a \u00a7 1983 suit against the hospital, claiming that the State had reason to know that the former patient was dangerous and thus had acted recklessly in permitting his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">The court disagreed. Expressly refusing to distinguish the case from <em>Martinez, </em>the court ruled that \u201cthere is no constitutional right to be protected by the State against being murdered by criminals or madmen.\u201d In the Seventh Circuit\u2019s view, the Constitution was designed as \u201ca charter of negative liberties; it tells the state to let people alone; it does not require the federal government or the state to provide services, even so elementary a service as maintaining law and order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">The court, however, was careful to limit its holding to situations where the state had not taken an active role in placing an individual in a position of danger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">We do not want to pretend that the line between action and inaction, between inflicting and failing to prevent the infliction of harm, is clearer than it is. If the state puts a man in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him, it will not be heard to say that its role was merely passive; it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-13\"><em>Id. </em>It was here, the court reasoned, that a fourteenth amendment claim based on an affirmative duty overlapped with the affirmative duty recognized by the Supreme Court in eighth amendment prisoner cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACT\">It is on this theory that state prison personnel are sometimes held liable un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>der section 1983 for the violence of one prison inmate against another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><em>Id. </em>Significantly, the court did not draw a distinction between \u201ccustodial\u201d and \u201cother\u201d relationships. In this sense, <em>Bowers </em>moved one step beyond <em>Doe. </em>Rather than implicitly limiting governmental liberty to custodial relationships the <em>Bowers </em>court chose to speak in broader terms; in the court\u2019s view, it was not the precise type of relationship that mattered, but whether the government had placed an individual in danger.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The analytical approach of <em>Bowers </em>was closely followed by this court one year later in <em>Fox v. Custis, </em>712 F.2d 86 (4th Cir.1983). The facts of <em>Fox </em>were similar to <em>Martinez. </em>Fox, a young woman, suffered injuries when a Virginia parolee set fire to her house. The parolee had been convicted previously of arson and grand larceny and sentenced to twenty years. After two years, he was paroled. Despite several violations, the parolee was permitted to remain on parole. It was at this point that the <em>Fox </em>arson occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We approached the question of affirmative duty in two ways. First, as in <em>Martinez, </em>we concluded that the injuries were \u201c \u2018too remote\u2019 from the challenged conduct of the State to constitute a \u2018deprivation\u2019 of constitutional rights under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. But convinced that the \u201cmix of factors\u201d made this a less persuasive case than <em>Martinez </em>to decide on proximate cause grounds, we .concluded that it was also necessary to examine whether the appellant had asserted a cognizable constitutional claim under the fourteenth amendment. Citing <em>Bowers, </em>we held that a duty could arise out of special \u201ccustodial or other relationships\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">With one qualification, we agree with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s recent holding that, in general, there simply is \u201cno constitutional right to be protected by the state against ... criminals or madmen,\u201d and that because in corollary, there is no \u201cconstitutional duty [on the state] to provide such protection, its failure to do so is not actionable under section 1983.\u201d <em>Bowers v. DeVito, </em>686 F.2d 616, 618 (7th Cir.1982). The qualification \u2014 an important one actually acknowledged by the Bowers court, id. \u2014 is that such a right and corollary duty may arise out of special custodial or other relationships created or assumed by the state in respect of particular persons. For example \u2014 as we have held in this circuit \u2014 such a right/duty relationship may arise under \u00a7 1983 with respect to inmates in the state\u2019s prisons or patients in its mental institutions whom the state knows to be under specific risk of harm from themselves or others in the state\u2019s custody or subject to its effective control. <em>Withers v. Levine, </em>615 F.2d 158 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 849, 101 S.Ct. 136, 66 L.Ed.2d 59 (1980) (prison inmates under known risk of harm from homosexual assaults by other inmates); <em>Davis v. Zahradnick, </em>600 F.2d 458 (4th Cir.1979) (inmate under observed attack by another inmate); <em>Woodhous v. Virginia, </em>487 F.2d 889 (4th Cir.1973) (same as Withers); cf. <em>Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>632 F.2d 1096, 1101-03 (4th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 929, 101 S.Ct. 1387, 67 L.Ed.2d 361 (1981) (no right where no pervasive risk of harm and specific risk unknown); see also <em>Spence v. Staras, </em>507 F.2d 554 (7th Cir.1974); <em>Gann v. Delaware State Hospital, </em>543 F.Supp. 268, 272 (D.Del.1982); <em>Walker v. Rowe, </em>535 F.Supp. 55 (N.D.Ill.1982) (duty of state to protect guards).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Our ruling, however, did not simply rehash <em>Bowers. </em>In two important respects <em>Fox </em>expanded on precedent. First, <em>Fox </em>completed the convergence of eighth and fourteenth amendment analysis that had begun in <em>Doe </em>and took shape in <em>Bowers. </em>The constitutional right that we asserted could arise was clearly based on the fourteenth amendment, but the shape and definition that we gave to that right by using the term \u201ccustodial or other relationship\u201d was influenced in large part by the consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>erations that lay behind the eighth amendment cases. Recognizing that the fourteenth amendment could not be read to \u2022establish a general affirmative duty to the public at large, we chose to limit that duty by applying a rationale similar to that used in <em>Estelle: </em>namely, that where the state had selected an individual from the public at large and placed him in a position of danger, the state was enough of an \u201cactive tortfeasor\u201d to make it only \u201cjust\u201d that the state be charged with an affirmative duty of protection. <em>Bowers </em>and <em>Doe </em>also made use of the eighth amendment analysis to address the fourteenth amendment issue, but <em>Fox </em>acknowledged more candidly and expressly than either <em>Doe </em>or <em>Bowers </em>the concerns that had helped to shape the contours of the duty imposed on the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Second, the <em>Fox </em>ruling was important because it stated in terms more explicit than <em>Bowers </em>that a right to affirmative protection need not be limited by a determination that there was a \u201ccustodial relationship.\u201d The <em>Fox </em>court ruled that a right to protection could arise from a custodial <em>or other relationship.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Pox\u2019s estate, however, failed to claim that a special relationship existed between her and the State. For this reason we found it unnecessary to define the type of \u201cspecial relationship required to give rise to a right ... to affirmative protection____\u201d 712 F.2d at 88. In one sense, then, <em>Fox </em>represented the culmination of a line of analysis that had begun in <em>Martinez, </em>.for it firmly established that a right of affirmative protection could arise under the fourteenth amendment. But at the same time <em>Fox </em>left the inquiry nearly as open-ended as <em>Martinez, </em>for it did not purport to delimit the scope of the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Having established that a right of protection may, given the proper facts, exist at present, the question now becomes whether that right was properly invoked by the plaintiffs in the cases at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Under <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), governmental officials will not be held liable if the law at the time of the alleged wrongdoing was not \u201cclearly established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738. Sylvia Brown and Michael Clark died in the spring of 1979. As our discussion in part II A above makes clear, an affirmative duty of protection under the fourteenth amendment did not emerge until after 1980. Indeed, the comparison of the post-1980 <em>Martinez-Fox </em>line of cases with <em>Estelle </em>and its pre-1980 eighth amendment progeny demonstrates just how limited the right to affirmative protection was in this circuit at the time the alleged violations occurred. Although the seeds of a fourteenth amendment-based right lay dormant in the eighth amendment cases, the defendants could not have anticipated the expansion that would later occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Moreover, even were we to rule that the defendants could have foreseen the <em>Fox </em>holding, it is not clear that under the facts of this case the defendants could, or should, have foreseen that a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d existed. Given the absence of specific guidelines to determine precisely what constitutes a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d and the particularly \u201cclose\u201d nature of the factual cases before us, we would be hard-pressed to conclude that the law as it affected the defendants was \u201cclearly established.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>need not decide whether, under the circumstances of this case, the State had created or assumed a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the Clark and Brown families. All of the defendants were entitled to a good faith immunity defense against liability under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district court should have dismissed both complaints along with the pendent claims at the summary judgment stage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We emphasize, however, that our decision today does not mean that a good faith immunity defense will always be available for defendants sued for failing to provide affirmative protection based on a <em>Fox </em>analysis. We hold only that under the facts of this case neither the state and county board members nor the caseworkers could reasonably have been expected to know that a failure to protect Sylvia Brown and Michael Clark potentially constituted a violation of their fourteenth amendment rights. Because our decision is based upon our belief that the <em>Fox </em>decision could not have been anticipated by the defendants, we need not attempt a definition of the type of relationship required to give rise to a right of protection under <em>Fox. </em>Were the issue properly before this court on different facts, there would be nothing to preclude further definition of the meaning of that term followed by a ruling that the facts of that case fell within the meaning of \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Although our decision today leaves the appellants without a remedy in federal court, the victim\u2019s estates still have several causes of action available to them in state court. We express no view on the appellants\u2019 rights under the tort law of South Carolina, but as the Seventh Circuit pointed out in <em>Bowers, </em>\u201c[t]he tendency in the common law has been to impose ever greater liability on officials who negligently fail to protect the public from dangerous criminals and lunatics.\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>666 F.2d at 618.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court for the District of South Carolina at Columbia is affirmed, and the judgment of the District Court for the District of South Carolina at Greenville is affirmed in part and dismissed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">. The <em>Clark </em>court\u2019s 54(b) certification did not purport to cover the caseworkers. The district court concluded that the evidence presented was insufficient to determine the caseworkers' involvement in the Clark investigation and that therefore the plaintiffs would be given additional time to continue discovery and file a more detailed complaint. Because a final judgment order had not been entered on the question of the caseworkers\u2019 liability at the time the suits were consolidated for appeal and notice of appeal was given, we believe that it would be improper to review the <em>Clark </em>court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to the caseworkers. The appeal by the caseworkers in <em>Clark, </em>therefore, is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">All of the <em>Brown </em>court\u2019s rulings, however, as well as the <em>Clark </em>court\u2019s rulings with respect to the Commissioner and the board members, are properly before us on appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\">.

Although we find no need to provide a comprehensive definition of \"special relationship\u201d given the facts of these cases, we note that these cases underscore some of the factors that should be included in a \"special relationship\" analysis. These factors \u2014 which would make these cases particularly close ones were we to decide them \u2014 include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">1) Whether the victim or the perpetrator was in legal custody at the time of the incident, or had been in legal custody prior to the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-14\">Here, for example, as in <em>Fox </em>and <em>Martinez </em>and unlike the situations in <em>Withers </em>and <em>Woodhous, </em>the claimants were members of the general public and not in custody. The state defendants were unaware that they, as opposed to anyone else in the public at large, faced a special danger. This fact, combined with the lack of a past or present custodial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>relationship between the state and the perpetrators, would argue against finding that a special relationship existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">2) Whether the state has expressly stated its desire to provide affirmative protection to a particular class or specific individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">This factor does not really argue convincingly one way or the other in our cases. It is difficult to conclude that the State intended to \u201csingle -out\u201d the decedents and place them in its own care as in the eighth amendment cases that <em>Fox </em>relies on so heavily. On the other hand, the preamble of the Child Protection Act does clearly express a desire to take affirmative steps to locate and protect potentially abused children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">3) Whether the State knew of the claimants\u2019 plight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">This factor goes more to the breach of the \"special relationship\" than a definition of the relationship. Yet it may prove probative of the extent to which the State intended to protect or watch over the particular claimant involved. In this case there is some indication that the State knew the children were being beaten. This strengthens the argument that some sort of special relationship had been established.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\">. The appellants argue that good faith immunity is not applicable because the affirmative duty owed by the State was \u201cclearly established\" in the Child Protection Act at the time the alleged wrongdoing occurred. This argument simply misses the mark. The law in this instance that must be \"clearly established\u201d to avert the application of <em>Harlow </em>is a constitutional right to protection by the State. A state statute, by itself, cannot create a substantive constitutional right. <em>Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980). Once an affirmative duty has been found to exist under the fourteenth amendment, it may then be possible for a State statute to trigger the application of that right. But if the underlying substantive right has not yet been clearly established, good faith immunity may be invoked regardless of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">Moreover, it is not even clear that the Child Protection Act requires the type of affirmative protection that the claimants argue that it does. The Act does not create an express duty of intervention but rather provides only that the State \"may\u201d intervene. <em>See </em>discussion supra at 189.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b271-15\">. Judge Wilkins did not act improperly in dismissing the case at the summary judgment stage with respect to those defendants for whom he found qualified immunity was applicable. In <em>Harlow </em>the Supreme Court eliminated the subjective good faith standard that had been used to determine if qualified immunity should be applied to executive officials and substituted an \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d test. The Court reasoned that if the law was not clearly established, immunity should be applied at the pretrial stage so as to minimize disruption of government activities. The court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-16\">Reliance on the objective reasonableness of an official\u2019s conduct, as measured by reference to clearly established law, should avoid excessive disruption of government and permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment. On summary judgment, the judge may determine, not only the currently applicable law, but whether that law was clearly established at the time an action occurred. If the law at that time was not clearly established, an official could not reasonably be expected to anticipate subsequent legal developments, nor could he fairly be said to \u201cknow\u201d that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.

The notion may exist that I can clarify or improve the law, even though the issue I endeavor to address is not truly presented by the case. As time goes by, however, I am coming more and more to an appreciation that, however silver the speech, silence is usually constructed from 24 karat gold.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">So, with deference, and despite the freshly minted pure silver from which the majority opinion has been east, I disassociate myself from everything appearing in the opinion endeavoring to establish the existence of a special relationship between the brutalized children on the one hand and the South Carolina Department of Social Services and its case workers on the other. Were the question before us, we should have to investigate whether the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d due process contention could hold water in the absence of the South Carolina legislation. Parental control of the destiny of a child may, in general, constitute so important a right that the Supreme Court might determine that a constitutional duty simply is not imposed on any state or local government employee who learns of suspected abuse to take steps to insure that a child apparently brutalized is removed from parental custody or otherwise guarded against violence from the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">Second, assuming that, absent statute, no right exists under the Fourteenth Amendment, we should, nevertheless, have further to decide whether the South Carolina statute brings about a <em>constitutional </em>right of affirmative protection. Neither of those two questions is easy of resolution. The cases supporting the majority\u2019s conclusion that there is a right (though admittedly rendered inapplicable here because of the existence of a good faith immunity defense) generally partake of the characteristic called \u201cdicta\u201d. They are ones which assume there is a right, but find it not applicable or not violated on the facts of the cases themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-16\">Accordingly, prudence dictates to me that I limit my participation in the majority opinion to concurrence in the proposition which all panel members accept: namely, that, <em>whether or not a constitutional right to affirmative protection exists, </em>it manifestly was not established clearly enough to permit recovery at the time that the alleged deprivations occurred. My concurrence consequently rests solely on the uncontrovertible existence in each of the cases of good faith immunity as a defense against liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
