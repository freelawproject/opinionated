SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">James Ricks, an unsuccessful candidate in the June 1983 election for the presidency of Local 6, Washington Teacher\u2019s Union (WTU), appeals a District Court order declaring that the election complied with the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA or the Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), and directing that the candidates certified by the Department of Labor (DOL) serve as the duly elected officers of the union. Ricks alleges that numerous substantive violations of LMRDA marred the conduct of the election and that DOL\u2019s certification was arbitrary, capricious, and inconsistent with the Act. He further alleges that the District Court committed several procedural irregularities in its disposition of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">We affirm the District Court in all respects but one. Even under the extraordinarily deferential standard of review set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 571-574, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1859-1861, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975), we find wholly inadequate the Secretary\u2019s treatment of Ricks\u2019 well-documented allegation that he was illegally prevented from distributing campaign literature. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(c). On this one issue, therefore, we remand to the District Court with instructions to that court to order the Secretary of Labor to reopen consideration of the \u25a0 alleged violations and submit a fuller statement of reasons and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b789-19\">A. <em>Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-20\">Following extensive investigations that revealed sometimes \u201cshocking abuses\u201d in the internal governance of labor organizations, S.Rep. No. 86-187, 86th Cong.; 1st Sess. 5 (1959) (hereinafter cited as <em>Senate </em>Report), Congress enacted the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq., </em>to \u201cguarantee internal union democracy.\u201d <em>Senate Report </em>at 6. Title IV of. the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 481-483, provides a number of procedural guarantees designed to assure free and open union elections. Among these guarantees are the right of every member in good standing to run for office, nominate candidates, and vote by secret ballot, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 481(a), (b) &amp; (d), the right of any candidate to have an observer at the polls, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 481(c), and an enforceable duty on the part of union leadership to assure all bona fide candidates equal access to the elector<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>ate in the distribution of campaign literature. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 481(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Subsequent to an \" election, any union member who has exhausted internal remedies may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 482(a). Following a mandatory investigation, the Secretary, if he finds probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred and that it has not been remedied, comes under a statutory obligation to bring a civil action against the union in federal court to set aside the election. If, after trial, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the election did not comply with LMRDA and that any violation \u201cmay have affected the outcome of the election,\u201d the court \u201cshall\u201d declare the election void and direct the Secretary to conduct a new election under his supervision. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 482(c). If, however, the supervised election satisfies the requirements of the Act, the Secretary must certify the names of those elected and request that the court issue a decree declaring them to be the duly elected officers of the union. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">B. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The election at issue in this case is the <em>third </em>that'WTU has attempted to conduct. At the request of the Secretary of Labor, the District Court nullified the results of the first two elections for gross violations of LMRDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">WTU conducted the <em>first </em>election on May 18, 1981. In this election, as in the two later elections, the rank and file were presented with several slates, each with over 20 candidates for various positions in the union leadership. Votes could be cast for candidates individually, although the results suggest that most union members voted by slate. The first election, which was conducted without DOL supervision, resulted in the election of the entire incumbent slate.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Ricks filed an administrative complaint with the Secretary pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(a). Following his statutorily required investigation, the Secretary found numerous violations of Sections 481(a) and 481(b) of the Act, including denial of a reasonable opportunity to nominate candidates and failure to conduct the election by secret ballot. The Secretary requested an order nullifying the election in its entirety and directing that WTU conduct a new election under his supervision. The District Court, after a trial limited to the issue of the secret ballot violation, granted the order in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Balloting for the <em>second </em>election (the first supervised election) took place between March 1 and March 19, 1983 under DOL supervision. Twenty-five hundred votes were cast. Ricks won the union presidency by a four-vote margin and his running mate, Jeanette Feely, was elected vice president by 21 votes. The other 19 victors were members of the slate of the incumbent president, William H. Simons. Almost immediately various union members and their representatives, including Ricks\u2019 counsel, filed protests claiming that numerous serious violations of LMRDA had occurred. The Secretary agreed, finding that Ricks had been deprived his statutorily protected right to an equal opportunity to mail campaign literature, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(c), and that at least 13 and possibly more fraudulent ballots had been cast. Affidavit of Richard G. Hunsucker, Director, Office of Labor-Management Standards Enforcement, United States Department of Labor, May 5, 1983 (Hunsucker I), at 3-4, <em>reproduced in </em>Appendix for Appellee (App. I) at 48-49. These ballots had been mailed to union members and returned to the union office as undeliverable. Somehow, they ended up in the ballot box. Believing that \u201cit is impossible to gauge exactly how many votes were cast in this manner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4, App. I at 49, on May 9, 1983 the Secretary petitioned the District Court to order a second supervised election for all offices. On May 10th the court nullified the March 1983 election and directed WTU to conduct yet another election, again under DOL supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">Ricks objected to that part of the District Court\u2019s order requiring that the second supervised election include the offices of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>president and vice president. In Ricks\u2019 view, he and Feely had won the second election <em>in spite of </em>the illegal conduct of the incumbent leadership. Reasoning that the incumbents should not be able to profit from their own misconduct, and-that the fraud could not have \u201caffect[ed] the outcome\u201d of the election for those two offices, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(c)(2), he argued that the supervised reelection should only be for the other positions. On June 2, 1983, treating Ricks\u2019 objection as a motion to reconsider the May 10th order, the District Court rejected the argument. Finding that \u201cplain old voter fraud * * * makes this whole election worthless,\u201d Transcript of June 2, 1983 Proceedings (Tr.) at 4, the court held that a new election for all of the positions was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">The <em>third </em>election \u2014 the subject of this appeal \u2014 was conducted under DOL supervision on June 18, 1983 and resulted in the defeat of Ricks and Feely and the election of all of the candidates on the incumbent slate. Ricks again protested the results of the election. But this time, after investigation, the Secretary found that whatever minimal violations of LMRDA occurred in the course of the election could not have \u201caffect[ed] the outcome.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(c)(2). Accordingly, he moved for a court order certifying the election and declaring the victorious candidates the duly elected officers of WTU. Certification of Election, August 12, 1983, App. I at 61-62. The District Court granted the order in full, Order and Judgment, September 29, 1983, App. I at 77-78, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AJU\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">In <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, supra, </em>the Supreme Court set out the appropriate standard for reviewing a decision by the Secretary of Labor not to bring a civil action to set aside a union election for violations of LMRDA. In <em>Usery v. Local U. No. 639, Int\u2019l Bhd of Teamsters, </em>543 F.2d 369 (D.C.Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1123, 97 S.Ct. 1159, 51 L.Ed.2d 573 (1977), this court held that the <em>Dunlop </em>standard of review applied as well to the Secretary\u2019s decision to certify an election as valid. Because of the special expertise of the Secretary of Labor and the congressional objective of \u201csettling] as quickly as possible the cloud on the incumbent\u2019s title to office,\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 463, 468 n. 7, 88 S.Ct. 643, 647 n. 7, 19 L.Ed.2d 705 (1968), <em>the Dunlop </em>standard of review is \u201cmuch narrower than applies under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a) [the arbitrary and capricious standard of the Administrative Procedure Act].\u201d <em>Usery, supra, </em>543 F.2d at 378. More specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcX\">Except in what must be the rare case, the court\u2019s review should be confined to examination of the \u201creasons\u201d statement, and' the determination whether the statement, without more, evinces that the Secretary\u2019s decision is so irrational as to constitute the decision arbitrary and capricious. Thus, review may not extend to cognizance or trial of a complaining member\u2019s challenges to the factual bases for the Secretary\u2019s conclusion either that no violations occurred or that they did not affect the outcome of the election. The full trappings of adversary trial-type hearings would be defiant of congressional objectives * * *. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-12\"><em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 573, 95 S.Ct. at 1860. Though highly solicitous of the Secretary\u2019s views, the <em>Dunlop </em>Court made clear that his latitude was not boundless. At a minimum, he must submit a statement of reasons that is \u201cadequate to enable the court to determine whether the * * * decision was reached for an impermissible reason or for no reason at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus the \u201cstatement of reasons should inform the court and the complaining union member of both the grounds of decision and the essential facts upon which the Secretary\u2019s inferences are based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573-574, 95 S.Ct. at 1861. With this standard of review in mind,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we now turn to Ricks\u2019 many allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>B. <em>The LMDRA Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"AfG\">Ricks alleges seven separate violations of LMRDA. For convenience we divide them into two sections. <em>First, </em>pointing to no specific provision, Ricks maintains that the District Court violated the spirit of the Act by requiring a new election for the positions of president and vice president even though, in Ricks\u2019 view, the record suggests that the incumbents were responsible for the LMDRA violations. <em>Second, </em>he alleges six specific violations of the Act: (1) that WTU breached its statutory obligation to reopen the nominating process prior to conducting the June 18, 1983 supervised election; (2) that Ricks\u2019 observers were prevented from observing bank checks used to establish voter eligibility; (3) that ballots were received by individuals not on any list; (4) that \u201cfunctional chapter\u201d members were permitted to vote in the election though ineligible under the union\u2019s by-laws and constitution; (5) that some members who had not paid their dues were permitted to vote though they were ineligible under the union\u2019s by-laws and constitution; and (6) that Ricks supporters were prevented from distributing campaign literature. Of these claims, only the last has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">1. <em>Requiring Ricks to run in the third election. </em>Ricks maintains that the District Court erred in requiring him to run in the third election. He reasons that he won the second election in spite of the illegal efforts on the part of the union to thwart his bid, and asserts that it would be inequitable for the victors of the third election to profit from their own misconduct. The Secretary argues that deference should be paid to his findings and those of the District Court that the fraud in the second election was so pervasive that ordering a rerun election for all offices was appropriate. He also argues that LMRDA\u2019s concern is not just with the interests of the competing candidates but also with the integrity of the electoral process. He derives from this unassailable proposition the argument that notions of equity, such as the clean hands doctrine, have no place in LMRDA analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Without question, the Act embodies a \u201cvital public interest in assuring free and democratic union elections that transcends the narrower interest of the complaining union member.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>389 U.S. at 475, 88 S.Ct. at 650. <em>See also Local 3489, United Steelworkers v. Usery, </em>429 U.S. 305, 309, 97 S.Ct. 611, 614, 50 L.Ed.2d 502 (1977). But beyond this general concern with the integrity of the electoral process, Congress sought to \u201cprevent, discourage, and make unprofitable\u201d improper conduct by entrenched union leadership. <em>Senate Report </em>at 5. Given this objective, we find it inconceivable that Congress intended to permit an incumbent union faction to abuse the Section 482(c) remedy by intentionally violating LMRDA\u2019s provisions and then, if defeated, invoking those violations as the basis for rerunning the election.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Marshall v. Local 1010, United Steelworkers, </em>664 F.2d 144, 151 (7th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Thus we agree with Ricks that, when faced with intentional misconduct by defeated incumbents, the District Court may, consistent with the letter and spirit of LMRDA, exercise its discretion and not require a Section 482(c) reelection. Under this standard, however, the District Court did not err in requiring a reelection for <em>all </em>offices, including those lost by the incumb\u00e9nts in the second election. Ricks himself admits that he \u201ccannot prove,\u201d brief for appellant at 24, that the Section 481(c) vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>lations were intentional, and neither the District Court nor the Secretary so found. The history and climate of the election make plausible Ricks\u2019 claim that the incumbents were responsible for the fraudulently cast ballots. But, based on our extensive review of the record, we cannot say that the District Court erred in failing to attribute intentional violations to the incumbents.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Thus appellant\u2019s claim that the District Court erred in requiring a rerun of the presidential and vice presidential elections must stand or fall on whether the fraud tainted the election for all offices and, accordingly, \u201cmay have affected the outcome\u201d within the meaning of Section 482(c)(2). <em>Usery v. Stove, Furnace &amp; Allied Appliance Wkrs, </em>547 F.2d 1043, 1047 (8th Cir.1977). The Secretary explicitly found that at least 13 fraudulent ballots were voted and concluded, after thorough investigation, that \u201cit is impossible to gauge exactly how many votes were cast in this manner.\u201d Hunsucker I at 4, App. I at 49. These underlying factual determinations, fully set out by the Secretary, are not open to judicial reassessment. We find the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that the fraud \u201cmay have affected the outcome\u201d of all positions in the second election fully supported and entirely rational. Under the controlling standard of review, therefore, our task is at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">2. <em>The six specific allegations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">a. <em>Failure to reopen the nomination process. </em>In conducting the June 18, 1983 election, the Secretary did not reopen the nominating process. Instead, reasoning that this was to be a rerun of the now-nullified second election, he limited the candidates to those who had been nominated to run in that election. Ricks alleges that'failure to reopen the nominating process violates 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(c), which requires that union members in good standing be permitted to participate in nominating candidates for \u201cany election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">The argument is plainly incorrect. Section 481(c) does speak in general terms about \u201cany election.\u201d However, neither the purpose of the provision nor any case law construing it undermines the Secretary\u2019s eminently reasonable view that the nominating process need not be reopened when a court orders a supervised reelection. Given Congress\u2019 clear intent to expedite the certification of a valid election, <em>Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>389 U.S. at 468 n. 7, 88 S.Ct. at 647 n. 7, and the absence of any suggestion that the nomination process itself was tainted,2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Secretary\u2019s construction of the statute comports with common sense and merits deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">b. <em>Preventing Ricks\u2019 observers from verifying voter eligibility. </em>Ricks maintains, and the Secretary does not dispute, that Ricks\u2019 supporters were not permitted to observe cancelled checks that showed timely payment of dues and were the basis for determining voter eligibility. The parties vigorously disagree over whether this conduct violated the Act. Ricks points to Section 481(c), which mandates \u201c[ajdequate safeguards to insure a fair election * * *, including the right of any candidate to have an observer at the polls and at the counting of the ballots.\u201d The Secretary suggests, without more, that the request was made at an \u201cinopportune moment during the tally.\u201d Affidavit of Richard G. Hunsucker, August 12, 1983 (Hunsucker II) at 12, App. I at 74. We doubt that this unsupported statement satisfies even the minimal demands imposed by <em>Dunlop. </em>The- Secretary did, however, provide ample factual support for his conclusion that the violation could not have \u201caffected the outcome\u201d and thus could not be the basis for overturning the election. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(c)(2). He conducted an investigation, traced all of the checks to the union\u2019s itemized bank deposit slips, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>concluded that all were genuine. Hunsucker II at 5, App. I at 67. Under the <em>Dunlop </em>standard of review, this fully supported and uncontested conclusion is not open to judicial reassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">c. <em>The mismailing of ballots. </em>Three nonmembers somehow received ballots in the mail. Hunsucker II at 9, App. I at 71. Ricks suggests that the mismailing should have triggered suspicion of more substantial fraud. But because the Secretary explicitly found, and appellant does not contest, that the three ballots in question were not voted, Ricks cannot seriously allege an LMRDA violation or credibly suggest that the mismailings \u201cmay have affected the outcome\u201d of the election. Appellant\u2019s assertion on this ground is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">d. <em>Permitting functional chapter members to vote. </em>The Act requires the Secretary to give effect to a union\u2019s constitution and by-laws to the extent that they are consistent with the statutory scheme. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(e); <em>Usery v. Local 639, Int\u2019l Bhd, of Teamsters, supra, </em>543 F.2d at 371. Ricks insists that the Secretary permitted \u201cfunctional members\u201d to vote even though the WTU constitution denies them the franchise. Article IV, Section lb of the WTU by-laws defines \u201cFunctional Chapters\u201d as \u201cemployees in other groups organized by the Union.\u201d Constitution and ByLaws, WTU Local 6, March 16,1981, <em>reproduced in </em>Appendix of Appellant (App. II) at 11. Article III of the WTU constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">All personnel employed or retired by the Board of Education, except officers charged with the assignment, scheduling, rating or promotion of such personnel, and workers in other groups organized by the Union [functional members], shall be eligible for membership. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">App. II at 8. The quoted provision leaves ambiguous whether the \u201cfunctional members\u201d language is part of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause or a continuation of the category enumerated in the first line. The Secretary's construction of the provision is eminently plausible. Indeed Section 411(a)(1), which gives \u201c[e]very member of a labor, organization * * * equal rights * * * to vote,\u201d may well require that construction. Ricks offers not a single reason for resolving the statutory ambiguity in favor of excepting functional members from eligibility. In any case, given the Secretary\u2019s expertise, deference is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">e. <em>Permitting members whose dues were in arrears to vote. </em>WTU ByLaw Article IV \u00a7 2 requires that \u201c[a]ll members except retired members shall pay their dues by payroll deduction, or in full by November 10th * * *.\u201d App. II at 11. Article III \u00a7 3 renders ineligible all members whose dues are more than 90 days in arrears. <em>Id. </em>at 10. The Secretary counted the 90-day period from November 10th and permitted members to vote provided they had paid dues by February 8, 1983. Ricks claims that anyone not paid in full by November 10th should have been declared ineligible. As with the \u201cfunctional member\u201d ambiguity, the language of the WTU bylaws leaves unresolved whether the 90-day arrearage period should begin or end on November 10. In our view, the Secretary\u2019s construction is the most natural reading. In any event, his interpretation of the WTU by-laws is entirely reasonable and, under the <em>Dunlop </em>standard of review, deference is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">f. <em>Impeding the distribution of campaign literature. </em>Far more troubling is the Secretary\u2019s treatment of Ricks\u2019 allegation that the union leadership systematically thwarted his statutorily protected right to distribute campaign literature. Numerous affidavits recount incidents in which, for example, such literature was removed from school mailboxes before the intended recipients had an opportunity to read it. <em>See, e.g., </em>Affidavit of Frances McFall, June 25, 1983, <em>reproduced in </em>App. II at 80. If attributable to the union leadership, such interference constitutes a clear violation of Section 481(c) of the Act, and certification of the election would be improper if the infraction \u201cmay have affected the outcome of the election.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>In certifying the results of the June 18, 1983 election despite Ricks\u2019 allegation on this point, the Secretary did not contest any of Ricks\u2019 copious documentation. Instead, he offered the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">In each instance, where one form of campaigning was denied initially, another was present, an alternate means to complete the campaign task was devised or inadequate attempts were made. There is no evidence that the candidates were not uniformly treated at each of the schools. Accordingly, either the violation was remedied in a timely manner or no violation occurred to justify upsetting the election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Hunsucker II at 8, App. I at 70. Under <em>Dunlop, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 573, 95 S.Ct. at 1860, a court must defer to the Secretary\u2019s conclusions provided only that they are rational and that he has offered a statement of reasons that informs the court of both the \u201cgrounds of decision and the essential facts upon which the Secretary\u2019s inferences are based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 95 S.Ct. at 1861. Even under this deferential standard, the Secretary\u2019s treatment of Ricks\u2019 allegations is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The factual basis for the conclusion that \u201calternate means\u201d of campaigning were \u201cdevised\u201d is by no means clear.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If we give the Secretary the benefit of the doubt, however, it is possible to conclude that Ricks\u2019 opportunity to mail literature or to campaign outside polling stations was the basis for <em>this </em>finding. Hunsucker II at 8-9, App. I at 70-71; Transcript of Trial at 113-114. But the first sentence of the Secretary\u2019s statement is in the disjunctive, and nowhere does the Secretary provide even the most cursory statement of the facts underlying his conclusion that Ricks made inadequate attempts to circumvent the interference with his statutorily protected right to distribute campaign literature. Nor does he defend the dubious proposition that the degree of Ricks\u2019 failure to vitiate someone else\u2019s illegal conduct is a permissible consideration at all. Moreover, the statement that \u201cthere is no evidence that the candidates were not uniformly treated\u201d is directly at odds with the extensive documentation provided by Ricks. If the Secretary has reasons for not crediting the many affidavits that directly contradict his conclusions, he must offer at least a cursory explanation. The conclusory assertion that \u201cno evidence\u201d suggests discriminatory treatment simply is not \u201cadequate to enable the court to determine whether the * * * decision was reached for an impermissible reason or for no reason at all.\u201d <em>Dunlop, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 573, 95 S.Ct. at 1861.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">Finally, the last line of the Secretary\u2019s explanation appears to suggest that even if violations occurred they did not affect the outcome of the election. While deference to this conclusion ordinarily is appropriate, in this case it is not warranted. Given that in the <em>second </em>election the Secretary concluded that extensive interference with campaign literature distribution did affect the outcome, Hunsucker I at 4-5, App. I at 49-50, and that the Secretary has offered no factual basis whatever for disregarding the substantial allegations of interference in the <em>third </em>election, the perfunctory and cryptic suggestion that such interference could not have affected the election\u2019s outcome is insufficient to satisfy even <em>Dun-lop\u2019s </em>minimal demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">C. <em>The Procedural Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">In addition to his allegation of substantive LMRDA violations, appellant asserts two procedural bases for reversing the decision of the District Court. Neither need detain us long.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">First, Ricks claims that the District Court failed to permit him adequate time to respond to the Secretary\u2019s motion to rerun the second election. On May 9, 1983 the Secretary moved for an order declaring that the second election was void and directing that he conduct a third election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>under his supervision. The District Court granted the order on May 10. Ricks argues that in acting so swiftly the court did not afford him adequate time to file a response opposing that part of the order requiring a new election for all union officers. In particular, he alleges violation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(e) (three extra days for service by mail) and Local Rule l-9(d) (ten days to oppose motion), which he reads together to afford him a mandatory 13 days to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Even were we to conclude that the District Court\u2019s disposition of the May 9 motion was premature, we would consider it a mindless celebration of form to reverse on this ground. Ultimately the court, treating the procedure as a motion for reconsideration, permitted Ricks to file a written memorandum<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, on June 2, to present his objections orally. Tr. at 4. Appellant makes no effort to argue that the court failed to afford him an opportunity to be heard, or that the court applied a different standard of review to the motions for reconsideration than it would have to the original motion. Ricks has had his \u201cday in court.\u201d Nothing would be gained by requiring the District Court to go through the motions of rehearing argument on a question it has already fully considered and resolved, and we decline the invitation to remand for so pointless an exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Finally, Ricks alleges that the District Court should have treated the Secretary\u2019s motion to certify the June election as a motion for summary judgment. This circuit has clearly held that the full panoply of summary judgment procedures do not apply to motions to certify union elections. <em>Usery v. Local No. 639, Int\u2019l Bhd of Teamsters, supra, </em>543 F.2d at 378. Ricks, however, finds in <em>Usery </em>a negative inference that under the proper conditions \u2014 all, he maintains, satisfied here \u2014 summary judgment is the required procedure. Apparently, the motivation for his claim is the belief that the trial court must hold an evidentiary hearing if the nonmoving party alleges the existence of material disputes of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The argument is plainly incorrect. Whatever label we attach to it, the appropriate procedure for reviewing DOL decisions to certify union elections is set out in <em>Usery v. Local 639, supra, </em>which in turn borrowed -the methodology announced in <em>Dunlop, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 573, 95 S.Ct. at 1860. The District Court clearly applied the correct approach. At bottom, Ricks is seeking the \u201cfull trappings of adversary trial-type hearings,\u201d an approach that \u201cwould be defiant of congressional objectives.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Of Ricks\u2019 numerous claims, only one has merit. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s direction in <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>this circuit will defer to the decision of the Secretary of Labor to certify a union election provided only that he supply a brief statement setting out the factual basis for his conclusions and that those conclusions are rational. Even under this highly deferential standard, we find inadequate the Secretary\u2019s treatment of Ricks\u2019 allegations of illegal interference with the distribution of campaign literature. <em>Dunlop </em>holds that the appropriate procedure in this circumstance is to remand to the District Court with instructions to direct the Secretary to explain more fully the basis of his decision to certify. In all other respects, the decision below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and remanded in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\">. We review, of course, not the Secretary\u2019s decision to certify a union election, but a District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Court order implementing that decision. We consider the rationality of the Secretary\u2019s certification and the adequacy of his explanation to be questions of law. Thus our review of the District Court's treatment of those questions is not limited to the \"clearly erroneous\u201d standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\">. Reading this measure of flexibility into the application of \u00a7 482(c) comports with the congressional objective of creating \"a judicial remedy appropriate for each specific problem.\u201d <em>Senate Report </em>at 7. <em>See also Usery v. Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots, </em>538 F.2d 946 (2d Cir.1976) (suit under \u00a7 482 is essentially an equitable proceeding).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\">. Ricks does not contest the Secretary\u2019s finding that the violations that occurred in the course of the first supervised election did not affect the nomination process. Hunsucker II at 12, App. I at 74.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\">. Remarkably, in a supplemental explanatory memorandum submitted in response to a question at oral argument, counsel for the Secretary supports his assertion that alternate means were available by citing the many affidavits alleging discrimination against the Ricks campaign.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">. On May 23 appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to appellee's motion for entry of an order directing a new election. We have not been able to review the contents of that memorandum because the document itself was not in the record transmitted to us by the District Court. The description in the docket sheet, however, makes clear that the memorandum concerned the question whether a new election should be held for all officers. In any event, the District Court heard oral argument on the question on June 2. The transcript of that proceeding indicates that the issue received full consideration at that time.
