In this consolidated appeal, they question the legal sufficiency of the indictment to charge one of the RICO offenses and of the evidence to support their multiple convictions. They also question several of the trial judge\u2019s rulings made prior to, during, and after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">We conclude that the allegations of the indictment were sufficient to charge the RICO offense in question and that the evidence proved each of the offenses charged against appellants, except the one charged against Francis \u201cJigger\u201d Santo in count five of the indictment. We also conclude that the trial judge did not err in making the pretrial, trial, and post-trial rulings that appellants question. Accordingly, except as to Francis Santo\u2019s conviction on count five, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-19\">A. <em>The Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-20\">From January 1, 1973 through December 1975, Alexander Heller, Howard Horowitz, Sanford Rafsky, and Herbert Zucker (\u201cthe partners\u201d and primary victims of appellants\u2019 loan sharking activities) were owners and officers of Z &amp; H, Inc. (Z &amp; H), which manufactured ladies\u2019 sportswear in Hialeah, Florida. The partners formed Z &amp; H in late 1972. Rafsky was its president, although his name did not appear on Z &amp; H\u2019s corporate documents because he had recently declared bankruptcy. In January 1973, the partners traveled to Las Vegas to obtain cash from casinos with which to capitalize Z &amp; H. Heller, Horowitz, and Rafsky procured $35,000 in credit from the Aladdin Hotel, gambled briefly, cashed their chips and returned to Florida, owing approximately $32,000 to the hotel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following May, two \u201cstrong, burly-looking\u201d men from Las Vegas arrived at Z &amp; H\u2019s Hialeah plant and threatened the partners with physical harm<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unless they paid their debt to the Aladdin Hotel. At this point Angelo Pepe, Z &amp; H\u2019s plant superintendent, interceded on behalf of the partners. Pepe took the two men aside for a chat and they left shortly thereafter, stating that Pepe was a \u201cgood friend.\u201d Rafsky then gave Pepe a check for $5,000 to settle the $32,-000 debt in full. Pepe took the check, telling the partners that it was for \u201cChink\u201d (Facchiano) who apparently had sufficient influence to cancel the debt to the casino.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>By mid-1973, Z &amp; H could not pay its bills and was unable to secure bank loans. Z &amp; H\u2019s financial difficulties were the genesis for the crimes committed in this case. The partners borrowed money from, and were victimized by, two groups of loan sharks. The first group, consisting of appellant Albert \u201cChink\u201d Facchiano and his lieutenant, Vincent \u201cTerry\u201d Terriacca, made two extortionate loans to the partners. The second group, headed by appellant Francis \u201cJigger\u201d Santo and staffed by two enforcers, appellants Thomas Miglionico and Paul Santo, made three loans to the partners. Both groups employed appellant Angelo Pepe as a loan solicitor, collection agent, and enforcer. The two groups also combined their resources to extort loan payments from the partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">When Z &amp; H became strapped for cash, Pepe told the partners that he could obtain \u201cshylock loans,\u201d setting the stage for the partners\u2019 first contact with the loan sharking group. The partners expressed interest, and Pepe introduced Herbert Zucker to Terriacca, Facchiano\u2019s lieutenant, in Miami. Terriacca told Zucker that he was in the business of loaning money at high interest rates, and he offered to loan the partners $10,000 at three percent interest per week. Terriacca warned Zucker that the partners would suffer severe consequences if they failed to pay off the loan. The three men parted without negotiating a loan; Pepe cautioned Zucker that \u201cthose people don\u2019t play games.\u201d. Thereafter, Rafsky asked Pepe to try to negotiate a lower interest rate. Pepe and Zucker met Terriacca again, and Terriacca, acceding to Pepe\u2019s request, told Zucker that the interest rate would be two percent per week. The parties agreed to a $10,000 loan at that rate, and Terriacca warned Zucker, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get hurt, so pay it back on time.\u201d Before the loan closed, Pepe cautioned Zucker that \u201cthis is a tough, hard organization, and be sure to pay back the loan, otherwise [someone would] get hurt.\u201d He also told Zucker that Terriacca was a lieutenant for \u201cChink\u201d (Facchiano), who operated the largest \u201cshylocking\u201d operation in south Florida for an organized crime \u201cfamily.\u201d They closed the loan in July 1973 at a third meeting, arranged by Pepe. Terriacca instructed Zucker to pay the loan off through Pepe in ten weekly installments. The partners paid off the loan, as scheduled, through Pepe.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Z &amp; H continued to have financial difficulties, and in late 1973 the partners asked Pepe if he could arrange another loan. This time Pepe went to Francis \u201cJigger\u201d Santo, a South Florida bookmaker, and obtained a $20,000 loan, at an interest rate of one and one-half percent per week, payable in weekly installments of $2,000. Pepe gave the partners $18,000 of the loan proceeds and, with their acquiescence, kept $2,000 as a commission. The partners used $15,000 of the money to purchase two thoroughbred race horses named \u201cJigger\u2019s Gal\u201d and \u201cSew for Four.\u201d \u201cSew for Four\u201d was a success, and the partners paid Pepe some of the interest due on the Santo loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In February 1974, the partners got Pepe to obtain a second loan from Francis Santo, $25,000 at an interst rate of two and one-half percent per week payable in cash through Pepe. The first Santo loan was still unpaid, so Rafsky gave Santo a $50,-000 check as collateral to cover both loans. Francis Santo warned the partners that they would get hurt if they failed to pay off the loans. Pepe also told Rafsky that \u201cthings [will] get rough if you don\u2019t get the payments made on time.!\u2019 To ensure that the partners\u2019 payments would be forthcoming, Francis Santo made the partners hire Thomas Miglionico as a laborer in Z &amp; H\u2019s plant, so that Miglionico could \u201cwatch [San-to\u2019s] money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Z &amp; H\u2019s cash flow problems continued, and on June 25, 1974 Pepe arranged a third loan from Francis Santo for $20,000 at three percent interest per week, again payable weekly through Pepe. . As before, Pepe gave the partners $18,000 of the proceeds and kept $2,000 as a commission. The partners used the $18,000 to buy fabric. Later that month Pepe obtained on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>behalf of the partners, through Terriacea, a second Facchiano/Terriacca loan for between $15,000 and $20,000, at three percent interest per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">By August 1974, the partners were substantially in arrears on the three Santo loans and the second Facchiano/Terriacca loan. Terriacea harassed Rafsky frequently, often coming to Z &amp; H\u2019s plant, but Rafsky still made no payments on the loans. Francis Santo told Rafsky that unless payment was forthcoming he would break Rafsky\u2019s legs or tear his eyes out. Santo offered to take the race horses in lieu of payment. Pepe and Miglionico also pressured the partners. Pepe told them to pay up because he was \u201cbeing hounded by Terriacea and Chink [Facchiano]\u201d; Miglionico said that he would protect Francis San-to\u2019s interests at all costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Fearing for his safety, Rafsky fled to New York. Soon after his arrival, however, Paul Santo, Francis Santo\u2019s son, who lived in Massachusetts, began calling Rafsky demanding that he make payments on his father\u2019s loans. Finally, in January 1975, Rafsky agreed to meet with Paul Santo at a steak house in New York City to discuss the Francis Santo loans. Rafsky took three friends with him to the meeting for protection. At the meeting, Paul San-to, warning Rafsky that he became violent when he lost his temper, demanded that Rafsky pay $75,000 in satisfaction of the Francis Santo loans. The next day Rafsky offered Paul Santo a $5,000 check as partial payment, but Santo refused to take the check, d\u00e9manding that Rafsky pay in cash. Shortly thereafter Rafsky sent Paul Santo $5,000 in cash through Edward Vanasco, one of Santo\u2019s friends. This partial payment, however, did not diminish the Santos\u2019 collection efforts. The Santos and Pepe made threatening phone calls to Rafsky, prompting Rafsky to pay Paul Santo an additional $2,500 in cash. Rafsky also had a friend give Paul Santo two small cash payments. Paul Santo and Rafsky subsequently met for a second time in a New York City restaurant. Rafsky again came with three friends; Santo brought Vanasco and Pepe. After a heated argument Rafsky agreed that he still owed Francis Santo $65,000.'</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">When the partners failed to make any further payments, Paul Santo told Rafsky to meet him again in New York City, this time at the Essex House. The meeting was held on September 23, 1975, but Rafsky failed to appear because he feared for his safety. Instead, he sent two friends, Norman Kops and Lionel Reifler. They met with Paul Santo, Vanasco, and Facchiano, who had traveled to New. York City from South Florida to attend the meeting. Facchiano opened the meeting by complaining bitterly about the money the partners owed him for the second Facchiano/Terriacca loan. Paul Santo then demanded that the balance due on the Santo loans be paid off; he stated that he would accept either cash or the partners\u2019 horses in satisfaction of the loans. He told Kops and Reifler that he would shoot \u201cSew for Four\u201d or break its .legs; he would also break Rafsky\u2019s legs and kidnap his wife and children if payment was not made. Santo then grabbed Reifler by the throat, letting go when Facchiano intervened. As the meeting came to a close, Facchiano told Paul Santo that he could do \u201cwhatever he wished.\u201d As far as Facchiano was concerned, Santo and Vanasco could assume the collection of his loan. Kops and Reifler told Facchiano and Santo that they would relay their messages to Rafsky. After the meeting, Facchiano told Santo and Vanasco that he was optimistic that everyone would get paid; he had spoken with the trainer of the partners\u2019 race horses and learned that \u201cSew for Four\u201d had been winning large purses.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">In October 1975, Rafsky returned to Miami with a friend, Vincent Carrano. On October 23 they went to Calder Race Track where, by chance, they encountered Francis Santo. Santo pushed Rafsky, spat at him and vowed to \u201cbreak [his] legs, when [he] got out of the hospital, break them again, until [he] became a rat.\u201d Carrano mollified Santo, promising him that he would be paid. That evening, Francis San-to placed a call to Rafsky. Carrano an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>swered the telephone and told him that Rafsky could not meet him the next day because they were traveling to Fort Myers, Florida. The following afternoon, after returning from Fort Myers, Rafsky and Carrano stopped by the racetrack to place a few bets. Pepe happened to see them there, but avoided any contact with them. Later, as Rafsky and Carrano were leaving the track, they encountered Miglionico. He told Rafsky to follow him because \u201cJigger wants to see you.\u201d Rafsky refused, and Miglionico beat him in the face and punched Carrano. He then ran off but was immediately apprehended by a security guard who saw the incident. Meanwhile, Rafsky was taken to a nearby hospital. He lost six teeth and eventually fifty percent of the vision in one eye and ten percent in the-other.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">B. <em>The Indictment and Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aet\">On June 21, 1979, a grand jury in the Miami Division of the Southern District of Florida returned a seven-count indictment against Facchiano, Miglionico, Pepe, Francis Santo, Paul Santo, and Terriacca.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Count one charged all defendants with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d) (1982)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by conspiring from June 1973 to October 1975 to violate section 1962(c) of the RICO statute. Section 1962(c) prohibits participation in the affairs of an interstate loan sharking enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or collection of unlawful debt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Count one listed twenty-nine overt acts the conspirators allegedly committed in furtherance of their conspiracy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Count two of the indictment charged all six defendants with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) (1982),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a substantive section of the EICO statute, by participating in the conduct of an enterprise in one or both of two ways: through a pattern of racketeering activity or through the collection of unlawful debt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To establish a pattern of racketeering at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity must be shown;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to establish the collection of unlawful debt only one act of collection must be shown. The acts of racketeering activity and collections of unlawful debt alleged in the indictment are crucial to this appeal, and we describe them extensively in the margin.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Count two listed eleven separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>acts of racketeering activity and also incorporated counts three through seven as additional acts of racketeering. All of these racketeering acts dealt with loan sharking: the extortionate extension of the five loans we have described <em>supra </em>in subpart A, the separate use of extortionate means, threats, and assaults to collect the loans, and travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of using extortionate means to collect them. Count two also listed ten different acts of collection or attempted collection of unlawful debt by the appellants. All of these acts stemmed from the appellants\u2019 efforts to collect the five loans we have described.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Count three charged Pepe and Francis Santo with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892 (1982), for making the third Santo loan of $18,000 on June 25, 1974, which allegedly was an extortionate extension of credit. Count four charged Terriacca with violating section 892 by making the first Terriacca loan of $10,000 in July 1973. Count five charged Facchiano with violating the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3) (1982), by traveling in interstate commerce (to the Essex House meeting in New York City) for unlawful purposes (to force payment). It also charged Francis Santo, Paul Santo, and Terriacca with aiding and abetting that violation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1982). Count six charged Francis Santo with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894 (1982), by using extortionate means to collect credit from Rafsky on October 23, 1975, the day before the Calder Race Track assault. Count seven charged Miglionico with violating the same statute on October 24, 1975, the day he assaulted Rafsky at the racetrack.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">Shortly after the grand jury returned its indictment, the district court, on its own motion, transferred the case pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 18 from its Miami Division to its West Palm Beach Division and then to its Fort Lauderdale Division, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>closer to Miami, due to the congested state of the Miami docket. Facchiano and Terriacca thereafter moved for a severance of parties. The court granted Terriacca\u2019s motion and tried him separately. The remaining defendants, prior to the trial, requested that the court hold a <em>James </em>hearing, <em>see United States v. James, </em>590 F.2d 575 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 917, 99 S.Ct. 2836, 61 L.Ed.2d 283 (1979), to determine the admissibility of the evidence the government intended to offer at trial. The court acceded to their request and scheduled the hearing. The court continued the hearing, however, when Francis Santo became ill. He remained ill, and the court finally decided to hold the hearing in his absence. The <em>James </em>hearing lasted thirteen days. Francis Santo\u2019s attorney attended it throughout, and Santo appeared toward the end.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The appellants\u2019 trial before a jury in Fort Lauderdale started in late November 1980 and lasted five weeks. The government established the facts we have related <em>supra </em>in subpart A. Rafsky, Zucker, and Rafsky\u2019s New York associates testified for the government and underwent extensive cross-examination. Gary Bowdach, a former racketeer and frequent government witness, also testified. The jury found Facchiano guilty on counts one, two, and five; Miglionico not guilty on count one but guilty on counts two and seven; Pepe guilty on counts one, two, and three; Francis Santo guilty on counts one, two, three, five, and six; and Paul Santo guilty on counts one, two, and five.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In this appeal, appellants make a number of challenges, including the sufficiency of count two of the indictment,- the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s disposition of their pretrial motions, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the correctness of various evidentiary rulings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For convenience, we consider these challenges in the following order. In Part II, we address the pretrial rulings; in Part III, we address the sufficiency of the evidence and the evidentiary rulings appellants question; and in Part IY, we address the sufficiency of count two of the indictment and the remaining claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">A. <em>Transfer to the Fort Lauderdale Division</em></p>\n<p id=\"A50\">Appellants claim that transfer of the <em>James </em>hearing and jury trial from the Miami Division to the Fort Lauderdale Division violated their rights under Fed.R.Crim.P. 18.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rule 18 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-p\">[T]he prosecution shall be had in a district in which the offense was committed. The court shall fix the place of trial within the district with due regard to the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses <em>and the prompt administration of justice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">(emphasis added). The appellants claim that the district court, in transferring the case to the Fort Lauderdale Division and subsequently denying their motions to return the case to Miami, acted arbitrarily because the transfer benefited only the government and did not give \u201cdue regard\u201d to their convenience. We find no merit in their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">Rule 18 was amended on August 1, 1979, to add the phrase \u201cand the prompt administration of justice.\u201d The pre-1979 Rule 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>as interpreted by the former Fifth Circuit,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> authorized a district court to transfer a case to a division other than the one where the offense was committed <em>only </em>for the convenience of the defendant and witnesses. <em>Dupoint v. United States, </em>388 F.2d 39, 43 (5th Cir.1968). The <em>Dupoint </em>interpretation of Rule 18 caused problems with the Speedy Trial Act, which was intended to \u201c \u2018permit the trial of a case at any place within the judicial district.\u2019 \u201d Rule 18 advisory committee note (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 93-1508, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1974)). To resolve these problems Congress passed the 1979 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Rule 18 does not \u201cencompass an absolute right on the part of [a defendant] to be tried in the division of his choice.\u201d <em>Houston v. United States, </em>419 F.2d 30, 33 (5th Cir.1969). Rather, a defendant\u2019s only right is that the trial court give \u201cdue regard\u201d to the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses when setting a place for trial. <em>United States v. Burns, </em>662 F.2d 1378, 1382 (11th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. McRary, </em>616 F.2d 181, 185 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1011, 102 S.Ct. 2306, 73 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1982); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>504 F.2d 92, 98 (6th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 975, 95 S.Ct. 1974, 44 L.Ed.2d 466 (1975). Here, the record indicates that the trial judge gave due regard to the desires of the appellants to be tried in Miami. After scheduling the trial for West Palm Beach, the court moved the trial to Fort Lauderdale, a place much closer to Miami, in an effort to satisfy their needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">In this case, the Rule 18 requirement of \u201cprompt administration of justice\u201d overrode the appellants\u2019 desire for absolute convenience. Courtroom space in the Miami Division had been exceedingly scarce for at least a year prior to trial. Waiting for space or wedging the five-week trial into the Miami calendar would have needlessly delayed the trial and also could have disrupted the Miami docket. Appellants claim that a courtroom opened up at the last minute in Miami; but an eleventh-hour transfer would have involved further delay, and a sizeable jury panel had already been summoned in Fort Lauderdale. Moreover, three of the five defendants resided out of state, as did most of the witnesses. They were not greatly inconvenienced by traveling to Fort Lauderdale instead of Miami. The district judge did not abuse his Rule 18 discretion in designating the place for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">B. <em>Composition of the Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">Appellants claim that the system for choosing the grand jury venire in the Fort Lauderdale Division of the Southern District of Florida violated their right to a grand jury representing a fair cross section of the community, created by the sixth amendment and the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 (1982).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>They contend that the Division\u2019s practice of filling the master jury wheel exclusively from voter registration lists rather than supplementing the wheel with names from other sources produced an unconstitutional underrepresentation of blacks. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">To establish a prima facie violation of the sixth amendment\u2019s fair cross-section requirement, a defendant must show (1) that the excluded group is a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to the systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. <em>Duren v. Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 99 S.Ct. 664, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979). If a defendant fails to establish any of these elements he has failed to establish a prima facie violation of the sixth amendment. We limit our review to the second element of <em>Duren, </em>whether the representation was fair and reasonable, because it is dispositive here. To determine whether the representation was fair and reasonable, we are only concerned with the \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d produced by the selection process.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Maskeny, </em>609 F.2d 183, 190 (5th Cir.1980) (rejecting comparative disparity and standard deviation analysis); <em>United States v. Butler, </em>611 F.2d 1066, 1069-70 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>615 F.2d 685, 686 (1980) (other statistical methods not necessary when small absolute disparity shown and minority more than ten percent of population). The relevant comparison for sixth amendment fair cross-section purposes is the comparison between the percentage of the \u201cdistinctive group\u201d on the qualified wheel and the percentage of the \u201cdistinctive group\u201d among the population eligible for jury service. <em>See United States v. Esle, </em>743 F.2d 1465, 1478 (11th Cir.1984) (Tjoflat, J., concurring). The district court found a 7.6 percent absolute disparity between the proportion of blacks among all the persons eligible for jury service in the Fort Lauderdale Division (11.3 percent) and the percentage of blacks on the master wheel (3.7 percent). <em>United States v. Facchiano, </em>500 F.Supp. 896, 898 (S.D.Fla.1980). Although the district court used the master wheel rather than the qualified wheel for comparative purposes, the disparity derived from this comparison was at least as great as that which would have been derived from the proper comparison. Because the disparity found by the district court was well within the absolute disparity limits set by this circuit, appellants failed to establish the second element of a prima facie sixth amendment fair cross-section violation, <em>e.g., Butler, </em>611 F.2d at 1069-70; <em>Maskeny, </em>609 F.2d at 190-91, and the trial judge committed no error in rejecting their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">C. <em>Severance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">Facchiano, Francis Santo, and Paul Santo contend that the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to grant their motions for severance, made both before and during the trial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 14 requires a trial court to balance the rights of the defendants and the government to a trial that is free from the prejudice that may result from joint trials against the public\u2019s interest in efficient and economic administration of justice. <em>United States v. Hewes, </em>729 F.2d 1302, 1318 (11th Cir.1984). It permits the court, in its discretion, to sever either defendants or counts in an effort to eliminate the prejudice caused by joinder. An appellate court will only reverse a trial court\u2019s denial of severance under Rule 14 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>(citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>To show that the trial court abused its discretion, appellants must demonstrate that they suffered \u201ccompelling prejudice\u201d as a result of the judge\u2019s refusal to grant their motion to sever. <em>United States v. Capo, </em>693 F.2d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1092, 103 S.Ct. 1793, 76 L.Ed.2d 359 (1983). Appellate courts are reluctant to second-guess trial court refusals to grant a severance. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1017 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (citing cases), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354 (1982); <em>see also United States v. DeSimone, </em>660 F.2d 532, 539 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (appellant must demonstrate compelling prejudice which could not be alleviated by the trial court and that he was unable to obtain a fair trial), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1027, 102 S.Ct. 1732, 72 L.Ed.2d 149 (1982). Finally, it should be noted that coconspirators should normally be tried jointly, <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>657 F.2d 755, 765 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 951, 102 S.Ct. 1456, 71 L.Ed.2d 667 (1982), and the fact that a defendant may have participated in only a single aspect of the conspiracy does not, by itself, warrant severance. <em>United States v. Marszalkowski, </em>669 F.2d 655, 659-60 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 906, 103 S.Ct. 208, 74 L.Ed.2d 167 (1982). With these principles firmly in mind, we consider Facchiano\u2019s and the Santos\u2019 motions for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">1. Facchiano\u2019s Severance Motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Facchiano contends that the district court\u2019s denial of his repeated motions for severance of parties violated his rights under Rule 14 and the due process clause of the fifth amendment and his right under the sixth amendment to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Facchiano claimed in his initial motion that, if he were tried separately, both Francis and Paul Santo would testify on his behalf. The trial court convened an evidentiary hearing on the severance issue, at which it received testimony from Paul San-to. The court also considered affidavits from both Santos and Paul Santo\u2019s grand jury testimony. The gist of the testimony was that neither Santos had made extortionate loans or. attempted to collect them, and that neither was part of a group that did so. Additionally, the Santos testified that neither knew of any loan sharking group and that to their knowledge Facchiano was not associated with any. such group. Finally, both Santos stated that they had never asked Facchiano to travel to New York City for a meeting at the Essex House; Paul Santo stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I know [Facchiano].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The district court, in a written order, found that there was \u201csome likelihood\u201d the Santos would testify for Facchiano if he were tried separately but that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay5\">the bulk of the Santos\u2019 proffer [was] exculpatory to them but neutral as to Facchiano. With regard to Facchiano, the tenor of the testimony is that <em>to their knowledge </em>Facchiano did not do or was not involved in certain things. This tends to be equivocal with regard to the wide range of activities charged in the indictment and in no way negates Act[s] of Racketeering [alleged against Facchiano].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">(emphasis in original). Accordingly, the court refused to sever Facchiano from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Facchiano contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his renewed motions to sever, made before the <em>James </em>hearing, after the <em>James </em>hearing, and at trial after the defense rested and after the charge conference.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>(These latter two motions to sever were actually motions for a mistrial.) In support of his contention Facchiano cites <em>Byrd v. Wainwright, </em>428 F.2d 1017 (5th Cir.1970), which lists certain factors<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> a court should apply in considering a severance motion based on a co-defendant\u2019s potential exculpatory testimony. He also cites <em>United States v. DeSimone, </em>660 F.2d 532 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), a multiple-defendant drug conspiracy ease, which applied the factors set forth in <em>Byrd. </em>In <em>DeSimone, </em>six defendants sought severance so that they could introduce the purportedly exculpatory testimony of a co-defendant, Butler, who, they said, would testify in their behalf only if he were tried separately. Butler gave an affidavit in which he stated that he would testify that he had not conspired with his co-defendants or they with him and that neither he nor they had possessed marijuana as charged in the indictment. The trial court refused to sever the ease, and we affirmed, noting that Butler\u2019s affidavit contained no clear indication of \u201cspecific and exonerative facts\u201d to which he would have testified. <em>Id. </em>at 540. Rather, his affidavit was a bare conclusory assertion that was more self-exonerating than exculpatory of the moving defendants. We also noted that Butler\u2019s proffer had not contravened his own penal interests, i.e., it was completely self-serving and thus lacked strong credibility. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the savings in time and resources produced by holding a joint trial in such a complex conspiracy case outweighed the possible benefit movants might have derived from Butler\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">In the case at hand, we find that the testimony proffered by the Santos was similar to that proffered by Butler. It consisted almost exclusively of bare exculpatory denials, devoid of any specific exonerative facts. As in <em>DeSimone, </em>the testimony was of dubious credibility because it was in no way contrary to the Santos\u2019 own interests. Moreover, judicial economy<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> weighed heavily against severance in this complex case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We thus conclude that Facchiano failed to carry his \u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing \u201ccompelling prejudice\u201d and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sever his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">2. Francis and Paul Santo\u2019s Severance Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Francis and Paul Santo contend that the district court committed reversible error when it refused to grant their respective motions for a separate trial. Both Santos moved for severance following the <em>James </em>hearing. In addition, Francis Santo renewed his motion in the form of a motion for mistrial after the jury was sworn. Both Santos claimed that they needed Pepe\u2019s testimony and that Pepe would not testify if he and the Santos were tried together. They made no proffer of what Pepe would say if he took the stand; they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>simply stated that Pepe\u2019s grand jury testimony exculpated them.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">This presentation fell far short of the \u201cspecific and exonerative facts\u201d requirement of <em>DeSimone. </em>The Santos made no concrete showing that Pepe would testify for them if they were tried separately, nor did they proffer what his testimony would be.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the severance.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aur\">D. <em>Francis Santo\u2019s Absence from the </em>James <em>Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Francis Santo was seventy-two years old at the time of the indictment. A short while before the court was to convene the <em>James </em>hearing, which it had scheduled at the appellants' request, Francis Santo was admitted to the coronary care unit of a Fort Lauderdale hospital with symptoms of a heart attack. His physicians diagnosed his condition as angina pectoris and cardiomyopathy.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Santo\u2019s counsel thereafter advised the court that Santo\u2019s condition made it impossible for him to attend the <em>James </em>hearing and that Santo would not waive his right to be present. The court continued the <em>James </em>hearing twice<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and finally took testimony from Santo\u2019s treating physicians in an effort to determine when Santo might be well enough to appear in court. The physicians were unable to give the court a definite date, so the court, after concluding that Santo\u2019s absence would be involuntary, began the hearing on November 4, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The court took precautions at the <em>James </em>hearing to minimize any prejudice to Santo. Santo\u2019s attorney was present throughout the entire hearing, participating fully to protect his client\u2019s interests. In addition, the court provided counsel with a daily transcript of the proceedings. Armed with this, counsel conferred nightly with Santo at the hospital. Finally, when Santo was released from the hospital, the court gave him the opportunity to recall for further cross-examination any witness the government had presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">The only witness put on the stand out of Santo\u2019s presence was Herbert Zucker, the government\u2019s first witness. Zucker was still on the witness stand, testifying on cross-examination, when Santo returned to court on Monday, November 10, 1980, following his release from the hospital. The court asked Santo\u2019s counsel whether, in light of Santo\u2019s presence, he had any additional questions to put to Zucker. Counsel replied, \u201cNo, I appreciate the opportunity, Your Honor, but I don\u2019t believe there would be [additional cross-examination] of this witness after conferring with Mr. San-to.\u201d Santo attended the remainder of the <em>James </em>hearing, which lasted until November 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">Francis Santo now argues that the examination of Zucker during his absence violated his right to be present at all stages of his trial and to confront the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>nesses against .him, accorded by Fed.R.Crim.P. 43 and the sixth amendment. His argument is meritless. A <em>James </em>hearing is simply a device for avoiding the risk of inadvertent introduction of hearsay at trial. It is not dispositive on the issue of hearsay, however, because the admissibility of testimony is, ultimately, a trial ruling. Moreover, a <em>James </em>hearing is optional; no substantive evidence is taken for trial, and guilt is irrelevant.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Roe, </em>670 F.2d 956, 962-64 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 856, 103 S.Ct. 126, 74 L.Ed.2d 109 (1982), this circuit held that the trial court\u2019s failure to hold a <em>James </em>hearing was not error and that the court was not required to find that a <em>James </em>hearing would be impractical before deciding to forego it. <em>Id. </em>at 963. In <em>United States v. Marquardt, </em>695 F.2d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1093, 103 S.Ct. 1793, 76 L.Ed.2d 360 (1983), we explained that a <em>James </em>hearing is a prophylactic measure to ensure that the jury does not hear inadmissible evidence but that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1bq\">[njothing in the <em>James </em>case suggests that the trial court\u2019s failure to hold a <em>James </em>hearing constitutes reversible error; the reversible error must occur at trial. Furthermore, the <em>James </em>decision does not relieve trial counsel of the obligation to make timely objection to hearsay statements of coconspirators, or to ask the court for appropriate relief when the jury has heard inadmissible hearsay, such as striking testimony, a cautionary instruction, or a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We think it clear that Francis San-to had no right under Rule 43 to be present throughout the taking of testimony at the <em>James </em>hearing. Rule 43 requires that, unless a felony defendant absents himself voluntarily or. through misconduct, he shall be present at the arraignment, plea, and \u201cevery stage of the trial,\u201d including impanelment of the jury, the return of the verdict, and sentencing. The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules, in drafting Rule 43, did not address a <em>James </em>hearing, because it is merely an optional, judicially created device, fashioned long after Rule 43\u2019s adoption, for the convenience of the parties and the trial court. The first advisory committee note shows clearly that proceedings such as <em>James </em>hearings do not fall into the Rule 43 catch-all, \u201cevery stage of the trial.\u201d That note states: \u201cThis principle does not apply to hearings on motions made prior to or after trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Lynch, </em>132 F.2d 111 (3d Cir.1942)). Rule 43 did not provide Francis Santo a right to be present at the <em>James </em>hearing; nor did it require his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Likewise, Santo had no sixth amendment right to be present. The sixth amendment\u2019s confrontation clause guarantees that \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with witnesses against him____\u201d To prevail on this issue, Santo must show that the <em>James </em>hearing was a stage which implicated the confrontation clause and that the court denied him a chance to confront witnesses.- Santo has not cited any other authority for his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">The district court, on the other hand, cited <em>United States v. Gradsky, </em>434 F.2d 880 (5th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>894, 93 S.Ct. 203, 34 L.Ed.2d 151 (1972), 401 U.S. 925, 91 S.Ct. 884, 27 L.Ed.2d 828 (1971), and <em>Yates v. United States, </em>418 F.2d 1228 (6th Cir.1969), in ordering the <em>James </em>hearing to proceed in Santo\u2019s absence. In both of those cases, the court of appeals found no error in the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the defendant from a pretrial suppression hearing at which evidence was taken. The <em>Gradsky </em>court noted in support of its holding that the defendant was represented by counsel at the hearing and that no court of appeals had extended the sixth amendment right of confrontation to an evidentiary suppression hearing. 434 F.2d at 882. Moreover, the defendant had not shown that he suffered any prejudice as a result of his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">We think the district court correctly relied on <em>Gradsky: </em>\u201c[t]he right to be present at every stage of trial does not confer upon the defendant the right to be present at every ... [hearing or] conference with the trial judge at which a matter relative to the case is discussed.\u201d <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>732 F.2d 846 at 846, 848 (11th Cir.1984). <em>See United States v. Howell, </em>514 F.2d 710, 714 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 914, 96 S.Ct. 220, 46 L.Ed.2d 143 (1975). The <em>James </em>hearing in this instance, like the hearings in <em>Gradsky </em>and <em>Yates, </em>was simply a pretrial evidentiary proceeding. In fact, it was much less important than the hearings in <em>Gradsky </em>and <em>Yates </em>because it did not bind the court to make any particular evidentiary ruling at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Finally, Santo has alleged not a whit of prejudice caused by his absence. As we have indicated, Santo\u2019s counsel was present throughout the hearing and conferred with Santo nightly. In addition, Santo declined the opportunity, on returning to court, to reopen his cross-examination of Zucker. In sum, given the characteristics of a <em>James </em>hearing and the facts of this case, we conclude that Francis Santo has not demonstrated any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">E. <em>Discovery and Disclosure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">1. Witness Interviews</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">The appellants claim they are entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor and the district court hindered or precluded them from interviewing witnesses. At a pretrial status conference, appellants moved the court to require the government to produce its witnesses, who were in the Witness Protection Program or under government control, at a safe, mutually agreeable place so that the defense could interview them before trial. These witnesses included Rafsky, Bowdach, and Zucker.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The court denied appellants\u2019 motions. The court also denied their requests to require the government to produce the witnesses as they were being assembled in the courthouse before the <em>James </em>hearing began. Appellants claim they could have easily interviewed the witnesses at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">It is well established that a defendant is normally entitled, without governmental interference, to access to prospective witnesses. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>555 F.2d 407, 425 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 1448, 55 L.Ed.2d 494 (1978); <em>United States v. Henao, </em>652 F.2d 591 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981). Moreover, the suppression of witnesses by the government violates the due process clause. <em>E.g., Freeman v. Georgia, </em>599 F.2d 65 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1013, 100 S.Ct. 661, 62 L.Ed.2d 641 (1980) (fourteenth amendment case) (police concealed witness). In most cases in which the court has found a constitutional violation, prosecutors have hidden witnesses or deliberately disobeyed court orders to produce for examination witnesses under governmental control. <em>See, e.g., Lockett v. Blackburn, </em>571 F.2d 309 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 873, 99 S.Ct. 207, 58 L.Ed.2d 186 (1978); <em>United States v. Opager, </em>589 F.2d 799 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">This circuit has made it clear that appellants seeking reversal on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>prosecutorially-impaired access to witnesses must allege specific demonstrable prejudice in order to set forth a constitutional claim. <em>Henao, </em>652 F.2d at 593; <em>United States v. Clemones, </em>577 F.2d 1247, 1252 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 927, 100 S.Ct. 1313, 63 L.Ed.2d 759 (1980). Hypothetical or generalized prejudice is insufficient. In <em>Clemones, </em>for example, the assistant U.S. Attorney instructed the thirty to thirty-five grand jury witnesses that the proceedings were secret and they could not talk to defense counsel. Defense counsel went to the magistrate and procured an order which stated that all the witnesses could speak freely with the defense. The magistrate directed the U.S. Attorney to serve this order on all the witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 1251. By the time of trial, however, the U.S. Attorney had not yet served the order on the witnesses, and a large number went uninterviewed. The district court denied a defense request for a continuance, and we affirmed the ensuing convictions. We found no constitutional violation because the defendants had failed to demonstrate <em>particularized </em>prejudice: \u201cThe government erred, but other than general allegations of prejudice the defendants have not shown that they were really harmed____ [Although the defendants] were entitled to be indignant ... they have not demonstrated real, substantive impairment of their right to fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">This case does not involve the deliberate violation of a court order or the \u201chiding out\u201d of a witness. It is clear that the government had no duty, absent a court order, to present its witnesses for interviews; the government\u2019s duty was, simply, not to deny access. <em>See Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 549, 97 S.Ct. 837, 840, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977). Moreover, in their briefs, appellants have failed' to show how they have suffered any real, particularized prejudice. The trial judge denied appellants\u2019 motions for pretrial interviews with protected witnesses because Zucker and Rafsky would be available to counsel at the <em>James </em>hearing and at trial and because Bowdach would be available at trial, either before or after the government placed him on the stand. The record shows that the trial judge made certain that both Facchiano and Pepe\u2019s counsel would have time to conduct private interviews with Rafsky before they cross-examined him. We find no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s treatment of appellants\u2019 requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">The government\u2019s witnesses were in obvious danger. In cases such as this, where protected witnesses are involved, the right of access may be delayed. <em>See United States v. Walton, </em>602 F.2d 1176, 1179-80 (4th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Pelton, </em>578 F.2d 701, 708 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 964, 99 S.Ct. 451, 58 L.Ed.2d 422 (1978). As noted, the protected witnesses, here, were available during and after the <em>James </em>hearing and before and during trial.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In addition, both Rafsky and a non-protected witness, Vincent Carrano, consented to interviews before testifying on cross-examination. Other witnesses were available, but refused to be interviewed.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the <em>James </em>hearing afforded counsel the opportunity to conduct a searching inquiry of the government\u2019s case in what was in essence a full blown discovery hearing. Under these circumstances, counsel\u2019s need to conduct pretrial interviews diminished considerably.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">Facchiano also claims that the prosecutor denied him access to Edward Vanasco and that the court should have sanctioned his conduct by striking Vanasco\u2019s trial testimony.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Facchiano\u2019s lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>asked Vanasco, who testified at the <em>James </em>hearing, for a pretrial interview. Vanasco then sought the prosecutor\u2019s advice. The prosecutor told him that he could do as he wished, but that the only reason the defense wanted the interview was to garner impeachment material against him. Facchiano\u2019s lawyer learned of the prosecutor\u2019s advice and brought the matter to the trial judge. The judge personally addressed Vanasco and informed him that he should view the prosecutor\u2019s admonition as the statement of a partisan and that an interview with Facchiano\u2019s lawyer would be fair, entirely proper, and completely up to him. Vanasco declined to be interviewed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> At trial, the court, over Facchiano\u2019s objection, permitted Vanasco to testify. We find no error, especially in view of Facchiano\u2019s failure to demonstrate any prejudice.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">2. Jencks Act Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">The Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1982),<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> requires a court, on motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>of the defendant, to order the government to produce any statement a government witness has made that is in its possession and relates to the subject matter of the witness\u2019 testimony. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3500(b). The purpose of the Jencks Act is twofold: to allow the defendant materials for impeachment and to protect government files from unwarranted disclosure. <em>See United States v. Smaldone, </em>544 F.2d 456, 460 (10th Cir.1976), <em>cert. </em>denied, 430 U.S. 967, 97 S.Ct. 1648, 52 L.Ed.2d 358 (1977).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Under the Act, the burden is on the defendant to show that the requested materials qualify as \u201cstatements\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e) and that they relate to the subject matter of the witness\u2019 testimony. A trial court\u2019s determination whether given materials constitute a Jencks Act statement is subject to reversal only if it is clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Medel, </em>592 F.2d 1305, 1316 (5th Cir.1979). Even if the trial court refuses to order the production of materials that are later determined to be Jencks Act statements, its refusal will not be considered reversible error if the materials merely duplicate matter already in the defendant\u2019s possession.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">This case presents two Jencks Act claims of substance. The first concerns statements Zueker and Rafsky made about their participation in a fraud against the Small Business Administration (SBA). Both before the trial began and after Zucker and Rafsky testified on direct examination, the appellants asked the court to require the government to produce these statements. Appellants argued that they related to the witnesses\u2019 testimony as to the solvency of Z &amp; H. Appellants\u2019 theory was that Zueker and Rafsky bilked enough money out of the SBA, some $250,000, to alleviate Z &amp; H\u2019s cash flow problems; thus, their testimony that they had to deal with loan sharks to raise cash was of doubtful credibility. The district court concluded that the requested statements would be of \u201cvery limited or marginal value\u201d and that appellants had failed to make \u201can adequate showing that there [was] apt to be any material in [the SBA\u2019s investigation files] which would properly fall under [the] Jencks [Act]____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The district court did not err.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The appellants knew that Zueker and Rafsky had pled guilty to the SBA fraud, and they cross-examined the two rigorously at trial. It is well settled that the Jencks Act does not require the production of prior statements that are incidental or collateral to the subject matter of the witness\u2019 testimony. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mackey, </em>571 F.2d 376, 389 (7th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Pacelli, </em>491 F.2d 1108, 1118 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 826, 95 S.Ct. 43, 42 L.Ed.2d 49 (1974). Moreover, the appellants, through discovery, had received Z &amp; H\u2019s bank statements and cancelled checks; consequently, they could have established Z &amp; H\u2019s cash flow from this source rather than the SBA files.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Facchiano argues, in addition, that the district court erred in not ordering the release of \u201call of Bowdach\u2019s statements concerning the Mafia, organized crime, and loansharking,\u201d including \u201cany statements of any nature, description, that are in the hands of the FBI at any office [and those in] any U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.\u201d The purpose of Facchiano\u2019s request apparently was to obtain impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">Bowdach was at one time an active participant in an organized crime family. He later turned government witness and testified in a number of criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>trials and before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Bowdach\u2019s testimony here, however, dealt only with Facchiano\u2019s membership in organized crime and his prior debt collection practices. <em>See infra </em>pp. 669-670. The prosecutor produced Bowdach\u2019s grand jury testimony and the single interview report that related to his knowledge of Facchiano\u2019s debt collection practices. Additionally, Facchiano had access to Bowdach\u2019s testimony before the Senate subcommittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Facchiano\u2019s request for <em>all </em>of Bowdach\u2019s prior statements was patently overbroad. Granting Facchiano\u2019s request would have forced the government to find and produce all statements<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Bowdach had ever made about organized crime and loan sharking. The plain words of the Jencks Act cannot be stretched this far.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>See Medel, </em>592 F.2d at 1316-17; <em>Mackey, </em>571 F.2d at 389; <em>Pacelli, </em>491 F.2d at 1119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"Abv\">Appellants each claim that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the jury verdicts of guilty and that the district court erred in denying their respective motions for acquittal. In reviewing their claims, we must ask whether, viewing the evidence and its natural inferences in a light most favorable to the government, a rational trier of fact could have found all elements of the crimes proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (en banc) (\u201cnot necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence\u201d), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>462 U.S. 356, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983). <em>United States v. Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 648 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1008, 102 S.Ct. 2300, 73 L.Ed.2d 1303 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">1. Sufficiency of the Evidence Against Facchiano</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">Facchiano claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he engaged in a RICO conspiracy with his coindictees, that he committed a substantive RICO violation, and that he used extortionate means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>collect the first Facchiano/Terriacca loan.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Facchiano initially contends that the evidence, at best, showed two separate loan sharking conspiracies, not just one as alleged in the indictment. The first conspiracy, he submits, was headed by Francis Santo and included Pepe, Paul Santo, and Miglionico. The second conspiracy involved Terriacca and Facchiano. (Faechiano claims his inclusion in the second conspiracy was an example of guilt by association.) He claims that these two groups happened to lend to the same debtors but that the loans were made at different times, for different amounts, and on different terms. This proof, according to Facchiano, produced a fatal variance in violation of the rule that \u201ca material variance between the indictment and the government\u2019s evidence is created by the government\u2019s proof of multiple conspiracies under an indictment alleging a single conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Sutherland, </em>656 F.2d 1181, 1189 (5th Cir.1981) (citing <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 1451, 71 L.Ed.2d 663 (1982). A conviction obtained under such circumstances must be set aside unless the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were not affected. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">To prove a single RICO conspiracy the government must show that the conspirators agreed to participate, directly or indirectly, in the affairs of .an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d). <em>See United States v. Sutherland, </em>656 F.2d 1181, 1189-93 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 1451, 71 L.Ed.2d 663 (1982); <em>United States v. Elliott, </em>571 F.2d 880, 902-03 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 953, 99 S.Ct. 349, 58 L.Ed.2d 344 (1978). <em>See also </em>P. Marcus, Prosecution and Defense of Criminal Conspiracy Cases \u00a7 4.02(2)(d) (1983 Supp.). A RICO conspiracy differs from an ordinary conspiracy in two respects: it need not embrace an overt act,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and it is broader and may encompass a greater variety of conduct.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">In proving a RICO conspiracy, the government does not have to establish that each conspirator explicitly agreed with every other conspirator to commit the substantive RICO crime described in the indictment, or knew his fellow conspirators, or was aware of all the details of the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Cagnina, </em>697 F.2d 915, 922 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 175, 78 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983). That each conspirator may have contemplated participating in different and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>unrelated crimes is irrelevant. <em>United States v. Lee Stoller Enterprises, Inc., </em>652 F.2d 1313, 1319 (7th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1082, 102 S.Ct. 636, 70 L.Ed.2d 615 (1981). Finally, there is no requirement that each defendant must have agreed to commit two predicate acts of racketeering activity. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>721 F.2d 1514, 1528-31 (11th Cir.1984). The government need only prove that each defendant conspired to commit the substantive RICO offense and was aware that others had done likewise. <em>Sutherland, </em>656 F.2d at 1193, 1194. <em>See Elliott, </em>571 F.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Applying these standards, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that one conspiracy existed and that Facchiano participated in it. The jurors heard testimony that the two Facchiano/Terriacca loans Pepe obtained from Terriacca were from Terriacca <em>and </em>Facchiano. Pepe described Facchiano as the head of the largest \u201cMafia shylocking operation\u201d in South Florida. Pepe solicited all of the loans for the partners and helped all of the creditors collect on them. The jurors also knew that Facchiano had traveled to New York to \u201chelp straighten out the Rafsky loans.\u201d Facchiano and Paul Santo worked in tandem at the Essex House meeting. At the end of the meeting, Facchiano concluded that \u201che could not control the situation and would have to leave it in Paul [Santo\u2019s] and Eddie [Vanasco\u2019s] hands____\u201d The jurors heard Yanasco testify that Facchiano thought the meeting went well; the partners\u2019 race horses were winning, and it looked like everyone would get paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">From this evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that one common agreement with a unified objective existed in this case.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The evidence clearly showed that two groups of loan sharks, one headed by Francis Santo, the other by Facchiano, conspired together to victimize Z &amp; H and its partners. Both loan sharking groups used the same loan solicitor and repayment conduit, Pepe. They engaged in joint collection efforts, such as the Essex House meeting, and together settled on a plan to obtain satisfaction through the winnings of the race horses. Certainly, this was an \u201cagreement on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>an overall objective,\u201d <em>Sutherland, </em>656 F.2d at 1193-94, and satisfied our standard for proof of one conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\"> Faechiano next contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove him guilty of the count two substantive RICO offense. To convict Faechiano of a substantive RICO violation in this case, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he associated with a loan sharking enterprise<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> having effect on interstate commerce and that he participated in the conduct of its affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity <em>or </em>through collection of unlawful debt. <em>See Phillips, </em>664 F.2d at 1011 (citing eases).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two predicate acts of racketeering activity,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The government, however, was required to prove only one collection of unlawful debt.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The indictment alleged that Faechiano engaged in several racketeering acts: extending the first Facchiano/Terriacca loan in 1973, collecting that loan through extortion, traveling in interstate commerce to New York City for the Essex House meeting for unlawful purposes, and using extortionate means to attempt to collect money at the Essex House. <em>See supra </em>note 12. The indictment also alleged that Faechiano engaged in collection of unlawful debt on several occasions: extortionately collecting the first loan, traveling to the Essex House to collect several loans, and using extortionate means of collection at the Essex House meeting. <em>See supra </em>note 13. .</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">We conclude, viewing the evidence and its inferences in a light most favorable to the government, that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The jury heard testimony from Rafsky, Reifler, and Zucker that clearly inculpated Facchiano as a participant in the acts of the enterprise. The evidence was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Faechiano committed at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity attributed to him in the indictment<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> or collected an unlawful debt. In fact, the evidence was sufficient to support <em>each </em>alleged act of racketeering and collection of unlawful debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">Faechiano contends, however, that, irrespective of the strength of the evidence; two of the predicate acts listed in count two of the indictment were identical, and the jury could have relied on them, thus grounding his conviction on only one complete \u201cact.\u201d He submits that predicate act (k) and count five of the indictment, which also was listed as predicate act (i), arose out of the same transaction and are identical. Predicate act (k) alleged that Facchiano used extortionate means to collect an extension of credit at the Essex House meeting in New York City, as that crime is defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Count five of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the indictment alleged that Facchiano violated the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> by-traveling in interstate commerce with the intent to carry out the unlawful act of extortionate collection and then by actually promoting, managing, or carrying out the act. As the Senate Report on the Travel Act bill stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">[T]o come within the provisions of the bill some activity in furtherance of a racketeering enterprise, subsequent to the performance of the travel, must take place ... <em>accordingly the gravamen of the offense will be travel and a further overt act to aid the enterprise.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">S.Rep. No. 644, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1961) (emphasis added), <em>cited in United States v. Jones, </em>642 F.2d 909, 912 n. 4 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Predicate act (k) and count five are not identical; Facchiano\u2019s claim thus fails as a matter of law. Section 894 (act k) and section 1952 (count five) each penalize separate conduct and require separate elements; the latter penalizes interstate travel for criminal purposes while the former penalizes extortionate means of collection. The RICO definition section, listing predicate acts of racketeering activity, states that violations of sections 894 and 1952 will each constitute separate acts of racketeering.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">We have previously encountered the type of claim Facchiano presents, most recently in <em>Phillips, </em>664 F.2d at 1039. <em>Phillips </em>\u2022relied heavily on <em>United States v. Starnes, </em>644 F.2d 673, 677-78 (7th Cir.1981), which is on all fours with the instant case.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number><em>Starnes </em>defendant committed an arson after traveling in interstate commerce with the intent to do so. The court of appeals held that even though the interstate travel violation and the arson may have been for the same purpose and incidental to each other, each act was a separate act of racketeering activity under RICO. <em>See also United States v. Martino, </em>648 F.2d 367, 402-03 (5th Cir.1981) (arson and mail fraud arising from same burning), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 2020, 72 L.Ed.2d 474, 456 U.S. 943, 102 S.Ct. 2007, 72 L.Ed.2d 465, 456 U.S. 943, 102 S.Ct. 2006, 72 L.Ed.2d 465 (1982); <em>United States v. Colacurio, </em>659 F.2d 684, 688 n. 4 (5th Cir.1981) (multiple briberies), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1002, 102 S.Ct. 1635, 71 L.Ed.2d 869 (1982). Contrary to Facchiano\u2019s contention, the government did not list a single criminal act twice to do double duty and form a pattern of racketeering activity. Act (k) and count five alleged \u201cpredicate crimes related to the affairs of the enterprise, thus meeting the requirement for proving a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Martino, </em>648 F.2d at 403; <em>accord Phillips, </em>664 F.2d at 1011 (RICO requires \u201ctwo separate crimes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Facchiano also contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he was involved in the first Facchiano/Terriacca loan, either in extortionately extending the money, as alleged in predicate act (a), or in using extortionate means to collect it, as alleged in predicate act (b). The first loan was for $10,000 at two percent interest per week. It resulted from a meeting between Pepe, Terriacea, and Zucker. Terriacea threatened the partners at that meeting, stating that they would repay the money he or \u201chis people\u201d lent or face injury. The partners were threatened a number of times after they borrowed the money. At one point Pepe urged them to pay off the loan or face the wrath of \u201cTerry\u2019s organization\u201d which Pepe said was controlled by \u201cChink.\u201d The loan was clearly extortionate when extended, and extortionate means were successfully used to collect it. Additionally, the jury heard evidence indicating that the acts of extending and collecting the first Facchiano/Terriacca loan were in furtherance of a common enterprise that was headed by Facchiano and invoked Facchiano\u2019s name to induce payment. We are unable to conclude that a reasonable trier of fact, viewing this evidence and its inferences in a light most favorable to the government, could not have found that Facchiano, acting through his agents Terriacea and Pepe, committed this extortionate extension and collection as alleged in predicate acts (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Finally, Facchiano claims that count two must fall because one of the acts listed therein as a collection of unlawful debt was time-barred. The collection of unlawful debt prong of RICO has no statute of limitations written into it and must therefore borrow the general five-year limitation found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282 (1982)<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>which directs that \u201cno person shall be prosecuted, tried or punished for any offense ... unless the indictment is found ... within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">One of the acts alleged to show Facchiano\u2019s collection of unlawful debt was act (b), the collection of the first Facchiano/Terriaeca loan in late 1973. Facchiano claims that his conviction on count two must fall because this act was over five years old at the time of the indictment and was time-barred under section 3282. According to Facchiano, the jury\u2019s general verdict on count two must be set aside because the jury may have based its verdict on this time-barred conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">At the close of all the evidence Facchiano moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that act (b) was time-barred; he also moved that act (b) be struck from the indictment and excluded from the court\u2019s charge to the jury. The court denied these motions, but instructed the jury that it could not consider any allegations of unlawful debt collection unless it found that the acts of collection occurred after June 21, 1974, the limitations period date. This date was also the proper limitations date for all of the other counts. Thus, if the jury followed the court\u2019s instruction it would not have considered act (b) at all, because it occurred in 1973. The jury had copies of the court\u2019s jury charge with it during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Facchiano claims that the jury was unable to follow the charge and that the court\u2019s failure to strike collection of unlawful debt act (b) constituted reversible error because the jury could have based his count two guilt on that invalid alternative. The district court\u2019s failure to strike act (b) was error, but we think any prejudice was prevented by the court\u2019s clear oral and written instructions concerning the proper date. We think the jury was capable of following the instruction that the government had to prove that the collection .of unlawful debt occurred subsequent to June 21, 1974. This instruction was stated twice in plain English and also set forth in the written instructions that the jury had during its deliberations. Facchiano\u2019s contention to the contrary is pure conjecture, based on the unfounded notion that the jury was incapable of following the simplest of instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Moreover, Facchiano\u2019s conviction on count five, which count two incorporated by reference as an act of collection, belies Facchiano\u2019s claim that the jury could have based count two liability on act (b) alone. By establishing the count five offense, the Travel Act violation, the government proved the collection of unlawful debt alleged in count two. This is all that was required for count two liability given that the other RICO elements in count two were established. In sum, Facchiano cannot claim that his count two conviction should be set aside because it could have been based on an invalid alternative ground.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>2. Sufficiency of the Evidence Against Miglionico</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The jury acquitted Miglionico of count one, the RICO conspiracy, but found him guilty of count two, the substantive RICO violation, and count seven, use of extortionate means to collect credit from Sanford Rafsky. The indictment alleged that Miglionico engaged in acts of racketeering when he used extortionate means (threats) to collect credit from Rafsky throughout 1974 and in October 1975, when he assaulted Rafsky at the racetrack. The indictment listed the same acts in support of the collection of unlawful debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Miglionico\u2019s assertion that the evidence was insufficient to prove that these acts took place, and therefore the verdicts on counts two and seven must be set aside, is without merit. The evidence showed that Miglionico was a knowing participant in the enterprise, placed as an employee at Z &amp; H by Francis Santo in 1974 to \u201cwatch\u201d San-to\u2019s investment. Miglionico himself stated as much to Rafsky, saying that he was \u201cout to protect Jigger\u2019s interests at all costs\u201d and \u201cif Jigger didn\u2019t get paid [he] would have to collect for Jigger.\u201d The record is replete with evidence concerning Miglionico\u2019s threats to the partners throughout 1974, especially those made to Sanford Rafsky. The record is also clear that Miglionico assaulted Rafsky at the racetrack in October 1975, because of the debt Rafsky owed to Francis Santo. There was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find that Miglionico was an active participant in the enterprise, committed two predicate acts of racketeering, or collected unlawful debt,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and used extortionate means to collect credit as alleged in count seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">3. Sufficiency of the Evidence Against Francis Santo</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">The jury found Francis Santo guilty on all counts lodged against him: counts one, two, three, five, and six. He claims that the evidence was insufficient to support any of these verdicts. For ease of analysis we discuss count five first.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">Francis Santo was convicted under count five as an aider and abettor of Facchiano\u2019s Travel Act violation when Facchiano went to New York City to participate in the Essex House meeting.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The government\u2019s theory was that Francis San-to caused Facchiano to go to New York to coerce payment from Rafsky.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-16\">A culpable aider and abettor need not perform the substantive offense,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> need not fully know of its details,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and need not even.be present.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> To obtain a conviction for aiding and abetting, the government must show that the defendant associated himself with the crime, participated in it as something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed. <em>United States v. Bryant, </em>671 F.2d 450, 454 (11th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Schwartz, </em>666 F.2d 461, 463 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-17\">The government failed to sustain its burden of proof on count five. The evidence showed that when Paul Santo arranged the Essex House meeting with Rafsky\u2019s associates, Kops and Reifler, he told them that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>\u201csomeone [apparently not Francis Santo] was coming in from Florida to help straighten out the Rafsky loans\u201d and that this person \u201cwas involved with money with Rafsky in some way.\u201d When Reifler and Kops entered the Essex House, they met the person to whom Santo had referred, Facchiano. Kops had known Facchiano as \u201cChink.\u201d- Facchiano immediately began complaining about the money owed him from the second Facchiano/Terriacca loan. Paul Santo and Edward Vanasco arrived. Vanasco stated that \u201cJigger [Francis San-to] was unable to make it.\u201d The conversation soon became threatening, and Paul Santo repeated Francis Santo\u2019s previous demands for the racehorses. The meeting then broke up.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The government provided no evidence that Francis Santo aided Facchiano\u2019s Travel Act violation or that he caused Facchiano to engage in it. No testimony was offered that Francis Santo suggested that Facchiano travel to New York, ever spoke to him, or assisted him in any way. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government, we reverse Santo\u2019s count five conviction.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The government did introduce sufficient proof to support Francis Santo\u2019s conviction under count three for extortionate extensions of credit in connection with the third Santo loan.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Besides testimony of the partners about the loan, the government called a fabric supplier who testified that the day the loan was made the partners attempted to give him $16,000 in cash \u201cfrom the money we ha[ve] just gotten from Jigger.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Francis Santo claims that count one must fail because the evidence did not support that he conspired to participate in an interstate loan sharking enterprise. Santo claims that he operated by himself, lending money as an investment and not through any agreement with Facchiano, Miglionico, Pepe, or Paul Santo. The RICO statute does not limit the term \u201centerprise\u201d; it simply defines it to include \u201cany ... group of individuals associated in fact.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4) (1982). As we stated in <em>Elliott, </em>an enterprise is any association which \u201chowever loose and informal, furnishes a vehicle for the commission of two or more predicate crimes.\u201d 571 F.2d at 898. <em>Accord United States v. Diecidue, </em>603 F.2d 535, 545 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 912, 100 S.Ct. 1842, 64 L.Ed.2d 266, 445 U.S. 946, 100 S.Ct. 1345, 63 L.Ed.2d 781 (1980). An enterprise need not have any distinct, formal structure. <em>Cagnina, </em>697 F.2d at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">As we discussed <em>supra </em>in Part IV.A., the evidence clearly showed an association of individuals affiliated for the purpose of victimizing Z &amp; H and its partners through loan sharking. That Francis San-to was not closely associated with some members of the enterprise is irrelevant. <em>See Martino, </em>648 F.2d at 394. It is also irrelevant that Francis Santo may not have been a member of a traditional organized crime \u201cfamily.\u201d RICO\u2019s reach does not respect such boundaries. The evidence showed that Francis Santo provided three of the five loans to the partners and enforced them through threats and assaults in close consort with Pepe, Paul Santo, and Miglionico. Francis Santo was connected with Facchiano through Pepe, their joint solicitor and collection agent, and through the unified collection efforts such as the Essex House meeting and the plan to extract repayment from race horse winnings. The proof was abundant that Santo conspired to participate in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ing activity or the collection of unlawful debt.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> <em>See Carter, </em>721 F.2d at 1530-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Francis Santo also questions the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction on count two, the substantive RICO count. Count two alleged ten predicate acts of racketeering against Francis Santo and six collections of unlawful debt. The section of count two listing racketeering activity incorporated by reference counts three (third Santo loan), five (aiding and abetting Facchiano\u2019s Travel Act violation), six (use of extortionate means to collect credit on the day before the racetrack assault), and seven (aiding and abetting Miglionico on the day of the racetrack assault).<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The other acts of racketeering covered Francis Santo\u2019s conduct in extending extortionate credit and attempting to collect extortionate credit on the first Santo loan; extending extortionate credit and attempting to collect extortionate credit on the second Santo loan; sending Pepe to New York to coerce Rafsky; making threatening telephone calls to Rafsky in New York; and aiding and abetting Paul Santo\u2019s and Facchiano\u2019s attempts to collect extortionate loans at the Essex House. The six collections of unlawful debt incorporated the conduct alleged in counts five and seven. They also covered Francis San-to\u2019s conduct in attempting to collect his first and second loans, including making threatening phone calls to Rafsky in New York and aiding and abetting Facchiano\u2019s and Paul Santo\u2019s attempted collection at the Essex House.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">With the exception of the act of racketeering and collection of unlawful debt arising out of the count five Travel Act violation, the evidence was more than sufficient to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Francis Santo committed all the acts alleged. He was a central figure in the conspiracy; the jury heard abundant evidence concerning his extortionate extensions of credit<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> and his threats of violence if the unlawful debt went unpaid. He made these threats both in Florida and New York, in person and by telephone, and through Pepe, Miglionico, and Paul Santo. The jury also heard how some of these threats actually succeeded in coercing payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">As we held <em>supra, </em>however, the government failed to prove that Francis Santo engaged in the conduct described in count five, and since count two incorporated count five, as both a predicate act of racketeering and an act of collection of unlawful debt, the government also failed to prove these count two acts. Thus, Francis Santo\u2019s best argument in his attack on count two would be that the jury could have relied on the count five conduct as one of the two required racketeering acts or as the required collection of unlawful debt. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tarnopol, </em>561 F.2d 466, 475 (3d Cir.1977) (multiple object conspiracy conviction reversed where no proof to one of alleged objects).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">We are not convinced that this possibility requires the reversal of count two, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ever. The jury convicted Francis Santo of counts three and six. Counts three and six were incorporated by reference into count two as predicate acts of racketeering. Counts three and six operated like special verdicts; by finding guilt on those counts the jury also found that two predicate acts listed in count two had been shown. <em>Accord United States v. Peacock, </em>654 F.2d 339, 348 (5th Cir.1981) (separate arson counts incorporated by reference as predicate acts into substantive RICO count), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>686 F.2d 356 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982).<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Accordingly, the government proved at least two predicate acts of racketeering beyond a reasonable doubt. This is all the government had to prove to establish a RICO pattern of racketeering and substantive RICO liability. <em>Elliott, </em>571 F.2d at 899 n. 23 (defendant must commit two acts of racketeering and \u201cthe two or more predicate crimes must be related to the affairs of the enterprise but need not be related to each other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">4. Sufficiency of the Evidence Against Paul Santo</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The racketeering acts and unlawful debt collections alleged against Paul Santo dealt with his continual threats against Rafsky in New York, his successful collection there of $7,500 from Rafsky, and his participation in the Essex House meeting, where he also aided and abetted Facchiano\u2019s collection efforts. Santo claims that the record fails to show that he loaned the partners any money and thus that he committed any RICO violations.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> He admits that he dealt with Rafsky, but only innocently in an attempt to collect on his father\u2019s investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">As we noted <em>supra, </em>a member of a RICO enterprise need not participate in all of the enterprise\u2019s activities or even have knowledge of them; he is criminally responsible if he is aware of the basic structure and purpose of the enterprise. The record shows that, after Rafsky moved to New York, Paul Santo threatened him and his family, threatened and assaulted Rafsky\u2019s representatives, and promised to injure the partners\u2019 race horses. In addition, Paul Santo aided Facchiano\u2019s efforts at the Essex House meeting and did most of the talking there. The evidence was more than sufficient to show that Paul Santo acted as a collection agent for the appellants\u2019 loan sharking enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">5. Sufficiency of the Evidence Against Pepe</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">The racketeering and collection of debt activities alleged against Pepe covered his conduct in soliciting and facilitating the loans, in acting as a payment conduit, and in threatening the partners. Pepe claims he was an employee of the partners, was \u201con their side,\u201d and thus could not have been convicted under counts one, two, and three. The record belies this claim. Pepe was an eager and greedy middleman. He introduced the partners to the lenders; obtained loans for the partners, deducting commissions for himself; relayed weekly payments to the lenders; and repeated and amplified the lenders\u2019 threats. At one meeting with the partners Pepe stated that he could no longer hold off the \u201cserious consequences\u201d of nonpayment. Both the partners and the lenders used Pepe for their own ends, but the record clearly shows that he allied himself with, and participated in, the enterprise. His conviction under count three is specifically supported by the evidence which established that he solicited and negotiated the third Santo loan for $20,000 at three percent interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>per week, from which he deducted a $2,000 commission for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">B. <em>Other Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"AmZ\">1. Testimony of Gary Bowdach</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The appellants claim that the testimony of Gary Bowdach was inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 403 and 404(b) and the Extortionate Credit Transactions Statute,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894(c), and was so prejudicial and inflammatory that it constituted reversible error.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Gary Bowdach had been a mid-level hoodlum in a number of organized crime rings. As such, he was familiar with the identities and practices of many organized crime figures. The government finally closed in on Bowdach, and he was indicted. In exchange for leniency, Bowdach became a star government witness. Prior to the trial in this case, he had testified in a number of criminal cases and before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">When he testified against the appellants, Bowdach was on parole in the government\u2019s protected witness program. The prosecutor called Bowdach to the stand to testify about Faechiano\u2019s previous criminal activity, contending that Bowdach\u2019s testimony was admissible for the purpose of establishing Facchiano\u2019s motive and ability to perpetrate the crimes charged. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 404(b). The prosecutor also contended that Bowdach\u2019s testimony was admissible under the Extortionate Credit Transactions Statute<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> which authorizes the introduction of evidence concerning a creditor\u2019s reputation for collection practices when direct testimony of the debtor is unavailable. A creditor\u2019s reputation for collection may be crucial in extortionate lending cases because loan sharks normally cannot collect unless they instill fear in the borrower, and fear is a natural component of extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">The prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Bowdach was short. Bowdach testified that he and Facchiano had been members of the \u201cGenovese organized crime family\u201d operating out of New York City and that Facchiano and Terriacca ran a \u201cshylock operation.\u201d Bowdach then testified that in 1974 he borrowed money from one of Facehiano\u2019s shyloeks, and Facchiano summoned him to a meeting at a restaurant when he refused to repay the loan. At the meeting Facchiano took Bowdach outside and .threatened him. While Facchiano was delivering the threats, Bowdach noticed two police officers, whom he recognized, observing them from some distance. He and Facchiano then split up and left. The court sustained a defense objection to the prosecutor\u2019s question whether Bowdach knew Facchiano\u2019s reputation in the community of Miami, Florida. The court also sustained an objection to a question inquiring of Facchiano\u2019s position within the \u201cGenovese crime family.\u201d At no time during his direct examination did the prosecutor, or Bowdach, use the terms \u201cmafia,\u201d \u201cmob,\u201d or <em>\u201cla cosa nostra.\u201d </em>The prosecutor ended his questioning of Bowdach after eliciting from Bowdach a description of his most recent felonies and the fact that the government had promised to inform the parole authorities of his cooperation in its case against Facchiano.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">Facchiano\u2019s cross-examination of Bowdach was extensive. His lawyer first es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tablished that Bowdach was a vicious murderer, a turncoat, and a liar. Then he developed the theme that his own client, Facchiano, was a \u201cmafia chieftan.\u201d Referring to Facchiano with these words, counsel got Bowdach to say, for the first time, that the \u201cGenovese crime family\u201d was actually the \u201cmafia\u201d and that Facchiano was a mafia \u201ccaptain.\u201d Counsel also inquired into affairs of the Genovese and Gambino \u201cmafia families.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The district court, in overruling Facchiano\u2019s objection when Bowdach first took the stand, held that Bowdach\u2019s testimony would be received pursuant to the Extortionate Credit Transactions Statute, because it tended to show the reputation for collection practices of the creditor, Facchiano. The court also ruled that the contested evidence was probative of the RICO charges and tended to show an association between Facchiano and his -coconspirators. The court gave the jury appropriate limiting instructions immediately before Bowdach testified, and it repeated those cautionary instructions in its final charge. The gist of these instructions was that Bowdach\u2019s testimony constituted \u201csimilar acts\u201d evidence, applicable <em>only </em>to Facchiano, which, standing alone, could not convict him of the crime charged. The jury was told, however, that, if it found by \u201cclear and conclusive\u201d evidence that Facchiano had committed these extrinsic acts, it could consider the acts as bearing on his intent, state of mind, lack of mistake or accident, and willfulness. Finally, the court cautioned that the jury could consider none of the evidence unless it first found, based on <em>other </em>evidence in the case, that Facchiano was guilty of the acts charged in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Facchiano contends that admission of Bowdach\u2019s testimony inflamed the jury and resulted in a conviction based on guilt by association. We disagree. Because we hold that Bowdach\u2019s testimony of Facehiano\u2019s previous involvement in a shylock operation was admissible as extrinsic acts evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), we need not comment upon its admissibility under the Extortionate Credit Transactions Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Rule 404(b) provides that evidence of other \u201ccrimes, wrongs, or acts ... may ... be admissible for other purposes [than to prove character] such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d If evidence of other crimes or wrongs is offered for one of these purposes, \u201c[t]he determination must be made whether the danger of undue prejudice outweighs the probative value of the evidence, in view of the availability of other means of proof and other factors appropriate for making decisions of this kind under Rule 403(a).\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) advisory committee note. <em>See United States v. Astling, </em>733 F.2d 1446, 1456-57 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">Under Rule 404(b) the admissibility of extrinsic acts evidence is determined by a two-prong test: first, the proffered testimony \u201cmust be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character. Second, the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and the evidence must be otherwise admissible under rule 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc)), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 920, 99 S.Ct. 1244, 59 L.Ed.2d 472 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">Here, Bowdach\u2019s testimony was relevant to Facchiano\u2019s intent, not his character.. It showed that Facchiano committed prior acts sufficiently similar to one or more crimes charged in the indictment to permit the inference that he intended to commit such crime.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> <em>Astling, </em>733 F.2d at 1457.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The prosecution\u2019s proof that Facchiano committed the extrinsic crimes of extortionate extensions of credit and use of extortionate means to collect credit was clear. Bowdach\u2019s testimony on this score was uncontradicted and was bolstered by the testimony of a police officer who stated that he had observed Bowdach and Facchiano outside the restaurant at the time Bowdach said he met with Facchiano. Moreover, the extrinsic offense evidence Bowdach produced disclosed conduct almost identical to that charged against Facchiano in the indictment: the intent elements in the extrinsic criminal conduct were identical to those required to convict Facchiano on counts one, two, and five. The extrinsic conduct Bowdach described, including Facchiano\u2019s membership in a \u201ccrime family,\u201d was also probative as to identity, preparation, and plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Turning to Beechum\u2019s second prong, we hold that the probative value of Bowdach\u2019s testimony was not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice. We realize that testimony concerning \u201cthe mafia\u201d and <em>\u201cla cosa nostra\u201d </em>can be most inflammatory, especially when a defendant has an Italian surname. However, much of the prejudice from \u201cmafia\u201d testimony was caused by Facchiano\u2019s own trial tactics. A thorough reading of the record shows that the prejudice was not undue, nor did it substantially outweigh the probative value of Bowdach\u2019s testimony. The probative value of the evidence was high; intent was a crucial element because Facchiano\u2019s theory was that no threats were used to coerce payment at the Essex House. Bowdach\u2019s testimony on direct examination was \u201cnot of a heinous nature, likely to incite the jury to an irrational decision,\u201d <em>United States v. McMahon, </em>592 F.2d 871, 876 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 921, 99 S.Ct. 2847, 61 L.Ed.2d 289 (1979); nor was it cumulative or confusing to the jury. <em>United States v. Tunsil, </em>672 F.2d 879, 881 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 850, 103 S.Ct. 110, 74 L.Ed.2d 98 (1982). The trial judge clearly acted within his discretion in admitting the evidence.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">2. Testimony Concerning the \u201cBurly Men\u201d from Las Vegas</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">The district court admitted testimony which showed that the partners had gone to Las Vegas in early 1973, obtained a fraudulent line of $35,000 casino credit at the Aladdin Hotel, and then cashed in their chips and capitalized Z &amp; H with the money. The court also admitted hearsay testimony bearing on some of these points: Zucker testified that Pepe said he had mollified the \u201cburly men\u201d by invoking the name of \u201cChink\u201d and that Pepe stated he later gave \u201cChink\u201d the partners\u2019 $5,000 check for interceding with the casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">The court ruled that all of this evidence was relevant and not unduly prejudicial. Later in the trial, however, the court struck the testimony connecting Facchiano to the settlement of the gambling debt and admonished the jury to disregard that testimony only as it related to Facchiano. The court decided that the \u201cburly men\u201d incident had not occurred \u201cduring the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy,\u201d <em>see </em>Fed.R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(e), and that proof of it constituted hearsay as to Facchiano. In its final charge to the jury, the court further instructed the jury that the defendants were on trial only for the conduct alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Facchiano claims that the challenged testimony was unduly prejudicial and that the court\u2019s instructions striking it were insufficient to remove the prejudice from the case. We disagree. We need not decide whether the testimony was inadmissible as coconspirator hearsay; the court struck it and the jury was firmly and adequately instructed to disregard it. (Had the government offered it as such, the testimony could have been admitted not for its truth, but to show why the partners later resorted to Pepe for money, and to show Pepe\u2019s and Facchiano\u2019s connection with each other, or Pepe\u2019s and Facchiano\u2019s ability to undertake shady financial dealings.) There is no reason to presume that the jurors disregarded the cautionary instructions given by the district court when it struck the testimony. <em>See Lakeside v. Oregon, </em>435 U.S. 333, 340 &amp; n. 11, 98 S.Ct. 1091, 1095 &amp; n. 11, 55 L.Ed.2d 319 (1978). The evidence concerning the Las Vegas trip was clearly relevant and admissible even though the hearsay implicating Facchiano was stricken. The testimony showed the genesis of Z &amp; H, its shaky finances, and the partners\u2019 desperation. The testimony also established Pepe as a person who could arrange deals on the edges of the underworld. We find no abuse of discretion here.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">3. Miglionico\u2019s Motion to Reopen Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">After all parties had rested, Miglionico moved to reopen the evidence to present the testimony of one witness, Donald Kovac. Miglionico asserts that the trial court\u2019s failure to reopen the evidence or, alternatively, to grant him a new trial requires reversal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Miglionico subpoenaed Kovac but he failed to appear, apparently because of a medical problem. When Miglionico\u2019s counsel proffered Kovac\u2019s testimony to the court, he explained that Kovac was Miglionico\u2019s landlord and would testify that\u2019 Miglionico\u2019s rent was always unpaid because Z &amp; H never paid Miglionico his wages. Miglionico\u2019s theory was that he beat Sanford Rafsky at the racetrack because of a personal debt, not because of money Rafsky owed Francis Santo. The court considered the testimony, stated that it was not \u201ccrucial,\u201d and denied the motion to reopen evidence. It also later denied Miglionico\u2019s motion for a new trial which asserted the same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>We discern no abuse of discretion. Kovac\u2019s testimony could not have served the purpose Miglionico sought. Only through inadmissible hearsay could Kovac have testified that Miglionico\u2019s employer did not pay him regularly. Moreover, all sides had rested and a number of witnesses had been released due to the Christmas holidays; they would have been difficult to recall had rebuttal been required. Finally, the proffered testimony was cumulative of other evidence, including the testimony of Rafsky and Zucker, that Rafsky and Z &amp; H had failed to pay Miglionico on time or at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">A. <em>The Indictment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The appellants contend that the indictment was faulty because it was unclear and duplicitous. Specifically, they object to count two, which presented alternate grounds of substantive RICO liability in one count. They assert that the pattern of racketeering activity prong and the collection of unlawful debt prong should have been stated in separate counts because the jury was unable to separate properly the elements of each. We disagree. The indictment fairly tracked the RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), which imposes liability in two ways. Although RICO prosecutions involving collections of unlawful debt are rare, we have found two cases in which the indictment was written in a similar manner. <em>See United States v. Morelli, </em>643 F.2d 402, 403-04 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>453 U.S. 912, 101 S.Ct. 3143, 69 L.Ed.2d 994 (1981); <em>United States v. Altese, </em>542 F.2d 104, 105 (2d Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1039, 97 S.Ct. 736, 50 L.Ed.2d 750 (1977). We find no error in stating both prongs of RICO liability in one count.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The appellants argue, in a similar vein, that a section 1962(c) RICO count may not allege the same act as both a predicate act of racketeering and as a collection of unlawful debt. Appellants contend that this overlapping use of predicate offenses in count two \u201cmakes doubtful any prospect of instructing the jury satisfactorily.\u201d They argue that \u201c[o]ne RICO prong is enough for any judge or jury.\u201d We agree that stating the RICO prongs in separate counts could simplify matters. We are unable, however, to conclude that use of alternative grounds of RICO liability and overlapping acts in one count contravened the statute or any of the appellants\u2019 rights. They do not allege any specific injury or surprise at trial caused by the allegedly confusing indictment. <em>See United States v. Chilcote, </em>724 F.2d 1498, 1505 (11th Cir.1984) (practical rather than technical considerations govern validity of an indictment). The indictment, tracking the RICO statute, was complex, but, clearly, it was not incomprehensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">B. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">Appellants seek reversal for a number of alleged errors in the jury instructions. Their first complaint arises from the district court\u2019s jury instruction on the \u201ccollection of an unlawful debt\u201d element of the RICO counts, one and two. The RICO statute provides liability for participation in the affairs of an enterprise through \u201ccollection of unlawful debt.\u201d The district court\u2019s charge on this element, however, was identical to a portion of its charge concerning extortionate collection of credit. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894 (counts six and seven). The disputed instruction, which tracked a section of the Extortionate Credit Transactions Statute, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 894(a), stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-12\">The government is required to prove ---- First: [t]hat ... the defendant knowingly participated in the use of extortionate means to collect <em>or attempt to collect </em>from Sanford Rafsky an extension of credit, <em>or punish Sanford Rafsky for nonpayment thereof.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-15\">(emphasis added). Appellants contend that RICO\u2019s plain language only proscribes \u201ccollection of unlawful debt,\u201d not attempted collection. Thus, they argue, the count one and two instructions were faulty. According to appellants, the district court should have instructed the jury that a RICO \u201ccollection of an unlawful debt\u201d requires the jury to find successful collection rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>than merely an act of collecting or inducing payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In their briefs, appellants cite the meaning of \u201ccollection\u201d as found in lay and legal dictionaries. Appellants neither cite, nor have we found, any eases or parts of the legislative history of RICO which support their position. To the contrary, Congress stated in the public law that enacted RICO that RICO\u2019s purpose was to \u201cseek eradication of organized crime in the United States by strengthening legal tools ... establishing new penal prohibitions, and by providing enhanced sanctions and new remedies.\u201d Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Statement of Findings and Purpose, Pub.L. 91-452, 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News (84 Stat.) 1073. The same public law ordered that \u201cthe provisions of [RICO] shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">It does not take a very liberal construction of RICO to reject appellant\u2019s argument. Appellants would have us apply RICO to collection of unlawful debt only when cash actually exchanged hands.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> To accept appellants\u2019 definition of collection would mean that a loan shark who killed his victim before the victim could hand over the money could not be charged under the RICO collection of unlawful debt prong. This runs against common sense and the remedial nature of RICO. Absent any legislative ' history showing otherwise we cannot believe Congress had such a result in mind. Congress defined \u201cto collect\u201d in the Extortionate Credit Transactions Statute as \u201cinducepng] in any way any person to make repayment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(5) (1982). We think this is a proper definition of the term \u201ccollection\u201d in RICO as well.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The appellants next complain that the instructions covering the element of collection in counts one, two, six, and seven permitted the jury to find the collection element based upon the punishment of Sanford Rafsky for nonpayment, even though these counts of the indictment stated nothing about punishment. <em>See supra </em>instruction, p. 674. This phrase concern-, ing punishment was, indeed, omitted from the relevant counts of the indictment. The issue appellants raise was never preserved, however, by proper objection pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, which states in part, \u201c[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to. which he objects and the grounds for his objection.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Accordingly, our review of this issue is limited to correcting plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Jury instructions will not be reversed for plain error unless \u201cthe charge, considered as a whole, is so clearly erroneous as to result in a likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice,\u201d or the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 645 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (citing <em>United States v. Varkonyi, </em>645 F.2d 453, 459 (5th Cir.1981)), cert. <em>denied, </em>459 U.S. 825, 103 S.Ct. 57, 74 L.Ed.2d 61, 456 U.S. 1008, 102 S.Ct. 2300, 73 L.Ed.2d 1303 (1982). In our judgment the charge did not constitute plain error under this standard. The extraneous punishment instruction came from the Extortionate Credit Transactions Statute, upon which some of the counts were based. The instruction obviously did not \u201csurprise\u201d the defense; defense counsel neither noticed it nor objected. It could not have prejudiced the appellants through surprise because proof of punishment was at the heart of the government\u2019s case; the \u201cpunishment\u201d of Sanford Rafsky permeated the entire trial. The indictment amply showed that the grand jury considered that the crimes charged encompassed threats and punishment. Plainly, the challenged jury instruction was not at variance or inconsistent with the grand jury\u2019s understanding of the crime. <em>See United States v. Cahalane, </em>560 F.2d 601, 606 (3d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1045, 98 S.Ct. 890, 54 L.Ed.2d 796 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Most importantly, the phrase concerning the punishment of Sanford Rafsky was merely cumulative of the words \u201ccollect\u201d or \u201cattempt to collect.\u201d The record reveals no instances of punishment of Rafsky, including the racetrack assault, which were not accompanied by collections or attempts to collect. Thus the jury could not have based liability on punishment alone, and we see no harm in the court\u2019s inclusion of references to punishment in its charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Appellants bring one other issue of substance concerning the jury instructions. They claim that the district court erred in declining to instruct the jury that participation in the enterprise\u2019s affairs had to be knowing and willful. Without these elements of mens rea and scienter, appellants claim, RICO would become a strict liability measure. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">In <em>Diecidue, </em>603 F.2d at 548, we rejected this contention. A plain reading of the statute indicates that RICO does not contain any separate mens rea or scienter ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ments beyond those encompassed in its predicate acts. <em>Accord United States v. Romano, </em>684 F.2d 1057, 1065 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1016, 103 S.Ct. 376, 74 L.Ed.2d 509, 459 U.S. 1016, 103 S.Ct. 375, 74 L.Ed.2d 509 (1982); <em>United States v. Scotto, </em>641 F.2d 47, 56 (2d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 961, 101 S.Ct. 3109, 69 L.Ed.2d 971 (1981); <em>United States v. Boylan, </em>620 F.2d 359, 361-62 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 833, 101 S.Ct. 103, 66 L.Ed.2d 38 (1980). In defining the elements of the RICO offenses here, the court tracked the language of Devitt &amp; Black-mar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, \u00a7 56.20 (Supp.1983), and the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Crim.), No. 37 (1979). In count one the court stressed that the jury must find \u201c[tjhat the defendant, with the knowledge of the conspiracy, willfully became a member of the conspiracy by agreeing to participate.\u201d In count two the court charged that the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt \u201c[t]hat the defendant was engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity ... by knowingly and willfully committing at least two acts of racketeering activity\u201d or \u201cknowingly or willfully collectpng] an unlawful debt.\u201d The court additionally defined the terms \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d and instructed that these mental states were required under the Travel Act and the extortionate credit counts which were alleged as predicate acts. The jury instructions in this case concerning state of mind were almost identical to those approved in <em>Diecidue, supra. </em>We hold that the court properly instructed the jury as to the mental state required for a RICO conviction. The bases for the verdicts were far from strict liability.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">C. <em>Alleged Perjury of a Government Witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"A55\">Facchiano and both Santos moved for a new trial because they claimed that the government failed to disclose favorable treatment to its witness, Lionel Reifler, in exchange for his testimony and then acquiesced in his perjurious testimony regarding those promises. Facchiano claims that this evidence, discovered shortly after trial, constituted a violation of the pretrial discovery orders and of the rules set forth in <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959), and <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and was \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence entitling him to a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. Facchiano claims that at trial the government and Reifler failed to disclose a \u201cdeal\u201d with federal prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois where Reifler pled guilty and received concurrent sentences, and later a reduction in sentence, for his cooperation in another federal case in Illinois and certain federal cases in Florida. The district court took extensive briefing on the issue but did not hold an evidentiary hearing. It denied the motion in a lengthy memorandum and order. Facchiano and both Santos assert this denial as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">When the investigation of this case began, Reifler was informed by federal prosecutors in Miami that his cooperation would be made known to judicial or parole authorities. On July 15, 1976, Reifler, pursuant to a plea agreement, changed from innocent to guilty two pleas he had entered in the Northern District of Illinois for wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property. The prosecutor had agreed to recommend concurrent sentences and to keep the court informed of Reifler\u2019s cooperation with federal authorities. Sentencing was then delayed, rescheduled, and delayed again. In the interim, a prosecutor from the Miami Organized Crime Strike Force sent Reifler\u2019s lawyer a letter for use in the sentencing which described Reifler\u2019s cooperation in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>On December 15, 1976, the district court sentenced Reifler to two concurrent four-year terms, pursuant to the plea agreement. At the sentencing the court stated that Reifler could move for a reduction in sentence if he could show substantial further cooperation with federal prosecutors. Reifler moved for a reduction in sentence on April 8, 1977. While that motion was pending, the prosecutor in the instant case sent a letter to the sentencing judge in Illinois, outlining Reifler\u2019s cooperation in <em>United States v. Anthony Accetturo, </em>another criminal ease in the Southern District of Florida. The letter did not mention the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">At a sentence reduction hearing on February 14, 1978, the Illinois prosecutor recommended that Reifler\u2019s sentence be reduced to eighteen months. The prosecutor\u2019s recommendation was based on Reifler\u2019s cooperation with federal authorities in Chicago and with federal prosecutors working on <em>Accetturo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">As part of the discovery in this case the prosecutor informed the defense counsel that the United States promised Reifler that it would make his cooperation in this case known to the courts and the U.S. Parole Commission. The prosecutor also provided copies of the two letters he had written on Reifler\u2019s behalf and Reifler\u2019s FBI \u201crap sheet.\u201d The rap sheet showed Reifler\u2019s concurrent four-year sentences in the Northern District of Illinois and that they had been reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">On direct examination, Reifler testified that the only promise he had received from the prosecutor in this case was that he would make his cooperation known to his sentencing judge in the Northern District of Illinois. Facchiano and the Santos claim that the disclosure here was constitutionally inadequate because it omitted Reifler\u2019s concurrent sentences and later sentence reduction. They also claim that Reifler perjured himself when the prosecutor asked him what consideration he had received for testifying and that the prosecutor acquiesced in this perjury, thereby violating <em>Giglio </em>and <em>Napue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The district court noted that the discovery order in this case was not issued until five days before trial, and that, although discovery was not complete, the government\u2019s disclosure contained substantial information about Reifler which was sufficient to enable defense counsel more fully to investigate Reifler before Reifler\u2019s cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Additionally, the district court noted that, in a sidebar conference, Facchiano\u2019s counsel stated that he was already aware of Reifler\u2019s pattern of cooperation in exchange for leniency. The court stated that the evidence of Reifler\u2019s cooperation was not newly discovered and that any facts not known to the defense after pretrial discovery were cumulative of impeaching facts already known. The trial court also found no <em>Brady </em>violation because Reifler\u2019s alleged perjury had \u201clittle if any influence upon the jury\u2019s judgment,\u201d and there was \u201cno reasonable likelihood\u201d that additional testimony concerning leniency would have influenced the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions for new trial. First, Reifler did not perjure himself. He stated, quite correctly, that the consideration he received in the instant case was that the prosecutor would apprise the sentencing judge in Illinois of his cooperation. That was done. Contrary to Facchiano\u2019s and the Santos\u2019 claims, the record shows that Reifler\u2019s concurrent sentences were a result of his initial plea bargain with an Illinois federal prosecutor in 1976. Reifler\u2019s February 1978 reduction in sentence was also unrelated to his testimony in the instant case; the transcript of the sentence reduction hearing shows that he was being rewarded for his cooperation in federal prosecutions in Illinois and in the <em>Accetturo </em>case in the Southern District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">We are faced with a <em>Giglio/Napue </em>violation if a government witness gives false testimony concerning consideration he has received from the government, and the prosecutor acquiesces in this testimony by failing to correct it or provide the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>with information so that it may do so. In such a case \u201c[a] new trial is required if the false testimony could in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>Giglio, </em>405 U.S. at 154, 92 S.Ct. at 766; <em>United States v. Barham, </em>595 F.2d 231, 242 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1002, 101 S.Ct. 1711, 68 L.Ed.2d 205 (1981). In this case the testimony was not false and, considering the abundant evidence presented against the defendants, even if Reifler had perjured himself there was little likelihood that the verdict would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We also find no violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). To establish a <em>Brady </em>violation the appellants must prove that the prosecution suppressed or withheld evidence which was favorable and material to the defense. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1025 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354, 459 U.S. 906, 103 S.Ct. 208, 74 L.Ed.2d 166 (1982); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>574 F.2d 1347, 1353 (5th Cir.1978). <em>Accord Moore v. Illinois, </em>408 U.S. 786, 794-95, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 2567-68, 33 L.Ed.2d 706 (1972). In this case the prosecution did not withhold favorable evidence. The prosecution provided the defense with the two letters written on behalf of Reifler. Because Reifler\u2019s 1976 plea bargain for concurrent sentences was unrelated to this prosecution, the prosecution\u2019s failure to describe it in detail was not required; it was set out in general terms on the rap sheet the prosecution disclosed. The information contained in the rap sheet also revealed Reifler\u2019s sentence reduction in 1978. Moreover, appellants do not claim they were foreclosed from further inquiring into these matters at the <em>James </em>hearing. In short, there was no showing in this case that Reifler perjured himself or that the prosecutor intentionally used false testimony. The government\u2019s disclosure of exculpatory or beneficial materials was sufficient. Accordingly, we find no fault in the district court\u2019s ruling; the <em>Giglio/Napue </em>and <em>Brady </em>claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we AFFIRM all convictions, except Francis Santo\u2019s conviction on count five, which we REVERSE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-15\">.

Pursuant to a written plan promulgated under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1863 (1982), the'names of potential jurors are randomly selected from voter lists and placed in a master jury wheel. The court may adopt other sources of names in addition to voter lists where necessary to secure a fair cross section of the community. From time to time the court publicly draws at random from the master jury wheel the names of as many persons as may be required for jury service. The people selected in the second drawing receive juror qualification forms which they must complete and return to the clerk of the court. The court determines solely on the basis of information provided on the juror qualification form and other competent evidence whether a person is unqualified for, or exempt, or is to be excused from jury service. Reasons for disqualification include the lack of citizenship, conviction of a felony, and inability to understand the English language.

Paul Santo states that in lieu of a severance the trial court should have permitted him to introduce Pepe\u2019s grand jury testimony into evidence. Such evidence is generally inadmissible, <em>see United States v. Carella, </em>411 F.2d 729, 732 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 860, 90 S.Ct. 131, 24 L.Ed.2d 112 (1969), and Santo cites no authority to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">.

We reject his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Because we have held that the denial of appellants\u2019 severance motions was proper, we find it unnecessary to assess their initial joinder in the indictment in this case. It is well settled that joinder under Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(b) is proper where an indictment charges multiple defendants with participation in a single conspiracy and also charges some but not all of the defendants with substantive offenses arising out of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1016 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (citing cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b728-13\">.

The <em>James </em>hearing was scheduled to commence on October 27, 1980, but was delayed until October 29 because of Santo\u2019s hospitalization. The hearing was again rescheduled for November 4 and commenced when Santo remained unavailable.

Under the <em>James </em>standards, the initial admissibility of coconspirator statements will depend upon whether the government can produce <em>substantial independent evidence </em>showing that a conspiracy existed between the defendant and the declarant and that the statements were made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>James, </em>590 F.2d at 581. We hold that the evidence adduced at the <em>James </em>hearing was well within this standard, and the district court did not err in admitting the coconspirator statements at trial. Moreover, <em>James </em>simply described a preferred evidentiary technique; it did not relieve defense counsel of articulating proper objections to hearsay at trial. Facchiano claims that there was no substantial evidence put forth at the <em>James </em>hearing to establish his membership in the conspiracy, and thus the admission of the coconspirator statements against him was improper. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E); P. Marcus, <em>supra </em>note 8, at \u00a7 5. The <em>James </em>hearing in this case was exhaustive; the testimony of Rafsky and Reifler, which closely tracked the proof adduced at trial, was sufficient to meet our standard of admissibility. <em>See United States v. Kopituk, </em>690 F.2d 1289, 1324 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 3542, 77 L.Ed.2d 1391, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S.Ct. 2090, 77 L.Ed.2d 300, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S.Ct. 2089, 77 L.Ed.2d 300 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\">. Zucker was not in the Witness Protection Program but he had recently moved to an address unknown to the appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\">. Bowdach did not appear at the <em>James </em>hearing, but he was available for an interview at trial, where he testified solely concerning the prior crimes of Facchiano. He had testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee and at a number of other trials involving alleged organized crime figures. Thus defense counsel was likely to be familiar with his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b731-13\">. <em>See infra </em>note 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b731-14\">. Vanasco\u2019s testimony at trial dealt almost exclusively with the collection efforts in New York. Facchiano also claims that the prosecutor breached a promise to tell Rafsky that Facchiano\u2019s counsel wished to interview him. During the time between the promise and the <em>James </em>hearing, Rafsky was not working in cooperation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>with the government; he was trying to quash the government's subpoena commanding his appearance at trial. The promise was oral, and Facchiano has not shown reliance or prejudice of any kind. Additionally, Facchiano\u2019s counsel apparently made no attempt to interview Rafsky individually during the days Rafsky was in court for the <em>James </em>hearing, which belies Facchiano\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b732-5\">. Edward Vanasco, who spoke with Paul San-to\u2019s counsel at the <em>James </em>hearing, Lionel Reifler, and a police officer testifying for the government about a meeting between Bowdach and Facchiano, <em>infra </em>pp. 669-670, 671, all refused to be interviewed at trial. <em>See Kines v. Butterworth, </em>669 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 980, 102 S.Ct. 2250, 72 L.Ed.2d 856 (1982) (\u201d[n]o right of a defendant\u2019s violated when a potential witness freely chooses not to talk; a witness may of his own free will refuse to be interviewed by either the prosecution or the defense\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">. We also find no error in the district court\u2019s preclusion of cross-examination as to the home addresses of Bowdach, Rafsky, and Zucker. Bowdach and Rafsky were in the Witness Protection Program; their addresses were protected by law. Zucker, as a government witness and key debtor in a loan sharking case, was in considerable danger. Moreover, Zucker had moved to a new address a few months before the trial, and no one in that community was familiar enough with him to give reputation or character testimony. Finally, the appellants allege no specific prejudice caused by this nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Our holding on this point is controlled by <em>United States v. Alston, </em>460 F.2d 48, 52 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 871, 93 S.Ct. 200, 34 L.Ed.2d 122 (1972). In <em>Alston, </em>an undercover police agent in a narcotics case declined to give his home address on the stand, and the district court sustained an objection to the question. In <em>Alston, </em>we interpreted Supreme Court precedent to hold that the defendant normally has a right to examine a witness as to his or her home address but that right does not exist if the examination is an attempt to \u201charass, annoy or humiliate [or] ... the physical safety of the witness or his family might be endangered by disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The purpose of this right is to enable the defendant to place the witness in his \"proper setting.\u201d Like the appellant in <em>Alston, </em>the appellants in the instant case were fully able to place in their \u201cproper setting\u201d the witnesses for whom no addresses were given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b732-12\">.

Nor do we think the district court erred by denying appellants\u2019 Jencks Act motions for Horowitz\u2019 and Heller\u2019s statements in the SBA files. Horowitz and Heller did not testify in this case; the Jencks Act therefore did not apply. <em>Medel, </em>592 F.2d at 1316 n. 12. Appellants claim, however, that Horowitz\u2019 and Heller\u2019s hearsay declarations were admitted into evidence through the testimony of Zueker and Rafsky, and thus Horowitz and Heller became \"witnesses\u201d for purposes of the Jencks Act. Even if we agreed, the statements of Horowitz and Heller concerning the SBA fraud were not producible under Jencks for the reasons stated in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">.

Facchiano brings two other Jencks Act issues on appeal. First, he claims that the trial court did not determine which materials were producible under the Act but rather permitted the government to make this determination. Our reading of the record shows this claim to be patently meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Second, Facchiano alleges that the district court erred when it did not order the production he requested under the Act of <em>all </em>prior promises of consideration made to Bowdach or received by him from the government, no matter what the case or time. Facchiano claims that this violated both the Jencks Act and the rule of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). There was no Jencks Act violation because the materials sought by Facchiano\u2019s carte blanche request in no way \"related\" to the testimony Bowdach gave at trial. Indeed, had the trial court granted the request the U.S. Attorney would have had to conduct a nationwide search involving numerous governmental agencies. We cannot say that failure to order this disclosure was erroneous. The jury was fully aware of any consideration Bowdach received in the instant case and that Bowdach was a habitual felon who frequently traded his testimony for leniency in his own recurring criminal prosecutions. If by chance, however, error occurred, it was clearly harmless. <em>Goldberg v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 94, 111 n. 21, 96 S.Ct. 1338, 1348 n. 21, 47 L.Ed.2d 603 (1976) (Jencks Act harmless error standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">Nor can we conclude that the denial of this material violated <em>Brady. Brady </em>held that \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is <em>material </em>either to guilt or punishment____\" <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97 (emphasis added). In this circuit we apply a strict standard of materiality. <em>See United States v. Judon, </em>567 F.2d 1289, 1293 (5th Cir.1978).

Facchiano claims that acts which constitute collection of unlawful debt are subject to a five-year statute of limitations, unlike those acts which establish a pattern of racketeering activity. We agree. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(5) (1982) defines \"pattern of racketeering activity\" as two or more predicate acts, at least one of which was committed during the general federal five-year statute of limitations period. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282 (1982). The first, oldest, predicate act, however, may be beyond the five-year period so long as it was committed within ten years of the second, recent, act. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1961(5). Thus a pattern of racketeering could be established with the first act almost fifteen years old. <em>But cf. id. </em>(one act must be committed after effective date of RICO).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">This is not true when the government seeks to impose RICO liability by proving a collection of unlawful debt, however. A plain reading of the RICO statute shows that the ten-year statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>limitations extension found in section 1961(5) only applies to a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">. Facchiano also contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish venue in the Southern District of Florida for the prosecution of the count two substantive RICO offense. His contention is frivolous. The count two offense had a substantial nexus with the Southern District of Florida. The \u201centerprise\u201d element of the offense, loan sharking, appears to have originated in that district, and the enterprise carried out much of its activity there. Moreover, Facchiano completed his commission of the offense in the Southern District of Florida by commencing his Travel Act violation (the trip to the Essex House in New York City) in South Florida. The venue for a Travel Act violation may be properly laid in any district in which the offense was begun, continued, or completed, <em>United States v. Davis, </em>666 F.2d at 200; <em>United States v. Blitstein, </em>626 F.2d 774, 782 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1102, 101 S.Ct. 898, 66 L.Ed.2d 828 (1981); <em>United States v.

Miglionico moved for a severance after Bowdach testified, claiming that the prejudice had a \"spillover\u201d effect. He asserts that the trial court's failure to grant a severance at that point was reversible error. We disagree. As we noted, Miglionico must show \"compelling prejudice\" caused by the trial court\u2019s failure to sever. The trial court made it abundantly clear that Bowdach\u2019s testimony went only to Facchiano. Moreover, Bowdach\u2019s testimony was a short episode in a long trial, and it never implicated Miglionico. The jury acquitted Miglionico on count one,, showing that it could assess the proof applicable to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"76\">\n<p id=\"b748-4\">. All appellants claim that we should reverse their convictions because the district court failed to grant a mistrial when the government elicited from Rafsky at trial that he was presently in \u201cfear[ ] for my life.\" At the time the appellants moved for a mistrial, the court said it would grant the mistrial unless the government could prove a continuing reasonable fear on the part of Rafsky for which the defendants were responsible. The court later denied their motions for mistrial, apparently satisfied that the government had met the court\u2019s requirements. The court also denied motions to strike the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The court erred in failing to strike the testimony, as it was irrelevant. The fear of the victim in a loan shark or extortion case is often crucial, but the issue here dealt with Rafsky\u2019s <em>present </em>fear, at trial. The error, however, was harmless. The testimony concerning Rafsky's fear was cumulative of inferences the jurors no doubt drew from the abundant, and properly admitted, evidence which showed threats and assaults. Any reasonable juror would have concluded that conduct of the appellants placed Rafsky in continuing fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">We also find no merit in Francis Santo\u2019s contention that his convictions should be reversed because the government called him a \"bookmaker\" in its opening statement to the jury and elicited the same label from Zucker on direct examination. The court twice instructed the jury to \"disregard the reference to bookmaking\u201d and not \"permit it to have any impact.\u201d Additionally, the court cautioned Zucker not to use the term. Finally, in its final instructions, the court cautioned the jurors that the appellants were on trial only for the precise crimes charged. Given the overwhelming evidence against Francis Santo, showing him to be a shylock and extortionist, we cannot agree that the \"bookmaker\u201d label, which was disposed of properly by the district court, resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial..</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Additionally, we find no error in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument that Miglionico\u2019s theory of defense, that he had nothing to do with loan sharking, was a fanciful \u201cMagic Kingdom defense.\u201d Finally, Miglionico\u2019s claim that the trial court showed bias against his counsel during closing argument is totally unsupported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"77\">\n<p id=\"b750-5\">. Appellants claim that their argument, here, also goes against the pattern of racketeering prong of RICO liability, because predicate act of racketeering (k), implicating Facchiano and both Santos, alleged the use of extortionate means to collect <em>or attempt to collect. See supra </em>note 12. This attempt element, according to appellants, was not proscribed by RICO. Appellants are mistaken in this contention, however, because RICO, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1), lists as possible predicate acts of racketeering violations of the Extortionate Credit Transactions Statute, and that statute defines \"collections\" as any acts \"induce[ing] in any way any person to make repayment thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\">. On a related issue, the appellants assert as error that the trial court failed to provide the jury with the legal definition of \"attempt\" in its instructions on counts one, two, five, and six. Contrary to the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, no defense counsel filed a written request for this charge. Moreover, no defense counsel objected to the charge at the conclusion of the evidence or earlier, at the charge conference. After the charge was read to the jury and the jury had retired to consider its verdict, Facchiano\u2019s counsel objected to the court's failure to define attempt in counts five and six. Nothing was mentioned about counts one and two, and Facchiano never stated how \"attempt\u201d should have been defined in the instructions. He did not request the court to recall the jury and instruct it on the word \"attempt.\u201d His objection on this issue covered only counts five and six and came in a string of objections he was creating for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Facchiano claims that his counsel preserved the objection properly, at least as to counts five and six. He cites <em>Delancey v. Motichek Towing Serv., Inc., </em>427 F.2d 897, 900 (5th Cir.1970), for the proposition that an objection to the court's failure to give a jury instruction may be properly preserved even though the instruction is not requested prior to the charge. <em>Motichek </em>stands for no such proposition. The appellant there complied <em>in toto </em>with Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 and apprised the court of his requested instructions prior to the charge. <em>Id. </em>at 899, 901. The <em>Motichek </em>court stressed that \"[t]his court has consistently held that the specifications of errors dealing with the giving of or failure to give instructions will not be considered unless the party objects in the manner provided by rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 900. Since Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 is an analytical twin of Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, <em>see </em>advisory committee note to Rule 30, we find <em>Motichek </em>convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Facchiano\u2019s counsel failed to follow Rule 30 on his objections concerning counts five and six; he never filed a written request for an instruction or advised the court orally of a requested instruction. Only after the jury had retired did he object to the court's failure to give an instruction covering \"attempt.\u201d No objections concerning counts one and two were made at all. We will only reverse a jury instruction for plain error if, viewing the court's charge as a whole, it was so clearly erroneous as to result in a substantial likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice. <em>See infra </em>p. 675. Appellants were far from meeting this standard. None were charged with an attempt offense. The appellants certainly were not injured in their inability to argue the definition of \"attempt\u201d to the jury in their closing arguments; no counsel requested such an instruction so they must not have thought about it. We hold that the court</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>thoroughly explained the elements of each count. It is well settled that a court need not define terms that are not unduly technical or ambiguous or that are within the common understanding of the jury. <em>See United States v.
