Appellants appeal their convictions urging that the evidence is insufficient to support their convictions. They argue further that the prosecutor committed misconduct sufficient to warrant reversal, that the trial court directed the verdict of the jury as to an essential element of the offense, that various evidentiary rulings were improper, and that their conduct was not constitutionally reached under section 1973i(c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Government, they show that the following transactions occurred. Fidencio Saenz and Gilberto Uresti were incumbent candidates for the offices of Duval County, Texas, county commissioner and county judge, respectively. Their names appeared on the May 1, 1982, Democratic Party primary election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-18\">During the month preceding the Democratic Party primary election, appellants, as well as other unindicted co-conspirators, conducted a door to door campaign. In several instances, prospective voters were offered welfare vouchers in exchange for their votes. In these instances, the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>spective voters were referred to the Duval County Welfare Office. There they were issued welfare vouchers that could be redeemed for food, clothing, or medical services. The facts surrounding specific solicitations will be discussed where appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">In examining the appellants\u2019 attack on the sufficiency of the evidence, we must decide whether \u201ca reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>462 U.S. 356, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983) (footnote omitted). In doing so, we must view the evidence and the inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the jury verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">(a) <em>The Evidence is Sufficient to Support the Conviction of Garza and Solis on Substantive Counts of Vote Buying</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Appellant Garza was convicted of one substantive count of paying and offering to pay Elizabeth Yarberry for her vote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant Solis was convicted of one substantive count of paying and offering to pay Mercedes Gonzales for her vote. Garcia does not directly challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting her convictions on the substantive charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">Garza\u2019s conviction rests exclusively on the testimony of Yarberry and Candula Torres. Yarberry testified that Domitilla Garza and Norma Solis came to see her before the May primary election. On their first visit, the defendants left a sample ballot on Yarberry\u2019s door.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, Garza came by her house to see if she had voted. Yarberry said she was planning to go the day of the election. Garza showed Yarberry a marked sample ballot and told her to vote for \u201cGilbert Estes.\u201d If she did, \u201cthey would help [her].\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following that conversation, Yarberry asked Garza to help her get a voucher. Yarberry then went to the civic center to get a voucher. When she arrived, Candula Torres was expecting Yarberry because Garza had told her she was coming. Yarberry received a voucher for $45.00. Yarberry testified she voted on election day after Garza and Solis took her to the polling place, in Garza\u2019s car. Garza and Solis gave her a marked sample ballot and told her to vote the way it was marked. On the way back to her home, Yarberry asked whether they were going to buy her something for voting. Solis purchased a six pack of beer for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">The court then questioned Yarberry.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-15\">The court: Did somebody promise you anything for your vote?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-16\">The witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-17\">The court: Who was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-18\">The witness: Domi Garza.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-19\">The court: That\u2019s Domitilla Garza?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-20\">The witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-21\">The court: Did Norma Solis promise you anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>The witness: No. Just the six-pack. That is all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-4\">The court: After you voted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-5\">The witness: After I voted, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-6\">The court: No I understand that part. What is it exactly that Domitilla Garza told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-7\">The witness: She told me she would help me if I voted the right way, which was for Gilbert Estes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-8\">The court: You call him \u201cGilbert Estes,\u201d I take it [that it is] Gilbert Uresti; County Judge that you are talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-9\">The witness: Well, the County Judge, sir</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-10\">The court: ... Well, when Domi made you that promise was Norma Solis with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-11\">The witness: No, sir. We were on the phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-12\">The court: On the phone. So the only time Norma Solis did something for you was after you voted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-13\">The witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-14\">The court: After you asked her for a six-pack? Is that what your testimony is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-15\">The witness: Yes, sir.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">Yarberry\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is challenged by appellants Saenz and Garcia.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Saenz and Garcia contend that Garza\u2019s solicitation of Yarberry\u2019s vote is not supported by the evidence. Defendant Garcia contends that Yarberry was not competent to testify, and that her testimony was confusing and conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-19\">Fed.R.Evid. 601 provides that \u201c[e]very person is competent to be a witness except as provided otherwise in [the] rules.\u201d A witness is competent to testify if she is capable of communicating relevant material and understands she has an obligation to do so. <em>United States v. Villatta, </em>662 F.2d 1205, 1206 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 916, 102 S.Ct. 1771, 72 L.Ed.2d 175 (1982). Furthermore, competency of a witness is a matter to be decided in the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Gurleski v. United States, </em>405 F.2d 253 (5th Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 2127, 23 L.Ed.2d 765 (1969). We conclude that Yarberry was not shown to be an incompetent witness, and the district court did not err by allowing her to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-20\">Furthermore, the Court of Appeals must accept all credibility choices made that tend to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>654 F.2d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1981). <em>United States v. Beason, </em>690 F.2d 439 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1177, 103 S.Ct. 828, 74 L.Ed.2d 1023 (1983). It is for the jury to resolve any conflicts within a witness\u2019 testimony. <em>United States v. Ortega-Chavez, </em>682 F.2d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-21\">Given that we must accept the jury\u2019s credibility choices and its resolution of the conflicts in Yarberry\u2019s testimony, it is clear that the evidence supports Garza\u2019s conviction. Yarberry testified that Garza promised to \u201chelp her\u201d if she voted the right way. Yarberry was later given a food voucher by Candula Torres, who testified that Garza told her Yarberry was coming for a voucher. From this evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could find that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>evidence establishes Garza s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Bell, </em>678 F.2d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Norma Solis also challenges her conviction, alleging that the evidence is insufficient to support her conviction. She was convicted of paying and offering to pay Mercedes Gonzales for her vote. Contrary to Solis\u2019 contentions, we find the evidence sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Mercedes Gonzales testified that Solis promised that Gonzales could pick up a welfare voucher if she voted for Judge Uresti. After Gonzales contradicted herself several times, the court told her she need not be afraid of anything or anyone. Then the court questioned Gonzales:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">The court: ... Did Norma Solis and Elvira Garza Rodriguez go to your house and ask you to vote for a candidate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-8\">The witness: In \u201982?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-9\">The court: Yes, in \u201982. Did either one of them promise you anything for your vote for a candidate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-10\">The witness: Just a voucher for food.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-11\">The court: All right. Who is it that told you that if you voted for that \u2014 for a candidate that you would receive a voucher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-12\">The witness: Norma.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">When asked why she contradicted herself earlier, Gonzales indicated she just didn\u2019t want to get involved.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">As we have stated, it is for the . jury to resolve any conflicts within a witness\u2019 testimony. <em>United States v. Ortega-Chavez, </em>682 F.2d at 1091. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that from Gonzales\u2019 testimony, a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes Solis\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">(b) <em>The Evidence is Sufficient to Support the Conspiracy Convictions of Saenz, Garcia, and Garza</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">In order to convict for criminal conspiracy, \u201cthe jury must find \u2018an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, and an overt act by one of the conspirators to further the agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>703 F.2d 815, 822 (5th Cir.1983). <em>United States v. Khamis, </em>674 F.2d 390, 392 (5th Cir.1982). Saenz and Garcia contend that the evidence is insufficient to support their conspiracy convictions because the Government has failed to prove an overt act by one of the conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-19\">The Government, in a conspiracy ease, need not prove that a substantive crime was actually committed. Instead, the Government only needs tp show some overt act by one of the conspirators taken in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Sutherland, </em>656 F.2d 1181, 1186-87 n. 4 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 1451, 71 L.Ed.2d 663 (1982). The Government need show only that \u201cat least one conspirator committed at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Fuiman, </em>546 F.2d 1155, 1158 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 856, 98 S.Ct. 176, 54 L.Ed.2d 127 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-20\">In the instant indictment, the Government alleged four overt acts. In one allegation, the Government alleged that Domitilla Garza and Norma Solis<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> offered Elizabeth Yarberry a food voucher if she would vote for Gilberto Uresti. Domitilla Garza was convicted on the substantive count that formed the basis for the alleged overt act. If the evidence is sufficient to support Garza\u2019s conviction on the substantive count, it is necessarily sufficient to establish the overt act that supports the convictions of Garza, Saenz, and Garcia on the conspiracy count. We have previously concluded that the evidence is sufficient to support Garza\u2019s conviction on the substantive count in Part 1(a) of this opinion. As in <em>Fuiman, </em>the Government has shown that \u201cat least one conspirator committed at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d 546 F.2d at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Saenz further argues that because Elizabeth Yarberry could not vote for Saenz because she .lived in a different precinct, an overt act to buy her vote for Gilberto Uresti cannot be used to support a conspiracy conviction against Saenz. Saenz misapprehends the law of conspiracy. The Government is not required to prove that Saenz had knowledge of all the details of the conspiracy, provided the Government establishes his knowledge of the essentials of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>625 F.2d 1196, 1198 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 938, 101 S.Ct. 2017, 68 L.Ed.2d 324 (1981). <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>732 F.2d 1536 (5th Cir.1984). There was testimony at trial from which the jury could infer Saenz\u2019s knowledge of this conspiracy. Rafaela Torrez testified that Saenz told her that two welfare vouchers were given to Torrez because of her vote.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Additionally, Josie and Manuel Arredondo testified that Saenz, while campaigning, offered to help Manuel Arredondo find a job and offered them a food voucher.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Saenz\u2019s argument that the overt act proven must have benefited him personally in his re-election bid is simply incorrect. From the testimony before the court, a reasonable juror could infer that Saenz knew that the essentials of the conspiracy involved buying votes with welfare vouchers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Domitilla Garza argues that the evidence was insufficient to show her knowing participation in the vote buying conspiracy. The Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew of the essential nature of the conspiracy and intended to join or associate with the objective of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Fowler, </em>735 F.2d 823, 826 (5th Cir.1984). <em>See United States v. Montemayor, </em>703 F.2d 109, 115 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014-, 104 S.Ct. 89, 78 L.Ed.2d 97 (1983). It is not necessary to prove that the defendant was familiar with every single detail of the conspiracy in order to prove intent, but the Government must show knowledge of the conspiratorial agreement and association with the plan. <em>United States v. Fernandez-Roque, </em>703 F.2d 808, 814-15 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Fowler, </em>735 F.2d at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">Contrary to Garza\u2019s contentions, the evidence amply demonstrates her knowing participation in the conspiracy. First, Garza played a central role in soliciting Yarberry\u2019s vote. <em>See supra </em>Part 1(a). In addition, Candula Torres, a former employee of the Duval County Welfare Office responsible for issuing vouchers during the pendancy of this campaign, testified that during the primary campaign she discussed the distribution of welfare vouchers with Garza, Judge Uresti, and Amelia Garcia.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, Torres testified that Garza, on several occasions, referred to welfare recipients who were \u201call right\u201d because they were voting the right way, and they should be \u201chelped\u201d by issuing vouchers to them.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> From this testimony, the jury could infer that Garza knowingly participated in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">The Government has met its burden as to all three defendants (Saenz, Garcia, and Garza) on the conspiracy counts. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Bell, </em>678 F.2d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">III. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Appellants contend that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct throughout the trial was so outrageous that this Court must reverse- for prosecutorial misconduct. Appellants argue that the prosecutor (1) impermissibly vouched for the credibility of the Government\u2019s witnesses and the integrity of the prosecution, (2) sought to inflame the passions of the jury, (3) personally attacked the defendants by arguing that they showed contempt for the Government\u2019s witnesses and by intimating that defendants would intimidate the Government\u2019s witnesses once the case was over, and (4) attacked defense counsel for objecting at trial to the admission of evidence. This Court agrees with appellants that some of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper, but we hold that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was not so egregious that reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">In <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>731 F.2d 1150, 1152 (5th Cir.1984), this Court recently reiterated the test for prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-8\">As the Supreme Court observed nearly a half century ago, the prosecutor \u201cmay prosecute with earnestness and vigor\u2014 indeed, he should do so. But while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed.2d 1314 (1935). To determine whether the prosecutor violated this rule, the reviewing court \u201cmust weight the degree to which the alleged improper argument may have affected the substantial rights of the defendants.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhoden, </em>453 F.2d 598, 600 (5th Cir.1972). Pertinent factors include: (1) the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the statements, (2) the efficacy of any cautionary instructions, and (3) the strength of the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">Allegedly improper prosecutorial comments must be considered in context when determining their propriety. <em>See United States v. Bursten, </em>453 F.2d 605, 608 (5th Cir.1971), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>409 U.S. 843, 93 S.Ct. 44, 34 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972); <em>United States v. Bright, </em>630 F.2d 804, 824 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-17\">After reviewing the context of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, we conclude that the majority of his questioned comments fall into the category of \u201cinvited response.\u201d <em>Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 339, 359-60 n. 15, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Shackelford, </em>709 F.2d 911, 913 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 253, 78 L.Ed.2d 239 (1983); <em>United States v. Bright, </em>630 F.2d at 824. A prosecutor may respond in rebuttal to improper arguments by defense counsel, even though such a response might not be permissible in the absence of provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-20\">This case was obviously hard fought by all parties. The closing arguments reflect this battle. One defense counsel argued that the prosecution had intimidated witnesses,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and coached witnesses like mechanics.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He argued that the prosecutor was unfair,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> untruthful,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> had \u201cabused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>system,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> had attempted to hide an unfavorable exhibit at trial,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and had put people on trial who were not there to defend themselves.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> He concluded with the following attack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-4\">I can\u2019t respond to Mr. Wolfe. He is a good lawyer. He is going to come up and say all kinds of things about me. I will tell you one thing, I am looking' at him eyeball to eyeball and I\u2019ll tell you, Jack Wolfe, you were not fair with Olga Uresti.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-5\">... I am telling you right now, you played dirty in this case. And that\u2019s not right. You have abused your privilege as an Assistant United States Attorney. She is not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Record Vol. VIII at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Another defense counsel argued that the prosecutor was an \u201cunfair man,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and also insinuated that the prosecutor was not acting in good faith.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Defense counsel asserted that the witnesses were \u201cprogrammed,\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> while another argued that it was \u201cvery easy to get these people to admit something when they are being asked.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Defense counsel directly attacked the credibility of the Government\u2019s witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-19\">I can\u2019t recall the evidence in this first case and I \u25a0 was taking notes, and you expect these ladies, who have been sick, who didn\u2019t make a mental notation, who don\u2019t know how to write their names, to remember, remember very clearly in their minds, <em>without coaching, </em>that something happened a year-and-a-half ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-20\">I am not trying to knock anybody down, but I will tell you one thing, they sure have some sharp minds around here. Those folks can remember a lot of things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">Record Vol. VIII at 1265-66 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-22\">In light of these personal attacks on the prosecutor and the direct attacks alleging that the witnesses\u2019 testimony was programmed, the result of intimidation, and not credible the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal statements, while not to be condoned, do not rise to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-23\">In <em>United States v. Bright, </em>this Court stated the parameters of the rule forbidding counsel to personally vouch for the credibility of witnesses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-24\">While it is true a prosecutor may not vouch for the credibility of witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>based on facts personally known to the prosecutor but not introduced at trial, ... that does not mean the prosecutor cannot argue that the fair inference from the facts presented is that a witness has no reason to lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-5\">... The prosecutor is not obliged to sit quietly while character assaults \u2022 are made on his witnesses; he is entitled to argue fairly their credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\"><em>630 </em>F.2d at 824 (citations omitted). Where defense counsel \u201cattacks the prosecutor, [or] his witnesses, ... the prosecutor, as an advocate, is entitled to make a fair response in rebuttal.\u201d <em>United States v.

Shackelford, </em>709 F.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">The appellants challenge the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defense lawyers were better attorneys, and that if it was a contest between lawyers, the prosecutor would lose.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This is a direct response to defense counsel\u2019s statement that the prosecutor is \u201ca good lawyer,\u201d who was going to tell them many things about the defendants and defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">The prosecutor continued by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-9\">You know what I had going for me in this case, ladies and gentlemen? At one time I think there were seven attorneys plus three helpers. They had ten attorneys in the courtroom. Here was me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">Record Vol. VIII at 1279-80. Appellants rely on <em>United States v. Mack, </em>643 F.2d 1119 (5th Cir.1981), for the proposition that this statement was improper. As in <em>Mack, </em>we agree that this statement was improper. As in <em>Mack, </em>however, we also find it does not mandate reversal. In both that case and the instant case, the jury was aware from the beginning of the trial that there were a number of defense lawyers in the courtroom. 643 F.2d at 1124. As we stated then, \u201cWhile the prosecutor\u2019s remark falls somewhat short of the high level of evenhandedness expected of those responsible for prosecutions in United States courts, any error in the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, this was a fair rejoinder to defense counsel\u2019s argument that the prosecutor had all the resources of the FBI and Texas Rangers at his disposal.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-18\">In light of defense counsels\u2019 arguments that the Government\u2019s witnesses were coached, programmed, and intimidated, the prosecutor\u2019s statements vouching for his witnesses and asserting their bravery were fair responses. The prosecutor argued they were not programmed as demonstrated by their human mistakes,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and by their testimony that exculpated some of the defendants.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Defense counsel argued that the Government had intimidated its witnesses. In response, the prosecutor argued just the opposite, that the witnesses might be subject to as much or more intimidation at home.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Appellants further argue that the prosecutor suggested that defense counsel was attempting to confuse the jury and keep the truth from it by objecting to evidence.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> They argue this amounts to reversible error. See <em>Houston v. Estelle, </em>569 F.2d 372 (5th Cir.1978). We disagree. Defense counsel accused the prosecutor of hiding evidence.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The prosecutor merely countered the attack. Consequently, <em>Houston </em>is inapplicable. Moreover, the court stated to the jury that defense counsel must object in order to preserve issues for appeal.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Appellants also argue that the prosecutor suggested that he only prosecuted the guilty.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The defense, however, had directly attacked the prosecutor\u2019s integrity in maintaining the prosecution, and had accused the prosecutor of abusing the system. The prosecutor\u2019s statement was made in defense of his decision to prosecute, which had been directly attacked. As such, it is not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">One remark by the prosecution bears further discussion. The prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-6\">Mr. Wolfe: You all have been working here every day this week and you have been going home every night and probably watched a little news and stuff. And you know there have been some events going on in the world that\u2019s pretty serious. You know that the Russians have been accused of shooting down a Korean jetliner. And I don\u2019t know how many innocent people died in that crash and everything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-7\">But Friday night after I got home after the trial and I am watching the news and I am seeing what\u2019s going on and they are asking the Russians about it, and you know what the Russians are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-12\">Mr. Canales: I object to counsel trying to characterize these Defendants as Russians or any type of analogy or anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-13\">The court: Remember my instructions. Objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-14\">Mr. Wolfe: What did the Russians say? \u201cWell, it is not our fault. It is the Americans\u2019 fault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-15\">Just like these Defendants said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it. It is the Ranger\u2019s fault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-16\">Mr. Canales: I object to it again, Your Honor. Characterizing our clients as the Russians, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-17\">The court: The objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-18\">Mr. Wolfe: We then asked them about it, they said, \u201cNo, no, we didn\u2019t do it. We didn\u2019t have anything to do with that airplane being shot down.\u201d And they are blaming it on everybody else but themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-19\">Record Yol. VIII at 1296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-20\">The Government admits that this rhetoric was improper. We agree. Contrary to appellants\u2019 contentions, however, we do not find reversible error. As we stated in <em>McPhee, </em>we must weigh the degree to which the alleged improper argument may have affected the substantial rights of the defendants. 731 F.2d at 1152. \u25a0 To do so, we must look at (1) the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the statements, (2) the efficacy of any cautionary instructions, and (3) the strength of the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-21\">First, we must determine the prejudicial effect of the statement on the jury. That the jury was not inflamed is demonstrated by the fact that one defendant was acquitted on all charges and three other defendants acquitted on at least one charge. This indicates to us that the jury carefully weighed the evidence against each defendant, acquitting when the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>dence was insufficient. This reflects a logical approach to the deliberations, inconsistent with passion or prejudice. Second, the court repeatedly instructed the jury that the arguments of counsel were not evidence.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This Court has held that such an instruction is sufficient to protect a defendant\u2019s rights. <em>See United States v. Shackelford, </em>709 F.2d at 913; <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>701 F.2d 367, 391-92 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1419, 79 L.Ed.2d 744 (1983). Finally, the evidence sufficiently supports each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Moreover, the prosecution was responding to defense assertions that the prosecutor was abusing the system. In response, the prosecutor argued that such a line of attack was merely a way of passing the blame to the prosecutor and the investigators, in the same manner that the Russians tried to place the blame for the airliner attack on the Americans. The prosecutor\u2019s unfortunate comparison cannot be condoned, but it does not reach the level of reversible error when taken in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">IV. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AU2\">To establish a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973i(c), the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an offer to pay or payment for registering to vote or voting and that the election involved was held in part for the purpose of selecting a candidate for federal office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-10\"><em>Provided, however, </em>That this provision shall be applicable only to general, special, or primary elections held solely or in part for the purpose of selecting or electing any candidate for the office of President, Vice President, presidential elector, Member of the United States Senate, Member of the United States House of Representatives, Delegate from the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, or Resident Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973i(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-17\">This Court has recognized that vote buying in a local election is covered by \u00a7 1973i(c) if candidates for federal office appear on the same ballot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-18\">When candidates for federal office appear on the same election-day ballot with the local candidates who have been the target of illegal vote-buying activities, the Necessary and Proper Clause affords Congress ample power to regulate conduct in the pendant state election to exclude the possibility of tainting, distorting or otherwise unfairly affecting the results of a federal election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-19\"><em>United States v. Garcia, </em>719 F.2d 99, 102 (5th Cir.1983). <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>636 F.2d 1003, 1011 (5th Cir.1981). <em>See United States v. Malmay, </em>671 F.2d 869, 874-75 (5th Cir.1982). <em>Accord, United States v. Carmichael, </em>685 F.2d 903, 908 (4th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1202, 103 S.Ct. 1187, 75 L.Ed.2d 434 (1983).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-20\">The district court recognized that the Government must prove that a federal election was involved in order to reach the conduct at issue here. The Government did so by introducing a copy of the ballot from the May 1, 1982, primary. In instructing the jury on the section 1973i(c) requirement of a federal election, the court stated that it did not think there was any question that federal candidates appeared on the May 1,1982, primary ballot in Duval County.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In a supplemental instruction<footnotemark>40</footnotemark>, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>the court stated that it was not in issue that federal candidates were on the. May 1, 1982, primary ballot. The appellants argue that these instructions impermissibly directed a verdict as to an essential element of the offense. <em>See United States v. Burton, </em>737 F.2d 439 (5th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>718 F.2d 1317, 1320-21 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc). To direct a verdict in whole or in part is plain error.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Brown, </em>555 F.2d 407, 421 n. 31 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 1448, 55 L.Ed.2d 494 (1977). <em>See Connecticut v. Johnson, </em>460 U.S. 73, 103 S.Ct. 969, 976, 74 L.Ed.2d 823, 832 (1983). We disagree with appellants\u2019 contentions that -this instruction amounted to a partial directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Appellants argue that two of the alleged solicitations raised the issue of which of several elections was the target of vote buying activities. Garza claimed that she contacted Yarberry about voting in a school board election, in which case, the ballot would not contain the name of a federal candidate. Defendant Garcia testified she took Alaniz to vote on only one occasion. That occasion involved Oscar Garcia\u2019s campaign in the runoff election, and there were no federal candidates on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Appellants\u2019 claims fail for two reasons. First, at most, the trial court stated that it was not in issue that federal candidates\u2019 names appeared on the May 1, 1982, ballot. That did not preclude appellants from arguing, or the jury from finding in any particular instance, that vote buying occurred in an altogether different nonfederal election from the May 1, 1982, primary. In fact, defense counsel so argued in closing argument. The court so instructed when it stated that \u201cin order for this to be a violation of law somebody must have paid or offered to pay for a vote <em>at that election \u2019&gt; </em><footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">Furthermore, taking the court\u2019s instructions as a whole, it clearly instructed the jury that it must find that a federal election was involved. The charge included these instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-14\">One, that it was a Federal \u2014 it was an election which somebody was running for Federal office. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-15\">Two, all right, that the defendant in his or her own right, or as I have defined it to you, okay, by aiding and abetting, paid or offered to pay a person for voting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-16\">And, three, that it was done knowingly, or wilfully. Those are the three elements of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-17\">Now, as to Counts 2 through 8, <em>if you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that those three elements, all of them, are proven to your satisfaction, </em>as would regard each one of the allegations, ... if you are not satisfied by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that that person did that, as I have defined it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>to you, <em>then you should find them not guilty.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Record Vol. VIII at 1320-21 (emphasis, added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The court\u2019s statement that it was not in issue that federal candidates were on the ballot was no more than a comment on the evidence. Federal courts are allowed to comment on the evidence. As the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-7\">It is within [the trial judge\u2019s] province, whenever he thinks it necessary, to assist the jury in arriving at a just conclusion by explaining and commenting upon the evidence, ... provided he makes it clear to the jury that all matters of fact are submitted to their determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhpX\"><em>Quercia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S.Ct. 698, 699, 77 L.Ed.2d 1321 (1933). <em>United States v. James, </em>576 F.2d 223 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">We find that the court was merely commenting on the weight of the evidence. The court clearly instructed the jurors that they were to be the only fact finders and that they must find all three elements of this offense were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, the court instructed the jury to disregard anything that might cause them to believe the Judge had an opinion in the case. The court's instructions, taken as a whole, were not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">V. EVIDENTIARY CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"AXh\">Appellant Garcia claims that the court admitted prejudicial hearsay statements over objection, and admitted documentary evidence without a proper predicate. Garcia also contends that the court improperly allowed testimony by Alba Garcia that she was convicted of vote buying for the opposition party. We find, after considering each of these issues, that no substantial right of the defendants is affected, and therefore any error is harmless error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1). Appellant Garza\u2019s contention that the court did not make the appropriate findings under <em>United States v. James, </em>590 F.2d 575 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 917, 99 S.Ct. 2836, 61 L.Ed.2d 283 (1979), or <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>700 F.2d 205 (5th Cir.1983) are without foundation. We have considered all other arguments by appellants and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">The evidence is sufficient to support each conviction. Additionally, any improper prosecutorial conduct did not rise to the level of reversible error. The district court\u2019s instructions preserved each element of the offense charged. Finding no reversible error, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973i(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-12\">(c) Whoever knowingly or willfully gives false information as to his name, address, or period of residence in the voting district for the purpose of establishing his eligibility to register or vote, or conspires with another individual for the purpose of encouraging his false registration to vote or illegal voting, or pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both: <em>Provided, however, </em>That this provision shall be applicable only to general, special, or primary elections held solely or in part for the purpose of selecting or electing any candidate for the office of President, Vice President, presidential elector, Member of the United States Senate, Member of the United States House of Representatives, Delegate from the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, or Resident Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-14\">If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons [do] any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-20\">If, however, the offense, the commission of which is the object of the conspiracy, is a misdemeanor only, the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 372 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-21\">If two or more persons in any State, Territory, Possession, or District conspire to prevent, by force, intimidation, or threat, any person from accepting or holding any office, trust, or place of confidence under the United States, or from discharging any duties thereof, or to induce by like means any officer of the United States to leave the place, where his duties as an officer are required to be performed, or to injure him in his p\u00e9rson or property on account of his lawful discharge of the duties of his office, or while engaged in the lawful discharge thereof, or to injure his property so as to molest, interrupt, hinder, or impede him in the discharge of his official duties, each of such persons shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than six years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">.
