Jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of this appeal is asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Food Fair, Inc., the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor, operated a chain of grocery stores in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Beginning in 1959, Food Fair, pursuant to its collective bargaining agreements, began contributing to the Retail Clerks Tri-State Pension Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d). In 1979, as part of a bankruptcy reorganization, the 101 stores in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were closed. This left, in the geographic area covered by the Fund, only the 5 Delaware stores. In 1981, those 5 stores were also closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Upon the closing of the Delaware stores, the Fund determined that Pantry Pride Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cPantry Pride\u201d), Food Fair\u2019s successor in interest, had withdrawn from the pension plan and was liable to the Fund under the MPPAA for its share of the Fund\u2019s total unfunded vested benefits. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 (1982). The Fund calculated Pantry Pride\u2019s share to be $20,935,-000, payable in 79 monthly installments of $326,379.16 and a final payment of $107,-972.06. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1399(b)(1), the Fund demanded that Pantry Pride pay the withdrawal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Pantry Pride brought this action in the district court for a declaratory judgment that the MPPAA was unconstitutional. Although the Act requires arbitration of disputes arising over withdrawal liability, the district court, upon motion by Pantry Pride, stayed arbitration pending the resolution of the constitutional challenge in accordance with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Republic Industries v. Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund, </em>693 F.2d 290 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The Fund then filed a motion with the district court asking, <em>inter alia, </em>that Pantry Pride be required to pay the withdrawal liability to the Fund during the pendency of the litigation in accordance with the previously calculated schedule. The district court denied this motion in part, limiting the payments required to $15,000 per month. The Fund appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">III. APPEALABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"Atz\">Pantry Pride contends that the order of the district court was not appealable as either a final decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, or as an interlocutory order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">An interlocutory order \u201cgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing, or dissolving injunctions\u201d is appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). In determining whether an order is appealable as an order refusing an injunction, there are two requirements. First, the order must have the effect of refusing an injunction. <em>Carson v. American Brands, Inc., </em>450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981). Second, the appeal must \u201cfurther the statutory purpose of 'permitting] litigants to effectively challenge interlocutory orders of serious, perhaps irreparable consequence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, </em>348 U.S. 176, 181, 75 S.Ct. 249, 252, 99 L.Ed. 233 (1955)).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">The district court\u2019s order refused, in part, the Fund\u2019s motion for an injunction to compel the interim payment of withdrawal liability. Although the language of the Fund\u2019s motion did not use the word \u201cinjunction,\u201d this court must look to the substance of the request, rather than rely only on its language in determining whether an order is an appealable denial of an injunction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>Insurance Co., </em>317 U.S. 188, 192, 63 S.Ct. 163, 164, 87 L.Ed. 176 (1942) (interpreting a predecessor to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1)). In this case, the Fund requested, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court compel Pantry Pride to make future payments according to the schedule in its prior demand which, construed liberally, is a request for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Also, the denial of the claim to interim withdrawal benefits is a serious one. Congress believed that it was important to insure that the flow of employer withdrawal liability payments was not delayed by an employer disputing liability. See Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Summary and Analysis of S. 1076, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>Special Supp. 310, Pens.Rep. (BNA) 81, 84-85 (1980); H.R.Rep. No. 869, 96th Cong.2d Sess. 84, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code &amp; Cong. Ad.News 2918, 2952 (payments should continue despite litigation). Further, the loss of the important statutory right to interim payments cannot be effectively reviewed once a final order has been made. If no interlocutory review were possible, the Fund could effectively lose its statutory protection against interruptions in the pre-arbitration flow of contributions that Congress mandated through the interim liability provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The order, insofar as it refuses, in part, the request for interim payments,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is reviewable as an interlocutory order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (1982). Because of our resolution of the appealability issue, we need not reach the contention that the order was appealable as a collateral final order under the doctrine of <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Although we are satisfied that the order denying the Fund\u2019s claim to equitable relief is properly appealable, we do not believe that the district court should have considered the Fund\u2019s motion for affirmative relief in its present procedural posture. The Fund has not filed any counterclaim, and, in these circumstances, is not entitled to seek affirmative relief until it has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">It is true that the federal courts have abandoned the strict pleading requirements of the common law, and the district court may, in certain cases, liberally construe a pleading, or in this case a motion, to state a complaint or counterclaim. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c), 8(f). <em>See also, Cooper v. Anderson, </em>277 F.2d 449 (5th Cir.1960) (failure to plead a counterclaim is not fatal when evidence introduced reveals a counterclaim and the issue is tried without objection). However, the policy favoring liberal construction does not take precedence over potential prejudice to the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">Pantry Pride may have been under the erroneous assumption that the Fund made a motion for security under Rule 65(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The issue of security, however, is separate from, and independent of, the question of whether the Fund has a right to interim payments under the MPPAA. Because of its erroneous assumption, Pantry Pride did not have an opportunity to respond to the motion as a counterclaim and may not have raised all of its defenses, if any,. to the Fund\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Under the circumstances, we cannot say that Pantry Pride was not prejudiced. We believe that in this case the district court should have required that the Fund comply fully with the rules of procedure before affording any relief. Although requiring that a claim for interim payments be filed as a complaint or counterclaim may have the unfortunate effect of delaying payment to the Fund, the rights involved in this case are significant enough to require that a court have the requisite pleadings and record before adjudicating the merits of the claim to interim withdrawal payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The order of the district court will be vacated, and the case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The mandate will issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\">. Pantry Pride also contends that the appeal was \u25a0untimely because the notice of appeal was filed more than 60 days after the district court announced orally that the motion would be denied in part. The time to appeal, however, runs from the date that the order is put in writing and entered on the court\u2019s docket. <em>See United States v. Indrelunas, </em>411 U.S. 216, 93 S.Ct. 1562, 36 L.Ed.2d 202 (1973). The Fund\u2019s notice of appeal filed on November 3, 1983 was clearly timely with respect to the court\u2019s order which was first written and entered on October 6, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-15\">. The court also thought it was entering an injunction:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">[counsel for Fund]: Your Honor, may I ask that the Court grant permission that we be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>have an interlocutory appeal on an expedited basis on this?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">THE COURT: I would be happy to do that.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">So I invite you [counsel for the Fund] to prepare [the order] the way you think best. If you prepare it under 1292(b), which is where I certify that the issue is dispositive of crucial matters in the case, that might be a problem because I am not sure I could certify that in good conscience. But if you frame the bond, the grant of their motion in terms of preliminary equitable relief, I believe you have a direct right of appeal from that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">[counsel for Fund]: We\u2019ll submit a proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Ill App. at 179-180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-11\">. The Fund also requested interest, liquidated damages, and attorney\u2019s fees in its motion. Because of our disposition of the claim to interim withdrawal payments, <em>infra, </em>it is not necessary to reach the issue of whether the denial of these requests is appealable under section 1291 or 1292(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b247-19\">. Pantry Pride in its brief before this court characterizes the Fund\u2019s motion as a one for security under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(c). Before the district court, Pantry Pride also appeared to believe that the issue was one of security:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-20\">THE COURT: The next issue is: Where do we stand here on payments and security?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-21\">[Counsel for Pantry Pride]: ... we are willing to put that up as a bond in <em>Republic, </em>as we mentioned to Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-22\">THE COURT: You suggest that you do this, you want to put this in some kind of escrow fund and have it earn interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>[Counsel for Pantry Pride]: That would be fine with us.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">THE COURT: All right. What else is before me?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Ill App. at 143-44. Our decision does not require us to address the serious issue raised by the Fund that a substitution of security for the interim payments may be inconsistent with the Congressional mandate in the MPPAA that the full interim payments be made to the Fund. <em>Cf. Republic Industries, </em>693 F.2d at 298.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b248-8\">JAMES HUNTER, III, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">1. The majority opinion finds that the Fund\u2019s request for interim payments of withdrawal liability was a prayer for injunctive relief, and therefore that the district court\u2019s order denying that relief was appealable, by looking \u201cto the substance of the request, rather than relypng] only on its language ____\u201d Yet the majority applies a rule of strict construction to find that the very same request was not a counterclaim, and therefore that the Fund is entitled to no affirmative relief. I find this disturbing, not only because it contravenes the cardinal principle that pleadings are to be \u201cconstrued so as to\u201d do substantial justice,\u201d <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(f), but particularly because in this case it facilitates the very evil that the interim payment provisions of the Multi-employer Pension Plan Amendments Act (\u201cMPPAA\u201d) were designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">2. A claim for relief in federal court need only contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and a demand for judgment for the relief to which he deems himself entitled.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). The Fund\u2019s motion for interim payments very clearly meets this standard, both requesting the payments and setting forth the statutory and factual bases for the claim. <em>See </em>II App. at 219-21. Pleadings are to be judged by their substance, not their form, and therefore, the \u201cpurely procedural matter of denomination will not be permitted to interfere with the determination of substantive rights____\u201d <em>De Vito v. Hoffman, </em>199 F.2d 468, 469 (D.C.Cir.1952). <em>See, e.g., United States v. White County Bridge Commission, </em>275 F.2d 529, 535 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Clippinger v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 818, 81 S.Ct. 50, 5 L.Ed.2d 48 (1960); <em>Goulding v. Sands, </em>237 F.Supp. 577, 578 (W.D.Pa.1965), <em>aff'd, </em>355 F.2d 230 (3d Cir.1966). The majority concedes this, yet regards the Fund\u2019s request as a nullity merely because it was denominated \u201cmotion\u201d instead of \u201ccounterclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">3. According to the majority, this technicalism is mandated by the prejudice that would inure to Pantry Pride if the motion were treated as a counterclaim. As evidence of this prejudice, the majority points to Pantry Pride\u2019s attempts here and in the district court to characterize the motion as one for security. Because this character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ization was necessary for Pantry Pride\u2019s argument that no appealable order existed here, it can hardly be taken as evidence that Pantry Pride was actually prejudiced in its ability to defend against the motion in the district court. Similarly, merely because Pantry Pride, relying on dictum in <em>Republic Industries, </em>693 F.2d 290, 298 (3d Cir.1982), moved the district court to substitute a bond for the interim payments does not indicate that Pantry Pride lacked notice of the nature of the relief that the Fund was requesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">4. More fundamentally, the search for actual prejudice to Pantry Pride is doomed to failure. The lack of a full volley of pleadings and a record that the majority deems so fatally prejudicial simply could not have harmed Pantry Pride\u2019s ability to defend against the motion. This is so because no defense to a motion for interim payments under MPPAA is cognizable in the first instance before the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">5. The statutory language that creates interim withdrawal liability is mandatory: \u201cwithdrawal liability <em>shall </em>be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor ... notwithstanding any request' for review ...,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1399(c)(2) (1982) (emphasis supplied); \u201c[payments <em>shall </em>be made by an employer in accordance with the determinations made [by a plan] until the arbitrator issues a final decision ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1401(d) (emphasis supplied). This language makes clear that, until an employer\u2019s withdrawal liability is determined through arbitration, the court has no discretion to do anything other than order interim payments in accordance with the Fund\u2019s demand. In essence, an action to enforce a pension fund\u2019s demand for payments of withdrawal liability <em>pendente lite </em>is akin to an action to enforce a judgment already rendered. <em>See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A. Gray Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 104 S.Ct. 2709, 2720, 81 L.Ed.2d 601 (1984) (withdrawal liability provisions of MPPAA effect no taking from _ employers because \u201cbenefits ... have already vested with the employees at the time of the employer\u2019s withdrawal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">6. This is not to say that MPPAA leaves employers without recourse against unreasonable or inaccurate demands for interim payments of withdrawal liability. A demand for interim payments of withdrawal liability is made under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1399, and is therefore itself subject to arbitral review for unreasonableness or clear error. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(3)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An employer may also bring an action in court for review of the decision in such an arbitration. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1401(b)(2). Where, however, as here, the employer forgoes the right to arbitrate the demand, \u201cthe amounts demanded by the plan sponsor under section 1399(b)(1) shall be due and owing ... and the plan sponsor may bring an action in a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction for collection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1401(b)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In such a case, the court must enforce the fund\u2019s demand. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1399(c)(2), 1401(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>7. As the majority recognizes, the requirement that employers make interim payments of withdrawal liability was intended to protect pension funds and their beneficiaries from interruptions in the flow of contributions during the pendency of employer challenges to fund demands. <em>See </em>Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, <em>Summary and Analysis of S. 1076, </em>96th Cong., 1st Sess. (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>310 Pens.Rep. (BNA) 81, 84 (1980). Specifically, Congress was aware that the financial integrity of pension funds, and therefore \u201cthe well-being and security of millions of employees, retirees, and their dependents,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001a(a)(3), would be at risk if employers appealing determinations of withdrawal liability could profit financially from engaging in dilatory litigation tactics. The interim payment provisions are but one device in a scheme designed to place upon employers the costs of delaying ultimate determinations of withdrawal liability. <em>See </em>Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, <em>supra, </em>at 84-85 (discussing interim withdrawal liability and statutory presumptions in favor of pension funds).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">8. Despite its recognition of this important congressional policy, the majority in this case countenances the continuation of a situation of precisely the sort that MPPAA\u2019s interim payment provisions were designed to prevent. Pantry Pride has been permitted to evade making payments of withdrawal liability since its withdrawal from the Fund in 1981. Meanwhile, the Fund is experiencing grave financial distress, due in part to the shortfall in contributions caused by the closing of Pantry Pride\u2019s stores. <em>See </em>II App. at 277-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">9. Because the majority reaches this concededly \u201cunfortunate\u201d result by adhering to a long-disfavored insistence upon procedural rigor, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\">. Arbitration on a question of interim liability would be permissible even where arbitration on ultimate liability is stayed under our decision in <em>Republic Industries. </em>As that decision recognized, <em>see </em>693 F.2d at 298, the issues of interim liability and ultimate liability are completely extricable. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(d) (providing that the amount of withdrawal liability ultimately assessed against an employer be adjusted for overpayments or underpayments <em>pendente lite </em>).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-10\">. The thrust of Pantry Pride\u2019s arguments in this appeal has been to invite this court to create a judicially enforceable reasonableness requirement for fund demands <em>pendente lite. </em>There would seem to be little need for such an innovation, given the opportunities for review provided by the statute. However, even if this court were to recognize a judicial power to review fund demands in the first instance, the judgment of the district court should be reversed. In deciding to deny in part the Fund\u2019s request for interim relief, the district court seems to have been concerned primarily with the effect the demand might have on Pantry Pride\u2019s finances. <em>See </em>III App. at 163. While this solicitude might have been commendable in another context, it is not a permissible basis for a court\u2019s decision in a case under MPPAA. Concern for the fiscal well-being of employers, particularly at the expense of pension funds and their beneficiaries, is conspicuously absent from MPPAA and its legislative history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">. I concur with the majority\u2019s holding that that Fund's entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees and interest on delinquent payments should not be reached on this appeal. The order from which the Fund appeals dealt only with Pantry Pride's interim withdrawal liability, and deferred all other matters. Ill App. at 184. Thus the Fund's entitlement to fees and interest is not properly raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
