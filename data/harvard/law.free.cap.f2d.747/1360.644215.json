We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-9\">On August 28, 1974, Willie M. Walker filed a complaint alleging racial discrimination against him by appellee, The Jim Dandy Company (Jim Dandy). In this complaint, appellants, Willie Rhoades and Bobbie P. Lowery, females, also alleged that Jim Dandy engaged in sexual discriminatory employment practices in its refusal to' hire them. Rhoades and Lowery sought to represent a class of females similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-10\">On May 25, 1977, the district court entered an order denying appellants\u2019 motions for class certification. In doing so, the court held that appellants had not established that the class was so numerous that joinder of all members was impractical, or that questions of law or fact existed common to the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">The district court granted Jim Dandy\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment against Walker. In addition, the court concluded that Walker\u2019s section 1981 suit was barred by the statute of limitations, and that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear Walker\u2019s Title VII claim. Therefore, oniy the individual claims of Rhoades and Lowery were tried. The district court entered a final judgment for Jim Dandy against. Walker, Rhoades, and Lowery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-15\">. On appeal, the former Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s decision concerning Walker's Title VII claim, and affirmed the judgment of the district court on Rhoades\u2019s and Lowery\u2019s individual claims. In addition, the former Fifth Circuit remanded the class certification issue for further consideration. <em>Walker v. The Jim Dandy Co., </em>638 F.2d 1330, 1336 (5th Cir.1981). Subsequently, on December 16, 1982, appellant, Elizabeth Pruitt, pursuant to Rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, filed a motion for permissive intervention as a party plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-17\">On remand, the district court scheduled a class certification hearing for January 6, 1983. At this hearing, the district court refused to certify the class and dismissed, with prejudice, the individual claims of appellants, Rhoades and Lowery. The court also denied appellant, Elizabeth Pruitt\u2019s, motion to intervene individually and on behalf of all female applicants for employment, all female employees of Jim Dandy, and all females who would have applied for employment with Jim Dandy. The court tried Walker\u2019s claim on its merits and dismissed it for lack of evidence of discrimination. No racial discrimination claims remain in the lawsuit. This appeal ensued upon certification pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-19\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-20\">I. Class Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-21\">Appellants\u2019 first contention is that the district court, 97 F.R.D. 505, erred in refusing to certify this action as a class action. \u201c[A] Title VII class action, like any other class action, may only be certified if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> have been satisfied.\u201d <em>General Tele</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number><em>phone Co. v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 2373, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982). It has long been the law that questions concerning class certification are left to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>Freeman v. Motor Convoy, Inc., </em>700 F.2d 1339, 1347 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Zeidman v. </em>J. <em>Ray McDermott &amp; Co., Inc., </em>651 F.2d 1030, 1038-39 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-4\">Accordingly, this court will not reverse a district court\u2019s decision on class certification absent an abuse of its discretion. <em>Ezell v. Mobile Housing Board, </em>709 F.2d 1376, 1379 (11th Cir.1983). In light of these principles, we review the certification ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">A litigant seeking to maintain a class action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17 (West 1981), must meet \u201cthe prerequisites of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation\u201d specified in rule 23(a). <em>General Telephone Co. of Northwest v. EEOC, </em>446 U.S. 318, 330, 100 S.Ct. 1698, 1706, 64 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980). For all practical purposes, these requirements effectively \u201climit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the \u25a0 named plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d <em>General Telephone Co., </em>446 U.S. at 330, 100 S.Ct. at 1706.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">In resolving this class certification issue, the district court correctly concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>General Telephone Company of Southwest v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982), controls. Mariano Falcon was a Mexican-American employee of General Telephone of Southwest. He brought suit under Title VII challenging the hiring and promotion practices of his employer. Falcon individually claimed that the company refused to promote him because of his national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-14\">The district court determined that Falcon was a proper representative for the class. The court thereafter certified the class as all Mexican-Amerieans who had applied for employment or were employed by the company in a specified division. The former Fifth Circuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the class. <em>Falcon v. General Telephone Co. of Southwest, </em>626 F.2d 369, 376 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-15\">The Supreme Court, however, granted certiorari to decide whether the class action was properly maintained on behalf of both employees who were denied promotion and applicants who were denied employment. In resolving this issue, the Court stated that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint provided an insufficient basis for determining whether the adjudication of his discrimination in promotion claim would require the resolution of any common question of law or fact concerning the failure of the employer to hire more Mexican-Americans. The Court concluded that the district court erred in finding that Falcon\u2019s claim was typieal of other claims against the employer by Mexican-American employees and applicants, without pinpointing questions of law or fact that were common to the claims of Falcon and the members of the potential class. <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 158-59, 102 S.Ct. at 2371-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-16\">While deciding <em>Falcon, </em>the Court also examined its prior decision in <em>East Texas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number><em>Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. 395, 97 S.Ct. 1891, 52 L.Ed.2d 453 (1977). <em>Rodriguez </em>was a Title VII action brought by three Mexican-American city truck drivers. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit certified a class composed of the trucking company\u2019s black and Mexican-American city drivers allegedly denied, on racial or ethnic grounds, promotions to more coveted line-driver positions. On review, the Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals \u201cplainly erred in declaring a class action.\" <em>Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. at 403, 97 S.Ct. at 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">The Court based this holding on the fact that the named plaintiffs were not qualified for line-driver positions when the class was certified. Therefore, they could have suffered no injury as a result of the allegedly, discriminatory practices; thus, they were simply not eligible to represent a class of persons who did allegedly suffer injury. <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 156, 102 S.Ct. at 2370 (quoting <em>Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. at 403-04, 97 S.Ct. at 1896-97). After noting that the holding in <em>Rodriguez </em>was limited, the Court, in the same breath, reiterated that careful attention to the requirements of rule 23 is indispensable. The Court also emphasized that mere allegations of racial or ethnic discrimination do not, in and of themselves, ensure that the party bringing the lawsuit will be an adequate representative of those who may be the real victims of discrimination. <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 156-57, 102 S.Ct. at 2370-71 (citing <em>Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. at 405-06, 97 S.Ct. at 1897-98).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">In the present case, the district court found, and the former Fifth Circuit affirmed, that appellants, Rhoades and Lowery, were not qualified for the jobs they sought, and thus, they suffered no injury as a result of the alleged discriminatory practices. <em>Walker v. The Jim Dandy Co., </em>638 F.2d 1330, 1335 (5th Cir.1981). Furthermore, this court\u2019s predecessor, when deciding <em>Walker, </em>clearly stated that \u201cthe district court could dismiss the class complaint if it found that the plaintiffs lacked a sufficient nexus with the class to be one of its members.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>638 F.2d at 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">On remand, the district court properly conducted an evidentiary hearing on the propriety of the litigation proceeding as a class action. <em>Ezell v. Mobile Housing Board, </em>709 F.2d 1376, 1380 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Jones v. Diamond, </em>519 F.2d 1090, 1098 (5th Cir.1975). At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court found, as a matter of fact and law, that appellants, Rhoades and Lowery, could not represent a class including female applicants for employment and employees of Jim Dandy because their individual claims were nonexistent. Moreover, the district court found that the plaintiffs lacked a sufficient nexus with the class to be one of its members. The court reasoned that because Rhoades and Lowery were applicants for supervisory positions, they did not sufficiently identify with other applicants for lower level labor jobs or employees complaining of disparate job assignments or pay. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">Appellants and Willie M. Walker allege in their complaint that pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) they commenced this suit on behalf of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-8\">[All] past, present and future black and female applicants for employment and black and female employees of the Jim Dandy Company and on behalf of those persons in the past, present or future who would have applied for employment with the Jim Dandy Company but for the defendant\u2019s racially and sexually discriminatory recruitment and employment practices and reputation therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfD\">Walker, however, sought to represent the putative class of black discriminatees; appellants, Rhoades and Lowery, petitioned the court for certification to represent a putative class of females similarly situated. More specifically, appellants sought to represent actual female applicants for employment, deterred female applicants for employment, and female employees of Jim Dandy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-9\">In the complaint, appellants allege, in pertinent part, that among the company\u2019s discriminatory acts are the following: \u201c(a) The defendant discriminates on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>sex ... against ... women in <em>recruitment, assignment, hiring, transfer </em>and <em>promotion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Correspondingly, appellants sought to represent a class of females alleging discriminatory acts in recruitment, assignment, hiring, transfer, and promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">We find that the district court correctly concluded that this case is governed by <em>General Telephone Company of the Southwest v. Falcon. </em>Following <em>Falcon </em>and <em>Rodriguez, </em>we hold that appellants\u2019 complaint provided an insufficient basis for concluding that the adjudication of appellants\u2019 claim of discrimination in <em>hiring </em>supervisory employees would require the resolution of common questions of law and fact concerning Jim Dandy\u2019s discriminatory practices in <em>recruitment, job assignment, transfer, </em>and <em>promotion. </em>We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the class complaint once it found that Rhoades and Lowery lacked a sufficient nexus with the class to be one of its members. <em>See Walker v. The Jim Dandy Co., </em>638 F.2d at 1335. Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing the class action complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">II. Appellant Pruitt\u2019s Motion to Intervene</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">Appellant, Elizabeth Pruitt, contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion to intervene pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under that rule, one is entitled to permissive intervention when his claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. In exercising its discretion, the court shall consider, among other things, whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. <em>EEOC v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., </em>736 F.2d 635 (11th Cir.1984). The district court denied Pruitt leave to intervene on four grounds: (1) untimeliness; (2) prejudice to the original parties; (3) the failure to file an EEOC charge; and (4) the absence of a viable case to intervene into. We will address each of these grounds in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-11\">A. Timeliness</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\">The district court denied Pruitt\u2019s motion to intervene on the ground that it was untimely filed. The question of timeliness lies within the district court\u2019s discretion; thus, we review the court\u2019s action only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Howse v. S/V \u201cCanada Goose I\", </em>641 F.2d 317, 320 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981); <em>Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., </em>558 F.2d 257, 263 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-13\">In assessing timeliness, a district court must consider four factors: (1) the period of time during which the putative intervenor knew or reasonably should have known of his interest in the case before he petitioned for leave to intervene; (2) the degree of prejudice to the existing parties as a result of the would-be intervenor\u2019s failure to move to intervene as soon as he knew or reasonably should have known of his interest; (3) the extent of prejudice to the would-be intervenor if his position is denied; and (4) the presence of unusual circumstances militating either for or against a determination that the application is timely. <em>Stallworth, </em>558 F.2d at 264-66. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>We have unequivocally held that this analysis applies to both intervention of right and permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. <em>United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, </em>432 U.S. 385, 387, 97 S.Ct. 2464, 2466, 53 L.Ed.2d 423 (1977); <em>NAACP v. New York, </em>413 U.S. 345, 366, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 2603, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973). The district court, in its memorandum opinion, considered, in a general manner, the aforementioned factors (1) and (2). The district court, however, failed to consider the extent of prejudice to Pruitt if her petition were denied, and the existence of unusual circumstances militating either for or against a determination that the application is timely. <em>See Stallworth, </em>558 F.2d at 264-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">\u201c \u2018Timeliness\u2019 is not a word of exactitude or of precisely measurable dimensions.\u201d <em>McDonald v. E.J. Lavino Co., </em>430 F.2d 1065, 1074 (5th Cir.1970). While the question whether an application for intervention is timely is largely committed to the discretion of the district court, an analysis of the provisions of rule 24, decisions of the Supreme Court, and this court\u2019s binding precedent authorize us to articulate the metes and bounds of the district court\u2019s discretionary power. In doing so, we reiterate the former Fifth Circuit\u2019s pronouncement that the four factors enunciated by the <em>Stallworth </em>court <em>\u201cmust </em>be considered in passing on the timeliness of a petition for leave to intervene\u201d [emphasis added]. <em>Stallworth, </em>558 F.2d at 264 (citing <em>United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, </em>432 U.S. 385, 387, 97 S.Ct. 2464, 2466, 53 L.Ed.2d 423 (1977)); <em>SEC v. Tipco, Inc., </em>554 F.2d 710, 711 (5th Cir.1977); <em>Smith Petroleum Service, Inc. v. Monsanto Chemical Co., </em>420 F.2d 1103, 1115 (5th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">Thorough review of the record fails to reveal that the district court gave due consideration to the four factors articulated in <em>Stallworth. </em>Because the district court denied, as untimely, Pruitt\u2019s motion to intervene without considering all four of the factors specified in <em>Stallworth, </em>we hold that the district court clearly abused its discretion. Accordingly, we remand this intervention issue to the district court for a determination consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-7\">B. Other Grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-8\">The district court also denied Pruitt's motion on the grounds that intervention would cause prejudice to the original parties, that Pruitt had failed to file an EEOC charge, and that no viable case existed for Pruitt to intervene into. As noted above, the district court considered <em>Stallworth </em>factor number 2 which involved the degree of prejudice to the existing parties as a result of Pruitt\u2019s failure to move to intervene earlier. Without rendering judgment on the merits of the court\u2019s finding, we hold that this consideration alone is an insufficient ground for denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-9\">In <em>Oatis v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., </em>398 F.2d 496 (5th Cir.1968), we held that each member of a class need not file an EEOC charge as a prerequisite to join a Title VII suit as long as at least one named plaintiff had filed such charges. <em>Oatis, </em>398 F.2d at 499. We, however, extended <em>Oatis </em>to non-class suits in <em>Wheeler v. American Home Products Corp., </em>582 F.2d 891, 897 (5th Cir.1977), where we held that similarly situated intervenors who had not filed EEOC charges nevertheless could assert backpay claims if one or more of the original plaintiffs had filed timely charges. <em>Wheeler, </em>582 F.2d at 897. Since Rhoades and Lowery had filed a timely EEOC charge and the court was considering the class certification issue, we hold that Pruitt did not have to file an EEOC charge as a prerequisite to intervene in this Title VII suit. Furthermore, since Rhoades and Lowery filed a timely notice of appeal and the case was before the district court at a duly scheduled hearing, we hold that Pruitt had a viable case to intervene into.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-11\">In sum, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>certify this action as a class action. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s order on this issue. As for Pruitt\u2019s motion to intervene, we hold that the district court strayed beyond the legal metes. and bounds of its discretion when it failed to consider all four of the <em>Stallworth </em>factors in deciding whether Pruitt\u2019s motion to intervene was timely. Accordingly, we reverse the district court and remand this issue to the court for a determination consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED and REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1438-12\">. Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-13\">(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of <em>all </em>members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-10\">(b) Class Actions Maintainable.
