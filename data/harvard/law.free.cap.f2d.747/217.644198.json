WINTER, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b294-17\">The Navy appeals from an order of the district court granting Leslie A. Cole, an enlisted active member of the Navy, a discharge as a conscientious objector (C.O.). It was the view of the district court that Cole was eligible for a C.O. discharge and that the Navy effectively had denied it without any basis in fact. The Navy then placed Cole on appellate leave and obtained from us a stay of her discharge pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-18\">We now reverse the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-20\">This is a case of a young woman who voluntarily enlisted in the Navy and who, after seventeen months of service, experienced a crystallization of C.O. views. The history of her relations with the Navy are set forth in an affidavit, based upon written records and personal recollection, of the legal officer on board the ship to which Cole was assigned. Because of its length, the body of the affidavit is appended as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-21\">The affidavit demonstrates that in July and August, 1982, Cole committed a number of military infractions. Although her request for reassignment of duties was honored, she was punished by confinement and reduction in pay for these infractions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>While confined, she was advised how to effect her release from the service as a C.O., and on October 12, 1982, she made application therefor. Her application and the hearing thereon received favorable consideration at the initial administrative level. Cole learned on January 21, 1983, that final action on her application would not be forthcoming for another four to five weeks, and within four days, Cole refused to perform her duties or to wear her uniform, ostensibly because of her beliefs. Cole\u2019s refusals brought on disciplinary action ultimately resulting in confinement, forfeiture of pay and a bad conduct discharge. Cole had served almost all of her sentence before she was released by the district court.' She has not, however, been discharged from the Navy.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The pendency of the proceedings for Cole\u2019s second set of infractions also halted final administrative action on her application for discharge because of the provisions of Art. 3620230.5 of the Navy Military Personnel Manual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">Commander, Naval Military Personnel Command, shall be informed by message if, after submitting an application for designation or discharge as a conscientious objector, the member commits an offense punishable under the UCMJ or, if at the time of submission of an application, the member is the subject of disciplinary action, and when disciplinary action has been completed. Final action on an application or an approved request for discharge shall not be effected until all disciplinary action, including confinement if applicable, has been resolved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">This personnel regulation was adopted under the authority of regulations of the Department of Defense, setting forth procedures governing conscientious objectors and processing requests for discharge based on conscientious objection. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 75.1 <em>et seq. </em>Section 75.6 of those regulations, after setting forth the procedure for applying for separation and consideration of the application, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">(g) Processing of applications need not be abated by the unauthorized absence of the applicant subsequent to the initiation of the application, or by the institution of disciplinary action or administrative separation proceedings against him. However, an applicant whose request for classification as a conscientious objector has been approved will not be discharged until all disciplinary action has been resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">(h) To the extent practicable under the circumstances, during the period applications are being processed and until a . decision is made by the headquarters of the service concerned, every effort will be made to assign applicants to duties within the command to which they are assigned which will conflict as little as possible with their asserted beliefs____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Section 75.6(g) and (h). From the discretionary language of \u00a7 75.6(g) (\u201c[processing of applications need not be abated ... by the institution of disciplinary action\u201d), it is manifest that the Navy has discretion to abate processing an application until disciplinary action has been resolved. In any event, the regulation forbids the discharge of any member of the military until all disciplinary action has been resolved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><em>Parisi v. Davidson, </em>405 U.S. 34, 92 S.Ct. 815, 31 L.Ed.2d 17 (1972), states all of the law necessary to a decision of this case with respect to the jurisdiction of the federal civilian courts to intervene in the military system of justice. In <em>Parisi, </em>which is distinguishable from the instant case by the fact that Parisi\u2019s application for a C.O. discharge as a conscientious objector had been finally denied before he sought habeas corpus in a federal district court, the opening sentence of the opinion states a controlling principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">When a member of the armed forces has applied for a discharge as a conscientious objector and has exhausted all avenues of administrative relief, it is now settled that he may seek habeas corpus relief in a federal district court on the ground that the denial of his application had no basis in fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">405 U.S. at 35, 92 S.Ct. at 816. Later in the opinion, the Court pointed out that Parisi had exhausted all available administrative remedies so that exercise of federal district court jurisdiction was proper. 405 U.S. 37-39, 92 S.Ct. at 817-819.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Cole has not exhausted her administrative remedies. Her application for separation as a C.O. has been neither granted nor denied. Under the established doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the district court should have declined to exercise jurisdiction unless there is a valid reason to excuse her from the necessity of exhaustion. We would concede that the sincerity of Cole\u2019s views as a C.O. are established on the present record and that a denial of her discharge on that ground would lack a basis in fact. But we do not think that the ultimate merit of her claim provides any excuse from the necessity of exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">The district court in effect excused exhaustion on the ground that the Navy Personnel regulation operates as the functional denial of Cole\u2019s application. That approach presumably stems from the perception that the Navy made exhaustion impossible and the conclusion that Cole therefore should not be held to the exhaustion requirement. We think that this approach is fallacious because it overlooks two crucial factors. First, Cole \u2014 rather than the Navy \u2014 was primarily responsible for the suspension of administrative processing of her application. She persisted in her refusal to obey orders and to observe military protocol, although she knew her conduct would halt final processing of her application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, to the extent that the Navy was responsible for the suspension of final processing, it was acting in accordance with a reasonable regulation applicable to those seeking separation as. conscientious objectors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Cole does not attack the validity of the regulation, and the district court did not consider its validity. The regulation embodies the provision of the Department of Defense regulation that disciplinary action takes precedence over the determination that a member of the military is a C.O. in the timing of a discharge. It thus effectively makes remaining on, or returning to, non-disciplinary status one of the conditions for obtaining a conscientious objector discharge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is not an unreasonable requirement for a branch of the military to adopt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is manifestly designed to discourage precisely what happened here \u2014 the assertion by an enlistee that she can be her own commander-in-chief or her own military judge and decide what orders she will obey and what military protocol she will observe before her claim to conscientious objection is finally established.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A military organization simply could not function under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">In expressing these views, we stress that there is nothing in this record to show that consideration of Cole\u2019s claim was unduly delayed<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or that orders were needlessly given her in conflict with her beliefs so as to lay the groundwork for unnecessary punishment or vindictiveness. We, of course, recognize that under the regulation of the Department of Defense, the Navy had the discretion to process her application at the same time that it carried on disciplinary procedures. But we cannot say that, given the military\u2019s need to maintain order and discipline, it is unreasonable or invalid for the Navy to suspend consideration of Cole\u2019s application pending resolution of disciplinary actions. Certainly it is reasonable for the Navy to withhold granting a C.O. discharge until all disciplinary action was resolved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">We recognize that, unless .Cole is successful in overturning her military con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>victions, she will receive a bad conduct discharge rather than a conscientious objector discharge. This is so because military courts do not generally recognize the defense of conscientious objection for refusal to carry out a lawful order. <em>See Parisi v. Davidson, </em>405 U.S. at 42-45, 92 S.Ct. at 820-822.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even though we also recognize that it is extremely unlikely that Cole will prevail in the military courts, we think that a bad conduct discharge is the price that she properly may be required to pay. The unquestioned need of the military to preserve order and discipline makes any other conclusion unthinkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">EXTRACT OF AFFIDAVIT</p>\n<p id=\"Azn\">The following is a chronology of the events pertinent to the above styled case, that were extracted from the attached documents and from my personal recollection:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">June 1982 \u2014 Petitioner attends a Navy School in San Diego, California;</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">June 28,1982 \u2014 Petitioner becomes an unauthorized absentee from school;</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">July 1982 \u2014 USS L.Y.

Article 3610100 of the Manual, dealing with enlisted administrative separations, similarly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">All pending military offenses should be disposed of under the UCMJ [Uniform Code of Military Justice] prior to processing a member under the provisions of these articles except where a member has requested separation in lieu of trial by court-martial----</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-14\">. In a post-argument affidavit, an officer of the Army, possessing the relevant information, supplied us with comparative data as to the course followed by the several branches of the military with regard to the discretionary language of \u00a7 75.6(g). It appears that the Army, like the Navy, suspends the processing of an application for a C.O. discharge until disciplinary action has been resolved; and if the disciplinary action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>results in a punitive (bad conduct or dishonorable) discharge, processing of the C.O. discharge application will not resume unless and until the punitive discharge has been remitted or disapproved. The Marine Corp and the Air Force retain the option of deciding the application, but if they conclude to grant a C.O. discharge, they will not deliver it while a punitive discharge remains in the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In response, Cole submitted three affidavits: one from a member of the Air Force, who .said that his C.O. application was processed while his court martial was pending and that he was ultimately given a C.O. discharge; another from a member of the Army, who said that his C.O. application was processed while he was awaiting his court martial; and a third from a member of the Navy, who said that his C.O. application was processed while he was serving his sentence imposed by Captain's Mast and that he was ultimately given a C.O. discharge. While these affidavits may question the uniformity of practice within the Army and the Navy, it is significant that none of the affiants claims that he was given a C.O. discharge after having been given a punitive discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-13\">. The affidavit annexed hereto shows that on January 27, 1983, an effort was made to convince Cole to return to work and to wear her uniform so as not to halt processing of her application. She, nonetheless, persisted in her refusals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b296-14\">. Of course in the instant case, the Navy applied its own regul\u00e1tion to suspend further considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tion of Cole\u2019s C.O. application. Arguably, the regulation would authorize only postponing delivery of a C.O. discharge while pending disciplinary action was unresolved. We need not concern ourselves with the correctness of the Navy\u2019s interpretation of its regulation because we deem each course of action the functional equivalent of the other. Our concern is whether the Navy\u2019s failure to grant the C.O. discharge was reasonable under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\">. Accordingly, even if the suspension of processing should qualify as a denial of Cole\u2019s application for jurisdictional purposes, the Navy\u2019s \u201cdenial\u201d was appropriate since Cole had failed to fulfill all the requirements for obtaining a conscientious objector discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">. Because, as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Parisi, </em>an enlisted person\u2019s right to a conscientious objector discharge is a function of the military\u2019s administrative grace, <em>Parisi, </em>405 U.S. at 38, n. 2, 92 S.Ct. at 818, n. 2, the military certainly may circumscribe that right with reasonable regulations. So long as the restrictions \u25a0 placed on the right are reasonable, the judiciary has no warrant to interfere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\">. It should be noted that the regulation of the Department of Defense, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.6(h), set forth in the text, requires that \"[t]o the extent practicable under the circumstances\u201d applicants for separation as conscientious objectors shall be assigned \"to duties within the command ... which will conflict as little as possible with their asserted beliefs...\u201d In this case, Cole was transferred, at her request, from repair work on submarines to duties as a food service attendant even before she filed a formal application for separation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b297-15\">. It is perhaps significant that almost four months elapsed between Cole's first overt manifestation of her beliefs \u2014 her unauthorized absence of June 28, 1982 \u2014 and the date of her formal application for separation (October 12, 1982). The hearing on Cole's application was held December 13, 1982, resulting in a recommendation on December 30, 1982, that her application be granted. Despite her marked delay in beginning the proceedings, she announced on January 21, 1983, that she would decline to conform to military protocol and military orders after January 31, 1983. In fact she ceased to conform on January 25, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b297-16\">. <em>See </em>n. 2, <em>supra. </em>It is significant that even those branches of the military which will process a C.O. application while disciplinary action is pending, will not deliver it if a punitive discharge results from the disciplinary action so long as the punitive discharge is extant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b298-13\">. Of course in <em>Parisi, </em>it was conceded that if Parisi was entitled to conscientious objector status, the court martial charges against him were invalid. 405 U.S. at 46 n. 15, 92 S.Ct. at 822 n. 15. But Parisi's refusal to obey the order to report for deployment to Vietnam occurred <em>after </em>his application for discharge was unlawfully finally denied. Here Cole committed military offenses while her application for discharge was pending. In any event, the Court has said that \"the question whether wrongful denial of conscientious objector status may be raised as a defense against various types of military charges must remain with the military courts.. 405 U.S. at 44 n. 13, 92 S.Ct. at 821 n. 13. Since the decision in <em>Parisi, </em>the military court of appeals has held that wrongful denial is not an available defense. <em>See United States v. Lenox, </em>21 U.S.C. M.A. 314, 45 C.M.R. 88 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b300-14\">SPROUSE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVR\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">I respectfully dissent. There is no question that Cole\u2019s conscientious objector beliefs were sincere and that if her application had \"been fully processed she would have received an honorable discharge. She followed all Navy procedures required to process her application, including a formal hearing, and the hearing officer recommended approval of a conscientious objector discharge. In transmitting this recommendation to the Naval Military Personnel Command, Cole\u2019s commanding officer made no recommendation himself, but merely noted that her beliefs appeared sincere. Possibly frustrated by the timetable of review by the Personnel Command, Cole refused to wear her uniform and to perform military duties. As the majority opinion correctly narrates, the Navy suspended ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>tion on her conscientious objector application. As a result of her subsequent court-martial, the application was never again considered. Cole received a bad conduct discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">. The majority concedes the merits of Cole\u2019s application for a conscientious objector discharge, but holds that the district court should have declined to exercise jurisdiction. I agree with the majority that we need look no further than <em>Parisi v. Davidson, </em>405 U.S. 34, 92 S.Ct. 815, 31 L.Ed.2d 17 (1972), for guidance in resolving the principal issue on this appeal. I disagree with the conclusion of my colleagues that <em>Parisi </em>mandates that Cole was required to exhaust military remedies of questionable value to her before resorting to the civilian judicial apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">As the majority points out, the rule of law governing this case was carefully stated by Justice Stewart in <em>Parisi: </em>\u201cWhen a member of the armed forces has applied for a discharge as a conscientious objector and <em>has exhausted all avenues of administrative relief, </em>it is now settled that he may seek habeas corpus relief in a federal district court on the ground that the denial of his application had no basis in fact.\u201d 405 U.S. at 35, 92 S.Ct. at 816 (emphasis added). The Navy\u2019s jurisdictional argument approved by the majority relies on the underscored language. It contends that Cole has not met the administrative exhaustion requirement of <em>Parisi </em>because her conscientious objector application, unlike Parisi\u2019s, was never completed and formally denied before she invoked the district court\u2019s habeas jurisdiction. In effect, the majority concludes that Cole\u2019s infractions and the interacting Navy regulations amount to a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In my view, Cole\u2019s final situation constitutes not a failure to exhaust but an impossibility to obtain the only administrative review that would have determined whether or not she was entitled to a conscientious objector discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\"><em>Parisi </em>involved an Army draftee who expressed a crystallization of conscientious objector views after nine months of military service. His application for a conscientious objector discharge was denied by the Department of the Army despite recommendations of approval from the base chaplain, base psychiatrist, special hearing officer, and commanders of an Army hospital and Army training center. Parisi appealed the denial to a military review board and sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. The court stayed considering the merits of the habeas petition until completion of administrative review of the discharge denial. While that review was pending, Parisi refused an order to board a plane for Vietnam and was charged with a court-martial offense. The military review board later upheld the discharge denial, but the district court again stayed consideration of the merits of the habeas petition, this time pending resolution of the court-martial. 405 U.S. at 35-37, 92 S.Ct. at 816-818. The Supreme Court held that a pending court-martial should not stay the habeas petition. Parisi exhausted all administrative remedies for obtaining a conscientious objector discharge, <em>id. </em>at 38-39, 92 S.Ct. at 818\u2014819; and principles of comity did not require the district court to stay its hand in deference to an independent proceeding that lacked a \u201creasonable promptness and certainty\u201d of offering Parisi the relief he sought, <em>id. </em>at 41-42, 92 S.Ct. at 819-820.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\"><em>Parisi </em>thus firmly establishes the federal court\u2019s obligation to entertain habeas petitions despite ongoing disciplinary proceedings in a military tribunal. Principles of comity, the Court in <em>Parisi </em>explained, do not demand that the federal judiciary delay its consideration of a conscientious objector\u2019s habeas claim unless the same relief \u201cwould also be available to him with reasonable promptness and certainty through the machinery of the military judicial system.\u201d 405 U.S. at 41, 92 S.Ct. at 820. The Court, in concluding that such relief was not available to Parisi in the military courts, relied on a crucial distinction between courts-martial and administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>proceedings that determine conscientious objector claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">Courts-martial are not convened to review and rectify administrative denials of conscientious objector claims or to release conscientious objectors from military service. They are convened to adjudicate charges of criminal violations of military law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">405 U.S. at 42, 92 S.Ct. at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In denying relief to Cole, the majority distinguishes <em>Parisi </em>because there the serviceperson received a final decision on his eligibility, thus plainly exhausting his administrative remedies and meeting the jurisdictional prerequisites for the exercise of the district court\u2019s habeas power. On the other hand, the majority concludes that the suspension of Cole\u2019s conscientious objector proceeding prior to final decision leaves the process of administrative review unexhausted. I believe that the district court took a more perceptive view of Cole\u2019s case in reasoning that the suspension of Cole\u2019s conscientious objector proceeding was equivalent to a <em>de facto </em>denial and that the ongoing disciplinary proceedings offered her no reasonably prompt administrative avenue for gaining consideration for her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">By the time Cole applied for federal habeas relief, she had been convicted of various charges of misconduct stemming from her personal aversion to war, sentenced to sixty days of hard labor, ordered to forfeit $375 pay per month for the next three months, and awarded a bad conduct discharge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only military review open to her at this juncture was in the military appeals courts, and those tribunals could not determine her conscientious objector status. <em>Parisi, </em>405 U.S. at 42-44, 92 S.Ct. at 820-821. Cole was placed in an impossible posture. She could not restart the administrative machinery responsible for processing her conscientious objector application without proving her innocence through the court-martial proceedings. In turn, she could not prove her innocence and avoid a bad conduct discharge without convincing the military appeals courts to accept her conscientious objections as a defense to the disciplinary charges \u2014 a step rejected in the past and ultimately not taken in Cole\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">The possibility, then, that Cole would eventually secure administrative consideration of her conscientious objector claim through the court-martial machinery was highly improbable and certainly inadequate when compared to the remedies available to her had the Navy processed her application to completion without regard to the pending disciplinary proceedings. Viewed realistically, the suspension order impaired her chances for a conscientious objector discharge more than a final adverse decision would have, because in the latter instance there would have been no question concerning her right to federal habeas review. <em>Parisi, </em>405 U.S. at 45, 92 S.Ct. at 821; <em>Cooper v. Barker, </em>291 F.Supp. 952, 959 (D.Md.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">The Navy argued on appeal that, even if its suspension action was equivalent to a denial of Cole\u2019s application, the denial was pursuant to its lawful regulations. It maintained that its regulations form part of the administrative apparatus that Cole must exhaust before she can meet the prerequisites for invoking the federal court\u2019s habeas jurisdiction. The Navy\u2019s argument, however, rests on infirm foundations.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">The requirement that a petitioner should exhaust administrative remedies before coming into court is not a doctrine of jurisdictional power, but of comity. <em>McKart v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 193-95, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 1662-63, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969); <em>United States ex rel. Tobias v. Laird, </em>413 F.2d 936, 939 (4th Cir.1969). The doctrine is of judicial creation and consequently draws its essence from the various prudential considerations that restrain the judiciary from interfering unduly with the law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ful operations of coordinate branches of government. Practical considerations, of course, also come into play in the judiciary\u2019s decision to require administrative exhaustion. The courts often benefit from an agency\u2019s special expertise in matters with which it deals repeatedly. Moreover, valuable resources are spared by a consistent exhaustion policy because \u201coften the agency\u2019s ultimate decision will obviate the need for judicial intervention.\u201d <em>Schlesinger v. Councilman, </em>420 U.S. 738, 756-57, 95 S.Ct. 1300, 1312-13, 43 L.Ed.2d 591 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The exhaustion requirement, however, is not to be blindly invoked. Its \u201c[ajpplication ... to specific cases requires an understanding of its purposes and of the particular administrative scheme involved.\u201d <em>McKart, </em>395 U.S. at 193, 89 S.Ct. at 1662.' It is a doctrine \u201csubject to numerous exceptions,\u201d <em>id., </em>and courts must be especially alert to that characteristic for it is still their lawful power to entertain an issue that is being prudentially relinquished. As this court has recognized, on appropriate facts habeas relief may be granted to a service-person \u201ceven if further administrative avenues appear[] theoretically open.\u201d <em>Tobias, </em>413 F.2d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The military'concededly is a \u201c \u2018specialized society ... \u2019 with \u2018laws and traditions ... [developed] during its long history.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schlesinger v. Councilman, </em>420 U.S. at 757, 95 S.Ct. at 1313 (citation omitted). Its vital role in preserving the nation\u2019s security and long tradition of autonomous operations support a strong exhaustion requirement in matters committed to its special expertise. <em>Id. </em>At no time, however, has the exhaustion doctrine been held to permit any agency, military or otherwise, to insulate itself from judicial review by administrative regulation. Such a mechanical view of the exhaustion doctrine would soon produce bizarre and constitutionally unacceptable results. <em>Hammond v. Lenfest, </em>398 F.2d 705, 715 (2d Cir.1968). An administrative agency effectively could preempt the judicial branch from exploring the limits of its own power, by creating a series of artificial barriers for the claimant to overcome in order to perfect his right to federal court review. The principle of comity underlying the exhaustion doctrine creates responsibilities running in both directions. It demands that courts refrain from interfering in the lawful procedures of agencies, but likewise exacts reciprocal obligations from the administrative agencies. <em>See, e.g., Orloff v. Willoughby, </em>345 U.S. 83, 94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 540, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953); <em>Hammond v. Lenfest, </em>398 F.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">I do not intimate that there is anything inherently improper about the Navy regulations involved in this appeal. I believe instead that, as applied to the peculiar circumstances of Cole\u2019s case, the regulations made futile further resort to the administrative machinery responsible for conscientious objector processing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>K. Davis, Administrative Law Text \u00a7 20.07 (3d ed. 1972); <em>United States v. Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>384 U.S. 424, 429-30, 86 S.Ct. 1539, 1542-43, 16 L.Ed.2d 662 (1966); <em>Tobias, </em>413 F.2d at 939. The Navy received a fair and effective opportunity to rule on Cole\u2019s conscientious objector application, but refused to process the application in deference to its regulations governing pending disciplinary charges. <em>See Smith v. Digmon, </em>434 U.S. 332, 333-34, 98 S.Ct. 597, 598-99, 54 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978) (per curiam) (claim raised in petitioner\u2019s brief but not addressed by state appellate court satisfies exhaustion); <em>Toney v. Franzen, </em>687 F.2d 1016, 1021-22 (7th Cir.1982) (claim exhausted if state court ignores issue or leaves room for further litigation); <em>Hudson v. Rushen, </em>686 F.2d 826, 830 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 916, 103 S.Ct. 1896, 77 L.Ed.2d 285 (1983) (sixth amendment claim exhausted when court of appeals de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>cided it adversely and the State Supreme Court denied certiorari, despite fact that certain relevant authorities not considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The district court\u2019s attempt to redress the consequences for Cole of the Navy\u2019s refusal to process her conscientious objector application was well within the narrow role that the Supreme Court has assigned federal courts in reviewing the military\u2019s conscientious objector decisions. The Court has limited the judicial inquiry to the \u201cno basis in fact\u201d standard of review and has cautioned courts to \u201cgive careful consideration to the appropriate demands of comity in effectuating [their] habeas corpus decree[s].\u201d <em>Parisi, </em>405 U.S. at 35, 46, 92 S.Ct. at 816, 822 (footnote omitted). <em>See also Tobias, </em>413 F.2d at 939. In eases in which pending disciplinary charges are unconnected to deep-seated conscientious objector beliefs, comity should require that the district court refrain from ordering a conscientious objector discharge until the military court-martial proceedings have run their course. <em>Parisi, </em>405 U.S. at 46 n. 15, 92 S.Ct. at 822 n. 15. Indeed, there may be circumstances in which the \u201cdemands of comity\u201d counsel against the issuance of a habeas decree even though the applicant\u2019s ongoing disciplinary proceedings involve charges related to deep-seated personal beliefs. These are determinations that are best resolved by the reviewing court in individual cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The district court in the present case, however, operated within the narrow limits defined by <em>Parisi. </em>It determined Cole\u2019s eligibility for a conscientious objector discharge under the \u201cno basis in fact\u201d standard and, contrary to the Navy\u2019s arguments, fashioned a remedy that properly accommodated the military\u2019s interest in punishing wrongdoers. At the time the habeas decree issued, Cole had already served much of her prison sentence, sustained the mandated pay reduction, and received notification of her discharge from the Navy. The only real relief she received from the district court was having her bad conduct discharge changed to show dismissal from the service because of her conscientious objections. The intrusion on military punishment prerogatives, therefore, was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">A service person claiming conscientious objector beliefs of course does not have special dispensation to flout military disciplinary rules. Miscreant personnel operating under that misconception will soon discover the judiciary to be an inhospitable forum. Cole\u2019s misguided actions, however, were hardly born of a desire to embarrass or defy military authorities. Her ordeal concededly was largely of her own making and the Navy cannot be faulted for demanding that she be punished for her misconduct. Had she conformed her conduct to the strictures of military life for sixty more days, her conscientious objector application would have been processed in accordance with Navy regulations and undoubtedly approved, thus avoiding this entire episode. Personal conscience, however, is a difficult force to restrain in the most disciplined of minds and, though that does not excuse Cole\u2019s rash behavior, it does explain her failure to adhere to military rules while her conscientious objector application was being processed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Because I would affirm the district court\u2019s order, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">I am authorized to state that Judge JAMES DICKSON PHILLIPS, Judge MURNAGHAN and Judge ERVIN join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">. The Court of Military Review affirmed Cole's convictions on December 23, 1983, while this appeal was pending. The Court of Military Appeals denied review on September 5, 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">. This is not a case in which Cole flouted administrative procedures in favor of federal court remedies. <em>See, e.g., McGee v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 479, 91 S.Ct. 1565, 29 L.Ed.2d 47 (1971). She, in fact, pursued the available administrative remedies diligently until the Navy suspended its processing - of her application. At that point, it became clear that the suspension, in combination with her disciplinary proceedings, would prevent the administrative process from resuming.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
