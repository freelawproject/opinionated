Ballantine, Jr., United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b412-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">This matter is before the Court upon appellants\u2019 appeal from the district court\u2019s order, which denied its motion but granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Upon consideration of the issues presented by this appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">In November, 1981 appellee, Dyneer Corporation (Dyneer), closed its Spun Steel Division. After the closing, Dyneer reviewed the pension plan (Plan), which arose out of a collective bargaining agreement between Dyneer and appellants, International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and its Local 917 (UAW). After its review, Dyneer wanted to terminate the Plan and convert it into individual annuities. Subsequent to the conversion and termination Dyneer intended to recoup any remaining surplus funds. On March 9,1982, however, UAW filed a complaint as a prophylactic measure to preclude Dyneer\u2019s recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">In its complaint, UAW set forth four allegations regarding Dyneer\u2019s intended recoupment. First, recoupment would violate both the collective bargaining agreement and the pension agreement. Second, recoupment would violate the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq. (ERISA). Third, recoupment would result in Dyneer\u2019s unjust enrichment. Fourth, recoupment would result in a breach of the Plan\u2019s trustees\u2019 collective fiduciary duty as defined by ER-ISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">Both Dyneer and UAW moved for summary judgment. In a memorandum opinion the district court denied UAW\u2019s motion, but granted Dyneer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In addressing the cross-motions for summary judgment the district court noted that although ERISA limits an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ployer\u2019s right of recoupment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ERISA also provides an exception to that limitation. That exception, which is found in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(d)(1), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">[A]ny residual assets of a single-employer plan may be distributed to the employer if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">(A) all liabilities of the plan to participants and their beneficiaries have been satisfied,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">(B) the distribution does not contravene any provision of law, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">(C) the plan provides for such a distribution in these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Our review of the exception\u2019s application in the instant case, however, need only consider the application of \u00a7 1344(d)(1)(C), since neither party disputed the applicability of \u00a7 1344(d)(1)(A)-(B) in the district court. <em>Aluminum Co. of America v. Sperry Products, Inc., </em>285 F.2d 911 (6th Cir.1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 890, 82 S.Ct. 139, 7 L.Ed.2d 87 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">In determining the applicability of \u00a7 1344(d)(1)(C) an analysis of the Plan is necessary because under \u00a7 1344(d)(1)(C) the Plan determines the availability of the right to recoupment. Articles I-VI of the Plan do not relate to recoupment, but instead to a myriad of topics such as: definitions (I), crediting of service (II), eligibility (III), retirement benefits (IV), payment of benefits (V), trust fund and trustees (VI). Article VII, which is entitled \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d however, states that upon the Plan\u2019s termination or amendment, not \u201call of any part of the Trust Fund [should] be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Employees or their beneficiaries____\u201d That statement and another similar one found in Article IX establishes the Plan\u2019s exclusivity. Hence, the district court\u2019s statement, that \u201c[t]he Plan generally prohibits ... [Dyneer] from recouping ...\u201d is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">Article IX and Article XI each establish the one exception to that general prohibition. Article IX states, in pertinent part, that the \u201cremaining part of the Trust Fund, if any, as may be the result of actuarial error may revert to ... [Dyneer].\u201d Article XI states, in pertinent part, that \u201cany surplus attributable to actuarial error shall be returned to [Dyneer].\u201d Hence, the district court's conclusion, that Dyneer\u2019s recoupment depends upon the existence of an \u201cactuarial error,\u201d is correct. Consequently, the definition of an \u201cactuarial error,\u201d is the real point upon which Dyneer\u2019s entitlement turns.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">The district court adopted the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s most recent definition of an \u201cactuarial error.\u201d That definition states that \u201cwhen fixed and contingent liabilities are discharged through the purchase of a contract or contracts from insurance company [sic] which provides the benefits with respect to individuals for whom the liabilities are determined, the remaining assets may be considered surplus arising from actuarial error____\u201d Rev.Rul. 83-52, 1983-13 C.B. 87. In support of its adoption the district court cited the lower court opinion in <em>Washington Baltimore Newspaper Guild Local 35 v. Washington Star Co., </em>555 F.Supp. 257 (D.D.C.1983); and <em>In re C.D. Moyer Co. Trust Fund, </em>441 F.Supp. 1128 (E.D.Pa.1977). Those opinions have been affirmed. <em>Washington Star Co., </em>729 F.2d 863 (D.C.Cir.1984), <em>aff'g </em>555 F.Supp. 257 (D.D.C.1983); <em>In re C.D. Moyer Co. Trust Fund, </em>582 F.2d 1273 (3rd Cir.1978), <em>aff'g, </em>441 F.Supp. 1128 (E.D.Pa.1977). Those affirmances are the persuasive authority upon which we base our affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">For the foregoing reasons we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-12\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">[ejxcept as provided in paragraph (2), (3), or (4) or subsection (d) of this section, or under sections 1342 and 1344 of this title (relating to termination of insured plans), the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
