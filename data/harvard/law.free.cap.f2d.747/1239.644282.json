In January 1983, the United States Department of Agriculture disqualified the store from receiving food stamps for a period of three years. The Sutherlins appeal from an order of the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirming the Department\u2019s action. We affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-23\">In their petition for judicial review of the administrative determination, and in this appeal, the Sutherlins have primarily contested the sanction imposed by the Department. We discussed the scope of appellate review of administrative sanctions in <em>Studt v. United States, </em>607 F.2d 1216 (8th Cir.1979). That case was also an appeal from an order of disqualification entered by the Department of Agriculture. We stated \u201cif only the sanction is challenged, the district court must limit its review to a determination of whether the sanction imposed on the violator is arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218. <em>See also Butz v. Glover Livestock Commission Co., </em>411 U.S. 182, 185-86, 93 S.Ct. 1455, 1457-58, 36 L.Ed.2d 142 (1973), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>412 U.S. 933, 93 S.Ct. 2746, 37 L.Ed.2d 162 (1973) (\u201c[T]he Secretary\u2019s choice of sanction was not to be overturned unless the Court of Appeals might find it \u2018unwarranted in law or ... without justification in fact____\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-24\">The Sutherlins argue that the Department did not adequately consider the hardship to food stamp recipients that would result from the sanction of disqualification. Accordingly, they contend that the Department acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to impose a monetary sanction instead of disqualification. <em>See Milgram Food Stores, Inc. v. United States, </em>558 F.Supp. 629 (W.D.Mo.1983). We have carefully examined the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>trative record in this case and conclude that the Department made a thorough and conscientious inquiry into the hardship issue before disqualifying the Sutherlins\u2019 store from participating in the food stamp program. The administrative review officer concluded that \u201cdisqualification of [the Sutherins\u2019] store would not subject * * * food stamp customers to hardship by depriving them of any shopping outlet at which to fully meet their food needs.\u201d The record amply supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that the Department did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-19\">.
