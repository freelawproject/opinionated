Fruehauf claims that the trial court erred in drawing a number of legal conclusions concerning the nature of the warranties and disclaimers contained in the contract between the parties, and in framing its jury instructions. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-19\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-20\">Fiorito, a heavy construction company, began negotiations in the Spring of 1977 with Fruehauf, a manufacturer of dump truck bodies, for the purchase of thirteen bodies to be installed on separately-purchased trucks. Fiorito uses dump trucks for, among other things, carrying wet concrete to highway construction sites. In pre-purchase negotiations, Fiorito informed Fruehauf of this contemplated use. Fruehauf admits that its representative told Fiorito that its truck bodies were suitable for carrying wet concrete. During pre-purchase negotiations Fruehauf also informed Fiorito that the bodies were covered under a five-year unconditional warranty and that the design of the bodies was unique. Fruehauf also gave Fiorito a sales brochure during this period which makes the same general claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>On March 14, 1977, Fruehauf gave Fiorito a written price quotation stating that each body would cost $5,262, and that each was covered by a five-year warranty. Later, Fruehauf lowered the price by $400 per body, and Fiorito agreed to purchase the thirteen bodies. On April 13, 1977, Fiorito signed a Fruehauf sales order, which sets forth on the reverse side a five-year warranty and a number of disclaimers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The total purchase price was $66,619.12. The disclaimers on the sales order include statements that the sole remedy for the buyer is \u201crepair or replacement,\u201d and that consequential damages are not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">After the bodies had been installed and the trucks began to haul wet concrete, a number of problems with the bodies developed. The two major problems were that the sides of the bodies (the \u201cdump boxes\u201d) bulged and bowed when filled with wet concrete and that the hydraulic hoists failed. Cracks and tears also developed in the corners and welds of the bodies. All thirteen trucks were affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">Fiorito notified Fruehauf orally of these problems but received no response. Fiorito and Fruehauf also exchanged letters in 1977. A Fruehauf service manager came to Fiorito\u2019s shop, examined the bodies, and stated that they were not covered under warranty. After another similar visit from Fruehauf managers, Fiorito began repairing the bodies itself. Several letters were exchanged between the parties but Fruehauf continued to deny coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-12\">Fiorito brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington on September 2, 1980, seeking damages. Diversity of citizenship provided the basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). A jury trial was conducted in July, 1982, Hon. Walter T. McGovern presiding. Fiorito argued that the bodies had been improperly manufactured and that Fruehauf had failed to honor express and implied warranties. In defense, Fruehauf relied mainly on the disclaimers contained in the sales order. The jury returned a verdict for , Fiorito, awarding $130,000 in damages. The court entered its judgment on July 23, 1982. Fruehauf s motion for a new trial was denied by order entered June 29, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-13\">Our jurisdiction over this appeal is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-14\">ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-15\">I. Whether the trial court correctly ruled, ah a matter of 'law, that (a) Fruehauf\u2019s limited \u201crepair or replace\u201d remedy failed of its essential purpose, and (b) under the circumstances of this case, failure of the limited remedy invalidated Fruehauf\u2019s disclaimer of consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>II. Whether the court\u2019s jury instructions, taken as a whole, allowed the jury to determine intelligently the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">1. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S LEGAL CONCLUSIONS WERE CORRECT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-6\">A. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-7\">The substantive law of Washington governs this diversity case. <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). We review the district court\u2019s determination and application of state law <em>de novo. Churchill v. F/V Fjord (In re McLinn), </em>739 F.2d 1395, 1399-1400 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc). \u201cOur independent determination of state law should be based upon recognized sources that are available to the parties and that may be argued and contested before the district court as well as before the appellate court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-8\">B. <em>The court correctly determined that Fruehaufs limited \u201crepair or replace\u201d remedy failed of its essential purpose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-9\">1. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-10\">Fruehauf argues that the trial court erred in its rulings concerning the Washington version of Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d) \u00a7 2-719, Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7 62A.2-719.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The April 13, 1977 sales order contains a limitation-of-remedies clause which purports to limit the buyer\u2019s remedies to repair or replacement. Such a clause is valid only if that remedy fulfills its \u201cessential purpose\u201d when the buyer seeks to enforce it. Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7 62A.2-719(2). The trial court held that as a matter of law Fruehauf\u2019s limited remedy failed of its essential purpose. In its order denying a new trial, the court stated that \u201cthe facts show nothing but a callous disregard by [Fruehauf] for the purposes for which the. exclusive repair-or-replacement remedy was designed \u2014 to insure that [Fiorito] would acquire defect-free trucks.\u201d Fruehauf raises two objections to the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue: first, that this was a question for the jury; and second, that the court\u2019s substantive conclusion was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-19\">2. <em>The court correctly answered the question as a matter of law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-20\">Fruehauf baldly asserts that \u201cfailure of essential purpose is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d Under Washington law, however, a court commits error if it submits an issue to the jury without substantial evidence to support it. <em>See Hughey v. Winthrop Motor Co., </em>61 Wash.2d 227, 377 P.2d 640 (1963); <em>Shipp v. Curtis, </em>318 F.2d 797 (9th Cir.1963) (applying Washington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>law); <em>Bean v. Stephens, </em>18 Wash.App. 364, 534 P.2d 1047 (1975). The testimony here showed that Fruehauf failed completely to honor its own repair or replace remedy, which represents a failure of essential purpose. The absence of substantial evidence to support Fruehauf s position meant that there was no issue of failure of essential purpose for the jury to decide. Therefore, the trial court was correct in not sending the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">3. <em>The court\u2019s decision was correct on the merits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">Fruehauf also makes the related argument that the court incorrectly decided, on the merits, that Fruehauf s limited remedy failed of its essential purpose. However, under any standard of review, the court\u2019s conclusion was correct. Denial of responsibility to repair is a failure of a limited remedy in the most basic sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">In <em>Lidstrand v. Silvercrest Industries, </em>28 Wash.App. 359, 365, 623 P.2d 710, 714 (1981), a Washington appeals court said that \u201c[Unreasonable delays in repairing or inability to repair a product where the manufacturer has promised such repairs causes a limited remedy to \u2018fail of its essential purpose\u2019 [within the meaning of \u00a7 62A.2-719(2) ].\u201d <em>See also Marr Enterprises, Inc. v. Lewis Refrigeration Co., </em>556 F.2d 951, 955 (9th Cir.1977) (citing with approval cases which hold that a remedy fails of its essential purpose where \u201cthe seller fail[s] to replace or repair in a reasonably prompt and non-negligent manner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-8\">Here, the court found that Fruehauf \u201carbitrarily decline[d] to made necessary repairs,\u201d and thus \u201carbitrarily and unreasonably declined to live up to its contractual promises.\u201d The court compared this case to <em>Soo Line Railroad Co. v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>547 F.2d 1365 (8th Cir.1977), which held that under the Minnesota version of the UCC (which contains language identical to \u00a7 62A.2-719(2)), \u201ca limited remedy fails of its purpose whenever the seller fails to repair goods within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>Soo Line, </em>547 F.2d at 1371 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-10\">The evidence in the record overwhelmingly supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Fiorito first notified Fruehauf of problems with the dump bodies orally, shortly after delivery, but received no response. Fiorito wrote Fruehauf in October, 1977, setting out a \u201clist of problems in the hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical systems.\u201d Fruehauf responded by letter on Nov. 4, 1977, stating that some of the complaints had to be inspected, that some had already been inspected, and suggesting ways in which the other problems could be corrected. When Fruehauf\u2019s service manager came to Fiorito\u2019s shop to inspect the bodies, he denied that the bodies were covered under warranty. This service manager admitted at trial that he is not an engineer, has no knowledge of the effects of hauling wet cement, and did not seek to gain any such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-11\">In April, 1980, Fiorito again wrote to Fruehauf, stating that Fiorito had had to repair the bodies itself since Fruehauf had refused to do so. Fruehauf responded by letter dated May 27, 1980, stating that \u201cwe have lived up to our warranty obligations as stated on the reverse side of our sales order.\u201d In June, 1980, Fiorito wrote to Fruehauf, demanding a full refund or replacement of the bodies. A July 10, 1980 letter from Fruehauf to Fiorito stated that Fruehauf had concluded an \u201cinvestigation\u201d which \u201crevealed that the product was misused.\u201d At trial, however, Fruehauf admitted that there was no such investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-12\">Based on these facts, the district court correctly concluded that Fruehauf\u2019s limited \u201crepair or replace\u201d remedy had failed of its essential purpose as a matter of Washington law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-13\">C. <em>The court correctly concluded that the failure of the limited remedy invalidated Fruehaufs disclaimer of consequential damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">Fruehauf next claims that the court erred in holding that under the circumstances of this case the failure of the limited remedy invalidated the disclaimer of consequential damages. The April, 1977 sales order contains a clause stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>\u201cseller shall have no liability for any ... consequential damages arising out of this order.\u201d The trial court concluded that under the facts of this case, the failure of the remedy rendered the consequential damages clause unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">Resolution of this issue requires an examination of the interrelationship of subsections (2) and (3) of Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7 62A.2-719. Subsection (2) states that \u201c[w]here circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Title.\u201d Consequential damages are authorized by Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7 62A.2-714(3) and 2-715(2). Subsection (3) of 2-719 states that \u201c[consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">The parties and the trial court agree that the Washington courts have not spoken directly to this issue. In such a situation, our task is to use \u201cour own best judgment in predicting how the state\u2019s highest court would decide the case.\u201d <em>Takahashi v. Loomis Armored Car Service, </em>625 F.2d 314, 316 (9th Cir.1980). Washington courts have held that failure of the essential purpose of a limited remedy makes consequential damages available pursuant to \u00a7 62A.2-719(2). <em>See, e.g., Lidstrand v. Silvercrest Industries, </em>28 Wash.App. 359, 623 P.2d 710 (1981). But no Washington court has been faced with a situation in which the seller has both a limited-remedy clause and a separate clause disclaiming consequential damages, then asserts that failure of the limited remedy does not affect the validity of the damages clause under \u00a7 62A.2~719(3). While each side makes a plausible argument on the issue, we prefer Fiorito\u2019s position, which was accepted by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">Fruehauf claims that under subsection (3), the consequential damages clause is always valid unless unconscionable, even if the remedy clause fails of its essential purpose. It cites cases from the Third, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits in support of its broad proposition. Upon examination, however, the majority of the cases support Fiorito\u2019s position that each case and each contract must be judged on its own merits. For example, <em>S.M. Wilson &amp; Co. v. Smith International, Inc., </em>587 F.2d 1363 (9th Cir.1978), held that a separate consequential damages clause remained valid despite the failure of a remedy clause, but stated that its \u201cholding is based upon the facts of this case ... and is not intended to establish that a consequential damage bar always survives a failure of the limited repair remedy. Each case must stand on its own facts.\u201d 587 F.2d at 1375-76. In <em>Wilson, </em>the court found that the parties had expressly bargained for both clauses and that the seller \u201cdid not ignore his obligation to repair; he was simply unable to perform it.\u201d 587 F.2d at 1375. Neither factor is present here. Similarly, the court in <em>Chatlos Systems v. National Cash Register Corp., </em>635 F.2d 1081 (3d Cir.1980), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>457 U.S. 1112, 102 S.Ct. 2918, 73 L.Ed.2d 1323 (1982), while stating that it saw \u201cno reason to hold, as a general proposition, that the failure of the limited remedy ..., without more, invalidates a wholly distinct term in the agreement excluding consequential damages,\u201d also recognized that \u201ccircumstances resulting in failure of performance [could] make[ ] it unconscionable to enforce the parties\u2019 allocation of risk.\u201d 635 F.2d at 1086-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-8\">Fruehauf relies most strongly on <em>Lewis Refrigeration v. Sawyer Fruit, Vegetable &amp; Cold Storage Co., </em>709 F.2d 427 (6th Cir.1983), a diversity case decided under Washington law. There, the court reasoned that \u201csection 2-719(3) is meant to allow freedom in excluding consequential damages unless a consumer is involved in the contract.\u201d 709 F.2d at 435. The court concluded that a consequential damage limitation should be enforced unless \u201cunconscionable,\u201d even where a limited repair remedy failed of its essential purpose. 709 F.2d at 431, 435. We are not bound by <em>Lewis Refrigeration, </em>of course, and decline to follow it. The Washington courts, we believe, will opt for the case-by-case determination method of resolving this issue, as called for in <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Chatios. </em>Judging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>each case and each contract on its own merits will better allow courts to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions regarding risk allocation and will lead less frequently to unjust results.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">Judge McGovern\u2019s approach in this case is both logically sound and supported by the weight of authority. In its order denying Fruehauf\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court explained its reasoning, with which we agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-6\">[The approach] that the Washington courts can be expected to follow, is to examine individually the provisions of each contract to ascertain the intent of the parties. Under the circumstances of each contract, are the exclusive-remedy and damage-exclusion terms separable elements of risk allocation, ... [o]r are they inseparable parts of a unitary package of risk-allocation? In the current case, it does not make sense to view the exclusive-remedy and consequential-damage provisions independently. The purpose of the parties in agreeing to this exclusive-remedy provision was to [i]nsure that the Plaintiff would not suffer from down time and other such consequential harms that follow from defective conditions in the trucks____ <em>It cannot be maintained that it was the parties\u2019 intention that Defendant be enabled to avoid all consequential liability for breach by first agreeing to an alternative remedy provision designed to avoid consequential harms, and then scuttling that alternative remedy through its recalcitrance in honoring the agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">A number of cases interpreting other states\u2019 versions of the UCC support this reasoning. For example, in <em>Soo Line Railroad Co. v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>547 F.2d 1365, 1373 (8th Cir.1977), the Eighth Circuit said that \u201cthe fundamental intent of section 2-719(2) reflects that a remedial limitation\u2019s failure of essential purpose makes available all contractual remedies, including consequential damages authorized pursuant to sections 2-714 and 2-715.\u201d Similarly, the court in <em>Jones &amp; McKnight Corp. v. Birdsboro Corp., </em>320 F.Supp. 39, 43-44 (N.D.Ill.1970), reasoned that a seller could not be allowed \u201cto shelter itself behind one segment of the warranty when it has allegedly repudiated and ignored its very limited obligations under another segment of the same warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">The Official Comments to 2-719 also support the trial court\u2019s reasoning and conclusion. The Official Comments on the Uniform Commercial Code provide, under the heading \u201cPurposes:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-12\">Under this section parties are left free to shape their remedies to their particular requirements and reasonable agreements limiting or modifying remedies are. to be given effect____ [A]ny clause purporting to modify or limit the remedial provisions of this Article in an unconscionable manner is subject to deletion and in that event the remedies made available by this Article are applicable____ [U]nder subsection (2), where an apparently fair and reasonable clause because of circumstances fails in its purpose ... it must give way to the general remedy provisions of this Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-16\">The Official Washington Comments further explain that subsection 2 \u201crelates to contractual arrangements which become oppressive by change of circumstances; [subsection 3], to contracts oppressive at inception.\u201d Here, the trial court correctly found that circumstances during performance rendered the damages limitation clause oppressive and invalid. The court did not believe that the clause was \u201coppressive at inception;\u201d in fact, the trial judge stated in his order denying a new trial that the clause was <em>\u201cnot </em>unconscionable, because of the parties\u2019 relatively equal bargaining positions, sophistication, etc.\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-17\">In summary, the trial court correctly held that in this case, the failure of the exclusive-remedy clause rendered the consequential-damages clause unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-18\">II. THE COURT\u2019S JURY INSTRUCTIONS WERE PROPER.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-19\">A. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-20\">When reviewing jury instructions, this court must ask \u201cwhether, viewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>jury instructions as a whole, the trial judge gave adequate instructions on each element of the case to insure that the jury fully understood the issues.\u201d <em>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm\u2019n v. N.F.L., </em>726 F.2d 1381, 1398 (9th Cir.1984). <em>Accord, Wellman v. Jellison, </em>593 F.2d 876, 878 (9th Cir.1979) (question is whether \u201cthe instructions as a whole gave the jury enough guidance to intelligently determine the questions presented\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">Fruehauf makes two attacks on the court\u2019s jury instructions: first, that the jury was improperly instructed on the issue of notice to seller of defects in the dump bodies; and second, that \u201cthe instructions as a whole were heavily weighted in the purchaser\u2019s favor and wholly failed to submit appellant\u2019s theory of the case to the jury.\u201d Neither of these contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">First, Instruction No. 9 adequately advised the jury of Fiorito\u2019s duty to notify Fruehauf of defects before Fruehauf could be held responsible for breach of warranty. The instruction stated that the jury could not find breach unless it found that \u201cFruehauf failed to make repairs under the represented warranty <em>after due and proper notice </em>of the defects had been given by Fiorito to Fruehauf.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Fruehauf\u2019s objections to this instruction are overly technical:</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">Second, the court\u2019s instructions when viewed as a whole appear to be entirely proper. A party is not entitled to a jury instruction phrased exactly as it desires; rather, an instruction is proper if it adequately allows the party to argue its theory of the case to the jury. <em>See Sanderson v. Chapman, </em>487 F.2d 264, 267 (9th Cir.1973). Fruehauf\u2019s objections to the jury instructions appear to be based on the erroneous belief that the court should have embraced its substantive theories. Nothing in the record or in the case law undercuts the trial court\u2019s view of its own instructions, which it explained in its order denying a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-10\">[Tjhis case was not as complicated and difficult as [Fruehauf] tries to suggest____ [Fruehauf] was fully enabled to make a closing statement and to highlight such parts of the court\u2019s instructions as it saw fit. [Fruehauf\u2019s] theories are accurately summarized in the court\u2019s instructions, and [Fruehauf] was allowed to argue therefrom. That is all that fairness requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-12\">In summary, Fruehauf\u2019s contention that the jury instructions were improperly slanted in favor of Fiorito is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-14\">The trial court\u2019s challenged rulings and jury instructions were proper in all relevant respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-15\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1387-7\">.
