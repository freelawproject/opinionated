(Black Hills), as the prevailing party in <em>Clifford, v. Janklow, </em>733 F.2d 534 (8th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-12\">Black Hills originally sued the state in a class action alleging due process and equal protection violations in the state\u2019s administration of the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP), for fiscal 1983. The district court enjoined the state from categorically excluding residents of subsidized and public housing, <em>Crawford v. Janklow, </em>557 F.Supp. 1146 (D.S.D.1983), and this Court affirmed. <em>Crawford v. Janklow, </em>710 F.2d 1321 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-16\">This case involves the state\u2019s revised LIEAP plan for fiscal 1984. That plan, which this Court characterized as having \u201ca surface appeal of rationality,\u201d <em>Clifford, </em>733 F.2d at 534, designates public housing residents as \u201cpartially vulnerable\u201d to heating costs because their housing subsidies took into account heating expenses. Other low income citizens not residing in subsidized housing are \u201cfully vulnerable\u201d to heating costs and need not prove actual heating expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 536. The district court expedited its consideration of the plan and, in January 1984, found that the state\u2019s method of administration violated LIHEAA provisions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8624(b)(5), 8624(b)(8) &amp; 8624(f). This Court affirmed on its reading of the latter two sections. <em>Id. </em>at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-17\">Attorney\u2019s fees are entrusted to the district court\u2019s discretion, and this Court will not find an abuse of discretion \u201cunless the record clearly supports such a conclusion.\u201d <em>Bowman v. Pulaski County Special School District, </em>723 F.2d 640, 646 (8th Cir.1983). On the record in this case we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-18\">The state contends that the similarity of this case to <em>Crawford </em>suggests that Black Hill\u2019s legal work should have benefited from repetition of similar issues, and their fee should be smaller. Despite superficial similarities, the cases differed enough to require additional work. The district court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-19\">a more full and complete record was made at trial on the merits by plaintiffs, and that although many of the legal issues were similar, in the instant case the factual and legal issues were sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>different to judge the instant case complex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\"><em>Clifford v. Janklow, </em>No. 83-3092, Slip op. at 2 (D.S.D. March 2, 1984), <em>aff'd, </em>733 F.2d 534 (8th Cir.1984). This Court agreed, declaring that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-6\">[t]he question presented in this case is different than the one we confronted in <em>Crawford </em>in that the State has reduced the benefit levels for subsidized housing residents \u2014 sometimes down to zero \u2014 instead of categorically excluding them from the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\"><em>Clifford, </em>733 F.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">The district court also noted that Black Hills attorneys attended settlement negotiations in Pierre and that they made greater use of expedited pretrial interrogatories in constructing the record at trial, which required the devotion of greater time and resources. In making these pretrial preparations and in trying the case, it seems reasonable that Black Hills assigned two attorneys to the case, a practice which this Court has previously approved in complex eases. <em>See Avalon Cinema Corp. v. Thompson, </em>689 F.2d 137, 139 (8th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">After careful review of the record, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in its award of attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1306-13\">. The Honorable Donald J. Porter, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1306-14\">. Appellants contend that appellees were not the prevailing party because, on the date their brief was submitted, the appeal had not been decided. The following day, this Court affirmed on the merits. <em>Clifford v. Janklow, </em>733 F.2d 534 (8th Cir.1984). This decision moots appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
