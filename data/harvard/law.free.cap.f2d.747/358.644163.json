The Trader mark Examiner, however, already had ruled in May 1978 that the mark \u201cINDUCT-O-MATIC\u201d was entitled to registration over Inductotherm\u2019s registered mark, \u201cINDUCTO.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In October 1978, Inductotherm filed suit against IOM in the United States District Court of New Jersey, which dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction. IOM then filed an action for declaratory judgment in the United States District Court of Michigan on February 1, 1979, seeking a determination that IOM\u2019s use of \u201cINDUCT-O-MATIC\u201d did not result in any trademark infringement, unfair competition, or false designation of origin in regard to Inductotherm\u2019s registered trademark, \u201cINDUCTO.\u201d Inductotherm, counterclaiming, contended that such usage did result in these violations of law. IOM appeals from the judgment of the district court granting Inductotherm an injunction prohibiting IOM\u2019s further use of the mark \u201cINDUCT-O-MATIC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">Inductotherm began repairing and servicing induction heating and melting equipment in 1953 under that name. In 1954, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Inductotherm began using the term \u201cINDUCTO\u201d and the tradename \u201cInductotherm\u201d on its equipment and since 1957 has been manufacturing and selling this equipment throughout the United States, including the State of Michigan. On July 14, 1964, Inductotherm became the owner of United States Trademark Registration No. 773,193 for the trademark, \u201cINDUCTO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AmP\">IOM, chartered as a Michigan corporation, began doing business under the trade-name \u201cInduct-O-Matic\u201d and began using the mark \u201cINDUCT-O-MATIC\u201d on or about January 4, 1961. Prior to 1969, its business consisted primarily of rebuilding and repairing induction equipment; thereafter, it began selling induction heating equipment in various states under its trade-name and mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The district court first considered and granted relief on Inductotherm\u2019s counterclaim of trademark infringement by IOM in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114. Under the Act, the test of trademark infringement is \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d as to the source of origin. <em>See, e.g., WSM, Inc. v. Tennessee Sales Co., </em>709 F.2d 1084, 1086 (6th Cir.1983). This Court has adopted a two-level test for reviewing lower court findings of likelihood of confusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">[T]he determination of what is the state of affairs regarding each factor .... [considered by the lower court in determining whether there is a likelihood of confusion] is a finding of fact reviewed on the clearly erroneous standard, but the further determination of the likelihood of confusion based on those factors is a legal conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\"><em>Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. Elby\u2019s Big Boy, </em>670 F.2d 642, 651 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>459 U.S. 916, 103 S.Ct. 231, 74 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982) (quoting <em>Alpha Industries, Inc. v. Alpha Steel Tube &amp; Shapes, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 440, 443-44 (9th Cir.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">In reaching its holding that there was a likelihood of confusion between Induetotherm\u2019s trademark, \u201cINDUCTO,\u201d and IOM\u2019s tradename and mark, \u201cINDUCT-OMATIC,\u201d the district court considered the following list of factors, which are in substantial conformity with those relevant factors on this issue set forth by this Circuit in <em>Frisch\u2019s Restaurant, </em>670 F.2d at 648:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">1) the degree of similarity between the marks in appearance, sound, and connotation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">2) the similarity of goods or services for which the marks are used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-12\">3) the area and manner of concurrent use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">4) the strength of the defendant\u2019s mark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-14\">5) the sophistication of the purchasers of the relevant goods;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-15\">6) plaintiff\u2019s intent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-16\">7) and any instances of actual confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">The district court found a high degree of similarity between \u201cINDUCTO\u201d and \u201cINDUCT-O-MATIC,\u201d noting that \u201ca sophisticated witness and possible purchaser ... indicated that \u2018INDUCT-O-MATIC\u2019 would connote a product produced by [Inductotherm].\u201d The court also found that \u201cthe differences in lettering and hyphenating are very slight, and likely to cause confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-18\">This finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">IOM contends that the differences in spelling, number of syllables, the use of hyphens, and sound and visual appearance establish little likelihood of confusion between the marks at issue. We agree with the district court that these differences are slight and unlikely to prevent confusion. The use of hyphens distinguishes between the two marks only on a visual level since this difference is absent when the words are spoken. Other distinguishing factors cited by IOM depend solely on the addition of \u201cMATIC\u201d to its trademark. We agree with the district court that this is a weak and nondistinctive term. The latter aspect of our holding is discussed more fully in our review of the district court\u2019s ruling in regard to the strength of Inductotherm\u2019s trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-20\">The District court\u2019s finding that the marks in question are used on similar goods also is not clearly erroneous. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>district court correctly noted that IOM sells primarily induction heating equipment, whereas Inductotherm sells primarily induction melting equipment. Since most of Inductotherm\u2019s equipment can also be used for induction heating, the effect of the differences in the equipment is greatly lessened. Moreover, Inductotherm does sell some induction <em>heating </em>equipment and also performs virtually all of the services offered by IOM.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">IOM\u2019s argument that it does not directly compete with Inductotherm is belied by its failure to contest the district court\u2019s finding in regard to concurrent use that \u201cboth parties sell in the same states, have some identical c\u00fastomers, and have the same competitors.\u201d Moreover, the similarity of goods and services offered by IOM and Inductotherm indicates the probability of direct competition. In any event, \u201cdirect competition between the products is not a prerequisite to protective relief.\u201d <em>Continental Motors Corp. v. Continental Aviation Corp., </em>375 F.2d 857, 861 (5th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In regard to the fourth factor, the district court found that \u201cINDUCTO\u201d was a strong mark, \u201cdistinctive in its tendency to identify the goods sold under that mark as emanating from ... [Inductotherm].\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the district court found that \u201cINDUCTO\u201d was a coined word with no dictionary or technical meaning, under which Inductotherm has had a large volume of sales and has established an excellent reputation. In contrast, it found IOM\u2019s mark to be \u201cweak and undistinctive,\u201d noting that \u201c[t]he \u2018matic\u2019 suffix indicates automatic, and is widely used in trademarks for this purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">IOM argues that the district court erred in failing to recognize that \u201cinduct\u201d is a common English word, meaning to lead in, introduce or induce, that is suggestive of induction, and refers to a number of trademark registrations incorporating the word \u201cinduct\u201d by third parties engaged in the electromagnetic induction field. We agree with the district court that these registrations do not, on the whole,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dilute any distinctive nature \u201cINDUCTO\u201d may have since these registrations do not involve products that compete with IOM and Inductotherm. <em>See, e.g., Price-Pfister Brass Mfg. Co. v. Milwaukee Faucets, Inc., </em>311 F.2d 817, 818 (C.C.P.A.1963). We find, however, that the district court was in error in its finding that \u201cINDUCTO\u201d was a \u201ccoined\u201d word, which implies that it is an arbitrary or fanciful term. As noted in <em>Miller Brewing Co. v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., </em>561 F.2d 75, 79 (7th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied </em>434 U.S. 1025, 98 S.Ct. 751, 54 L.Ed.2d 772 (1978) (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">A term for. which trademark protection is claimed will fit somewhere in the spectrum which ranges through (1) generic or common descriptive and (2) merely descriptive to (3) suggestive and (4) arbitrary or fanciful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">J{: * * <em>'M </em>sfc J)c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">A generic or common descriptive term is one which is commonly used as the name or description of a kind of goods.

Langfield, </em>134 F.2d 899 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>320 U.S. 743, 64 S.Ct. 44, 88 L.Ed. 441 (1943), clearly held that trademarks at issue must be broken down into their component parts in order to determine their appropriate class in the trademark spectrum. As between \u201cSonventol\u201d and \u201cSolvite,\u201d the marks at issue in <em>Langfield, </em>the court ruled that the component common to each term was descriptive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">Neither of the marks in question is of that class known as arbitrary or fanciful. Each falls quite clearly into the class of suggestive marks characteristic of the product exemplified. <em>Morgan\u2019s Sons Co. v. Ward, </em>7 Cir., 152 F. 690, 12 L.R.A., N.S., 729. Such trade-marks may be valid but as to them the field is open to other traders to employ equally suggestive marks provided only that they be not deceptively similar. <em>Ostermoor &amp; Co. v. Rose Spring &amp; Mattress Co., </em>55 App.D.C. 307, 5 F.2d 268; <em>Citrus Soap Company v. Royal Lemon Products Company, </em>8 Cir., 2 F.2d 972. The word \u201csolvent\u201d is purely descriptive of any cleaning compound whether semi-solid or liquid and \u201cSol\u201d has been used so long by businesses as part of a trade-mark name for cleaning compounds that neither use of the prefix \u201cSolvent\u201d nor the prefix \u201cSol\u201d may be so exclusively appropriated by one manufacturer or tradesman as to wholly deny its use in any manner by others. The idea sought to be conveyed to the mind of the purchaser by the respective trade-marks of the parties to these proceedings is that each is selling a solvent for use in cleaning, and while the prefix \u201cSol\u201d or \u201cSolvent\u201d is common to both marks, each is but descriptive of the product indicated, and being of common right, neither party can claim the exclusive use of either, alone or as the dominating element of a compound word.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 902-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In the instant case, analysis of the component parts of the marks at issue clearly indicates that \u201cINDUCTO\u201d is not an arbitrary or fanciful term. The district court was in error to the extent that it implied otherwise in ruling that \u201cINDUCTO\u201d had no dictionary or technical meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">The dominant common component in each mark at issue is \u201cinduct.\u201d As noted earlier, this word has a known meaning, to lead, introduce or induce. We agree with IOM that this term is a suggestive one in that it suggests to the imaginative that each company is engaged in the electromagnetic induction field, as opposed to describing a particular product for a particular use, as in <em>Langfield.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">The court in <em>Langfield </em>further directed that \u201cdescriptive letters, syllables or phrases\u201d be eliminated in determining whether two trademarks are deceptively similar. 134 F.2d at 903. In applying this test to the case before it, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-14\">The suffixes \u201cvite\u201d [in Solvite] and \u201ctol\u201d [in Solventol] distinguish one combination from the other and give an identifying character to the trade designation which makes it unlikely that one trademark could, with the exercise of ordinary care, be mistaken for or be confused with the other. They look unlike, are spelled differently and are phonetically dissimilar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">In the instant case, \u201co\u201d is a descriptive vowel common to \u201cINDUCTO\u201d and \u201cINDUCT-O-MATIC\u201d and must therefore be deleted under our ruling in <em>Langfield. </em>Thus, only the term \u201cmatic\u201d distinguishes the two marks. \u201cMatic\u201d is clearly a descriptive phrase, and, as found by the district court, indicates automation. As such, it also requires deletion. Accordingly, unlike the situation in <em>Langfield, </em>there is no \u201cidentifying character to the trade designa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tions\u201d of \u201cINDUCTO\u201d and \u201cINDUCT-OMATIC,\u201d other than the suggestive term common to both, \u201cinduct,\u201d that makes it unlikely that one trademark will be mistaken for another.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Application of the <em>Langfield </em>test leads to the conclusion that \u201cINDUCT-O-MATIC\u201d is deceptively similar to \u201cINDUCTO.\u201d Our discussion and application of this test with regard to the fourth factor of trademark strength are in response to defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cINDUCTO,\u201d because it contains \u201cinduct,\u201d is a weak trademark, and indicate the district court\u2019s error in determining that \u201cINDUCTO\u201d was a strong mark because it had no dictionary or technical meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Generally, proof of secondary meaning is not required with regard to a suggestive term, <em>Miller, </em>561 F.2d at 79, nor by the owner of a registered trademark, <em>Roto-Rooter Corp. v. O\u2019Neal, </em>513 F.2d 44, 46-47 (5th Cir.1975). We note, however, that the other bases for the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cINDUCTO\u201d was a strong mark, the heavy advertising by Inductotherm employing its trademark over a number of years and the well established reputation of Inductotherm as a leader in the induction field, is supported by the record, but this is insufficient to support a conclusion of a strong mark under all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We also point out that at least one court has indicated that if a mark has become incontestable under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> its lack of distinctiveness cannot be raised in litigation. <em>See Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 366, 377, 381 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 830, 97 S.Ct. 91, 50 L.Ed.2d 94 (1976). <em>But cf. Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc., </em>718 F.2d 327, 331 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe law in this circuit ... is different [from <em>Union Carbide, supra]. </em>[A] registrant [cannot] use the incontestable status of its mark ... offensively, as a sword to enjoin another\u2019s use.\u201d), <em>cert. granted to resolve conflict, </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1438, 79 L.Ed.2d 760 (1984). Finally, we note that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2l\">[W]hether a mark is regarded as \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d, \u201coriginal, arbitrary, fanciful\u201d or \u201cgeneric, descriptive, geographic\u201d is but one of the elements to be considered in determining whether confusion is likely to result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-12\"><em>Continental Motors Corp., </em>375 F.2d at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">In regard to the fifth factor, the court found that the purchasing of a \u201clarge order is done by sophisticated buyers\u201d who \u201cwould not be readily confused,\u201d but that those persons handling the purchase \u201cof components and parts are not as sophisticated and thus would likely be confused.\u201d It has been observed that the \u201cexpertise of purchasers does not always assure the absence' of confusion.\u201d <em>Communications Satellite Corp. v. Comcet, Inc., </em>429 F.2d 1245, 1252 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>400 U.S. 942, 91 S.Ct. 240, 27 L.Ed.2d 245 (1970). Further, as noted in <em>Wincharger Corp. v. Rinco., Inc., </em>297 F.2d 261, 264 (C.C.P.A.1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\">[I]n most instances technicians would use the products of either party and they are a discriminating group of people but that does not eliminate the likelihood of purchaser confusion here. Being skilled in their own art does not necessarily preclude their mistaking one trademark for another when the marks are as simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>lar as those here in issue, and cover merchandise in the same general field.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">We have some question as to whether this factor was adequately analyzed by the district court, but in finding that the marks at issue are similar and cover competing, goods, we also find under the foregoing authority that the district court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the factor of purchaser sophistication \u201calso militates against [IOM].\u201d This is a close question and not a determinative factor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In regard to the important sixth factor, the district court found that IOM\u2019s \u201cintent was not clear,\u201d but that IOM knew of Inductotherm\u2019s trademark when IOM adopted its name. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1C\">It is the law <em>[see, e.g., USM, Inc., </em>709 F.2d at 1087 n. 1] that a jr. user is charged with the obligation to avoid the adoption of a trademark which might be confused with a sr. mark ____ Where plaintiff knew of the sr. mark and nevertheless proceeded to adopt a similar mark, he assumes a risk, and all doubt should be resolved in favor of the senior user.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">IOM argues initially that the district court made no finding that it had knowledge of Inductotherm\u2019s trademark. The district court in the following Finding of Fact referred to IOM\u2019s knowledge of Inductotherm rather than its knowledge of \u201cINDUCTO\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">84. Given the sales volume of defendant, its advertising and reputation, and. also considering the contradictory testimony surrounding the selection of the name Induct-O-Matic, the court finds that D. DeArment [President of IOM] <em>knew of Inductotherm </em>when the name Induct-O-Matic was selected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">In its Conclusions of Law, however, the court twice referred to IOM\u2019s knowledge of the <em>trademark, </em>\u201cINDUCTO,\u201d making reference to Finding of Fact # 84. We conclude, however, that the record does not support a finding that IOM had knowledge of Inductotherm\u2019s trademark when IOM adopted its name.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">The district court did not make a factual finding that IOM knew of the \u201cINDUCTO\u201d mark, only that Mr. DeArment, IOM\u2019s president, knew of Inductotherm. Even if we assume that its failure to include knowledge of \u201cINDUCTO\u201d in its factual finding was merely inadvertent, since it did conclude as a matter of law that IOM knew of Inductotherm\u2019s trademark when it adopted its name, there is no sufficient basis for such a finding. The district court bases its finding first on the sales volume of defendant-appellee. Inductotherm began selling \u201cINDUCTO\u201d trademark equipment in 1957 and sold such marked equipment in Michigan beginning in 1958. Its national sales volume in 1959 was only $1,093,479 and in 1960, $1,616,988. Michigan sales were 8% to 10% of the total, or less than $160,000 in the larger sales volume year. Those, two years are critical since IOM adopted its name before its incorporation on January 4, 1961. The district judge also concluded, inconsistently, that Inductotherm did not learn of IOM until 1975, even though the latter had over one million dollars in annual sales by 1970, primarily in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">To support its finding and conclusion of knowledge, the district court also relied on advertising. It made a finding that Inductotherm began advertising in <em>Metal Progress, </em>a trade journal, in 1960, and that Mr. DeArment had subscribed to <em>Metal-Progress </em>for twenty years. However, the earliest <em>Metal Progress </em>advertisement in evidence was in the December 1960 issue which came out in 1961. Thus, it provides no basis for finding Mr. DeArment knew of Inductotherm or \u201cINDUCTO\u201d before January 4, 1961. Inductotherm\u2019s total advertising budget for 1958 was only $17,900; in 1959, $13,800; and in 1960, $20,000. Those sums would hardly provide a basis for an assumption or a reasonable inference of knowledge of Inductotherm in 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">Finally, the district court relied on the contradictory testimony surrounding the selection of the name \u201cINDUCT-O-MAT-IC.\u201d Three witnesses testified about' the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>selection of the corporate name prior to incorporation. All denied they had heard of Inductotherm or its mark \u201cINDUCTO.\u201d The three did not agree on all the persons present at the meeting when the name was adopted and there was some disagreement as to the specific person who suggested that they adopt \u201cINDUCT-O-MATIC.\u201d The meeting had occurred more than twenty years before the trial. It was for the trial judge to weigh their credibility but it was undisputed that the corporate name was registered on January 4, 1961, and so must have been adopted <em>before </em>that date. It was immaterial which of those present when the name was adopted suggested the name, since there was simply no evidence that any of them knew of Inductotherm or its mark \u201cINDUCTO.\u201d Merely because there was some disagreement about a meeting twenty years before does not provide a basis for finding that one of those present knew of Inductotherm and, more importantly, of \u201cINDUCTO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The district court\u2019s finding that Mr. DeArment knew of the trademark \u201cINDUCTO\u201d in January 1961 is therefore clearly erroneous. IOM has established its good faith usage and is entitled to use the mark \u201cINDUCT-O-MATIC\u201d in Macomb County, Michigan and other Michigan counties where it was first local user.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We are also disposed to agree with IOM\u2019s argument that the district court employed an incorrect <em>rationale </em>in finding that IOM was not entitled to the \u201cgood faith prior use\u201d defense, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b)(5), to the Act\u2019s incontestability provision, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Section 1065 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">The right of the registrant to use [its] registered mark in commerce for the goods or services on or in connection with which such registered mark has been in continuous use for five consecutive years subsequent to the date of such registration and is still in use in commerce, is incontestable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Section 1115(b)(5) provides (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">(b) If the right to use the registered mark has become incontestable under section 1065 of this title, the registration shall be conclusive evidence of the registrant\u2019s exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the affidavit filed under the provisions of said section 1065 subject to any conditions or limitations stated therein ... except when one of the following defenses or defects is established:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">(5) That the mark whose use by a party is charged as an infringement <em>was adopted without knowledge of the registrant\u2019s prior use </em>and has been continuously used by such party or those in privity with him from a date prior to registration of the mark under this chapter or publication of the registered mark under subsection (c) of section 1062 of this title: Provided, however, that this defense or defect shall apply only for the area in which such continuous prior use is proved____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">In <em>Old Dutch Foods, Inc. v. Dan Dee Pretzel &amp; Potato Chip Co., </em>477 F.2d 150 (6th Cir.1973), this Court held that the adoption and use of a mark in certain areas by one whose use antedated the registration of a similar mark by another but postdated the registrant\u2019s use in other areas has exclusive rights under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b)(3) to use its mark in the area it has preempted through use of its mark, <em>when that mark was adopted without knowledge of the prior use in other areas by the registrant. </em>This defense seems available to IOM because, as earlier determined, the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that IOM had knowledge of Inductotherm\u2019s mark when it incorporated in Michigan and began employing its mark. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that IOM could not invoke the \u00a7 1115(b)(5) defense was not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">In regard to the seventh factor, the district court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">[T]here was no evidence of actual confusion. Although this is a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>consideration, this finding is far from determinative, since it is not clear how such confusion would actually come to light.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">IOM concedes, as it must, that \u201cactual confusion need not be established in order to find trademark infringement,\u201d but argues that \u201cthe absence of any actual confusion over more than 21 years is strong evidence that there is no likelihood of confusion.\u201d We find it significant that the Trademark Examiner initially refused to register IOM\u2019s mark in 1978 because of likelihood of confusion between IOM\u2019s mark and Inductotherm\u2019s previously registered mark. <em>See supra </em>note 1. Since we have found that several conclusions on which the district court relied in making a decision are clearly erroneous, we conclude albeit reluctantly that we should remand this controversy to the district court for further consideration in light of these holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The district court also found that IOM violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) pertaining to the false designation of origin counterclaim raised by IOM, and that IOM violated Michigan common law relating to unfair competition. Because we have concluded that we must remand this controversy for the reasons discussed, we also remand for reconsideration the district court\u2019s judgment for Inductotherm on these counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The final argument raised by IOM, that Inductotherm is barred from injunctive relief by laches, will need to be reconsidered on remand as well. This court noted in <em>United States v. Weintraub, </em>613 F.2d 612, 619 (6th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied </em>447 U.S. 905, 100 S.Ct. 2987, 64 L.Ed.2d 854 (1980) (quoting <em>Costello v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 265, 282, 81 S.Ct. 534, 543, 5 L.Ed.2d 551 (1961)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">\u201cLaches requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense.\u201d [L]aches is an equitable defense and ... it can certainly be raised only by one who comes into equity with clean hands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The Supreme Court in <em>Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, </em>240 U.S. 403, 419, 36 S.Ct. 357, 362, 60 L.Ed. 713 (1916), further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">As to laches and acquiescence, it has been repeatedly held, in [trademark] cases where defendants acted fraudulently or with knowledge of plaintiffs\u2019 rights, that relief by injunction would be accorded ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">Since we have held that the district court was in error in ruling that IOM had knowledge of Inductotherm\u2019s use of \u201cINDUCTO\u201d when it adopted its mark, this argument may be found to have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Accordingly, we remand this controversy to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-12\">. The Trademark Examiner initially rejected IOM's registration application on the ground that the mark \"INDUCT-O-MATIC\u201d was confusingly similar to Inductotherm\u2019s \"INDUCTO\" trademark. The application was approved on IOM\u2019s assertion by affidavit that its goods did not compete with those sold by Inductotherm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">. One third party registration, \"Inductron,\" by TOCCO Company does appear to relate to products that are in competition with those of IOM, but IOM produced no evidence that the Inductron products were well promoted or recognized by consumers. <em>See Scarves By Vera, Inc. v. Todo Imports, Ltd., </em>544 F.2d 1167, 1173-74 (2d Cir.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\">. A situation similar to the instant one was presented in <em>Price-Pfister, </em>311 F.2d at 818, in which the court made the following ruling in regard to the marks, \"ADJUSTO\" and \u201cADJUSTA-FIT\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">With respect to appearance, meaning, and sound, the dominant portions of the trademarks differ from each other by the substitution in the suffix portions of an \"A\u201d in appellant's mark for the \"O\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark and the addition of the descriptive term \"FIT\u201d to appellant\u2019s mark. We think these differences do not obviate the likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers arising from appellant\u2019s use of its mark on its goods. The addition of the term \"FIT\u201d to appellant\u2019s mark creates an impression that it might well be related to appellee\u2019s \"ADJUSTO\" family of goods.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-16\">. This statute .contains a number of defenses to incontestability, one of which is discussed, <em>infra, </em>wherein we conclude that Inductotherm\u2019s trademark has become incontestable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
