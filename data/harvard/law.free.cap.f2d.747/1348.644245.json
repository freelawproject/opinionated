Plaintiff-appellant claims that he was involuntarily reassigned within, and dismissed from, the Colorado Army National Guard in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 709(e). Jurisdiction lies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and \u00a7 1343(a)(3). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-17\">The defendants are all officers of the Colorado Army National Guard, COARNG. In this court Major General Herbert R. Temple, Jr. was substituted for Emmet H. Walker, Jr. as Director of COARNG.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-18\">Martelon, plaintiff-appellant, sought full-time employment in the COARNG as an administrative supply technician. He was informed in writing that his employment was \u201ccontingent upon membership in the Colorado National Guard.\u201d R. 337. He enlisted in the Guard on November 1, 1974, was employed as an administrative supply technician on November 3, 1974, and assigned to the 220th Military Police Company. His duties required that he supervise military material for his unit. On June 21, 1983, he was involuntarily reassigned to the 193rd Police Battalion. No comparable civilian activity was available in the 193rd Police Battalion. On August 1, 1983, his civilian job was terminated because his new military assignment was incompatible with his continued civilian employment as an administrative supply technician.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-19\">Plaintiff then filed this suit seeking relief from his termination as a technician in the Guard. He alleged three grounds for relief. First, appellees breached his contract by involuntarily transferring him from one military unit to another. He does not pursue this ground on this appeal. See appellant\u2019s brief, p. 4, n. 4. Second, appellees violated his constitutional rights in not affording him a hearing before his termination as a technician of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Third, appellees violated 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 709(e) by terminating his employment for a reason not specified in the statute. The court granted summary judgment for the appellees. There is no issue of material fact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>Our review is limited to whether the court correctly applied the substantive law. <em>Western Cas. &amp; Sur. v. National Union Fire Ins., </em>10th Cir., 677 F.2d 789, 791, n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Plaintiff does not contest that appellees had the authority to transfer him to a different military unit. The trial court noted, R. 454, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-5\">\u201c... plaintiff has not cited, and I have not found, any section of the enlistment contract either guaranteeing his assignment to a specific military unit or limiting the Guard\u2019s ability to reassign him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJC\">The enlistment contract signed by plaintiff specifically says, R. 68:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-6\">\u201cI have had this contract fully explained to me, I understand it, and certify that <em>no promise of </em>any kind has been made to me concerning assignment to duty____\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-8\">The United States Constitution in Art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 12-16, grants control of the Military to the Congress and not to the courts. As said in <em>Chappel v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 2366, 76 L.Ed.2d 586:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-9\">\u201cIt is clear that the Constitution contemplated that the Legislative Branch has plenary control over rights, duties, and responsibilities in the framework of the military establishment, including regulations, procedures and remedies related to military discipline:____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-10\">In <em>Chappell </em>the Court held that \u201cmilitary personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations.\u201d Id. 103 S.Ct. at 2368. In <em>Chappell, </em>five enlisted men of the United States Navy brought an action against their military superiors pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619, claiming that because of their minority race defendants failed to assign them desirable duties, gave them low performance valuations, threatened them, and imposed penalties of unusual severity. <em>Bivens </em>held that federal officers may be sued for damages arising out of civil rights violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-11\">In refusing to allow a <em>Bivens </em>remedy for military personnel against their superior officers, the Court said, <em>Chappell, </em>supra, 103 S.Ct. at 2365:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-12\">\u201cCivilian courts must, at the very least, hesitate long before entertaining a suit which asks the court to tamper with the established relationship between enlisted military personnel and their superior officers; that relationship is at the heart of the necessarily unique structure of the military establishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-13\">In <em>Gilligan v. Morgan, </em>413 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 2440, 37 L.Ed.2d 407, the Court refused to entertain a suit by university students under \u00a7 1983 asking that the courts examine the pattern of training, weaponry and orders of the Ohio National Guard, saying, Id. at 10, 93 S.Ct. at 2446:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-14\">\u201cIt would be difficult to think of a clearer example of the type of governmental action that was intended by the Constitution to be left to the political branches directly responsible \u2014 as the Judicial Branch is not \u2014 to the electoral process. Moreover, it is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Johnson v. Orr, </em>No. 82-2578 D.C.N.J. is misplaced. In that case, technicians claimed that they were terminated as a result of their union activities. In declining to follow <em>Chappell, </em>the New Jersey district court found that the technicians\u2019 claims were incident to their civilian, not military, employment. In the case at bar, termination following his involuntary military transfer is clearly related to military employment. The record amply demonstrates the dissatisfaction of plaintiff\u2019s superiors with plaintiff\u2019s military performance. R. 78-145. The record also shows that the dissatisfaction was the cause of plaintiffs transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-16\"><em>Chappell </em>involved a <em>Bivens </em>claim, while here \u00a7 1983 is the basis for relief. The difference is due to the identity of the defendants. In <em>Bivens </em>they were federal officers. Here they are state officers and federal relief must be based on \u00a7 1983. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number><em>Chappell </em>the Court failed to address the \u00a7 1985 claim brought by the enlisted men against their superiors. The Court stated that its decision in <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152, guided its analysis in <em>Chappell. </em>Supra, 103 S.Ct. at 2365. In <em>Feres </em>the Court held that the Federal Tort Claims Act did not extend to injuries suffered by military personnel in service. The Court pointed out that no such liability existed before the Federal Tort Claims Act and that Congress never intended to create such liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">Before the passage of \u00a7 1983, there was no liability on the part of military superiors for transgressions against the rights of other military personnel. By the passage of \u00a7 1983, Congress never intended to create such rights. See the Court\u2019s review of the legislative history of \u00a7 1983 found in <em>Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 98-99, 101 S.Ct. 411, 416-17, 66 L.Ed.2d 308. The plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">Plaintiff argues that defendants terminated him for a reason not specified in the statute. Section 709(e)(1), 32 U.S.C., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law and under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned \u2014 (1) a technician who is employed in a position in which National Guard membership is required as a condition of employment and who is separated from the National Guard or ceases to hold the military grade specified for his position by the Secretary concerned shall be promptly separated from his technician employment by the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1427-8\">The district court found, R. 455, that \u201ca civilian technician ceases to hold the requisite \u2018military grade\u2019 when he or she is reassigned to a military unit from which the civilian technician duties cannot be performed.\u201d Plaintiff says that because grade is defined in 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(10) to mean \u201ca step or degree, in a graduated scale of office or military rank, that is established and designated as a grade by law or regulation,\u201d the district court is wrong. The defendants say that the statute anticipates that it shall be expanded by the promulgation of regulations. Section 709(a) provides that \u201c[ujnder <em>regulations prescribed </em>by the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force ... persons may be employed as technicians in ... the National Guard.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] Section 709(e) begins \u201c[n]ot withstanding any other provision of law <em>and under regulations </em>prescribed by the Secretary concerned____\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">Plaintiff was terminated under Technician Personnel Regulation 302.7-9 which reads, R. 262:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-11\">\u201cA National Guard technician must be assigned to an appropriate military unit (to include military grade and speciality) in the State.where his technician job is located (see 32 U.S.C. 709(b)). The concept of the National Guard technician program is that technicians will be militarily assigned to the same unit in which his technician job is located. In other words, a technician will perform his technician duties, his military training duties, and be mobilized to active duty in the same unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1427-12\">Technician Personnel Regulation 752.2-3, brief of Amicus Curiae, Add. 55, mandates removal of technician employment when a technician \u201cfails to maintain the military grade/rank, branch of service, or compatible military assignment for the position occupied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-13\">The question is whether the regulations are consistent with \u00a7 709(e). The rule-making authority granted to' an administrative agency is not power to make law. Rather it is \u201cthe power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress as expressed by the statute.\u201d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 213-214, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1391, 47 L.Ed.2d 668. Resort is to the legislative history of the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968, of which \u00a7 709(e) is a part. See <em>United States v. Earth Sciences, Inc., </em>10th Cir., 599 F.2d 368, 372. The legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>of the Act shows that Congress considered that the military mission of the technicians was paramount and that the technician\u2019s duties were inseparable from his or her military obligations. See <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>D.C.Cir., 730 F.2d 1534, 1542-1547.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">The Senate Report accompanying the bill, S.Rep. No. 1446, 90th Cong. 2d Sess., R. 236, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-5\">\u201cThe concept of the technician program is that the technicians will serve concurrently in three different ways: (a) Perform full-time civilian work in their units; (b) perform military training and duty in their units; and (c) be available to enter active Federal service at any time their units are called.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">At R. 254, the Report says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-7\">\u201cThe concept of the full-time civilian technician program is that his civilian work will be performed in the same unit in which he holds a mobilization assignment. In other words, the technician would perform his civilian work, his training duty, and be mobilized to active duty in the same unit____ It is the view of the Committee, therefore, that technicians who are required to be military members of the National Guard should occupy a military position which is compatible with their civilian technician position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">See also the remarks of Congressman Pickle, 113 Cong.Rec. 3838 and of Senator McIntyre, 114 Cong.Rec. 23,254-23,255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">Plaintiff also argues that the agency has impermissibly broadened the removal provisions of \u00a7 709(e)(1) because the term \u201cgrade\u201d as used therein does not refer to the military unit in which the technician is serving. The Act need not contain this level of detail. In <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>D.C.Cir., 730 F.2d 1534, the court considered the argument that the National Guard was required to bargain over a union proposal to eliminate consideration of technician\u2019s military performance from reduction in force actions because the statute did not mention \u201c \u2018evaluations\u2019 or their use\u201d in \u00a7 709(e). The court said, Id. 1544:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-13\">\u201cThis argument is bootless. The Act need not descend to such detail. The evaluation and rating of personnel are implicit in every military organization, their use is fundamental and need not be explicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">The Senate Report and the remarks of members of Congress show that Congress intended that technicians be compatible in their military and civilian unit assignments. Given such legislative history, it is inconceivable that regulations mandating compatibility should be interpreted as inconsistent with \u00a7 709(e). The military has great and wide discretion in the formation, application, and interpretation of military regulations. <em>Noyd v. McNamara, </em>10th Cir., 378 F.2d 538, 540. We agree with the district court\u2019s holding that, R. 455, \u201ca civilian technician ceases to hold the requisite \u2018military grade\u2019 when he or she is reassigned to a military unit from which the civilian duties cannot be performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
