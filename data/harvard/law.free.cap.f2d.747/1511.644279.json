The first order, Opinion No. 186,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> accepted and adopted in full a new rate design proposed by the Wisconsin Electric Power Company (\u201cWEPCO\u201d), reversing the initial decision of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) on all issues.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second order, Opinion No. 186-A,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> denied rehearing on the ground that the rehearing applications raised no new issues. The principal issue presented by these consolidated appeals is whether FERC\u2019s finding \u2014 that WEPCO\u2019s proposed new rate design adopting two new pricing methods is just, reasonable, non-preferential and nonprejudicial \u2014 is based upon substantial evidence in the record and is within a zone of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-21\">This case arises under the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 791a, <em>et seq. </em>(1982), (\u201cthe Act\u201d), and associated regulations. Section 205(a) of the Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires that all rates subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction be \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d and declares rates that do not meet these standards to be unlawful. In addition, section 205(b) mandates that rates not be unduly preferential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>or prejudicial. Section 205(e) imposes on the public utility the burden of proving that any proposed rate is just and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-4\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm FERC\u2019s implementation of the time-of-day pricing component of the new rate design but reverse FERC\u2019s adoption of the marginal pricing component. We find that, with regard to the marginal pricing component, the Commission failed to comply with its statutory mandate to ensure that rates are just, reasonable, non-discriminatory and non-preferential. Moreover, we find that FERC both failed to offer a reasoned explanation for its decision and failed to develop record support, based on the facts of this case, for the adoption of the new marginal pricing ratemaking methodology. Accordingly, we remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-6\">On July 30, 1980, WEPCO filed a wholesale electric rate increase which was made the subject of a FERC investigation under section 205(e). All aspects of WEPCO\u2019s rate proposal were satisfactorily resolved by settlement negotiations prior to hearing except for the two new concepts in the rate design that are at issue here: the substitution of time-of-day energy charges for unitary energy charges, and the use of marginal cost pricing concepts<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> instead of the traditional embedded or average cost pricing. The new rate design still recognizes two discrete types of costs: (1) demand or fixed costs, <em>i.e., </em>building and maintenance expenses, and (2) energy or variable costs, <em>i.e., </em>the cost of generating electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-7\">Petitioners do not challenge the adoption of time-of-day rates in principle. Brief of ELCON, 32-33; Brief of the Cities, 59-60. They argue only that WEPCO has not offered sufficient evidence to support cost differentials in the periods chosen, and that neither Exhibit 5 nor Exhibit 32, offered as record support for the choice of peaking periods, suggests that a 12-hour peak period is justified. <em>Id., </em>J.A. 60-61. FERC, on the other hand, found the selection of peak periods to be reasonable and to be supported by substantial evidence on the record. J.A. 45. We agree and affirm this portion of FERC\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-10\">Petitioners challenge the adoption of marginal cost pricing in this case on several grounds, the most important of which is that substantial adjustments to the theory were made in order to apply it to this ease. These adjustments were necessary because of the \u201crevenue constraint,\u201d representing the maximum revenue collectable by the utility in a given period. In this case, the revenue constraint was determined according to the traditional ratemaking method of average costs. Consequently, if WEPCO collects the fixed costs allocated to wholesale customers by a demand charge and the variable costs by an energy charge under marginal cost pricing instead of average pricing, the total revenues generated will exceed the revenue constraint. Therefore, FERC approved the following reconciliation methodology: WEPCO would collect the entire marginal cost of <em>energy </em>and would consider any residual revenue collectable under the revenue constraint to be the <em>demand </em>charge. J.A. 22, 76. The resulting charges are not pegged to the demand or energy costs assigned to the customers in WEPCO\u2019s cost-of-service study, and there are <em>no </em>demand charges for off-peak customers. J.A. 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AZE\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1589-12\">The scope of our review in this case is limited. We defer to the agency\u2019s expertise, particularly where the statute prescribes few specific standards for the agency to follow, so long' as its decision is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the record and reached by \u201creasoned decision-making,\u201d including an examination of the relevant data and a reasoned explanation supported by a stated connection between the facts found and the choice made. <em>Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 245, 9 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>207 (1962); <em>Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division v. FPC, </em>504 F.2d 225, 230 (D.C.Cir.l974); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825l (1982). As this court recently stated in a case arising under the Natural Gas Act, which prescribes a similar \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1590-4\">This paucity of statutory guidance has resulted in judicial deference to administrative ratesetting. However deferential the judiciary may be, courts have never given regulators carte blanche ____ [T]he judiciary has inferred certain requirements from the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard [and] ... \u201c[w]hat is basic is the requirement that there be support in the public record for what was done\u201d ____ In reviewing the record, this Court engages in an inquiry akin to the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d inquiry mandated by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 .U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) (1976) .... Indeed, this Court has required the Commission to specify the evidence on which it relied and to explain how that evidence supports the conclusion it reached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1590-9\"><em>City of Charlottesville v. FERC, </em>661 F.2d 945, 949-50 (D.C.Cir.1981) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-10\">B. <em>FERC\u2019s Order Fails to Comply With the Statutory Mandate to Determine Whether Rates are Just, Reasonable, Non-Discriminatory and Non-Preferential</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-11\">The Commission relied exclusively on economic theory to justify the adoption of a rate design based on marginal costs. But, especially in a case of this sort\u2014 where the agency has given lip service to a theoretical design and then inexplicably distorted the theory in its application \u2014 mere reliance on an economic theory cannot substitute for substantial record evidence and the articulation of a rational basis for an agency\u2019s decision. While we might defer to FERC\u2019s application of this new theory in another case, we cannot do so here where the agency failed to address potentially serious problems with the new rate design, especially with WEPCO\u2019s reconciliation methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-15\">1. <em>The Reconciliation Methodology</em></p>\n<p id=\"AA9\">FERC asserts that the new rate design \u201cwill serve the public interest by more closely tracking the utility\u2019s cost incurrence than the traditional non time-differentiated average cost methodology.\u201d J.A. 46. This contention is hardly surprising because FERC has previously considered cost tracking to be the primary feature of a just and reasonable rate structure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it is clear in this case that, under WEPCO\u2019s proposal of <em>modified </em>marginal cost pricing, costs will be tracked less accurately than under average cost pricing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-16\">For instance, WEPCO\u2019s Exhibit 20, J.A. 572, shows that demand <em>costs </em>approximate 41% and energy <em>costs </em>approximate 59% of the actual cost of service. Under WEP-CO\u2019s proposal, however, demand <em>charges </em>will equal about 20% of the revenues and energy <em>charges </em>will equal 80%. WEPCO\u2019s own witness acknowledged the total lack of correlation between the demand cost and the demand charge, J.A. 146, stating under cross-examination that \u201cit is difficult to calculate an accurate marginal demand cost and inasmuch as our philosophy is as it is to shrink the demand cost first, we didn\u2019t pay a lot of attention to the <em>theoretical niceties </em>of that calculation.\u201d J.A. 241 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>WEPCO\u2019s witness also testified that the reconciliation necessitated by the revenue constraint should be made where it will have the least adverse impact on the allocation of resources, and argued that the demand charge represents that part of the rate structure. The Commission accepted two of three reasons put forth by WEPCO to support the reconciliation methodology chosen, placing primary reliance on WEP-CO\u2019s stated excess capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-4\">The excess capacity argument is the key factor in our conclusion. Because there is currently excess capacity, WEPCO\u2019s shortrun marginal cost of capacity is zero. The logical conclusion of this fact, all other things being equal, would be a zero demand charge both on-peak and off-peak. But even with energy costs priced at their margin, that would produce a revenue shortfall below the company\u2019s revenue requirement. This revenue short-fall [sic] should be avoided by increasing the demand charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1591-5\">J.A. 58. In accepting this rationale, however, the Commission appears to treat the demand charge like modeling clay in order to force the application of marginal cost pricing to the energy component.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-6\">The Commission\u2019s second rationale is equally conclusory. Again noting the present excess capacity, the Commission simply asserts that \u201cit is legitimate in setting a demand charge to focus on the short-term.\u201d J.A. 58. The Commission fails to explain why a short-term focus is acceptable, or to discuss the potential effects of this short-term approach. We believe that this approach poses serious potential problems, including the future possibility of a sudden rate surge when additional capacity is required. FERC has totally failed to address these problems in any meaningful fashion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1591-10\">Accordingly, we find that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the reconciliation methodology chosen, and that the Commission\u2019s stated reasons for its approval are almost wholly conclusory, largely short-sighted and patently unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-11\">2. <em>The Rate Tilt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1591-12\">There is a similar absence of evidence and explanation for the approval of a \u201crate tilt\u201d that results from the application of WEPCO\u2019s rate design. Under the Act, a rate design must be non-discriminatory and non-preferential as well as being just and reasonable. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(b); <em>see also Alabama Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. FERC, </em>684 F.2d 20, 27 (D.C.Cir.1982) (quoting <em>United States v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., </em>263 U.S. 515, 524, 44 S.Ct. 189, 193, 68 L.Ed. 417 (1924)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If a rate design has different effects on charges for similar services to similar customers, the utility bears the burden of justifying these different effects. It can satisfy this burden by \u201coffering a valid reason for the disparity or by demonstrating that the gap is as small as practicable under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. Not all discrimination is necessarily unlawful. Section 205(b) proscribes \u201cany <em>unreasonable </em>difference in rates\u201d and any <em>\u201cundue </em>preference or advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28 (emphasis added); <em>see also Second Taxing Dist. v. FERC, </em>683 F.2d 477, 486-88 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Pub. Serv. Co. v. FERC, </em>575 F.2d 1204, 1211 (7th Cir.1978); <em>Southwestern Pub. Serv. Co., </em>22 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,341 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-13\">Petitioners have shown, and the record makes clear, that the proposed rate design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>results in a cross-subsidization, charging high-load factor customers part of the costs of service to low-load customers. Brief of ELCON, 36; J.A. 297-99.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The utility has put forth no legally sufficient reason for charging high-load factor customers a rate that does not accurately reflect the cost of serving them. Indeed, at oral argument before this court neither FERC\u2019s counsel nor WEPCO\u2019s counsel even attempted to explain or justify' the rate tilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-4\">In light of the record before us, it is plain that WEPCO has not met its burden of showing that such a rate tilt is reasonable. In addition, FERC has made absolutely no attempt to outline the factors justifying the rate tilt. Instead, the Commission\u2019s decision offers only frivolous and circular reasoning in an effort to deny the existence of a tilt, and the brief from FERC fails to address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-5\">In its opinion, FERC stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-6\">Admittedly, these results are not likely to be beneficial from the perspective of certain customer classes. This explains the source of the opposition of the high load factor municipal and industrial intervenors. Other customer groups, however, are likely to benefit'from WEPCO\u2019s proposal. This trade-off of customer gains and losses is a fact of life ---- The important question is whether there is a cost justification for the rate structure adopted. We find that there is. WEPCO\u2019s proposal comports with the well-reasoned theory of marginal cost pricing____ [0]nce marginal costs are chosen as the standard to be applied, <em>it cannot be complained that the result lacks a rational basis.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-11\"><em>Nor can it be complained that the result promotes an unlawful rate tilt. </em>In point of fact, no \u201ctilt\u201d exists as that term is commonly understood because the result obtained here comports entirely with the pricing and reconciliation methodologies which underly [sic] it. There has been no deviation from marginal cost pricing theory. If a \u201ctilt\u201d can be said to exist, it is a \u201ctilt\u201d from average cost pricing: But that is no tilt at all because WEPCO never intended to use average cost pricing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1592-14\">J.A. 46-48 (emphasis added). FERC\u2019s reasoning is totally circular and utterly without meaning. It is uncontested that, under the proposed rate design, part of the demand cost is being collected through the energy charge. Yet, the Commission accepts the reconciliation methodology as consistent with marginal price theory. Therefore, the tilt logically arises from marginal pricing, not from average pricing as the Commission asserts. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the tilt does arise from \u201caverage cost pricing\u201d (as claimed by FERC), it still must be shown that the proposed rate design is non-discriminatory and non-preferential. <em>See </em>note 8 <em>supra. </em>In this case, neither WEPCO nor FERC has produced any evidence showing factual differences to justify the tilt or to show that it is <em>de minimis. </em>Such a rate tilt, without legal justification, is unlawful. <em>Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. FERC, </em>628 F.2d 578, 592-93 (D.C.Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-15\">C. <em>The Alleged Application of Marginal Price Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1592-16\">Petitioners complain that WEPCO\u2019s record evidence is limited to \u201crecitations and quotations of marginal cost pricing theory ... and a few broad, unsubstantiated assertions that the same design employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>at retail has had beneficial results.\u201d Brief of the Cities, 23; <em>see also </em>Brief of ELCON, 20-21. The AU was struck by the lack of a record justification for the new model:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A97\">The adoption of any particular mode of pricing can hardly be an end in itself, no matter what the mode may be. The results of a particular mode, its effects upon the adopting utility and upon the consuming public, those are the ends that give the mode value, that justify its adoption. Those results may be seen only through analysis of the actual facts and through comparisons with the probable results of the adoptions of different modes. It is only by comparisons with other modes that the value of a particular mode may be identified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1593-4\">The record now before the Commission shows that WEP [sic] has made no analysis of the type just described, has made no such comparison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1593-5\">J.A. 9. The Commission\u2019s reversal of the ALJ\u2019s order, by stark contrast, merely states that \u201conce marginal costs are chosen as the standard to be applied, it cannot be complained that the result lacks a rational basis.\u201d J.A. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-6\">We conclude that, according to the applicable law in this circuit, mere invocation of theory is an insufficient substitute for substantial evidence and reasoned explanations. This is especially true in the context of this case where the theory has been severely compromised by the revenue constraint and the resulting modification in marginal pricing methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-7\">Apart from the problems discussed above, petitioners have pointed out that pure marginal pricing theory in this case is limited in at least two additional ways. First, the theory assumes a state of pure competition which even FERC concedes does not exist in the wholesale electric utili-' ty industry in Wisconsin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, there is evidence in the record suggesting that some effects of the new design might be economically inefficient.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s order did not address this latter point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-11\">The principal point to be made here is <em>not </em>any opposition to marginal price theory (in its pure or a modified version), but rather that mere economic theory may not take the place of record evidence and reasoned decision-making. This point was made clear by this court in <em>City of Charlottesville v. FERC, </em>661 F.2d 945 (D.C.Cir.1981), where FERC approved an increase in. rates for two interstate pipeline companies purely on the basis of an incentive theory. We found that the record lacked any meaningful evidence of a causal relationship between the rate and the theoretical design, vacated FERC\u2019s decision and remanded, quoting Judge Leventhal\u2019s opinion in <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C.Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1593-12\">An agency\u2019s view of what is in the public interest may change, either with or without a change in circumstances. But an agency changing its course must supply a <em>reasoned analysis ... </em>and if an agency glosses over or swerves from prior precedents without discussion it may cross the line from the tolerably terse to the intolerably mute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1593-13\"><em>City of Charlottesville, </em>661 F.2d at 951 n. 35 (emphasis added). In her concurrence, Judge Wald added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1593-14\">That evidence is not to be found in this record, and ... I do not think a purely theoretical incentive, the effectiveness of which is belied by the facts in the specific case, is sufficient to justify a deviation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>from normal ratemaking practices .... Though this court in the past has approved agency use of predictive economic models ... we have always stressed that the agency must make \u201ca conscientious effort to take into account what is known as to past experience and what is reasonably predictable about the future\u201d to monitor whether the model\u2019s assumptions work in practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1594-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 954-55 (quoting <em>American Pub. Gas Ass\u2019n v. FPC, </em>567 F.2d 1016, 1037 (D.C.Cir.1977), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>435 U.S. 907, 98 S.Ct. 1456, 55 L.Ed.2d 499 (1978)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1594-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-6\">The heart of our problem with FERC\u2019s approval of distorted marginal cost pricing is that the Commission relied solely on theoretical postulates that, so far as we can divine from the record and FERC\u2019s orders, bear no relation to present realities in this case. Although we strongly prefer to defer to the expertise of the agency with regard to rate design, we cannot do so where FERC has failed to consider relevant factors and to articulate a reasonable basis for its decision, and where FERC has not complied with its statutory mandate to set rates at a just, reasonable, non-discriminatory and non-preferential level. We repeat that FERC is not foreclosed from relying on marginal price theory if there is a basis for its adoption in this case. We vacate FERC\u2019s order, not because it relied on pure theory, but because the theory was applied in this case despite the fact that the theory upon which FERC bases its approval was not <em>actually </em>used here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-7\">In sum, we unequivocally state that we are not hereby expressing our opposition to the adoption of marginal cost based rate designs in <em>any </em>form. We are concerned only with the total lack of record support for FERC\u2019s position and with the absence of reasoned decision-making on the part of FERC. There are a number of suggested post-hoc rationalizations in FERC\u2019s and the intervenors\u2019 briefs on review but those cannot substitute for record evidence or reasoned decision-making. The agency should consider and explain the effect of the reconciliation methodology on cost-tracking, the long-term problems inherent in ignoring the demand component at this point and the reasons that justify the acknowledged rate tilt. The agency should also explain and spell out in more than purely theoretical terms how the alleged economic efficiencies flow from the modified or adapted version of the theory applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-10\">Accordingly, we remand the case to allow FERC and interested parties to supplement the record on the issue of marginal cost pricing. A modified version of marginal cost pricing theory may indeed be perfectly acceptable, but not without record support and reasoned decision-making by FERC that address the particular nuances of the <em>modified </em>theory. If the adoption of marginal cost theory to WEP-CO\u2019s wholesale rates is justified by the further proceedings, we have no doubt that the agency\u2019s decision will be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-11\">We affirm FERC\u2019s implementation of the time-of-day pricing component of the new rate design but reverse FERC\u2019s adoption of the marginal pricing component. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-12\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1588-11\">.

As to the \"tilt,\" FERC\u2019s staff witness stated: I oppose WEPCO\u2019s [sic] proposed margin cost based energy rates for several reasons. First, as stated by Company witness Abdoo, there cannot be a complete reconciliation between the theories of marginal cost and average cost. Since WEPCO\u2019s filed cost of service derives an allocated revenue requirement utilizing average cost, using marginal cost based rates creates some inconsistencies. As can be seen from page 15 of Exhibit No._(S-2), using the Company\u2019s costs from its case-in-chief, over $10 million in demand related costs are to be recovered through the proposed marginal cost based rates thereby causing a severe tilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-18\">This tilt causes an inappropriate price signal to be sent to ratepayers by the demand portion of the rate structure, because the demand charge is being understated ....</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-19\">J.A. 297-98.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1593-8\">.

In fact, there is evidence that the city can generate its own peak load at a lower real cost. Thus general economic efficiency might be reduced and WEPCO\u2019s peak load factor increased.

This is the first marginal cost pricing rate case to come before us, and it will serve as a guide for further applications of marginal cost pricing to electricity rates.

As such, it must be expected that the development of a record traditionally thought sufficient to satisfy our review will be difficult. Without the benefit of precedent, it will also prove difficult for the Commission to reconcile the theory to every nuance of actual practice. In my view, we should be more sensitive in our review to the novelty of the'proposed design.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-4\">The Supreme Court recognized in <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968), that weight should be accorded the unusual difficulties of the first proceeding involving a new design. In <em>Permian Basin, </em>the Federal Power Commission was attempting to implement an entirely new concept in determining maximum just and reasonable rates for sales in interstate commerce of natural gas produced in the Permian Basin. The Commission believed that the particular rate structure it adopted would employ price functionally, \u201cas a tool to encourage the production of appropriate supplies of natural gas,\u201d and as an incentive to exploration and production. <em>Id. </em>at 796, 88 S.Ct. at 1375. The Supreme Court found that the rate structure fell within the \u201czone of reasonableness,\u201d even though price distinctions were unrelated to quality, on the basis that such price discrimination could be employed \u201cto achieve relevant regulatory purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797, 88 S.Ct. at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-5\">The Court also examined the method by which the Permian Basin rates were derived. The Commission had adopted prices based on cost factors which it found to serve as an incentive to exploration and production. The court determined that, while it may not produce arbitrary or unreasonable results, \u201cthe Commission may employ any \u2018formula or combination of formulas\u2019 it wishes, and is free to \u2018make the pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800, 88 S.Ct. at 1377 (quoting <em>FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>315 U.S. 575, 586, 62 S.Ct. 736, 743, 86 L.Ed. 1037 (1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-8\">The Court' in <em>Permian Basin </em>was acutely aware that it was travelling uncharted waters. <em>See, e.g., id., </em>390 U.S., at 788, 810-11, 88 S.Ct. at 1382-83. Indeed, even a member of the Commission described its efforts as \u201cadmittedly ... experimental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758, 88 S.Ct. at 1355. The Court also recognized that \u201cthe breadth and complexity of the Commission\u2019s responsibilities demand that it be given every reasonable opportunity to formulate methods of regulation appropriate for the solution of its intensely practical difficulties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790, 88 S.Ct. at 1372. Thus, in conducting its review, the Court candidly admitted that it was \u201cobliged at this juncture to give weight to the unusual difficulties of this first area [rate] proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 792, 88 S.Ct. at 1373. The Court emphasized, however, \u201cthat this weight must significantly lessen as the Commission\u2019s experience with area regulation lengthens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court\u2019s review thus appropriately accommodated the uncertainties inherent in the first case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-9\">It is my view that our per curiam opinion ignores the difficulties under which the agency labors. In our zeal to have FERC establish a more sufficient record for affirmance, we require an overly stringent exactness in fitting the theory to the facts of this case. I oppose imposing such a standard of certainty. While pure theory alone is insufficient to support a rate design, our review must be adjusted to accommodate the nature of the decision to be made by the agency. Where theory is so much a part of an initial decision, as here, a reviewing court should not require the same type of evidence as it would in other rate cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number>The per curiam opinion condemns the present \u201cdistorted\u201d version of marginal cost pricing because the agency made substantial adjustments to the theory in order to apply it to this case. Because the revenue constraint was derived on an average cost basis, pure theory cannot be implemented. The question then is, what is the most reasonable modification of the theory compatible with the predetermined revenue requirement? According to WEPCO and FERC, the best application calls for implementing pure marginal <em>energy </em>costs and collecting the residue by way of the demand charge. By doing so, the <em>energy </em>charge is calculated according to pure marginal theory. As FERC explains, this is important because such an energy charge would elicit the best response from consumers. J.A. 58. By definition it accurately tracks energy costs. Customers respond proportionately less to changes in the demand charge. Manipulating it therefore diminishes the effectiveness of the marginal cost pricing plan relatively less than would an equivalent change in the energy charge. In the economists\u2019 terminology, the demand for power is more elastic with respect to changes in the energy charge than to changes in the demand charge. In my view, the agency\u2019s application represents a pragmatic adjustment which best achieves the relevant regulatory goals of marginal cost pricing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-4\">The per curiam similarly charges that the modified theory applied here results in a so-called \u201crate tilt.\u201d In fact, any rate tilt present exists <em>because </em>the overall revenue constraint was derived from <em>average </em>demand and energy costs. Naturally, any design based on marginal cost will be at odds with the revenue constraint. In its effort to retain the benefits of marginal cost pricing, FERC modified its theory. If this modification causes a tilt, <em>it does so only in relation to the average demand and energy charges formerly derived. </em>J.A. 46-48; From the record, it appears that once the theory of marginal cost pricing is found to be satisfactorily supported, certain conclusions inevitably follow. Among these is that marginal cost pricing cannot be reconciled perfectly with the revenue constraint. Accordingly, I cannot agree that FERC has made \u201cabsolutely no attempt\u201d to outline its explanation of the so-called rate tilt. This court has recognized that \u201cCongress has carefully eschewed tying \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 rates to any particular method of deriving the rates.\u201d <em>American Public Power Assoc. v. FPC, </em>522 F.2d 142, 146 (D.C.Cir.1975). Rather, \u201cCongress clearly intended to allow the Commission broad discretion in regard to the methodology of testing the reasonableness of rates.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1596-7\">It is notable that similar proceedings were conducted by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission for large demand users. In approving time-of-day, marginal cost rates, the Commission faced the problem that pure marginal rates would result in exceeding the revenue constraint. The Commission ruled that adjustments should be made to the demand charge;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1596-8\">The Commission is persuaded that, if an adjustment in any of the charges is required because of the revenue constraint, that adjustment should be made to the demand charge and not to the energy charge. There are several reasons for this. In the first place, as people\u2019s counsel witness [] explained, the calculation of marginal energy costs is far more exact than the calculation of marginal demand costs. By adjusting the least exact charge, the commission reduces the chances of designing a rate which fails to send the proper price signal. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the ultimate effect of a reduction in kwh consumption will be felt immediately. If a customer reduces its energy consumption on-peak by 100 kwh and the marginal cost has been properly estimated, PEPCO will save exactly that marginal cost in fuel and related operating expenses. This effect contrasts with marginal demand costs when the ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>effect of a saved KW of peak demand may not be experienced for years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1597-4\"><em>Re Potomac Electric Power Co., </em>31 P.U.R. 4th 219, 232 (D.C.Commission 1970) (Order No. 7002). The Commission termed this a \u201cpragmatic adjustment.\u201d 31 P.U.R. 4th 249, 254 (D.C. Commission 1979) (Order No. 7034). The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Metropolitan Washington Bd. of Trade v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>432 A.2d 343 (D.C.App.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-5\">Thus, I reluctantly join in the remand of the record. I am fearful that we require FERC to go to unreasonable lengths to substantiate its decision. There are limits on what an agency can do when approving a rate design that implements a theoretical construct such as marginal cost pricing. Our review should be influenced to a large extent by the nature of the decision confronting the agency. <em>See, e.g., City of Charlottesville v. FERC, </em>661 F.2d 945, 955 (D.C.Cir.1981) (MacKinnon, J., dissenting in part). The application of marginal cost theory to electricity rates is in its infancy. I doubt seriously that the effects of using a modified form of theory are susceptible to the same degree of proof thought sufficient in other rate making cases. Our per curiam requires an exactness of proof which is unreasonable in this case. I would affirm on the basis of this record, \u201cobliged at this juncture,\u201d as the Supreme Court said in <em>Permian Basin, </em>\u201cto give weight to the unusual difficulties of this first [marginal cost rate design] proceeding.\u201d 390 U.S. at 792, 88 S.Ct. at 1373.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1595-6\">.
