At oral argument, the defendant conceded the validity of the injunction and, consequently, the validity of the district court\u2019s findings of trademark violations. Defendant\u2019s sole challenge is to the award of profits and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The district court awarded an accounting of profits solely under Rhode Island law because it appeared that plaintiffs had not given the notice of registration required under federal law for such an award. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111. Under Rhode Island law, however, registration of a mark is itself constructive notice of the registrant\u2019s claim of ownership. R.I.Gen.Laws \u00a7 6-2-4. In order to recover lost profits under Rhode Island law, the court must make a finding of fraudulent intent on the part of the defendant. <em>Bostitch, Inc. v. King Fastener Co., </em>87 R.I. 274, 140 A.2d 274, 284 (1958). The district court expressly made such a finding and we do not find it clearly erroneous. Defendant also argues that no profits should be awarded to the plaintiff because it is a union and does not itself engage in the printing business and, therefore, cannot have suffered any loss of profits. We believe the district court exercised its equitable powers appropriately by giving a windfall to the trademark owner rather than the trademark infringer. <em>Accord Mishawaka Mfg. Co. v. Kresge Co., </em>316 U.S. 203, 207, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 1024, 86 L.Ed. 1381 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs was made under federal law rather than state law because there was considerable doubt as to whether state law permitted recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. The primary question here is whether the plaintiff was barred from recovering attorney\u2019s fees because it had failed to give the notice of registration required by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111; plaintiff had not displayed the mark with the words \u201cRegistered in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u201d or \u201cReg. U.S. Pat. &amp; Tm. Off.\u201d or with the letter R enclosed within a circle. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 states, \u201cin any suit for infringement under this chapter by such a registrant failing to give such notice of registration, no profits and no damages shall be recoverable under the provisions of this chapter unless the defendant had actual notice of the registration.\u201d The limitations of \u00a7 1111 are incorporated by reference into 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117, which authorizes recovery for profits, damages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. The district court found that, unlike profits and damages, there was no requirement of notice for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Section 1111, by its language, places a notice requirement only upon the recovery of profits and damages. Furthermore, the legislative history of the attorney\u2019s fees provision indicated that it was considered to be essentially an equitable remedy. S.Rep. No. 1400, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 7132, 7137. We see no intent by Congress to limit this equitable remedy by requiring the statutory notice of \u00a7 1111. The only requirement Congress placed upon the award of attorney\u2019s fees was that the case be \u201cexceptional,\u201d \u00a7 1117. The legislative history shows that Congress intended \u201cexceptional\u201d to mean malicious, fraudulent, deliberate, or willful infringement. <em>Id. </em>at 7133. The district court made such a finding and there is no basis for rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Costs to appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
