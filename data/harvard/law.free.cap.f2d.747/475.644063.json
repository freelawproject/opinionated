We find that the Secretary\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with directions to award Miller benefits under both Title II and Title XVI of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae-\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">James Miller is a thirty-one year-old male of above average intelligence who has completed approximately three years of college. Between 1975 and 1982, Miller was hospitalized over seventeen times to receive treatment for an ongoing mental disorder. In 1976, Miller was diagnosed as schizophrenic.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">Miller began receiving disability benefits in 1976. Although his mental condition remained relatively unchanged, he became employed in 1980. Miller was notified in July of 1980 that he was no longer deemed incapable of engaging in substantial gainful employment and his disability benefits were terminated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Miller continued working until January of 1981, when his anxiety attacks forced him to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">This case reveals serious administrative and judicial delay common in the processing of disability insurance claims. Miller applied for disability benefits and supplemental security income benefits on January 7, 1981. After his application was declined on initial consideration and reconsideration plaintiff requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (AU). The hearing was held on August 12,1981. In a decision mailed to Miller on February 11, 1982, the AU denied both the disability and supplemental security income benefits applications. The Appeals Council denied his request for review on April 2, 1982, but agreed to reconsider his request after receiving a supplemental record. In a letter dated June 14, 1982, a member of the Appeals Council informed Miller that despite his \u201csignificant emotional problems,\u201d the supplemental records indicated no \u201cdeterioration in [Miller\u2019s] overall psychiatric status since the issuance of the administrative law judge\u2019s decision.\u201d The Appeals Council affirmed its earlier refusal to review the February 11, 1982, AU decision. Miller filed a petition for review in the federal district court; his claim was denied on October 31, 1983. Miller appealed to this court and argument was heard in June of 1984. Our decision is rendered approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>mately three years and eight months after Miller\u2019s 1981 application for disability and supplemental security income benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"APq\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Miller argues that there is not substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support either the AU\u2019s determination that Miller\u2019s impairment was not severe enough to meet the disability criteria set forth in Category of Impairments, Mental, Functional nonpsychotic disorders, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1501-404.1599, Appendix 1, \u00a7 12.04 (1984) (hereinafter cited as Appendix 1, \u00a7 12.04),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or the AU finding that Miller could perform low-level, nonstressful jobs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Our review is limited to whether the administrative findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See Ledoux v. Schweiker, </em>782 F.2d 1385, 1387 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Nettles v. Schweiker, </em>714 F.2d 833, 835 (8th Cir.1983); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). Because we review the record as a whole, we include in our review the supplemental record submitted and reviewed by the Appeals Council. The evidence is overwhelmingly inconsistent with the Appeals Council\u2019s observation that Miller suffered no \u201cdeterioration\" between the time of the AU decision and the Council\u2019s consideration of the request for review. Rather, the record is replete with observations made subsequent to the hearing before the AU that Miller\u2019s condition was degenerating. The 1981 psychiatric reports reviewed by the AU reflect little concern over Miller\u2019s suicidal or psychotic symptoms. The reports written in 1982 demonstrate that Miller\u2019s \u201cstate of mood was anxious and depressed;\u201d he was \u201cmore depressed than usual.\u201d (Progress Note dated 2-12-82). The psychiatric evaluations revealed Miller\u2019s \u201csuicidal ideation\u201d (Progress Note dated 2-18-82) \u201cwhich seems to be coming more prominent all the time.\u201d (Progress Note dated 2-22-82). The doctors reported that \u201c[tjhese depressive symptoms are more severe than in the past and appear to be associated with mood congruent psychotic features.\u201d (Progress .Note dated 3-2-82).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-16\">The record as a whole, including the supplemental 1982 reports, shows a chronic condition compatible with Miller\u2019s undisputed statements that he was unable to pursue substantial gainful activity. Miller has been under psychiatric treatment including various medications for his panic attacks and depression since 1976. The testimony shows that Miller was unable to sleep, or eat, and that he had recurrent suicidal thoughts. The medical evidence and Miller\u2019s testimony established that Miller experienced up to eight \u201cpanic attacks\u201d per day. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>These attacks so restricted his daily activities that he was unable to work around other people and was afraid of open spaces.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Miller testified that due to these conditions he was unable to hold down a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Combining the original and the supplemental evidence, the AU\u2019s finding that Miller could obtain substantial employment and thus was not disabled is not supported by the record as a whole. The medical evidence shows that Miller\u2019s condition in 1982 was not improving. Rather, Miller\u2019s mental state was deteriorating. In <em>Dreste v. Heckler, </em>741 F.2d 224, 226 n. 2 (8th Cir.1984) (per curiam) we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">We reject the AU\u2019s claim that [the claimant] did not have a twelve-month period of continuous disability. It is in-, herent in psychotic illnesses that periods of remission will occur. This does not, however, lead to the conclusion that the disability has ceased * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>See also Lebus v. Harris, </em>526 F.Supp. 56, 61 (N.D.Cal.1981) (\u201cRealistically, a person with a mental impairment may be unable to engage in competitive employment as his ability to work may be sporadically interrupted by unforeseeable mental setbacks\u201d). Although Miller is classified as having a nonpsyehotic disorder, our analysis in <em>Dreste </em>is applicable. Functional nonpsyehotic disorders are disabling. <em>See </em>Appendix 1, \u00a7 12.04. In <em>Bailey v. Califano, </em>614 F.2d 146, 150 (8th Cir.1980), this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">The regulations specifically list functional nonpsyehotic disorders as an impairment. These disorders must be manifested by recurrent and persistent periods of anxiety with tension and apprehension which result in a restriction of daily activities and construction of interests and deterioration in personal habits and seriously impaired ability to relate to other people. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1501, <em>et seq., </em>App. 1 \u00a7 12.04 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">After considering the record as a whole, we find that Miller has met the disability criteria set forth in Appendix 1, \u00a7 12.04. The medical testimony and evidence relating to Miller\u2019s attempts to maintain a job support Miller\u2019s contention that he suffers from a nonpsyehotic disorder and is incapable of continued employment. <em>See Tennant v. Schweiker, </em>682 F.2d 707, 710 (8th Cir.1982) (finding that medical evidence showed unequivocally that the claimant suffered from a personality disorder). The supplemental record demonstrates that Miller\u2019s symptoms are chronic and reoccurring and that Miller was undergoing treatment for his condition. We reverse the district court\u2019s decision and remand with an order that plaintiff Miller be awarded benefits under both Title II and Title XVI of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Judgment reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-17\">. Miller requested reconsideration of the Social Security Administration's decision to terminate his benefits. The decision was affirmed, and Miller did not appeal.

The district court found Miller did not meet the disability criteria set forth in Appendix 1, \u00a7 12.04 on the grounds that Miller had not shown he could not relate to other people and because his personal habits had not deteriorated. We find the record supports the opposite conclusions: Miller was not able to interact with others and his personal habits had deteriorated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b554-19\">. The record is filled with descriptions of Miller as nervous, anxious, and slightly disheveled. Miller testified, for example, that he was forced to quit his job as a janitor in a dime store because of his discomfort \"in that store around people.\u201d Further, the vocational expert testified that Miller possibly could engage in certain low-stress types of employment, but that such work might exacerbate Miller\u2019s problems because the jobs would not challenge him intellectually.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
