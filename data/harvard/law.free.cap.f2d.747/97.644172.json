(the Epstein firm). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Cheng began this employment discrimination suit against GAF in 1977. While the case was in the discovery stage, the Epstein firm hired as an associate, Philip Gassel, an attorney who had been employed by Legal Services for the Elderly Poor, the organization representing Cheng. Thereupon Cheng moved to disqualify the Epstein firm from representing GAF, contending that the firm\u2019s continued participation in the action violated the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Concluding that disqualification \u201cwould not serve any interest which the law recognizes\u201d the district court denied this motion. On appeal we reviewed the circumstances and contentions in considerable detail and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">Thus, it is clear that under Canon 9 as well as Canons 4 and 5, Gassel and the Epstein firm must be disqualified. Judge Owen\u2019s decision to the contrary was an abuse of discretion. Moreover, if there were any doubt as to the propriety of our action, we would resolve it in favor of disqualification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-7\"><em>Cheng v. GAF Corp., </em>631 F.2d 1052, 1059 (2d Cir.1980) <em>(Cheng I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">We therefore reversed and remanded to the district court for entry of an order of disqualification. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court summarily vacated our judgment, <em>GAF Corp. v. Cheng, </em>450 U.S. 903, 101 S.Ct. 1338, 67 L.Ed.2d 327 (1981), and instructed us to dismiss Cheng\u2019s appeal on jurisdictional grounds, based on its intervening decision in <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981), which held that orders denying motions to disqualify counsel in civil cases are unappealable interlocutory orders. Cheng then moved before us td treat the original appeal as a petition for a writ of mandamus. We denied this motion and dismissed the appeal. <em>Cheng v. GAF Corp., </em>659 F.2d 1058 (2d Cir.1981) (mem.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">When Cheng later renewed his disqualification motion, the district court denied it without prejudice to still later renewal should circumstances warrant it. After the Supreme Court denied Cheng\u2019s petition to review our denial of his request for mandamus, GAF moved in the district court for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs incurred in defending against Cheng\u2019s efforts to disqualify GAF\u2019s counsel after May 12, 1981, the date on which Cheng had renewed his original disqualification motion in the district court. Finding that Cheng\u2019s later disqualification efforts were unreasonable, the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, awarded GAF $1,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs.' <em>Cheng v. GAF Corp., </em>566 F.Supp. 350 (S.D.N.Y.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Again we reversed, <em>Cheng v. GAF Corp., </em>713 F.2d 886 (2d Cir.1983) <em>(Cheng II), </em>concluding that our prior decision \u201cwas itself enough to justify appellant\u2019s efforts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891. In that opinion we observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">Thus, although the district court was not bound by our previous decision, we find it puzzling that he chose to ignore the reasoning of that decision and again denied appellant\u2019s motion to disqualify. More significantly, we find it extraordinary that he should penalize appellant\u2019s lawyer for attempting to have this court review that denial, given that this court had already ruled in appellant\u2019s favor in its earlier opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">Thereafter, Cheng moved for a third time to disqualify the Epstein firm, and this time the district court granted the motion. GAF now appeals, contending that the district court abused its discretion. In light of the prior history of this case, particularly our decisions in <em>Cheng I </em>and <em>Cheng II, </em>which criticized the district court\u2019s view that the Epstein firm should not be disqualified, it is clear that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finally granting the disqualification motion. The order appealed from is therefore affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
