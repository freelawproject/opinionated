Tooker received a sentence of two consecutive two-year terms of imprisonment and a $100,000 fine after he pleaded guilty to a two-count information charging that he unlawfully attempted to export arms in violation of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in its denial of the motion for reduction of sentence, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">Tooker was arrested at Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport on February 15, 1983, when he attempted to board a flight to London, England, with twenty-four night vision devices, which, under 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.01 (1984), are classified as munitions of war. Tooker had failed to comply with the licensing provisions for exporting these munitions as required by 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The attempted export formed the basis of Count 2 of the information, and Tooker\u2019s negotiation with South Africa concerning the export of bomb parts formed the basis of Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-15\">Tooker pleaded guilty to both counts as part of a plea bargain in exchange for the Government\u2019s promise not to bring additional charges of customs law violation relating to the same transactions. The district court accepted Tooker\u2019s plea and ordered a presentence investigation. A presentence investigation report was prepared by the United States Probation Office and made available to Tooker and his counsel prior to the sentencing proceeding. At sentencing, defense counsel took exception to the presentence report\u2019s evaluation of the severity of Tooker\u2019s offense. According to Tooker\u2019s counsel, the United States Probation Office erroneously assigned an offense severity factor of \u201c8\u201d \u2014 a classification usually assigned to offenses such as treason. The district court sentenced Tooker to the maximum term of imprisonment (two years on each count) on March 25, 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-16\">With the assistance of counsel, Tooker thereafter filed a Rule 35 motion on June 9, 1983. The motion alleged that the court\u2019s assessment of the maximum term of imprisonment was influenced by bond having been set at $1,000,000 and the presentence report\u2019s classification of Tooker\u2019s offenses in Category 8. Tooker further contended that both the amount of bond and the severity category were based upon erroneous assumptions. Tooker also maintained that the presentence report contained erroneous information regarding his prior travels in that the report stated that he had traveled to Russia, Tooker assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>ed that he had never traveled to the Soviet Union, but that his passport contained a Greek visa (or stamp) which was apparently mistaken as Russian by the probation officer who prepared the report. The motion also alleged that the bomb parts deal never passed the stage of preliminary negotiations and that the Republic of South Africa, a friendly ally of the United States, was the contemplated destination of the bomb parts. The motion also stated that Great Britain was the contemplated destination of the night sights and that the sights were items readily available on the open market. Tooker offered correspondence and telex messages in support of these claims. The motion further asserted that the district court had assumed that Tooker\u2019s dealings implicated national security concerns and that the above information undercut the court\u2019s erroneous assumption. According to Tooker, neither South Africa nor Great Britain represented the type of risk to American security that would justify treating the export of weapons to that country as treason. On August 1, 1983, Tooker filed a <em>pro se </em>amendment to the motion of June 9. In his amendment, Took-er urged the court to act under the newly amended Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(B). On August 30, 1983, the court denied Tooker\u2019s motion without conducting a hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">On appeal, Tooker maintains that the district court erred in denying his Rule 35 motion and that the amended provisions of Rule 32(c)(3)(D) are applicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">II. <em>Presentence Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"AlF\">Tooker contends that his presentence report contained factually erroneous information concerning his travels. Tooker further asserts that the district court relied upon this allegedly erroneous information in imposing the maximum term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">Generally, this Court will not review the severity of a sentence imposed within statutory limits. <em>United States v. Sparrow, </em>673 F.2d 862, 864 (5th Cir.1982). This Court will, however, \u201ccarefully scrutinize the judicial process by which punishment was imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A Rule 35 motion is directed to the sound discretion of the district court and will be disturbed only for illegality or gross abuse of discretion. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Robinson, </em>700 F.2d 205, 214 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1003, 79 L.Ed.2d 235 (1984). Despite the district court\u2019s broad discretion, a defendant retains the right not to be sentenced on the basis of invalid premises. <em>United States v. Espinoza, </em>481 F.2d 553, 555 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">A defendant may not obtain relief, however, by merely alleging that his presentence report contained factual inaccuracies or inappropriate information. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>693 F.2d 412, 415 (5th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Cimino, </em>659 F.2d 535, 537 (5th Cir.1981). ' Indeed, a defendant must show that the information was <em>materially </em>inaccurate and that the judge <em>relied </em>on that information. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">In the instant case, Tooker points to the district court judge\u2019s statements at sentencing in support of his contention that the court relied upon erroneous factual information. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-11\">I think these were illegally exported because there was no End Use Certificate obtained. Based on the time and travel that the Defendant has done internationally, it is not realistic to me that he was not acquainted with the requirements of international trade. <em>I have </em>\u2014 or <em>there exists nothing but his word that the destination of these implements of war </em>\u2014 and <em>that\u2019s what they are </em>\u2014 was' <em>South Africa. </em>It involves substantial amounts of money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>We know, and I know from prior experience and prior cases involving the criminal exportation of implements of war that these items end up in the hands of people who intend to use them. Otherwise, they\u2019re not interested in spending millions of dollars to acquire them. And when we\u2019re talking about night vision scopes and bomb fin assemblies, we\u2019re not talking about something that we use on September 1st on the opening of dove season. <em>We\u2019re talking about implements that are parts of deadly weapons that can only be used </em>\u2014 and <em>particularly in that part of the country </em>\u2014 for <em>terror, mayhem, and other undesirable things.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-5\">In my opinion, the turning loose of items like this into the international stream of commerce could very well compromise the security of the United States: And, at the present time, particularly, with the matters that were revealed on Monday night by the President during his address to the nation, <em>I think that we can sorely stand not to have the security of the United States threatened or compromised.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Record Vol. 4 at 8-9 (emphasis added). Tooker suggests that the emphasized portions of the court\u2019s comments indicate that the court' erroneously assumed that the arms were destined for Russia for use in \u201cterror, mayhem, and other undesirable things.\u201d We find Tooker\u2019s argument untenable. Nothing in the court\u2019s statements evinces any reliance by the court on the presentenee report\u2019s listing of Russia as one of the countries to which Tooker had traveled.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, as defense counsel conceded during oral argument before this Court, the district judge\u2019s statements can reasonably be interpreted as an expression of the court\u2019s concern that illegally purchased arms could fall into the wrong hands in South Africa or England and be used in terrorist activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">Tooker also maintains that his presentence report erroneously classified the severity of his offense in Category 8 and that the district court was influenced by that classification in imposing sentence. Tooker has demonstrated, however, neither that the classification by the parole office was a misclassification, nor that the court relied upon the classification in imposing sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clearly, the court made no reference to the classification in giving its reasons for imposing the maximum term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-10\">Tooker also points to the district court\u2019s statement concerning an \u201cend use certificate\u201d as evincing the court\u2019s reliance on inaccurate information. According to Tooker, an end use certificate had not yet become necessary because the agreement to export the munitions was still being negotiated. An end user\u2019s certificate could not be obtained, argues Tooker, until the deal had been consummated. This argument is specious. The issue of whether an end use certificate was the appropriate license for exporting munitions speaks more to the question of Tooker\u2019s guilt rather than to the propriety of his sentence. Tooker\u2019s guilt is not an issue now before this Court. Indeed, at the ' proceeding where Tooker entered his plea of guilty, Tooker readily admitted that he did not have the proper license to export munitions. Further, Tooker did not object (although given the opportunity to do so by the court) to the Government\u2019s factual summary which recited that an end use certificate was the appropriate license that would permit shipment of the munitions from the United States. The presentence report merely repeated the factual summary which had been put in the record at the plea proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-11\">In sum, Tooker has the burden of demonstrating that his presentence report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>contained materially false information upon which the district court relied or that the court abused its discretion. <em>See Robinson, </em>700 F.2d at 214. He has shown neither.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">III. <em>Rule 32(c)(3)(D)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> requires the sentencing court, as to each matter controverted, either to make a finding as to the accuracy of the challenged factual proposition or to determine that a finding is unnecessary because the matter controverted will not be considered in sentencing. The rule further requires that a written record of the court\u2019s findings accompany any copy later made available to the Bureau of Prisons or the Parole Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">The amended rule became effective on August 1, 1983, over four months after Tooker\u2019s conviction and sentencing. The Supreme Court\u2019s implementation order provides that the amendments \u201cshall govern all criminal proceedings thereafter commenced and, insofar as just and practicable, in proceedings then pending.\u201d Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D), 103 S.Ct. 81 (advance sheet, yellow pages, June 15,1983). Tooker argues that the amended rule is applicable to the instant case because his Rule 35(b) motion was pending on the effective date of the amendments and urges us to remand his case to the district court for compliance with the rule. The Government counters that the thrust of Rule 32 pertains to sentencing proceedings, and not to motions under Rule 35. Thus, the argument follows, \u201cpending\u201d refers to cases pending for sentencing, not pending Rule 35 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">The Advisory Committee Notes to the proposed Rule 35(c)(3)(D) indicate that the purposes of the amendments are to ensure that a record is made of the resolution of controverted matters and to make certain that the resolution of those controversies comes to the attention of the agencies who utilize the presentence report. With these purposes in mind, and assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Tooker\u2019s sentencing proceedings were pending on August 1, 1983, we fail to see how it is either just or practicable that the amended rule apply here. Indeed, according to Tooker\u2019s counsel at oral argument, the allegedly erroneous factual information in the presentence report was brought to the attention of the probation office and the severity category of Tooker\u2019s offense has been reclassified. <em>See </em>n. 5 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">Tooker has alleged no facts to show that the sentence he received was a gross abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court denying Tooker\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-11\">Any person who willfully violates any provision of this section or section 2779 of this title, or any rule or regulation issued under either section, or who willfully, in a registration or license application or required report, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, shall upon conviction be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778(b)(1) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-13\">As prescribed in regulations issued under this section, every person (other than an officer or employee of the United States Government acting in an official capacity) who engages in the business of manufacturing, exporting, or importing any defense articles or defense services designated by the President under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall register with the United States Government agency charged with the administration of this section, and shall pay a registration fee which shall be prescribed by such regulations____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1053-18\">. Although Tooker received the maximum term of imprisonment, he did not receive the maximum fine. The district court could have fined Tooker an additional $100,000. <em>See 22 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2778(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">. We note that in his brief on appeal, Tooker makes much of the district court\u2019s summary denial of his Rule 35 motion. It is well established, however, that the district court may summarily deny such a motion \"if the facts alleged fail to show illegality or gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>743 F.2d 1127 at 1129 (5th Cir.1984); <em>see also United States v. Nerren, </em>613 F.2d 572, 573 (5th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Muniz, </em>571 F.2d 1344, 1345 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">. The report stated that Tooker had traveled extensively to foreign countries including Israel, Africa, England, Egypt and Russia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">. At oral argument, defense counsel stated that the United States Parole Office has reclassified the severity of Tooker's offense as Category 4. He also stated that at the time of Tooker\u2019s offense, the parole office had no classification for such an offense and that is the reason that the offense was placed in Category 8. Any reclassification by the parole office, however, is not disclosed by the record on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">. It should also be noted that the sentencing judge possesses wide discretion, largely unlimited in scope, in both the kind and source of information he may consider in determining punishment. <em>United States v. Ochoa, </em>659 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 959, 102 S.Ct. 1472, 71 L.Ed.2d 678 (1982). Further, the judge is permitted to look beyond the record and consider a defendant's past conduct and activities. <em>Id. </em>In this regard, it is highly probable that the district judge in the instant case properly considered, and was influenced by, the fact that Tooker\u2019s guilty plea to two counts of unlawfully attempting to export munitions of war was in exchange for the Government\u2019s promise not to bring additional charges of customs law violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1056-14\">. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-15\">If the comments of the defendant and his counsel or testimony or other information introduced by them allege any factual inaccuracy in the presentence investigation report or the summary of the report or part thereof, the court shall, as to each matter controverted, make (i) a finding as to the allegation, or (ii) a determination that no such finding is necessary because the matter controverted will not be taken into account in sentencing. A written record of such findings and determinations shall be appended to and accompany any copy of the presentence investigation report thereafter made available to the Bureau of Prisons or the Parole Commission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
