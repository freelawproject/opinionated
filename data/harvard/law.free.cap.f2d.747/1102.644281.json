They cited defendants for hunting migratory birds on a baited field, in violation of federal statute and regulations promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-18\">On the day of the hunt, there was very little \u201cbait\u201d still present in the field. There was testimony that there were two or three places where bait had been, but, at best there were only traces of the bait left.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only true pile of bait existing on the field was a pile which was allegedly covered by recent \u201cbush-hogging.\u201d The unfortunate defendants were apparently unaware of, and had not participated in, the baiting of the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-19\">The Scenic Land Hunting Club (the \u201cClub\u201d) had rented the tract.of land and field at issue from one Charles G. Thomas. Evidently, the ownership of this land was contested by other individuals. As a result of this contest, the Club took legal action and through the efforts of its attorney, John R. Meldorf, also a defendant, obtained a restraining order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prohibiting those other individuals from entering upon the land, or threatening to interfere with its use for hunting. Ironically, according to defendants, on the day of the hunt the Sheriff of Bledsoe County and his deputy were requested by the Club to be present at the field to enforce the order in the event any trouble occurred resulting from the issuance of the restraining order. Also, defendants posted copies of the order at various points around the hunting area in an effort to avoid any problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-20\">There was in fact no evidence introduced at trial tending to show that any of the defendants either baited the field, or knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>that it was baited at any time. The question presented, therefore, is whether individuals who are without knowledge that a field has been baited may still be found criminally liable under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703-711.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Section 703 of Title 16 makes it unlawful for any person, \u201cat any time, by any means or in any manner, to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture, or kill, ... any migratory bird.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 703. That same statute allows for exceptions to this general proscription to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior. Pursuant to this delegated power, the Secretary has promulgated regulations allowing the taking of migratory birds only in a very limited and specific manner. <em>See </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1 (1983). One of the restrictions laid down by the Secretary is that migratory birds may not be taken:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-6\">By the <em>aid of baiting, </em>or <em>on or over any baited area. </em>As used in this paragraph, <em>\u201cbaiting\u201d </em>shall mean the placing, exposing,- depositing, distributing, or scattering of shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn, wheat or other grain, salt, or other feed so as to constitute for such birds, a lure, attraction or enticement to, on, or over any areas where hunters are attempting to take them; and <em>\u201cbaited area\u201d </em>means any area where shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn, wheat or other grain, salt, or other feed whatsoever capable of luring, attracting, or enticing such birds is directly or indirectly placed, exposed, deposited, distributed, or scattered; and such area shall remain a baited area for 10 days following comp\u00edete removal of all such corn, wheat or other grain, salt, or other feed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">50 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">Therefore, this regulation effectively proscribes two different kinds of conduct; (1) taking migratory birds \u201cby aid of baiting,\u201d and (2) taking migratory birds \u201con or over any baited area.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bryson, </em>414 F.Supp. 1068, 1072 (D.Del.1976). The penalty set out by Congress is a fine of not more than $500, or imprisonment for not more than six months. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. In the present case, appellants have been charged and convicted only under the latter offense, taking migratory birds on or over a baited field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\">There was direct testimony to the effect that on August 26, 1982 (nine days prior to the hunt) the field was baited. Under the definition of \u201cbaited field,\u201d <em>see </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21(i), this field was therefore baited on September 4, 1982, the day of the hunt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority view, and the view of this circuit, is that there need be no showing that the defendants actually baited the field, or that they even knew it was baited; rather the crime is a strict liability offense. In <em>United States v. Green, </em>571 F.2d 1, 2 (6th Cir.1977), this circuit held that 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21(i) does \u201cnot require proof of knowledge.\u201d (Citation omitted). This was subsequently reaffirmed in <em>United States v. Brandt, </em>717 F.2d 955, 958 n. 3 (6th Cir.1983). In <em>Brandt, </em>although the court was dealing with a somewhat different issue,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-13\">The hunter is therefore placed in a precarious position____ A subjectively \u201cinnocent\u201d person can unwittingly run afoul of the regulation. However, this is inherent in all so called \u201cpublic welfare offenses\u201d wherein scienter is not an ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>ment of the offense and these types of offenses have long been sanctioned by the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 958 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">The Sixth Circuit is not alone in this view. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jarman, </em>491 F.2d 764 (4th Cir.1974). We find that only <em>United States v. Delahoussaye, </em>573 F.2d 910 (5th Cir.1978), has taken a different approach. In <em>Delahoussaye, </em>to establish a violation under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703-711, a minimum of scienter was required to be proven. The court concluded that a \u201creason to know\u201d that the field has been baited must be demonstrated, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-6\">Any other interpretation would simply render criminal conviction an unavoidable occasional consequence of duck hunting and deny the sport to those such as, say, judges who might find such a consequence unacceptable. On the other hand, to require a higher form of scienter \u2014 actual guilty knowledge \u2014 would render the regulations very hard to enforce and would remove all incentive for the hunter to clear the area, a precaution which can reasonably be required. Such a reading is unnecessary to the regulations\u2019 constitutionality, and we reject it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANr\"><em>Id. </em>at 912-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">Were we writing with a clean slate, this reasoning would be appealing, but this view was expressly rejected in <em>Brandt, </em>717 F.2d at 958 n. 3. We also rejected in <em>Green </em>any argument that there must be proof that the baiting was done for the hunters\u2019 benefit. 571 F.2d at 2. The law is, unhappily for defendants, established that scienter is not required for a conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We concede that it is a harsh rule and trust that prosecution will take place in the exercise of sound discretion only. It is for Congress and the Secretary of the Interior to establish and change the policies here involved,</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">We reluctantly in this case must Affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1179-15\">. On September 1, 1982, bait was observed still to be op the field.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1179-16\">. Meldorf, according to defendants\u2019 brief, at the time of the hunt was only a \"guest of the Club in recognition of his obtaining the restraining order.\u201d Also, Meldorf \"was so unfamiliar with the [field] that he drove past [it] three times before he found it.\u201d <em>See </em>Brief for Defendants-Appel-Iants at 7. Thus, we are presented here with a different kind of \"attorney\u2019s fee\u201d question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">. Appellants also contest the sufficiency of the evidence tending to show bait on the field the day of the hunt. They concede, however, the fact that bait was on the field just nine days prior thereto. Under the regulations adopted by the Secretary, there need be no bait on the field on the day of the hunt. 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">. The court was addressing 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.-21(i)(2), a proviso that allows taking migratory birds over land that is of <em>\u201cbona fide </em>agricultural operations.\" The court unanimously upheld the validity of the statute and its strict liability nature, ruling that when taking migratory birds over a field supposedly seeded for agricultural purposes, the intent of the party doing the seeding is relevant as to whether it was for agricultural purposes. This does <em>not </em>affect the strict liability nature of the offense in regard to the hunter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">. Appellants\u2019 final argument that the regulations are unreasonable in light of congressional intent is unavailing. The Secretary was given plenary power to allow the taking of migratory birds, which is otherwise <em>wholly unlawful. </em>We are not prepared to say the Secretary\u2019s regulations are arbitrary or constitute a \"clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>Citizens To Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Rather, the regulations are entitled to a \"presumption of regularity.\" <em>See National Rifle Association of America, Inc. v. Kleppe, </em>425 F.Supp. 1101, 1111 (D.D.C.1976), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>571 F.2d 674 (D.C.Cir.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
