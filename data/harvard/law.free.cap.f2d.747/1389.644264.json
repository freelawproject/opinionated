The Immigration Judge and the Board of Review found that he was ineligible for suspension of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254 because, under subsection (f) he had \u201centered the United States as a crewman.\u201d Evidence showed that, though petitioner had not previously served as a crewman, before he traveled to the United States he was hired to' be a crewman for a specific vessel at Panama City, Florida. After entry he traveled to Panama City where he joined the crew of the ship. He served for a week, left the ship, and remained illegally in the United States for 12 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>The Immigration Judge rejected the contention of petitioner that he did not enter as a crewman because he only became a crewman after he arrived in the United States and joined his ship. The Immigration Judge relied on <em>Matter of Goncalves, </em>10 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 277 (BIA 1963), in which a seaman was employed on an American vessel that was sold abroad; he was brought back to the United States in transit so that he could ship over on a foreign vessel. He was admitted for the purpose of shipping over. Unable to obtain employment as a seaman, he took a job in the United States. The Board of Review held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-4\">[I]t matters little that an alien is admitted as a crewman and deserts his ship, or that he deserted the ship without being permitted to land as a crewman, or that he, as is commonplace, was brought to the United States as a passenger or workaway to reship as a seaman on another vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-5\">We believe that the respondent is barred from [section 244] relief because he entered in pursuit of his calling as a seaman. That he entered by reason of his occupation is clear from his testimony which shows he entered the United States to ship out as a seaman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">The Immigration Judge held that it is not necessary for a person to be a crewman before he enters the United States in order to enter as a crewman, that if he enters to ship on a vessel as a crewman he is admitted in pursuit of his calling as a seaman. The Board of Review followed <em>Goncalves. </em>Petitioner contends that the case should be controlled by <em>Matter of Rebelo, </em>13 I &amp; N Dec. 84 (BIA 1968), which states that the applicability of the crewman exclusion is limited to cases where the alien is serving aboard a vessel and seeks and gains admission because of his occupation in that role. We agree with the Board that <em>Rebelo </em>is not controlling. Rebelo, occupationally an alien crewman, was admitted to the United States as a properly documented visitor for pleasure. He did not enter in pursuit of his calling. If the first prong of the <em>Rebelo </em>language were applied literally as petitioner desires, neither an alien in transit between service on two different vessels nor an alien who has left the service of a vessel outside the United States and returns to the United States and rejoins that same vessel would be a crewman within the meaning of subsection (f). We agree with the Board that <em>Goncalves </em>is properly applied to this case and that the focal issue is whether petitioner entered the United States in pursuit of his calling as a seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
