They will be considered in an unpublished memorandum pursuant to Ninth Circuit Rule 21. <em>See United States v. Kennedy, </em>726 F.2d 546, 547 n. 1 (9th Cir.1984), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 365, 83 L.Ed.2d 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1383-32\">ALARCON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1383-33\">James Newport and Dennis Thomas appeal their convictions stemming from their participation in a scheme to manufacture and distribute phenyl-2-propanone and methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-34\">We must decide whether a jury instruction which equates \u201creasonable doubt\u201d with \u201creal doubt\u201d diminishes the government\u2019s burden of proof in violation of due process. We conclude that giving a \u201creal doubt\u201d instruction to the jury does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>not constitute constitutional error and affirm. i</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">The district court gave the following instructions on reasonable doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-5\">The defendants are presumed by law to be innocent. The law does not require a defendant to prove his innocence or produce any evidence at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-6\">The government has the burden of proving each defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and if it fails to do so, you must acquit him. Thus, while the government\u2019s burden of proof is a strict or heavy burden, it is not necessary that the defendant\u2019s guilt be proved beyond all possible doubt. It is only required that the government\u2019s proof exclude any reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-7\">A reasonable doubt is a real doubt based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that you would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of your own affairs. If you are convinced that the accused have been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, say so. If you are not convinced, say so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-8\">Unless the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed every element of the offense with which he is charged, you must find him not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-9\">Newport and Thomas argue, without citation to any authority, that \u201cthere would appear to be a Due Process constitutional infirmity with the \u2018real doubt\u2019 instruction given by the Court.\u201d They also contend that \u201c[a]s defined by Webster, the term \u2018real\u2019 must mean \u2018indubitable\u2019 or \u2018unquestionable.\u2019 \u201d This argument ignores the fact that the same source lists other meanings for the term \u201creal,\u201d which preceed those 'selected by appellants, including \u201cauthentic,\u201d \u201cgenuine,\u201d \u201cactual,\u201d and \u201ctrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-10\">\u201cReal\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Third International New Dictionary 1890 (1971) as \u201cthat is precisely what its name implies: not merely so called: truly possessing the essence of what it is called.\u201d Thus, when used as an adjective in connection with, the word \u201cdoubt,\u201d the term \u201creal\u201d means a doubt which is an authentic, genuine, actual and true instead of its opposite meaning i.e. \u201cunreal, apparent, or imaginary\u201d doubt. <em>See </em>antonym of \u201creal\u201d in Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 962 (1975). \u201cReal\u201d is a qualitative and not a quantitative term. As used in the court\u2019s instructions, it refers to the \u201cnature\u201d of the doubt rather than the \u201camount\u201d of the doubt which must be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-12\">An appellate court reviewing a reasonable doubt charge' must consider the instructions in their entirety. If the charge, taken as a whole, fairly and accurately conveys the meaning of reasonable doubt, it is proper. <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>713 F.2d 463, 472 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 535, 78 L.Ed.2d 715 (1983); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>546 F.2d 309, 314 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 918, 97 S.Ct. 1333, 51 L.Ed.2d 597 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">We are satisfied that, when considered contextually, the court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt was free of constitutional error. The issue we review in this opinion is one of first impression in this circuit. The Fifth Circuit, however, has ruled on this precise question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-16\">In <em>United States v. Schaffer, </em>600 F.2d 1120 (5th Cir.1979), in considering a similar set of instructions, the Fifth Circuit held that defining reasonable doubt as \u201creal doubt\u201d when considered \u201cin light of the entire jury charge,\u201d did not lessen the government\u2019s burden or constitute plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 1123. In <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>681 F.2d 997, 1002 (5th Cir.1982), the court held that an instruction which included the \u201creal doubt\u201d language was a \u201cproper\u201d charge without discussing the precise question presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-17\">Our determination that the instruction used by this court in this matter did not violate due process should not be construed as an indication that we approve of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>language used or that it contains the most appropriate formulation of the reasonable doubt standard. In <em>Taylor v. Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. 478, 488, 98 S.Ct. 1930, 1936, 56 L.Ed.2d 468 (1978), the Court commented that a definition of reasonable doubt as \u201ca substantial doubt, a real doubt\u201d while \u201cperhaps not in itself reversible error often has been criticized as confusing.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Muckenstrum, </em>515 F.2d 568, 571 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1032, 96 S.Ct. 564, 46 L.Ed.2d 406 (1975); <em>United States v. Christy, </em>444 F.2d 448, 450 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404. U.S. 949, 92 S.Ct. 293, 30 L.Ed.2d 266 (1971). <em>Id. </em>at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">The challenged instruction was free of constitutional error. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
