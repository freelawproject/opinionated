(NASD) is a self-regulatory association created pursuant to the Maloney Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o-3 (1982), to regulate brokers and dealers of securities who are members of the association. One of NASD\u2019s members, Lewellyn Company, converted almost $15 million of funds and securities of the now insolvent First National Bank of Humboldt, Iowa. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as receiver of the bank, alleged that the bank\u2019s loss of a portion of the converted funds was proximately caused by NASD\u2019s negligent admission and supervision of Lewellyn Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed FDIC\u2019s complaint against NASD on a FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(6) motion, finding that \u201ca customer [First National Bank of Humboldt, Iowa] of a member [Lewellyn Company] of a national securities association [NASD] has no common law cause of action against the association for negligent admission or supervision of the member.\u201d <em>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v.
