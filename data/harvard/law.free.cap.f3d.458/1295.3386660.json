The first time, we reversed the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of this \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Gray v. Bostic, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 472, 2004 WL 3112657 (11th Cir.2004). This time, the defendants appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motions for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. After review, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-11\">\n<em>A. The Incident</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-12\">Coach Lattuce Greer Williams believed that Gray was not doing \u201cjumping jacks\u201d along with the rest of the physical education class. Coach Williams told Gray she needed to do her exercises. When Gray failed to comply, Coach Williams told Gray to \u201c[cjome to the wall\u201d of the gym. Williams testified that as Gray walked to the wall, \u201c[s]he told me that she would punch me or hit me, hit me in the face.\u201d A nearby teacher, Coach Tara Horton, witnessed the disagreement with Coach Williams. Coach Horton testified that Gray said, \u201cI bust you in the head,\u201d which Coach Horton explained meant that \u201cshe was going to hit him in the head.\u201d Although Coach Williams and Coach Horton attribute slightly different language to Gray, the gist of their testimony is that Gray threatened to hit Coach Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-14\">In contrast, Gray testified that she did not threaten to \u201cbust\u201d Coach Williams in the head. Although Gray could not remember what she said, she agreed that she threatened to \u201cdo something\u201d to Coach Williams and that what she said was disrespectful, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-15\">Q: Then, [Coach Williams] told me that, at that point, you told him that you were going to bust him in his head; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-16\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-17\">Q: You didn\u2019t say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-18\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-19\">Q: Is Coach Williams lying to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-20\">MR. LIVEOAK: Objection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-21\">Q: (By Mr. Wisdom) You can answer. Is Coach Williams telling me a lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-22\">A: I guess he did. I don\u2019t remember what I said, but I didn\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-23\">Q: You don\u2019t remember what you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-24\">A: (Witness shakes head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-25\">Q: You don\u2019t have any idea what you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-26\">MR. LIVEOAK: Is that no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-5\">Q: (By Mr. Wisdom) So, you don\u2019t know if you said that you might punch him; is that right: Did you say something to him that was disrespectful?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-6\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-7\">Q: What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-8\">A: I don\u2019t remember..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-9\">Q: Did you tell him that you might do something to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-10\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-11\">Q: What did you tell him that you were going to do to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-12\">A: I don\u2019t remember.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-13\">Because of the summary judgment posture of the case, we construe Gray\u2019s testimony as denying the coaches\u2019 version of what she said. However, Gray does not dispute that she threatened to \u201cdo something\u201d physically to Coach Williams. Thus the precise nature of her physical threat\u2014 whether it was to hit him in the face,-poke him in the eye or kick him in the shins\u2014 does not change our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">After hearing Gray\u2019s threat to Coach Williams, Coach Horton instructed Gray to come over to her. Coach Williams then turned his attention back to his class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-17\">Deputy Antonio Bostic also witnessed the exchange between Gray and Coach Williams. Deputy Bostic was employed as a Tuscaloosa County Sheriffs Deputy and served as a school resource officer (\u201cSRO\u201d) for several schools, including Holt Elementary. Before Gray reached Coach Horton, Deputy Bostic intervened and told Coach Horton that he would talk to Gray. Coach Horton insisted that she would handle the matter. However, Deputy Bostic insisted that he would handle Gray and escorted Gray out the gym door into a lobby area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-18\">Deputy Bostic told Gray to turn around, pulled her hands behind her back and put Gray in handcuffs. Deputy Bostic tightened the handcuffs to the point that they caused Gray pain. Deputy Bostic told Gray, \u201c[T]his is how it feels when you break the law,\u201d and \u201c[T]his is how it feels to be in jail.\u201d Gray began to cry. Gray stood with the handcuffs on for not less than five minutes, with Deputy Bostic standing behind her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-19\">In discovery responses, Deputy Bostic averred that he detained and handcuffed Gray \u201cto impress upon her the serious nature of committing crimes that can lead to arrest, detention or incarceration\u201d and \u201cto help persuade her to rid herself of her disrespectful attitude.\u201d Deputy Bostic\u2019s discovery responses also stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>\u201cdid not feel the need to apologize to LaQuarius Gray for telling her that she committed a misdemeanor in my presence and showing her what would happen if a less generous officer than I were to arrest her for her actions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After Deputy Bostic took the handcuffs off, Gray went to the Coaches\u2019 Office until her next class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">Neither Coach Horton nor Coach Williams was afraid of Gray or believed that Gray would actually carry out her threat. When asked whether he was \u201cever afraid that [Gray] would commit an act of violence towards [him] or Ms. Horton,\u201d Coach Williams replied, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Similarly, Coach Horton replied \u201cNo,\u201d when asked if she was \u201cever afraid that Ms. Gray would physically assault you or another student?\u201d When asked, \u201c[W]hen Ms. Gray told Coach Williams that she was going to bust him in the head she\u2019s not actually physically capable of doing that, is she,\u201d Coach Horton agreed. Coach Horton planned to talk with Gray about the incident and give her a warning. Coach Horton testified that she would not have been required to write Gray up, give Gray detention, or send her to the principal\u2019s office \u201cbecause it wasn\u2019t that major.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">\n<em>B. Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">On November 4, 2003, by and through her mother, Gray filed suit against Deputy Bostic and Tuscaloosa County Sheriff, Edmund Sexton in their official and individual capacities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gray\u2019s complaint contained eight counts, including claims: (1) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of Gray\u2019s First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights (Count 1); (2) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 for race discrimination (Count 2); and (3) under state law for invasion of privacy, assault and battery, false imprisonment, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Counts 4 through 8). Gray also sought declaratory and injunctive relief (Count 3). The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-11\">Gray appealed to this Court, challenging only the district court\u2019s dismissal of her Fourth Amendment claims against Deputy Bostic and Sheriff Sexton individually and the denial of her motion for leave to amend her complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reversed, stating that on remand Gray was entitled to pursue her Fourth Amendment claims against defendants Deputy Bostic and Sheriff Sexton individually and to file an amended complaint. <em>Gray, </em>127 Fed-Appx. 472. The district court ordered Gray to file an amended complaint asserting only the Fourth Amendment claims that remained following her appeal. Gray then amended her complaint, asserting claims of excessive use of force and unreasonable seizure against defendants Bostic and Sexton individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-12\">Following discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>qualified immunity. The district court denied the motion, prompting'this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">Although the denial of summary judgment generally is not a final appeal-able order subject to immediate appeal, \u00e1n interlocutory appeal may be taken where the district court denies the defense of qualified immunity and the appeal involves a question of law. <em>McMillian v. Johnson, </em>88 F.3d 1554, 1563, <em>amended on other grounds, </em>101 F.3d 1363 (11th Cir.1996). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the opposing party. <em>Williams v. Consol. City of Jacksonville, </em>341 F.3d 1261, 1266-67 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-8\">\n<em>A. Qualified Immunity Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-9\">\u201cQualified immunity offers a complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities if their conduct \u2018does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1346 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). To be entitled to qualified immunity, the defendant must prove that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority. <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnce the defendants establish that they were acting within their discretionary authority, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that qualified immunity is not appropriate.\u201d <em>Lumley v. City of Dade City, </em>327 F.3d 1186, 1194 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-10\">The Supreme Court has established a two-part test to evaluate whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity. First, as -a threshold inquiry, we address whether the facts presented, taken in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, establish a constitutional violation. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). If we answer this question in the affirmative, then we \u201cask whether the right was clearly established.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-12\">\n<em>B. Deputy Bostic\u2019s Discretionary Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-13\">Gray argues that Deputy Bostic was not acting within the scope of his discretionary authority when he detained and handcuffed Gray. \u201cTo establish that the challenged actions were within the scope '-of his discretionary authority, a defendant must show that those actions were (1) undertaken pursuant to the performance of his duties, and (2) within the scope of his authority.\u201d <em>Harbert Int\u2019l v. James, </em>157 F.3d 1271, 1282 (11th Cir.1998). To that end, \u201ca court must ask whether the act complained of, if done for a proper purpose, would be within, or reasonably related to, the outer perimeter of an official\u2019s discretionary duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-14\">Although our prior opinion concluding that Deputy Bostic was acting within his discretionary authority was at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage and was based on merely the allegations in the complaint, there is no evidence at the summary judgment stage that changes our conclusion. Deputy Bostic as an SRO, was charged with the responsibility to investigate criminal activity that might be taking place at Holt Elementary School. As part of that responsibility, Deputy Bostic\u2019s, duties included, under the right circumstances, detaining and questioning .students and possibly arrest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>ing and handcuffing them. The fact that' the right circumstances (for detention or handcuffing) may not have been present in this case is irrelevant to our inquiry. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that the \u201cinquiry is not whether it was within the defendant\u2019s authority to commit the allegedly illegal act\u201d because \u201c[fjramed that way, the inquiry is no more than an \u2018untenable\u2019 tautology\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">Gray stresses that SROs were not supposed to discipline students and that Deputy Bostic admitted in his interrogatory responses that his reasons for detaining and handcuffing Gray were to \u201cimpress upon her the serious nature of committing crimes that can lead to arrest, detention or incarceration\u201d and \u201cto help persuade her to rid herself of her disrespectful attitude.\u201d We note, however, that it is also clear from Deputy Bostic\u2019s interrogatory responses that he believed Gray had committed a misdemeanor when she threatened her teacher and that Deputy Bostic detained her to discuss the incident with her. Therefore, we conclude that Deputy Bostic\u2019s actions were within his discretionary duties and turn to whether his actions were unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">\n<em>C. Constitutional Violations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">Gray argues that Deputy Bostic used excessive force in detaining her because he lacked a right to detain her at all. Therefore, her excessive force claim is not an independent claim, but rather is subsumed in her illegal seizure claim. <em>See Bashir v. Rockdale County, </em>445 F.3d 1323, 1331 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that \u201c[u]nder this Circuit\u2019s law ... a claim that any force in an illegal stop or arrest is excessive is subsumed in the illegal stop or arrest claim and is not a discrete excessive force claim\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, our inquiry focuses on Deputy Bostic\u2019s seizure of Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-9\">As stated in Gray\u2019s earlier appeal, we apply the reasonableness standard articulated in <em>New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 </em>U.S. 325, 341-42, 105 S.Ct. 733, 742-43, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985), to school seizures by law enforcement officers. <em>See Gray, </em>No. 04-12240, slip op. at 14, 2004 WL 3112657. In <em>T.L.O., </em>the Supreme Court recognized that the substantial need to maintain discipline in the classroom and foster a positive learning environment \u201crequires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search\u201d in the public school setting. <em>T.L.O. </em>469 U.S. at 340, 105 S.Ct. at 742. To that end, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe accommodation of the privacy interests of schoolchildren with the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools does not require strict adherence to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 105 S.Ct. at 742. Instead, under T.L.O.\u2019s reasonableness standard, \u201cthe legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the <em>T.L.O. </em>standard, the reasonableness of the search is evaluated using a two-step inquiry: \u201cfirst, one must consider \u2018whether the ... action was justified at its inception\u2019; second, one must determine whether the search as actually conducted \u2018was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified interference in the first place.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 105 S.Ct. at 742-43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>(citations omitted). The <em>T.L.O. </em>standard mirrors the standard announced in <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>governing the reasonableness of investigatory stops. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-4\">Under T.L.O.\u2019s first prong, we examine whether Deputy Bostic has a reasonable basis for calling Gray over to him, i.e., stopping her, and asking her questions. It is undisputed that Deputy Bostic witnessed Gray threaten to do something physically to her teacher. Under Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-11-8, a verbal threat, \u201cmade with the intent to carry out the threat, that would cause a reasonable person who is the target of the threat to fear for his or her safety,\u201d constitutes the crime of harassment, which is a Class C misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-ll-8(a)(l)-(3). Gray stresses neither Coach Williams nor Coach Horton feared for their safety and that Deputy Bostic had no probable cause or arguable probable cause to arrest her. However, under <em>T.L.O., </em>the level of suspicion in a school setting needed to justify a search or an investigatory stop is only reasonableness under the circumstances. Given his having witnessed Gray\u2019s threat in a school setting, Deputy Bostic\u2019s stopping Gray to question her about her conduct was reasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">Turning to T.L.O.\u2019s second prong, we must consider whether Deputy Bostic\u2019s subsequent handcuffing of Gray \u201cwas reasonably related to the scope of the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>T.L.O. </em>469 U.S. at 341, 105 S.Ct. at 743 (quotation marks omitted and emphasis supplied). \u201c[A seizure] will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the [seizure] and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 105 S.Ct. at 743. After stopping Gray, Deputy Bostic not only questioned her, but also handcuffed her for not less than five minutes. Thus, the question under the second prong is whether the handcuffing of nine-year-old Gray was reasonably related to the scope of the circumstances which justified Deputy Bostic\u2019s initial interference and was not excessively intrusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-7\">By his own admission, Deputy Bostic did not handcuff Gray to effect an arrest of Gray. Rather, his handcuffing of Gray was during an investigatory stop. Nonetheless, during an investigatory stop, an officer can still handcuff a detainee when the officer reasonably believes that the detainee presents a potential threat to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>safety. <em>See United States v. Hastamorir, </em>881 F.2d 1551, 1557 (11th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Blackman, </em>66 F.3d 1572, 1576-77 (11th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Kapperman, </em>764 F.2d 786, 790-91 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">The problem in this ease for Deputy Bostic is that, at the time Deputy Bostic handcuffed Gray, there was no indication of a potential threat to anyone\u2019s safety. The incident was over, and Gray, after making the comment, had promptly complied with her teachers\u2019 instructions, coming to the gym wall and then to Coach Horton when told to do so. There is no evidence that Gray was gesturing or engaging in any further disruptive behavior. Rather, Gray had cooperated with her teachers and did not pose a threat to anyone\u2019s safety. In fact, Coach Horton had insisted that she would handle the matter, but Deputy Bostic still intervened. Deputy Bostic does not even claim that he handcuffed Gray to protect his or anyone\u2019s safety. Rather, Deputy Bostic candidly admitted that he handcuffed Gray to persuade her to get rid of her disrespectful attitude and to impress upon her the serious nature of committing crimes. In effect, Deputy Bostic\u2019s handcuffing of Gray was his attempt to punish Gray in order to change her behavior in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">Thus, Deputy Bostic\u2019s handcuffing Gray was not reasonably related to the scope of the circumstances that justified the initial investigatory stop. Rather, the handcuffing was excessively intrusive given Gray\u2019s young age and the fact that it was not done to protect anyone\u2019s safety. Therefore, the handcuffing of Gray violated Gray\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">\n<em>D. Clearly Established Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">Whether a constitutional right was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the violation turns on \u201c \u2018whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bashir, </em>445 F.3d at 1330 (quoting <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. at 2156). We focus on the status of the law in March 2003 when Deputy Bostic detained and handcuffed Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-9\">It is well settled that, under the Fourth Amendment, \u201c[t]he scope of a detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification\u201d and that the \u201cinvestigatory methods employed [during a detention] should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officer\u2019s suspicion in a short period of time.\u201d <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1325-26, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983). As we have already discussed, this Court has long concluded that it is reasonable for officers to use handcuffs to protect themselves during an investigative detention. <em>See Hastamorir, </em>881 F.2d at 1556-57; <em>Kapperman, </em>764 F.2d at 790 n. 4. However, Gray does not cite and we cannot locate a case addressing before today when it may be reasonable to use handcuffs in an investigatory stop absent a safety rationale. Thus, no factually similar pre-existing case law put Deputy Bostic on notice that his use of handcuffs to discipline Gray was objectively unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-10\">However, our inquiry does not end here. Even in the absence of factually similar case law, an official can have fair warning that his conduct is unconstitutional when the constitutional violation is obvious, sometimes referred to as \u201cobvious clarity\u201d cases. <em>See United States v. Lanier, </em>520 U.S. 259, 271, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 1227, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (\u201c[A] general con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>stitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question, even though the very action in question has [not] been previously held unlawful.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">The Fourth Amendment\u2019s general proscription against \u201cunreasonable\u201d seizures seldom puts officers on notice that certain conduct is unlawful under precise circumstances. <em>Evans v. Stephens, </em>407 F.3d 1272, 1283 (11th Cir.2005) (en banc). Nonetheless, on rare occasion we have concluded that general Fourth Amendment principles make the constitutional violation obvious. <em>See, e.g., Id. </em>at 1283 (concluding that the constitutional violation was obvious where an officer conducted body cavity searches in a degrading and forceful manner and when there was no need for immediate action); <em>Vinyard, </em>311 F.3d at 1355 (concluding that the constitutional violation was obvious where the officer grabbed the arrestee by the hair and arm and applied pepper spray after she had been handcuffed and secured in the back of the patrol car); <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1198-99 (11th Cir.2002) (concluding that the constitutional violation was readily apparent where an officer slammed the arrestee\u2019s head against the trunk after she was handcuffed, secured and any risk of danger or flight had passed); <em>Priester v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>208 F.3d 919, 927 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that the constitutional violation was obvious where an officer permitted his dog to attack a handcuffed, compliant arrestee for two minutes and then threatened to kill the arrestee when he kicked the dog in an effort to resist the attack). In these cases, the officer\u2019s conduct at issue lay \u201cso obviously at the very core of what the Fourth Amendment prohibits that the unlawfulness of the conduct was readily apparent to [him] notwithstanding the lack of [fact-specific] case law.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>284 F.3d at 1199 (internal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, the officer\u2019s conduct in these cases was \u201cwell beyond the \u2018hazy border\u2019 that sometimes separates lawful conduct from unlawful conduct,\u201d such that every objectively reasonable officer would have known that the conduct was unlawful. <em>Evans, </em>407 F.3d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">We likewise conclude that Deputy Bostic\u2019s conduct in handcuffing Gray, a compliant, nine-year-old girl for the sole purpose of punishing her was an obvious violation of Gray\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. After making the comment, Gray had complied with her teachers\u2019 and Deputy Bostic\u2019s instructions. Indeed, one of the teachers had informed Deputy Bostic that she would handle the matter. In addition, Deputy Bostic\u2019s purpose in handcuffing Gray was not to pursue an investigation to confirm or dispel his suspicions that Gray had committed a misdemeanor. Rather, Deputy Bostic\u2019s purpose in handcuffing Gray was simply to punish her and teach her a lesson. Every reasonable officer would have known that handcuffing a compliant nine-year-old child for purely punitive purposes is unreasonable. We emphasize that the Court is not saying that the use of handcuffs during an investigatory stop of a nine-year-old child is always unreasonable, but just unreasonable under the particular facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">Therefore, Deputy Bostic is not entitled to qualified immunity, and the district court properly denied summary judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-9\">\n<em>E. Sheriff Sexton</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">Gray alleges that Sheriff Sexton failed to train and supervise adequately Deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>Bostic on the proper use of force in this elementary school setting. The district court dismissed Gray\u2019s official capacity claim against Sheriff Sexton without challenge. Thus, all that remains is her individual capacity claim against Sheriff Sexton as Deputy Bostic?s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">Supervisory officials cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for the unconstitutional actions of their subordinates based on respondeat superior liability. <em>Hartley v. Parnell, </em>193 F.3d 1263, 1269 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, supervisors can be held personally liable when either (1) the supervisor personally participates in the alleged constitutional violation, or (2) there is a causal connection between the actions of the supervisor and the alleged constitutional violation. <em>Id. </em>Gray does not allege that Sheriff Sexton personally participated in her handcuffed detention. Thus, Gray attempts to use the second method.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">Under the second method, \u201c[t]he causal connection can be established when a history of widespread abuse puts the responsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation, and he fails to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brown v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 667, 671 (11th Cir.1990)). Furthermore, to be sufficient to notify the supervisor, the deprivations must not only be widespread, they also \u201cmust be obvious, flagrant, rampant and of continued duration, rather than isolated occurrences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brovm, </em>906 F.2d at 671).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">There is no evidence in the record of widespread and obvious handcuffed detentions of students by Deputy Bostic or other deputy sheriffs. There was some vague, arguably hearsay testimony by Coach Horton that she had heard that Deputy Bostic once placed another Holt Elementary student in handcuffs. However, there is no evidence that Sheriff Sexton was aware of this alleged incident. Furthermore, this one isolated incident, of which there are no details, is not sufficient to put Sheriff Sexton on notice that Deputy Bostic needed additional training or supervision on the use of force when detaining minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">We also recognize that Gray alleges that Sheriff Sexton instituted a policy instructing deputies to detain, handcuff, arrest and incarcerate individuals who were not suspected of committing a crime. There is no evidence in the record, however, that Sheriff Sexton instituted such a policy or any other policy that would have led Deputy Bostic to believe that he could detain a student in handcuffs absent safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-13\">Finally, Gray emphasizes that Deputy Bostic received no training specifically addressing the detention of students. She contends that Sheriff Sexton should have foreseen that unwarranted handcuffed detentions of students were \u201cbound to happen\u201d without such training. Thus, Gray is arguing that the need to train was \u201cso obvious\u201d that the failure to do so constituted deliberate indifference without prior notice. <em>See Gold v. City of Miami, </em>151 F.3d 1346, 1352 (11th Cir.1998) (addressing municipal liability for failure to train).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-14\">The Supreme Court has \u201chypothesized that, in a narrow range of circumstances, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>violation of federal rights may be a highly predictable consequence of a failure to equip law enforcement officers with specific tools to handle recurring situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 409, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 1391, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997)). However, the Supreme Court\u2019s only example of an obvious training need was the use of deadly force when police officers are given firearms. We have already determined that the need for training regarding the proper use of handcuffs is \u201c \u2018[ujnlike the risk from a particular glaring omission in a training regimen,\u2019 \u201d and is instead a risk from a \u201cpossible imperfectionf ], ... in ... training and supervision\u201d that is \u201c \u2018not obvious in the abstract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352 (quoting in part <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 409, 117 S.Ct. at 1391).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">We similarly conclude that the need for training regarding the detention of students specifically is not obvious in the abstract and that a lack of such training is a \u201cpossible imperfection,\u201d but not a \u201cglaring omission\u201d from a training regimen. Deputy Bostic received training, at both the police academy and the Tuscaloosa County Sheriffs Department, on the proper use of force and the principles of probable cause. The failure to provide <em>specific </em>training regarding the detention of students, in addition to general training regarding use of force during detention and arrest, was not \u201cso likely\u201d to result in the violation of students\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights that Sheriff Sexton reasonably can be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need for this particularized training without any prior notice. <em>See City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 390-92, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1205-07, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989) (finding no obvious need to train jail supervisors regarding when to provide medical treatment beyond first aid); <em>Gold, </em>151 F.3d at 1352; <em>Young v. City of Augusta, </em>59 F.3d 1160, 1172 (11th Cir.1995) (finding no obvious need to train jailers regarding medical treatment for mental illnesses and dispensing of prescribed medication).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, Sheriff Sexton was entitled to summary judgment in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">\n<em>F. Injunctive Belief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-10\">Defendants also argue that the district court erred in failing to grant summary judgment on Gray\u2019s claim for injunctive relief against Sheriff Sexton.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, Gray\u2019s injunctive relief claim seeks a declaration that Sheriff Sexton\u2019s custom or policy of failing to train deputies on the detention of students is unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>and seeks to enjoin Sheriff Sexton from continuing to implement that custom or policy. However, there is no evidence of an unconstitutional policy or custom implemented by Sheriff Sexton. Therefore, Gray\u2019s claim for injunctive relief against Sheriff Sexton also necessarily fails. Accordingly, Sheriff Sexton is entitled to summary judgment on Gray\u2019s claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on Gray\u2019s illegal seizure claim against Deputy Bostic in his individual capacity, reverse the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on Gray\u2019s claims against Sheriff Sexton and on her separate excessive force claim against Deputy Bostic, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1341-15\">. In the first appeal of the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we reviewed the allegations in the complaint, which stated only that Gray made a \"disrespectful comment\u201d to Coach Williams. We noted that at the Rule 12(b)(6) juncture, there was no allegation of profanity or fighting words or that Gray was a danger to any teacher or student. <em>Gray, </em>No. 04-12240, slip op. at 14, 17, 2004 WL 3112657. Now, at the summary judgment juncture, we have deposition testimony as to what was said and the context in which it was said.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aq18\">. There is a factual dispute about how long Gray was in handcuffs. As to time, Gray testified that she did not know how long she stood in handcuffs. However, Gray was asked whether it was \"less than five minutes,\u201d and' replied \"No, sir.\u201d When Coach Horton was asked how'long Gray was in handcuffs, she responded, \"I\u2019m going to guestimate two minutes maybe.\u201d Deputy Bostic averred that he \u201cdetained [Gray] for less than 30 seconds ....\u201d At the summary judgment stage, however, we must review the evidence in a light most favorable to Gray and as'sume that Gray was handcuffed for not less than five minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1342-7\">. Deputy Bostic was never deposed and did not file a declaration in support of his motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the only sworn statement from Deputy Bostic relating to the events is contained in his interrogatory responses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">. Gray\u2019s original complaint also alleged claims against Joyce Harris, Holt Elementary School's principal; Joyce Sellers, the Tuscaloosa County School Superintendent; and members of the Tuscaloosa County Board of Education. Gray subsequently dismissed these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1342-14\">.In the prior appeal, Gray did not challenge the dismissal of her First, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims, her state law claims or her official capacity claims against Deputy Bostic and Sheriff Sexton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">. Although Gray alleges that Deputy Bostic tightened the handcuffs enough to cause her pain, she has not argued that the handcuffing constituted excessive force even if Deputy Bostic\u2019s stop was supported by reasonable suspicion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">. Although defendants claim Deputy Bostic had probable cause, the conduct in \u00a7 13A-11-8 cases has been generally more egregious and has involved a credible threat. <em>See, e.g., B.B. v. State, </em>863 So.2d 132, 135-36 (Ala.Crim.App.2003) (holding that a disruptive seventh grade student who threatened to kill his teacher violated \u00a7 13A-11-8 where the student was very angry during the incident, uttered the threat through clenched teeth and threw a desk across the room while stating, \u201cI hate that teacher, I hate that teacher,\u201d and the teacher and another witness both testified that they feared the student would harm the teacher); <em>Fallin v. City of Huntsville, </em>865 So.2d 473, 477 (Ala.Crim.App.2003) (concluding that defendant violated \u00a7 13A-11-8 where defendant, a large man, was yelling threats to his daughter's cheerleading coach while approaching her with waving arms and pointing fingers and the coach and other witnesses testified that they were afraid for their safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-9\">However, because <em>T.L.O. </em>does not require probable cause in a school setting, we need not reach the issue of whether Deputy Bostic had probable cause or arguable probable cause. <em>See Durruthy v. Pastor, </em>351 F.3d 1080, 1089 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that a showing of only arguable probable cause is required to establish that an officer is entitled to qualified immunity).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">. For this reason, we reject Gray\u2019s argument that Sheriff Sexton can be held liable because, under Alabama law, a deputy sheriff is the agent and alter ego of the sheriff. To hold Sheriff Sexton liable for Deputy Bostic's alleged constitutional violation under an alter ego theory would amount to respondeat superior liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">. Gray cites no case law or statute that required Sheriff Sexton to train SROs, such as Deputy Bostic, on how to detain students. Therefore, the law was not \"clearly established\u201d for purposes of qualified immunity such that a reasonable official in Sheriff Sexton\u2019s shoes would have known that the failure to provide such training constituted deliberate indifference. <em>See Riley </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>94 F.3d 632, 637 (11th Cir.1996) (concluding that sheriff was entitled to qualified immunity on failure-to-train claim where plaintiffs failed to cite case law or constitutional provision requiring sheriff to provide training on how to use Army personnel and rejecting plaintiffs' argument that <em>City of Cantons </em>general standard of liability in failure to train cases clearly established the right).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AiV\">. Generally, the denial of summary judgment on a claim for injunctive relief is not a final appealable decision. <em>Switzerland Cheese Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. E. Horne\u2019s Market, Inc., </em>385 U.S. 23, 25, 87 S.Ct. 193, 195, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966). However, \"[ujnder the pendant appellate jurisdiction doctrine, we may address [otherwise] nonappealable orders if they are 'inextricably intertwined' with an appealable decision.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Hall, </em>231 F.3d 1289, 1294 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted). Here, Gray's claim for injunctive relief and Sheriff Sexton's argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity are inextricably intertwined because both turn on whether Sheriff Sexton has implemented an unconstitutional policy or custom. <em>See Moniz v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>145 F.3d 1278, 1281 n. 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>(11th Cir.1998) (concluding that the issues are inextricably intertwined when the court, in resolving the qualified immunity issue, also reaches the merits of the pendant claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
