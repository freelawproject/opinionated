In the underlying suit, the Does allege that two members of Chabad House, sent ostensibly to \u201cmotivate, befriend and enrich\u201d J.D., in actuality tormented and abused him. They seek to hold Chabad liable for both the actual injuries to J.D., and also Chabad\u2019s \u201cnegligent selection, training and monitoring of [its members], its negligent misrepresentations, and its failure to warn that [its members] had not been screened or trained and would not be monitored or supervised.\u201d Subsequent to the Does\u2019 initiation of their lawsuit, American Empire, with which Chabad holds an insurance policy, brought a declaratory action seeking a judgment that the American Empire policy does not cover the Does\u2019 claims against Chabad. After briefing, and with the benefit of a Report and Recommendation from the magistrate judge, the district court found that the policy did not provide coverage for the torts alleged by the Does, and therefore granted summary judgment in favor of American Empire. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The parties agree that the Chabad members accused of abusing J.D. are \u201cinsureds\u201d within the scope of the American Empire policy. Thus the sole question presented in this appeal is whether a separate exclusion provision in the American Empire policy bars the Does\u2019 claims. The district court found, and we now affirm, that the policy contains such an exception and therefore relieves American Empire of any responsibilities stemming from the Does\u2019 litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Specifically, the American Empire policy contains an \u201cAbuse or Molestation Exception,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">This insurance does not apply to \u201cbodily injury\u201d, \u201cproperty damage\u201d or \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d arising out of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-13\">1. The actual or threatened abuse or molestation by any person in the care, custody or control of any insured, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-14\">2. The negligent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-15\">a. Employment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-16\">b. Investigation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-17\">c. Supervision,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-18\">d. Reporting to the proper authorities, or failure to so report, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-19\">e. Retention, of a person for whom any insured is or ever was legally responsible and whose conduct would be excluded by Paragraph 1 above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-20\">We have previously recognized that, under Florida law, such \u201carising out of\u2019 exclusions are to be construed broadly. <em>James River, </em>540 F.Sd at 1275 (citing <em>Taurus Holdings, Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>913 So.2d 528, 539 (Fla.2005)). Indeed, in <em>James River </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-21\">\u201cthe term \u2018arising out of is broader in meaning than the term \u2018caused by<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and means \u2018originating from,\u2019 \u2018having its origin in,\u2019 \u2018growing out of,\u2019 \u2018flowing from,\u2019 \u2018incident to\u2019 or \u2018having a connection with.\u2019 \u201d To have arisen out of something, there must be \u201csome causal connection, or relationship\u201d that is \u201cmore than a mere coincidence\u201d but proximate cause is not required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-22\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Taurus Holdings, </em>913 So.2d at 539). We think it clear that this standard is broad enough to include the Does\u2019 claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-23\">As a result, because the parties agree that the Chabad members are \u201cinsureds,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the plain terms of the Abuse and Molestation Exclusion thus exclude the Does\u2019 claims unless some irregularity distinguishes the American Empire policy from other \u201carising out of\u2019 contracts. The Does argue that indeed the American Empire policy contains a material distinction. Specifically, they aver that unlike the policies at issue in <em>Taurus </em>and <em>James </em>River; the American Empire policy contains a second paragraph that modifies the first. To this end, they interpret the policy to require courts to \u201clook to paragraph 1 when the claims against the insured are based on the abuse itself or vicarious liability for the acts of the abuser, and to paragraph 2 when the claims against an otherwise innocent insured are based on its enabling negligence.\u201d They in turn conclude that, under their proposed interpretation, their claims are covered by the American Empire policy because those claims do not involve negligence of the types set forth in paragraph 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">We cannot agree. To begin, the Does\u2019 reading would have us ignore the plain meaning of the first paragraph, in contravention of Florida law. <em>E.g., Khosrow Maleki, P.A. v. M.A. Hajianpour, M.D., P.A., </em>771 So.2d 628, 631 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000) (a contract must be interpreted pursuant to the plain meaning of its terms). Moreover, to accept the Does\u2019 interpretation we would also have to ignore the \u201cgeneral rule[ ] [that] use of a disjunctive in a statute indicates alternatives and requires that those alternatives be treated separately. Hence, language in a clause following a disjunctive is considered inapplicable to the subject of the preceding clause.\u201d <em>Brown v. Budget Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc., </em>119 F.3d 922, 924 (11th Cir.1997). We think that <em>Brown\u2019s </em>understanding of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d applies equally to the insurance policy in this case. As a result, we reject the Does\u2019 alternative interpretation, which would require us to read \u201cor\u201d as a limitation on paragraph 1, rather than as an independent exclusion where paragraph 1 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Does\u2019 claims against Chabad are excluded from the scope of Chabad\u2019s insurance policy with American Empire. Thus, we hold that American Empire is entitled to summary judgment in their declaratory judgment action, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\">. We review the grant of summary judgment, as well as the interpretation of an insurance contract, <em>de novo. See, e.g., James River Ins. Co. v. Ground Down Eng'g, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). Furthermore, in this diversity case involving an insurance contract, state law governs. <em>See Dempsey v. Auto Owners Ins. Co., 717 </em>F.2d 556, 559 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
