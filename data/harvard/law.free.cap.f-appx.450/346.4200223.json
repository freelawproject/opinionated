Pursuant to a treaty with the United States, he was transferred to a United States prison to serve his sentence. Maldonado appeals the United States Parole Commission\u2019s (Parole Commission) determination that he be released from prison after 188 months. He argues that his release date is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, he argues that, based upon the abuse he suffered from Mexican police and prison guards and his history and characteristics, he should be released from prison sooner than in 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">The Parole Commission must \u201cdetermine a release date and a period and conditions of supervised release for an offender transferred to the United States to serve a sentence of imprisonment, as though the offender were convicted in a United States district court of a similar offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4106A(b)(1)(A); <em>Navarrete v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>34 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.1994). We review that determination \u201cin accordance with section 3742 of [Title 18] as though the determination appealed had been a sentence imposed by a United States district court.\u201d \u00a7 4106A(b)(2)(B). Thus, we review the Parole Commission\u2019s ultimate determination for its substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">After a post-transfer hearing, the hearing examiner determined Maldonado\u2019s recommended release date by calculating the United States Sentencing Guidelines range for the federal offense of second degree murder. A guidelines range of 188 to 235 months would have applied if Maldonado had been convicted of second degree murder. The hearing examiner recommended that Maldonado be released after 188 months in prison, a term at the bottom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the guidelines range. The Parole Commission adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendation of a 188-month term.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The Parole Commission\u2019s release date determination was not an abuse of discretion. In making the recommendation of a 188-month term, the hearing examiner considered the abuse Maldonado suffered in Mexico, his young age when he committed the offense, his lack of any other criminal history, and his conduct since he had been in prison. The hearing examiner also noted, however, that the offense was \u201cvery serious.\u201d The hearing examiner ultimately determined that a term at the bottom of the sentencing guidelines range was appropriate because of the abuse, and the Parole Commission\u2019s release determination specifically mentioned the abuse. The Parole Commission\u2019s release determination is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
