(\u201cShelton\u201d) brought suit against Defendant-Appellee Placid Oil Company (\u201cPlacid\u201d), alleging property damage caused by oil and gas exploration prior to Placid\u2019s 1986 bankruptcy. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>bankruptcy court granted Placid\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the district court affirmed. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Placid is an oil and gas company, and from 1942 until 1956, Placid operated oil wells on property in Louisiana leased from Shelton\u2019s predecessor in title. On August 29, 1986, Placid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3002(c)(3), the bankruptcy court set January 31, 1987 as the Bar Date for filing proofs of claim to Placid\u2019s bankruptcy estate. Known creditors were given notice by mail of the Bar Date. Unknown creditors were given notice by publication in the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>on January 2, January 9, and January 16 of 1987. On September 30, 1988, Placid obtained a discharge from the bankruptcy court of all claims existing on that date, except those created or assumed by the reorganization plan. The bankruptcy court\u2019s order also included any future claims for damages that occurred prior to the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">In 2002, Shelton purchased the property Placid previously leased. Six years later, Shelton brought suit in state court, alleging that Placid caused environmental damage to the property during its 1942 to 1956 leasehold. Placid reopened its Chapter 11 case and filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court to determine the dis-chargeability of Shelton\u2019s claim. Placid then filed a motion for summary judgment. Placid argued that Shelton\u2019s predecessor in title, the owners of the property at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings, did not file a proof of claim for any alleged environmental damage to the property during Placid\u2019s leasehold. Thus, Placid argued, Shelton\u2019s claim had been discharged by the bankruptcy court\u2019s 1988 order. In response to Placid\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Shelton argued that its predecessor did not receive adequate notice of Placid\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding. Specifically, Shelton argued that its predecessor was a \u201cknown creditor,\u201d and as such, was entitled to \u201cactual notice,\u201d i.e. notice by mail or in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">On April 10, 2010, the bankruptcy court granted Placid\u2019s motion. The district court affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shelton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">A grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. In re SeaQuest Diving, LP, </em>579 F.3d 411, 417 (5th Cir.2009) (citing <em>In re Erlewine, </em>349 F.3d 205, 209 (5th Cir.2003)). Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.CivP. 56(c); Fed. R. BauioiP. 7056 (applying Fed.R.CivP. 56 to adversary bankruptcy proceedings). As for the district court\u2019s determination of whether a party is a known or unknown creditor, this court has determined it \u201cis entirely an issue of fact, and our standard of review is therefore one of clear error.\u201d <em>In re Crystal Oil Co., </em>158 F.3d 291, 298 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-15\">To satisfy Fourteenth Amendment due process, notice must be \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to inform interested parties of the pendency\u201d of the proceeding. <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hano</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>ver Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). A claim against a declarant of Chapter 11 bankruptcy is considered a property interest requiring notice to the potential claimant. <em>In re Kendavis Holding Co., </em>249 F.3d 383, 385-86 (5th Cir.2001) \u201cThe type of notice that is reasonable or adequate for purposes of satisfying the due process requirement in this context depends on whether a particular creditor is known or unknown to the debtor.\u201d <em>In re J.A. Jones, Inc., </em>492 F.3d 242, 249 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">The Supreme Court has explained that known creditors include \u201cboth those claimants actually known to the debtor, as well as those whose identities are \u2018reasonably ascertainable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crystal Oil Co., </em>158 F.3d at 297 (quoting <em>Tulsa Prof'l Collection Servs., Inc. v. Pope, </em>485 U.S. 478, 490, 108 S.Ct. 1340, 99 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988)). \u201cA creditor is \u2018reasonably ascertainable\u2019 if it can be discovered through \u2018reasonably diligent efforts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams, </em>462 U.S. 791, 798 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 2706, 77 L.Ed.2d 180 (1983)). \u201cIn order for a claim to be reasonably ascertainable, the debtor must have in his possession, at the very least, some specific information that reasonably suggests both the claim for which the debtor may be liable and the entity to whom he would be liable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">\u201cUnder the Supreme Court\u2019s longstanding jurisprudence, the debtor must provide actual notice \u2014 not notice by publication\u2014 to all \u2018known creditors\u2019 in order to achieve a legally effective discharge of their claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>City of New York v. New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>344 U.S. 293, 296, 73 S.Ct. 299, 97 L.Ed. 333 (1953)). For example, the Court has \u201crecognized that mail service is an inexpensive and efficient mechanism that is reasonably calculated to provide actual notice.\u201d <em>Tulsa, </em>485 U.S. at 490, 108 S.Ct. 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">While actual notice of the Bar Date must be provided to known creditors, constructive notice is constitutionally sufficient for unknown creditors. <em>J.A. Jones, </em>492 F.3d at 249-50. It is well established that notice by publication will generally suffice for constructive notice. <em>See Chemetron Corp. v. Jones, </em>72 F.3d 341, 346 (3d Cir.1995). Furthermore, \u201c[publication in national newspapers is regularly deemed sufficient notice to unknown creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349-50; <em>see also Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 316-17, 70 S.Ct. 652 (1950) (Notice by publication is sufficient for unknown creditors.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Shelton argues that their predecessor was a known creditor entitled to actual notice because Placid continued to lease the property until 1964. This is significant for two reasons. First, Shelton claims that a water study published in 1958 showed that the water wells on the property were contaminated due to oil and gas activities. Second, a June 1, 1964 edition of <em>Oil and Gas Journal </em>contained an article entitled \u201cLouisiana Battling Brine Pollution\u201d that claims that the Little River, which borders the Shelton property, was being polluted due to unlined oil and gas pits. Therefore, when Placid filed for bankruptcy, Shelton claims, it should have been aware of Shelton\u2019s potential property damage claims. Shelton argues that this would make Shelton\u2019s predecessor in title a known creditor and thus entitled to actual notice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">This court has held that when reviewing a decision for clear error, the judgment \u201cwill be reversed only if, on the entire evidence, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>In re Allison, </em>960 F.2d 481, 483 (5th Cir.1992). The district court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous because the summary judgment evidence sufficiently establishes that Shelton\u2019s pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>deeessor was an unknown creditor at the time Placid filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-3\">Specifically, the record indicates that, at the time Placid filed for bankruptcy, there was no specific information that reasonably suggests that Placid knew of any claims related to property it leased from Shelton\u2019s predecessor. <em>Crystal Oil Co., </em>158 F.3d at 297. The district court correctly relied on the following evidence to support its grant of summary judgment: (1) from 1956 to 1986 (when Placid filed bankruptcy), no environmental complaint was made by Shelton\u2019s predecessor in title; (2) affidavits provided by Shelton did not show actual knowledge, asserting that Placid knew of Shelton\u2019s potential claim; (3) as Placid had tens of thousands of former leaseholds, it would have taken a \u201ctremendous effort\u201d for Placid to give each actual notice of the bankruptcy, and had no reason to do so; and (4) Shelton\u2019s assertion that the environmental damage was easily identifiable is not credible in light of the fact that it took Shelton six years, from when they purchased the property in 2002 until they filed suit in 2008, to notice the damage. In light of this evidence, we agree with the district court that Shelton\u2019s predecessor was an unknown creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">As an unknown creditor, Shelton was entitled only to notice by publication. <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 316-17, 70 S.Ct. 652 (1950). Placid notified unknown creditors by publication in the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>on three separate occasions. According to Fifth Circuit precedent, notice by publication in the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>is sufficient for unknown creditors. <em>In re Crystal Oil Co., </em>158 F.3d 291, 298 (5th Cir.1998). Therefore, Shelton received adequate notice and summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1050-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">.
