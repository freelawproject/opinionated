Herrera argues about prosecutorial misconduct, the sufficiency of the evidence, a jury instruction on deliberate ignorance, the admission of testimony, and the denial of relief under the safety valve. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">Herrera argues that the government failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in violation of his constitutional right to due process, <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), but we disagree. \u201cA <em>Brady </em>violation ... occur[s] if the prosecution delays in transmitting evidence during a trial, but only if the defendant can show prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Beale, </em>921 F.2d 1412, 1426 (11th Cir.1991). Before Herrera\u2019s first trial, a magistrate judge ordered the prosecution to produce an agent\u2019s notes of an interview of Herrera, and the prosecution complied with that order before Herrera\u2019s second trial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(l)(B)(ii). The magistrate judge\u2019s order to produce the notes was in a footnote of an order that neither party noticed before Herrera\u2019s first trial. Herrera argues that, under <em>Brady, </em>the evidence should have been produced sooner, but he fails to identify any information in the notes that was \u201cfavorable\u201d to him or \u201cmaterial to the establishment of his guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Beale, </em>921 F.2d at 1426. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Herr<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>era\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the alleged <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Herrera argues that the government failed to prove that he knowingly-possessed or intended to distribute the 98.35 grams of cocaine found in a hidden compartment of his tractor trailer truck, but the record supports his conviction. When Trooper Darrell Seymour stepped up to the window of Herrera\u2019s truck to conduct a commercial vehicle inspection, he noticed immediately what appeared to be a hidden compartment in the bunk area that had been covered with carpet in different color than the rest of the cab. Herrera\u2019s conduct was inconsistent with that of a commercial truck driver with two years experience: Herrera provided loose sheets of paper when asked to produce his log book, and he was unable to trigger his low air warning device without Seymour\u2019s assistance. Herrera also acted extremely nervous during the inspection. Herrera\u2019s eyes opened \u201creal wide\u201d and he had a \u201creal shocked and surprised look\u201d when Seymour asked Herrera to produce safety articles for the truck that are stored typically in the bunk; upon climbing inside the patrol car, Herrera laughed uncomfortably and asked if he could \u201cgo out there and dig up a pine tree\u201d; while inside the police vehicle, Herrera scratched himself and coughed repeatedly; and, when questioned about the tree, Herrera stated that he would remove the tree from the ground using his hands in lieu of a shovel. After Seymour discovered the cocaine, Seymour told Herrera that he was being arrested for \u201cthe dope,\u201d and Herrera repeated, \u201cthe dope.\u201d Later, Herrera told Seymour that he had \u201chad a bad feeling about this trip.\u201d Less than two months earlier, Charles Engle of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency had shown Herrera where a hidden compartment had been added to the sleeping compartment in another truck he was driving for the same trucking company. Although the compartment was empty, Engle explained to Herrera that similar compartments were used to transport illegal drugs. Based on Herrera\u2019s encounters with law enforcement, the jury reasonably found that Herrera had a \u201cconsciousness of guilt,\u201d <em>United States v. Leonard, </em>138 F.3d 906, 909 (11th Cir.1998), and the district court did not err by denying Herrera\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. In the light of the evidence against Herrera, the district court also did not abuse its discretion when it instructed the jury about both actual knowledge and deliberate ignorance. <em>See United States v. Arias, </em>984 F.2d 1139, 1143-44 (11th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Herrera argues that the district court should have excluded Engle\u2019s testimony as unduly prejudicial, but Herrera\u2019s argument fails. Evidence about Herrera\u2019s observation of another hidden compartment in another truck owned by the same company and his notice of the purpose for such a compartment was material and, as he concedes, not a prior bad act governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). Engle\u2019s testimony was probative and not unduly prejudicial. Engle\u2019s testimony established only that he informed Herrera about the presence and purpose of a hidden compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Herrera also argues that he was entitled to relief under the safety valve, but we disagree. To qualify for relief under the safety valve, a \u201cdefendant has an affirmative responsibility to truthfully disclose to the government all information and evidence that he has about the offense and all relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5C1.2(a) (Nov.2010). In response to his presen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>tence investigation report, Herrera submitted a four-page statement in which he denied any knowledge about the cocaine, and the district court discredited Herrera\u2019s statement consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict. The district court did not err by denying Herrera\u2019s request for relief under the safety valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">We AFFIRM Herrera\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
