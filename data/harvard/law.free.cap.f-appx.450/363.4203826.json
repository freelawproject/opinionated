In the \u00a7 2255 motion, Havens claimed, among other things, that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to inform him of the Government\u2019s plea offers and by failing to advise him regarding the benefits of pleading guilty. We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue whether the district court erred in denying relief on the ineffective assistance claim without conducting an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">A district court may deny a \u00a7 2255 motion without holding an evidentiary hearing \u201conly if the motion, files, and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir. 1992). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion without holding an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cervantes, </em>182 F.3d 1106, 1110 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The deficiency must be \u201cso serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To show prejudice, the petitioner must show \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Havens\u2019s district court filings establish his contention that his counsel failed to inform him of the Government\u2019s plea offers and that counsel did not advise him of the benefits of pleading guilty, such as credit for acceptance of responsibility. Although he admitted that wished to preserve for appellate review the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, Havens averred in the district court that he would have pleaded guilty had he been properly advised by his trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">\u201c[Ojne of the most precious applications of the Sixth Amendment may well be in affording counsel to advise a defendant concerning whether he should enter a plea of guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Grammas, </em>376 F.3d 433, 436 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have held that \u201cfailing to inform the defendant of a plea offer could amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Teague v. Scott, </em>60 F.3d 1167, 1171 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cIn determining whether or not to plead guilty, the defendant should be made aware of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences so that he can make an intelligent choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">In denying relief on Havens\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, the district court credited an affidavit prepared by Havens\u2019s trial counsel, who averred that he had discussed with Havens the application of the sentencing guidelines and that Havens had rejected the Government\u2019s plea offers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u201c[Contested fact issues [in a \u00a7 2255 case] ordinarily may not be decided on affidavits alone, unless the affidavits are supported by other evidence in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>685 F.2d 449, 451 (5th Cir.1981). In view of the existence of contested factual issues material to Havens\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying relief without conducting an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Cervantes, </em>132 F.3d at 1110. Accordingly, we VACATE the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief and REMAND the matter to the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
