The BIA concluded that Suarez was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status to that of a lawfully admitted permanent resident because he had been admitted into the United States as an alien in transit without visa (\u201cTWOV\u201d). Suarez concedes that he was initially admitted into the United States in TWOV status when he arrived at the Houston-Bush Intercontinental Airport. He argues that, contrary to the BIA\u2019s conclusion, he was subsequently admitted into the United States in a status other than TWOV when an immigration officer inspected his passport and airline ticket, and permitted him to leave the airport\u2019s immigration lounge and enter the general airport area for the purpose of accessing the airport\u2019s services. Thus, Suarez argues that he was statutorily eligible for an adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-19\">When examining a petition for review, we must first consider whether we have subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2004). We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). We generally lack jurisdiction to review a judgment regarding an alien\u2019s adjustment of status to that of a lawfully admitted permanent resident. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. We, nonetheless, retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Thus, we have jurisdiction to review a claim to the extent that it challenges the application of a legal standard to an undisputed factual pattern, but we may not review the BIA\u2019s factual findings. <em>Jean-Pierre v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>500 F.3d 1315, 1322 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Because Suarez\u2019s eligibility for adjustment of status claim challenges the application of the relevant statutory legal standard to the undisputed facts, we have jurisdiction to consider his claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Where the BIA issues its own opinion, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision unless the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Kueviakoe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1304 (11th Cir.2009). Here the BIA issued its own decision, without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, and we therefore review only the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We review issues of law <em>de novo, </em>including questions of statutory interpretation. <em>De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2006). However, following the principles of <em>Chevron </em>deference, when we review the BIA\u2019s construction of a statute that it administers, we \u201cwill defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of [the] statute if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Quinchia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">If certain criteria are satisfied, the Attorney General may adjust the status of an alien who was \u201cinspected and admitted or paroled into the United States\u201d to that of a permanent resident. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Aliens admitted in TWOV status, however, are not eligible to have their status adjusted to that of a lawfully admitted permanent resident unless they meet specific statutory criteria not applicable here. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c), (i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(b)(1) (providing that aliens that enter the United States in transit without a visa are ineligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">\u201cAdmission\u201d and \u201cadmitted\u201d denote \u201cthe lawful entry of [an] alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A). The INA no longer defines the term \u201centry.\u201d Prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), however, \u201centry\u201d was defined as the \u201ccoming of any alien into the United States, from a foreign port or place or from an outlying possession, whether voluntary or otherwise.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13) (1995). Moreover, the BIA has determined that an \u201centry\u201d requires, among other things, \u201ca crossing into the territorial limits of the United States.\u201d <em>Matter of Martinez-Serrano, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 151, 153 (BIA 2009) (quotation omitted); <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">After thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition. In light of the historical definition of \u201centry,\u201d Suarez\u2019s prior admission to the United States in TWOV status when he arrived at the Houston airport, and the absence of any intervening departure, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the immigration officer\u2019s consent to Suarez\u2019s request to access the general airport area did not constitute a separate \u201cadmission\u201d to the United States under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A) was a reasonable construction of the INA to which we must defer. <em>See Quinchia, </em>552 F.3d at 1258. And because Suarez was only admitted to the United States in TWOV status, he was statutorily ineligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>for an adjustment of his status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
