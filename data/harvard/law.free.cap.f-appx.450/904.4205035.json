After review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">A. Removability</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">In May 2006, Zaporojan entered the United States from Moldova on an exchange-visitor visa, which permitted him to remain until September 26, 2006. Zaporo-jan overstayed his visa. In January 2009, Zaporojan filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief, claiming past persecution in 2005 and a well-founded fear of future persecution in Moldova because of his imputed political opinion and membership in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-16\">In March 2009, the Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging Zaporojan with being removable, pursuant to INA \u00a7 287(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States longer than permitted. At a master calendar hearing, Zaporojan admitted the allegations in the NTA and conceded removability \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b929-17\">B. Persecution Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b929-18\">According to Zaporojan\u2019s application and his testimony at his removal hearing, Za-porojan\u2019s father was a businessman and local politician in Soroca, Moldova, who fought corruption. Beginning in 2004, Za-porojan\u2019s father participated in an undercover investigation into a scheme of extortion and bribery by the mafia and public officials. On January 12, 2005, Zaporo-jan\u2019s father disappeared. Zaporojan\u2019s father was scheduled to testify against a local mafia member who had been extorting money from him. On January 13, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>father\u2019s body was found on the outskirts of Soroca with a shotgun wound to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">A few days after the killing, a local journalist gave Zaporojan\u2019s mother an audio cassette tape containing a recording of Zaporojan\u2019s father. On the audiotape, Za-porojan\u2019s father was talking with high-ranking Moldovan officials a few days before his death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the journalist warned the family not to tell anyone about the tape, information eventually leaked.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">In May 2005, Zaporojan\u2019s brother called the police to inquire about the progress of the investigation into his father\u2019s murder. A few days later, two strangers beat Zapo-rojan\u2019s brother while he was walking home. The attackers told Zaporojan\u2019s brother to keep his nose out of things that were none of his business. Zaporojan\u2019s brother later received anonymous phone calls warning him to \u201cstay out of their business.\u201d In late 2005, Zaporojan\u2019s mother and brother left Moldova. Zaporojan, however, stayed to complete his college studies in Moldova\u2019s capital, Chisinau.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">In February 2006, while walking in So-roca, Zaporojan was forced into a police car. Officers took Zaporojan to the basement of a police station, where they beat him and demanded to know where the cassette tape was located. The next morning, Zaporojan was released and treated at the Ijospital for a concussion and bruises. About a month later, Zaporojan received an anonymous phone call stating that if he did anything, his life would be in danger. In May 2006, Zaporojan decided to leave Moldova and join his brother in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">According to the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2009 Country Report for Moldova, corruption is pervasive throughout the Moldovan government and society. An expert testified that the mafia essentially controls the Moldovan government. The expert also testified that, other than Romania and the border area of Russia, the Moldovan mafia does not have much influence in the rest of Europe. The expert opined that if the Moldovan mafia really wanted to, it could \u201chaunt its opponents\u201d in any country in the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) because the E.U. has no enforcement authority and \u201cis still more an idea than an actual effectively operating government.\u201d When Zaporojan was asked why the Moldovan mafia would continue to target Zaporojan outside Moldova, Zaporo-jan responded, \u201cBecause they are aware we have this tape.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">C. Romanian Citizenship and Zaporo-jan\u2019s Mother</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Although citizens of Moldova, Zaporo-jan, his mother and his brother have also obtained Romanian citizenship, which entitles them to live and work anywhere in the E.U. In fact, Zaporojan\u2019s mother lives in Italy.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Zaporojan\u2019s mother has not been harmed or threatened in Italy, but she reports that Moldovan people working in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Italy are sometimes threatened and extorted by the Moldovan mafia. While grocery shopping, Zaporojan\u2019s mother once noticed individuals who \u201clook[ed] different,\u201d with \u201c[t]heir hair ... cut short, they look[ed] athletic, shorter people,\u201d and she \u201cgot scared and doesn\u2019t go out anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">In June 2008, Zaporojan\u2019s mother returned to Moldova to sell the family home. While visiting her husband\u2019s grave, Zapo-rojan\u2019s mother was attacked by unknown assailants and had to be hospitalized before she could return to Italy.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">D. Decisions of the IJ and the BIA</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The IJ credited Zaporojan\u2019s hearing testimony, but denied all relief. Among other things, the IJ determined that Zaporojan was statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because: (1) as to past persecution, he had not shown a nexus between the harm he suffered and a statutorily protected ground; (2) as to future persecution, his Romanian citizenship permitted him to relocate outside Moldova and in the E.U. countries, where there was no evidence he would be harmed; and (3) as to CAT relief, he had not shown he would be tortured by the Moldovan authorities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">The BIA dismissed Zaporojan\u2019s appeal. The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that Zaporojan had not shown that a protected ground was at least one central reason for the past harm he had suffered. The BIA noted that Zaporojan\u2019s attackers were not motivated by his imputed political opinion based on his father\u2019s anti-corruption efforts or Zaporojan\u2019s familial relationship to his father. Rather, the details of the attack demonstrated that Zaporojan\u2019s attackers were motivated by a desire to prevent the discovery of evidence of corruption on the audio cassette tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">The BIA also agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that Zaporojan had not shown a well-founded fear of persecution because his Romanian citizenship would allow him to settle anywhere in the E.U., the Moldovan mafia did not have much influence outside of Moldova, and Zaporojan\u2019s mother\u2019s suspicions that the Moldovan mafia was present in Italy was not sufficient to show that Zaporojan would be harmed outside Moldova. Although Zaporojan did not challenge the denial of CAT relief, the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>concluded that Zaporojan failed to establish a likelihood of torture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Zapo-rojan filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A5C\">A. Past Persecution Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">On appeal, Zaporojan argues that he established a nexus between the harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>he suffered in Moldova and his membership in a particular social group, namely, the family of his murdered father.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant must show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> INA \u00a7 101(a)(42); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1280-31 (11th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) \u2014 (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the REAL ID Act of 2005, the asylum applicant must show that one of the protected grounds \u201cwas or will be at least one <em>central </em>reason\u201d for the persecution. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), 119 Stat. 231, 302-03 (2005) (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Evidence of acts of private violence or criminal activity do not demonstrate persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Here, we cannot say the evidence compels a conclusion that one of the central reasons the Moldovan police and mafia targeted Zaporojan was his family relationship to his father. Rather, substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the Moldovan police and mafia were driven by a desire to retrieve the audio cassette that a journalist gave his mother because it contained incriminating evidence of corruption by high-ranking Moldovan officials. In fact, Zaporojan testified that the police detained and beat him because they were trying to find the audio cassette and that he believed the mafia would continue to target him because the mafia knew about the audio cassette. Moreover, Zaporojan testified that the attacks on his family (apart from his father\u2019s murder) did not begin until after the mafia and police learned about the audio cassette. There is also no evidence that Zaporojan himself had ever fought corruption either individually or with his father. Instead, the attacks are, by his own testimony, to obtain the audio cassette tape. In short, the mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>treatment Zaporojan alleges was akin to acts of criminal violence, which do not constitute persecution on account of a protected factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-20\">B. Future Persecution Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">Substantial evidence also supports the determination that Zaporojan failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of future persecution. If an asylum applicant cannot establish past persecution (and thus benefit from a presumption of future persecution), he may still establish a well-founded fear of persecution by showing that there is a reasonable possibility he will be persecuted on account of a protected factor and that he has a subjectively genuine fear that he will be so persecuted. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352. If the asylum applicant can avoid the feared persecution by relocating, and it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so, he cannot establish a well-founded fear. <em>Id.; see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(ii), 208.16(b)(3)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">For the reasons already stated, the prior attacks on Zaporojan, his brother and his mother do not provide a reasonable basis for fearing persecution on account of the family relationship to Zaporojan\u2019s father. In any event, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Zaporojan could avoid future harm by relocating. First, Zaporojan admitted that none of the attacks occurred outside the family\u2019s hometown of Soroca. Second, as a Romanian citizen, Zaporojan can live and work anywhere in the E.U. The expert testified that the Moldovan mafia did not have a significant influence outside of Romania and the border with Russia. The fact that the Moldovan mafia could theoretically pursue someone anywhere in the E.U. does not compel a conclusion that the Moldovan mafia will do so in Zaporojan\u2019s case. This is especially true given that Zaporo-jan\u2019s mother has lived unthreatened in Italy since late 2005, and her own fears of the Moldovan mafia\u2019s presence in Italy appear to be at best speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-7\">. The contents of the tape were not transcribed and put in the record. During the removal hearing, a portion of the tape was played in which Zaporojan's father was crying and talking emotionally with the deputy mayor. Zaporojan's affidavit states that the tape contained his father's conversations with high-level officers with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Moldova about the extortion and also telephone conversations with local officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">Zaporojan avers that although the audio cassette tape \"did not have much information that could really hurt those who were recorded,\u201d neither the police nor the mafia \"know what had been recorded exactly in that audio cassette and it bothers them.\u201d In his hearing testimony, Zaporojan stated that on the cassette tape his father \u201ctells about all the high-ranked political figures, about everything, every unjust fact done in our country, about the attorneys who took bribes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-8\">. The IJ found that Zaporojan\u2019s 2009 asylum application was untimely and that Zaporojan failed to establish an exception to the one-year filing requirement. The BIA declined to address the issue of the timeliness of Zaporo-jan\u2019s asylum application because, even if Za-porojan established he warranted an exception, his asylum claim still failed because he did not demonstrate that a protected ground was at least one central reason for his 2006 attack. Because the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s finding as to timeliness, we do not address that issue. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that we review the BIA's decision \"except to the extent it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b931-14\">. Zaporojan did not challenge the denial of CAT relief before the BIA or in his brief to this Court. Therefore, we do not address his CAT claim. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1352 (11th Cir.2009) (deeming abandoned petitioner\u2019s CAT claim to which petitioner's brief made only a passing reference); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2006) (explaining that, pursuant to INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), we lack jurisdiction to review issues not raised before the BIA even if the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>considered the issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b932-5\">. On appeal, Zaporojan does not advance his persecution claims based on imputed political opinion and thus abandons them. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b932-6\">. Similarly, an alien seeking withholding of removal must show that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion upon being returned his country. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. Because this standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum, an alien who fails to establish asylum eligibility generally cannot satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b932-7\">. The INA does not define what constitutes persecution on account of \"membership in a particular social group.\u201d The BIA assumed <em>arguendo </em>that Zaporojan\u2019s family constituted a \"particular social group\u201d within the meaning of the INA. On appeal, the parties do not dispute that a family constitutes a particular social group. Accordingly, we do not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b932-10\">. Because Zaporojan's 2009 application was filed after May 11, 2005, the REAL ID Act\u2019s provisions apply to his case. See Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. at 305-06.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b932-11\">. The BIA issued its own decision, but agreed with the IJ\u2019s reasoning that Zaporojan failed to establish a nexus to a statutorily protected ground. Thus, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA as to that issue. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1350. We review the determination that an alien is statutorily ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the \"highly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. Under the substantial evidence standard of review, we will reverse a finding that the applicant failed to show the required nexus only if the record compels a finding to the contrary. <em>See Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
