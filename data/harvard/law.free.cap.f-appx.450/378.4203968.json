He also appeals the 10-month revocation sentence, ordered to be served consecutively to the 110-month sentence, that the district court imposed after it revoked a supervised release term he was serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Jones argues that his 110-month sentence, which included an adjustment based on the career offender Guideline, was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing goals. Jones posits that the career offender Guideline fails to account for his individual\u2019s circumstances, which include that he is a committed husband and father. The court sentenced Jones at the bottom of the range of 110 to 137 months, which represented a six-level downward departure. Jones asked for a sentence at the bottom of the range. The record demonstrates that the district court considered Jones\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and made an individualized assessment in imposing a properly calculated guidelines range sentence. Accordingly, Jones has failed to show that the district court committed any error, whether under an abuse of discretion or plain error standard. <em>See Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir .2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">Jones argues that the 10-month sentence he received after his supervised release was revoked is \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d because it was imposed to run consecutively to the 110-month sentence. Because Jones did not object, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 260 (5th Cir. 2009). Jones fails to show that the district court plainly erred when it imposed a consecutive below-guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
