He thereafter reentered the United States (without authorization) and on November 9, 2009, was arrested in Broward County, Florida, for strong armed robbery. On December 6,2010, he pled guilty to a federal indictment charging him with being found in the United States after having been deported without the Attorney General or his successor, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security having expressly consented to his reentry into the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2), and the district court sentenced him to a prison term of 57 months. He now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-20\">Appellant contends that the district court infringed his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when, in sentencing him under the Sentencing Guidelines, it enhanced his U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a) base offense level of 8 by 16 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), because he had previously been deported after being convicted of a crime of violence, i.e., the 1996 Florida conviction of armed burglary of a dwelling. Such infringement of his constitutional rights occurred, he submits, because the fact that formed the basis of the court\u2019s \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l)(A) enhancement, i.e., that 1996 conviction, was not charged in the indictment (or admitted by him when he pled guilty). His contention is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>528 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which holds that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(b)(2), which the district court properly applied, is a penalty provision for 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), not a separate crime. As such, the fact of the 1996 Florida conviction of armed burglary of a dwelling did not have to be charged in Appellant\u2019s indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
