The district court sentenced Miller to the statutory minimum sentence of 120 months of imprisonment on Count 1 and to 78 months of imprisonment on Count 2 and on Count 3, with all sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In two assignments of error, Miller challenges the district court\u2019s rulings denying her credit for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 and declining to apply the safety valve provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 based on the finding that she did not fully and truthfully admit her conduct in the underlying offense. She argues that the finding is clearly erroneous because she admitted all of her offense conduct. She maintains that her denial of knowing about the existence of a working methamphetamine lab in her shed was entirely plausible and should not be the basis for denying her acceptance of responsibility or precluding the application of the safety valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain a duty to consider the Sentencing Guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). This court reviews the sentence imposed for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 519. In <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the Supreme Court established a bifurcated process for conducting a reasonableness review. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>this court must determine whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, this court will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>I. Procedural Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\n<em>A. Acceptance of responsibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Deferring to the district court\u2019s unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, this court examines the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility \u201cunder a standard of review even more deferential than a pure clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 705 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This court \u201cwill affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">\n<em>B. Safety valve</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Pursuant to \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), a defendant who provides information to the Government may avoid the imposition of a statutory minimum sentence if the district court finds that he meets five criteria. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>264 F.3d 527, 529-30 (5th Cir.2001). The fifth criterion, the only one at issue here, requires that by the time of sentencing \u201cthe defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan-\u201d \u00a7 501.2(a)(5); see <em>also </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(5). \u201c[Tjhe defendant has the burden of ensuring that he has provided all the information and evidence regarding the offense to the Government. This he must do no later than at the time of the sentencing hearing regardless whether the Government requests such information.\u201d <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146-47 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The district court\u2019s determination of whether the defendant has provided full disclosure is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>See Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d at 145-46; <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 433 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cUnder the clearly erroneous standard, [i]f the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In this case, the district court heard testimony at sentencing that the police had a recording made during a controlled methamphetamine buy wherein Miller told the buyer that the proceeds from the sale were going to be used to fund an ongoing methamphetamine cook. Later that same day, police located an active methamphetamine lab in her shed. Nevertheless, Miller consistently maintained that she did not know about the lab. Given the testimony, the district court\u2019s determination that Miller did not fully and truthfully admit all of her conduct in the offense is not without foundation and is plausible. <em>See Solis, </em>299 F.3d at 458; <em>Davis, </em>76 F.3d at 84. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s finding is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\n<em>II. Clerical Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Finally, the judgment reflects that Miller was convicted in Count 3 of violating, inter alia, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(a). However, Miller was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860a. Accordingly, we instruct the district court on remand to correct the judgment to reflect that Miller was convicted of \u00a7 860a, rather than \u00a7 860(a). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
