United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 18, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010). The district court dismissed the petition on grounds that Redditt failed to satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-23\">Redditt is not required to obtain a COA to pursue his appeal. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). We re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u25a0view the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381-82 (5th Cir.2003). The savings clause is applicable only to a claim \u201c(i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The applicant bears the \u201cstringent\u201d burden of affirmatively showing that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective and that he is entitled to avail himself of the \u201climited exception\u201d found in the savings clause. <em>Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The <em>Abbott </em>decision does not state, as Redditt claims, that multiple consecutive terms of imprisonment may not be imposed on multiple separate convictions under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See Abbott, </em>131 S.Ct. at 23 (holding that \u201ca defendant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a \u00a7 924(c) conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a different count of conviction\u201d). To the contrary, the Supreme Court has affirmed the imposition in a single proceeding of consecutive sentences under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 131-37, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993). Redditt fails to satisfy the savings clause. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. We have reviewed Redditt\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
