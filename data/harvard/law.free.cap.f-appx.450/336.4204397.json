He argues that the district court erroneously applied the six-level \u201cofficial victim\u201d adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2 because President Obama was not a \u201cvictim\u201d of the offense and his actions were not \u201cmotivated by\u201d President Obama\u2019s status as a federal official. He also argues that the district court erred by finding that the offense involved more than two threats and applying a two-level adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Ordinarily, this court reviews a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 362 (5th Cir.2010). However, if a defendant has not preserved an issue for review in the district court, review of the issue is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>516 F.3d 285, 286-87 (5th Cir.2008). To show plain error, Miller must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it \u201c \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">\u201cTo preserve error, an objection must be sufficiently specific to alert the district court to the nature of the alleged error and to provide an opportunity for correction.\u201d <em>United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009). Miller\u2019s objection below to the application of \u00a7 3A1.2 was based on his assertion that he was not \u201cmotivated by\u201d President Obama\u2019s status as a government official. Thus, that argument was properly preserved. <em>See id. </em>However, this objection would not have alerted the district court to the \u201cvictim\u201d argument he raises on appeal. Therefore, review of that argument is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 643 (5th Cir.2003)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">Miller argues that President Obama was not a victim of the underlying offense because he was not affected directly or indirectly by the offense. He argues that the victim in this case was society as a whole, which was required to spend public resources in its investigation of the threat. He further argues that a generalized public interest does not constitute a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3A1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">The commentary to \u00a7 3A1.2 indicates that, the President may be considered a victim for purposes of the adjustment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2, comment, (n.5) (providing that \u201c[i]f the official victim is an exceptionally high-level official, such as the President or the Vice President of the United States, an upward departure may be warranted due to the potential disrup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tion of the governmental function.\u201d)- Furthermore, there is no requirement that President Obama be personally impacted by the threats in order to be considered a victim. <em>See United States v. Polk, </em>118 F.Sd 286, 289-91 (5th Cir.1997). Miller argues that his case is distinguishable from <em>Polk </em>because in that case there were efforts made to plot and carry out a real bombing, whereas in the instant case, no efforts were made to carry out his threat. However, \u00a7 3A1.2 does not require that the victim be harmed in any way or even be made aware of the threat. <em>See Polk, </em>118 F.3d at 298 (quoting <em>United States v. McCaleb, </em>908 F.2d 176, 179 (7th Cir.1990)). In light of the foregoing, Miller has not shown that the district court erred by finding that President Obama was a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the \u00a7 3A1.2 adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Miller argues that \u00a7 3A1.2 does not apply because his threat was not motivated by President Obama\u2019s status as a government official. He argues, as he did below, that his threats were motivated by his desire to provoke an angry reaction from other posters on Craigslist. He further argues that the district court\u2019s rejection of his position as inconsistent with his plea reflects a misunderstanding of the elements of the offense or the application of the adjustment, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Contrary to Miller\u2019s assertion, the district court did not reject Miller\u2019s argument because it was inconsistent with the plea. The district court rejected Miller\u2019s argument because it agreed with the Government\u2019s argument that the threats were made against President Obama because of his status as the President. The district court found that \u201cif you read what Mr. Miller wrote, ... it\u2019s just inescapable that paragraph 25 [applying the \u00a7 3A1.2 adjustment] is correct.\u201d The district court also observed that Miller\u2019s argument bordered on a failure to accept responsibility; however, this inconsistency was not the reason the district court overruled Miller\u2019s objection. Miller has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s finding that his threat was motivated by President Obama\u2019s official status was clearly erroneous. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Finally, Miller argues that the district court erroneously applied a two-level adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2) based on the determination that the offense involved more than two threats against President Obama. He argues that there were only two threats in the record that were directly related to the offense. Therefore, he argues that there was no basis to apply the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">At sentencing, Miller objected to the two-level adjustment on the ground that the two threats against President Obama should be considered a single threat because they occurred in close temporal proximity. Because Miller is making a different argument on appeal, review of his claim is for plain error. <em>See MedinaAnicacio, </em>325 F.3d at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The determination that an offense involved more than two threats under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(l) is a factual matter. \u201cQuestions of fact capable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing can never constitute plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir.1991). As a question of fact that was capable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection, the district court\u2019s determination that the offense involved more than two threats, warranting an increase under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(1) cannot constitute plain error. <em>See id. </em>In any event, the record establishes that Miller made at least three threats against President Obama. Accordingly, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>court did not err by applying the two-level adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Miller has not shown any error in the district court\u2019s sentencing determinations. Thus, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
