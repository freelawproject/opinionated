On appeal, Mon-je argues that: (i) the district court erred in refusing to apply a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 for his allegedly minor role in the offense; and (ii) his below-range total sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">A district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant qualifies for a mitigating role adjustment under the guidelines is a finding of fact that will be reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The district court has considerable discretion in making this fact-intensive determination. <em>Id. </em>at 946. The defendant bears the burden of establishing his role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 934. Counsel\u2019s allegations alone are insufficient to resolve a disputed sentencing issue. <em>See United States v. Kapelushnik, </em>306 F.3d 1090, 1095 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that counsel\u2019s allegations were an insufficient basis on which to grant a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">The guidelines provide for a two-level reduction if the defendant was a minor participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a), (b). A minor participant is one who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal. <em>Id. (n. 5).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">In determining a defendant\u2019s role, the district court must first measure the defendant\u2019s role in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941. When the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to his actual conduct, the defendant cannot prove entitlement to a mitigating role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme for which he was not held accountable. <em>Id..</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">Although the first part of the analysis may be dispositive in determining the defendant\u2019s role, a court may also measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 944-45. When doing so, a district court may consider only those participants who are identifiable by the evidence and who were involved in the relevant conduct for which the defendant was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 944. The fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of others engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive, since it is possible that none are minimal or minor participants. <em>Id. </em>The district court must determine that the defendant \u201cwas less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>\u201d in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original); <em>see also United States v. Cacho, </em>951 F.2d 308, 309-10 (11th Cir. 1992) (concluding that the district court properly refused to grant a minor role adjustment where the defendant traveled with his co-conspirators, was present when his co-conspirators had drugs strapped to their bodies, and knew that they were all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>part of a plan to bring drugs into the United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445, 451-52 (2007). The district court is required to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\"> The district court was correct in refusing to grant Monje\u2019s request for a minor role reduction where he admitted to transporting a much larger amount than he was charged with, and the amount attributed to him was very large. Under the second <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>prong, as the district court noted, Monje played an integral role in the conspiracy, especially considering the large amount of drugs he transported and the drugs would have gone nowhere without his role being fulfilled. Additionally, Monje\u2019s total sentence met the goals encompassed within \u00a7 3553(a). It was undisputed that Monje transported large amounts of methamphetamine, and the district court specifically took into account Monje\u2019s age and other characteristics when determining an appropriate sentence. In light of these circumstances, Monje has not shown that his total 130-month sentence was unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
