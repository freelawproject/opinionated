He argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict because the Government did not establish \u201cuse of the mails\u201d as required in a federal mail fraud prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Bueno moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case, and he renewed his motion at the close of all of the evidence. Accordingly, he properly preserved his sufficiency claim for appellate review. <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>211 F.3d 878, 882 (5th Cir.2000). The denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>In deciding the sufficiency of the evidence, we will affirm a jury verdict if, \u201cviewing the evidence and the inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>577 F.3d 273, 284 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">To prove mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: \u201c(1) a scheme to defraud (2) which involves a use of the mails (3) for the purpose of executing the scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Ingles, </em>445 F.3d 830, 835 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Although the Government must prove that the mailing caused by the defendant\u2019s actions was incident to an essential part of the scheme, it need not prove that the defendant used the mails himself or actually intended that the mail be used. <em>Id. </em>The defendant \u201ccauses\u201d the mails to be used if he does an act with the knowledge that the use of the mails will follow in the ordinary course of business, or where such use can be reasonably foreseen. <em>Id. </em>A mailing is \u201cincident to an essential part of the scheme\u201d if the completion of the alleged scheme depended in some way on the use of the mails. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">Bueno argues that the Government failed to establish his use of the mails because his scheme to defraud was complete before the payment checks were deposited in the mail. He argues that the scheme began when he filled out the invoices and hand delivered them to an Endeavor Energy Resources employee and obtained his approval; therefore, \u201c[a]ny mailing was tangential and after the alleged scheme had occurred.\u201d He further argues that the reasoning set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Maze, </em>414 U.S. 395, 94 S.Ct. 645, 38 L.Ed.2d 603 (1974) and <em>Kami v. United States, </em>323 U.S. 88, 65 S.Ct. 148, 89 L.Ed. 88 (1944), supports this argument. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In <em>Kann, </em>323 U.S. at 94-95, 65 S.Ct. 148, the Supreme Court held that the mailing of fraudulently cashed checks between two banks was not \u201cincident to an essential part of the scheme\u201d because the scheme to defraud was complete when the defendants cashed the fraudulent checks at the first bank. In <em>Maze, </em>414 U.S. at 402, 94 S.Ct. 645, the Court held that the mailing of invoices among a motel proprietor and a credit card holder by a credit card company was immaterial to the consummation of the defendant\u2019s scheme because the scheme reached fruition when the defendant fraudulently obtained goods and services using the credit card, not when the credit card bills were mailed to the card holder. In <em>United States v. Strong, </em>371 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2004), this court recognized that under the holdings in <em>Kann </em>and <em>Maze, </em>\u201ca tangential mailing occurring after the success of a fraud scheme is complete would never qualify\u201d as incident to an essential part of the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Unlike in <em>Kann </em>and <em>Maze, </em>the mailings at issue were the payments themselves. \u201cMailings that distribute the proceeds of the scheme to defraud among the perpetrators are \u2018incident to an essential part of the scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rico Indus., Inc., </em>854 F.2d 710, 713 (5th Cir.1988) (citing <em>Pereira v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 1, 8, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954)). Bueno\u2019s scheme could not, and did not, come to fruition unless and until Endeavor paid either him directly, or paid the factoring company. The mailings were thus an integral part of the scheme. Bueno\u2019s sole challenge to the use of the mails element of the offense is without merit. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to establish the use of the mails element of the offense. <em>See Rico Indus., </em>854 F.2d at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
