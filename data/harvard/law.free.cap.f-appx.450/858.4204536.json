Mitalane filed the instant petition for review on June 13, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">On appeal, Mitalane argues that the BIA abused its discretion in determining that his appearance in anti-terrorism training videos while in the United States did not create changed or extraordinary circumstances that excused him from the one-year filing deadline for asylum. Mitalane argues that, in evaluating the reasonableness of his delay in applying for asylum in February 2009, the BIA should have considered the time between that date and April 2008, the date that his application for adjustment of status was denied and his parole was revoked. He asserts that, in denying his motion for reconsideration, the BIA failed to indicate whether it had considered the \u201cchange in circumstances\u201d or \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exception, and why an October 2002 letter from his former counsel to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d), that explained that Mitalane would no longer be eligible for immigration benefits through his wife because Mitalane and his wife were separating, was relevant to the timeliness question. Finally, Mitalane argues that the BIA failed to give reasoned consideration to his arguments or make adequate findings sufficient to aid in appellate review, as its prior conclusion that he had no objectively reasonable fear of future persecution was speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003)). Our review is \u201climited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009) (involving the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">An alien may file, within 30 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal, one motion to reconsider a decision that the alien is removable from the United States.

U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2005). Filing a motion for reconsideration does not toll the statutory time period for filing for review of a final order of removal. Ja<em>ggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">As an initial matter, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal dated September 24, 2010, because Mitalane\u2019s petition for review, filed on June 13, 2011, was not filed within 30 days of the removal order. Mi-talane\u2019s filing of the motion for reconsideration did not toll the statutory time period for filing for review of that order. Accordingly, to the extent that Mitalane is challenging the BIA\u2019s September 24, 2010, order, we dismiss his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">As to Mitalane\u2019s timely appeal from the BIA\u2019s May 16, 2011, order, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Mitalane\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Because Mitalane did not identify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, we hold that the BIA properly denied his motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we deny Mitalane\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
