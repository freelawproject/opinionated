Instead, he argued in his state post-conviction proceedings that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to his wife\u2019s testimony. He does not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-22\">\u201cA state habeas corpus petitioner who fails to raise his federal claims properly in state court is proeedurally barred from pursuing the same claim in federal court absent a showing of cause for and actual prejudice from the default.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Nagle, </em>172 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir.1999). When a petitioner has failed to present a claim to the state courts and \u201cit is obvious that the unexhausted claims would be pro-eedurally barred in state court due to a state-law procedural default, we can forego the needless \u2018judicial ping-pong<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and just treat those claims now barred by state law as no basis for federal habeas relief.\u201d <em>Snowden v. Singletary, </em>135 F.3d 732, 736 (11th Cir.1998). Here, Humphrey\u2019s failure to raise his equal protection and due process claims on direct appeal or in his first state post-conviction petition in the Florida courts bars him from raising the issues in a successive petition, <em>see Mills v. Florida, </em>684 So.2d 801, 804 n. 3 (Fla.1996), and he has failed to show good cause for the default. Thus, his equal protection and due process claims are proeedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-18\">.
