The district court granted State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the Slaters then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">In 2008, a fire destroyed the Slaters\u2019 house in Hampton, Georgia. At the time, the Slaters\u2019 property was insured with State Farm. The policy provided coverage for certain insured losses with respect to real and personal property owned by the Slaters, subject to the terms, conditions, and exclusions of the policy and applicable Georgia law. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of State Farm on the basis that no reasonable jury could conclude, based upon the facts of the case, that either Wendell Slater or Charmell Slater was residing at the dwelling when the loss occurred. Accordingly, the district court found there was no coverage afforded by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as those that govern the district court. <em>Capone v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>592 F.3d 1189, 1194 (11th Cir.2010). After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court that because neither of the Slaters was residing at the dwelling when the loss occurred there is no coverage afforded by the insurance policy. Moreover, the Slaters\u2019 claim for loss of personal property should not be treated separately from their claim for the loss of the dwelling because the Slaters failed to raise that issue in the district court. Even if, however, we consider this argument raised by the Slaters for the first time on appeal, we would conclude that this issue is without merit because Georgia courts have previously disposed of an insurer\u2019s entire claim based on the insurer\u2019s violation of the residency condition. Lastly, we conclude the Slaters are not entitled to bad faith penalties because there is no coverage owed under the Slaters\u2019 policy with State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
