An applicant may qualify for cancellation of removal by establishing (1) a continuous physical presence in the United States for at least 10 years; (2) good moral character during such period; (3) a lack of convictions for certain offenses; and (4) exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the applicant\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l)(A)-(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A)-(D). In her petition for review, Patel argues that the BIA and IJ violated their own precedent by failing to review the entire record when determining whether Patel\u2019s return to India would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her two U.S. citizen children and her parents, who are lawful permanent residents. Patel further argues that the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s fact-finding regarding the hardship element was so fatally flawed as to constitute a reviewable error of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Before considering the merits of a petition, we review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2004). Notwithstanding any other provision of law, we lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary granting or denial of cancellation of removal. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). We also have held that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that an applicant has not met \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D)\u2019s \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard. <em>Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.2006). Nonetheless, we retain jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">As an initial matter, we have jurisdiction to review, as a question of law, Patel\u2019s claim that the BIA and IJ violated their own precedent in failing to review the record as a whole. In reviewing an IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of relief, the BIA has held that, \u201c[u]pon review of the record as a whole, the Immigration Judge is required to balance the equities and adverse matters to determine whether discretion should be favorably exercised.\u201d <em>In re Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 296, 301 (BIA 1996). However, the BIA and IJ are not required to address specifically each piece of evidence presented, as long as they consider the issues raised and announce a decision establishing that \u201cthey have heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010) (brackets and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Contrary to Patel\u2019s argument that the IJ overlooked certain of portions of the record, the IJ stated that he had considered Patel\u2019s documentary and testimonial evidence and based his decision on the totality of the circumstances. Furthermore, the BIA and IJ both discussed a significant portion of the evidence presented by Patel, including Patel\u2019s son\u2019s allergy symptoms, the doctors\u2019 letters, the similar climate in India and Florida, the absence of Patel\u2019s husband, the poor healthcare and sanitation in India, Patel\u2019s parents\u2019 health issues, the fact that Patel cooked and did laundry for her parents, and the hardships that Patel\u2019s parents and children would face if Patel were removed to India. Furthermore, because the BIA and IJ were only required to review the record as a whole, as opposed to addressing specifically each piece of evidence, their decisions indicate that \u201cthey have heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Ayala, </em>605 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Patel also argues that the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s fact-findings underlying its discretionary determination that Patel\u2019s family would not suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship were so flawed as to constitute a reversible error of law. We find, however, that this argument does not raise a reviewable legal question, but rather is an attempt to challenge the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s discretionary hardship determination, over which we have no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-8\">. We review the BIA\u2019s and IJ's legal determinations <em>de novo. Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWe review only the Board\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ's opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA indicated that it affirmed the IJ's analysis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>conclusion that Patel did not establish the requisite hardship and also conducted its own analysis, we review both the IJ\u2019s and BIA's decisions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
