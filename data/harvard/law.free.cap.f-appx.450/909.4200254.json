Contreras appeals her sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment on the ground that the district court did not properly calculate the financial loss caused by Contreras\u2019s fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">After review of the record, we affirm Contreras\u2019s 18-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">At the relevant times, Defendant Contreras was an employee of Atlantic Pacific Mortgage Company (\u201cAPMC\u201d), a mortgage intermediary between the borrowers and various lenders. Contreras helped borrowers fill out applications for home loans, which were then forwarded to the lenders and the Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">A single-count information charged Contreras with loan and credit application fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014. The information alleged that Contreras had knowingly \u201cstated and represented, and caused to be stated and represented\u201d that the monthly income of \u201cR.A.,\u201d the recipient of a loan insured by the FHA, was substantially more than R.A.\u2019s actual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Defendant Contreras\u2019s Presentenee Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) found that Contreras had arranged false employment information and other false documentation in connection with six FHA-insured loans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of the six loan recipients for which Contreras provided false information defaulted on his loan. For five of these loans, the default triggered an insurance payment from the FHA to the lender bank. In part to calculate the loss amount, the PSI documented the history of these six loans as follows.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">A. Borrower \u201cR.A.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">On or about March 28, 2006, Defendant Contreras and R.A. completed a handwritten home mortgage loan application. R.A. had also signed a separate, blank mortgage loan application. Contreras then forwarded both documents to APMC\u2019s home office. Thereafter, APMC\u2019s home office returned to Contreras R.A.\u2019s signed application but with inflated values substituted for R.A.\u2019s actual monthly income. Contreras knew that the information in R.A.\u2019s final loan application was false and that the mortgage lender would rely upon the false information.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">R.A.\u2019s FHA loan file also contained a letter from R.A.\u2019s cousin, Gladys Lobelo. The letter stated that Lobelo had given R.A. $7,000. R.A. later told investigators that he never heard of Gladys Lobelo and never received a gift from Lobelo.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Through APMC as the intermediary, R.A. obtained an FHA-insured mortgage loan from U.S. Bank N.A. in the amount of $339,669. After R.A. defaulted on this loan, the FHA, as insurer, paid U.S. Bank N.A. for an insurance claim in the amount of $382,227.93. On or about April 19, 2009, R.A.\u2019s property was sold for $64,161.08, resulting in a net loss of $321,986.16 to the FHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">B. Borrower \u201cM.M.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">On or about June 9, 2006, M.M. signed a blank home mortgage loan application and gave the application to Defendant Contreras. Contreras signed the application in the \u201cTo Be Completed by Interviewer\u201d section. M.M. told investigators that M.M. provided Contreras with M.M.\u2019s actual employment information.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">However, the signed mortgage loan application actually submitted to the FHA stated that M.M. had been employed by Dalia Building Company for two years and three months as a warehouse manager and during that time earned a monthly salary of $6,424.77. In fact, M.M. never worked for Dalia Building Company, and M.M.\u2019s monthly income was substantially less than $6,424.77. M.M. denied providing the false information represented in the FHA loan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">Through APMC as the intermediary, M.M. obtained an FHA-insured loan from Chase Home Finance LLC in the amount of $243,041. After M.M. defaulted on this loan, the FHA paid Chase Home Finance LLC for an insurance claim in the amount of $273,631.86. On or about April 19, 2009, M.M.\u2019s property was sold for $51,663.86, resulting in a net loss to the FHA of $221,968.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>C. Borrower \u201cD.O.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">On or about September 29, 2006, D.O. signed a home mortgage loan application. Defendant Contreras signed D.O.\u2019s application in the \u201cTo Be Completed by Interviewer\u201d section.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">The application actually submitted to the FHA stated that D.O. had been employed by Yenamaica for three years at a salary of $4,445 per month. In fact, D.O.\u2019s monthly salary was substantially less. Further, the application stated that D.O. intended to occupy the mortgaged property as his primary residence. In fact, D.O. purchased the property as an investment and did not intend to live on the property. Contreras knew that the information in D.O.\u2019s loan application was false and that the mortgage lender would rely on the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Through APMC as the intermediary, D.O. obtained an FHA-insured loan from U.S. Bank N.A. in the amount of $157,528. After D.O. defaulted on this loan, the FHA paid U.S. Bank N.A. an insurance claim in the amount of $169,321.38. On or about April 19, 2009, D.O.\u2019s property was sold for $27,479.96, resulting in a net loss of $141,841.37 to the FHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">D. Borrower \u201cC.J.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">Defendant Contreras completed a handwritten home mortgage loan application with C.J. The application submitted to the FHA and signed by C.J. represented C.J.\u2019s monthly income as $8,618.18. In fact, C.J.\u2019s monthly income was substantially less. C.J.\u2019s application stated that C.J. had worked for West Coast Business Solutions. Luis Diaz, the President of West Coast Business Solutions, told investigators that he did not know who C.J. was and that the signature represented as Diaz\u2019s signature on CJ.\u2019s application was forged. Contreras knew that the information in C.J.\u2019s loan application was false and that the mortgage lender would rely on the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Through APMC as the intermediary, C.J. obtained an FHA-insured loan from U.S. Bank N.A. in the amount of $305,210. After C.J. defaulted on this loan, the FHA paid U.S. Bank N.A. an insurance claim in the amount of $325,592.13. On or about April 19, 2009, C.J.\u2019s property was sold for $110,500.00, resulting in a net loss of $215,092.13 to the FHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">E. Borrower \u201cM.B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">Defendant Contreras completed a handwritten home mortgage loan application with M.B. The application submitted to the FHA stated that M.B.\u2019s monthly income was $7,390.85. In fact, M.B.\u2019s monthly income was substantially less. Contreras knew that the information in M.B.\u2019s loan application was false and that the mortgage lender would rely on the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">Through APMC as the intermediary, M.B. obtained an FHA-insured loan from U.S. Bank N.A. in the amount of $240,555. After M.B. defaulted on this loan, the FHA paid U.S. Bank N.A. an insurance claim in the amount of $275,643.60. M.B.\u2019s property was sold for $148,000.00, resulting in a net loss of $127,643.60 to the FHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">F. Borrower \u201cJ.M.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">On or about June 6, 2006, J.M. signed a blank home mortgage application and gave the application to Defendant Contreras. Contreras signed J.M.\u2019s application in the \u201cTo Be Completed by Interviewer\u201d section.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">The loan application, submitted to the FHA and signed by J.M., stated that J.M. had been employed by West Coast Business Solutions for two years and was paid a monthly salary of $6,945.81 during that time. Although J.M. had worked for West Coast Business Solutions, his monthly salary was substantially less than $6,945.81.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-18\">J.M. obtained an FHA-insured loan from U.S. Bank N.A. in the amount of $266,437. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>J.M. later defaulted on this loan. According to the Lee County, Florida Property Appraiser\u2019s Office, J.M.\u2019s property\u2019s value at the time the PSI was prepared was $72,522.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, the estimated loss to U.S. Bank N.A. for J.M.\u2019s loan was approximately $193,915.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">II. SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">A. PSI Calculations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The PSI assigned Contreras a base offense level of 7. The PSI determined that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 was the applicable sentencing guideline for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, if the statutory maximum term of imprisonment is 20 years or more, then the defendant\u2019s base offense level is 7. Because the maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of \u00a7 1014 is 30 years, the PSI assigned Contreras a base offense level of 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The PSI applied a 16-level increase to Defendant Contreras\u2019s base offense level because the amount of financial losses due to Contreras\u2019s relevant conduct was more than $1 million but less than $2.5 million. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I). To calculate the financial losses, the PSI added the FHA insurance claim amounts less the subsequent sale price of the properties; these five loss amounts together totaled $1,028,531.26.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the FHA insurance claim for the J.M. property was not yet filed and the property not yet sold, the PSI calculated the loss for the J.M. property as $193,915, which represented the loan amount less the property\u2019s current value. The PSI calculated the total loss as $1,222,446.26. This 16-level increase raised Contreras\u2019s offense level to 23.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-11\">R.A.: $382,227.93-$64,161.08</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-12\">$321,986.16</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), the PSI reduced Defendant Contreras\u2019s offense level by three levels for her acceptance of responsibility, yielding a total adjusted offense level of 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">Contreras had no criminal history points. Accordingly, her criminal history category was I. Contreras\u2019s resulting guidelines range was 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">B. Objections and Stipulation</p>\n<p id=\"b937-18\">Prior to sentencing, Defendant Contreras objected to the 16-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I) for causing a loss of more than $1 million but less than $2.5 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In her written objections to the PSI, Contreras argued that the loss calculation in the PSI should not have been based on the lender banks\u2019 insurance claims against the FHA because those claims included fees and costs that were not cognizable losses under the sentencing guidelines. Contreras claimed that, at most, she should receive (1) a 12-level increase, which reflects losses of $200,000 to $400,000, or (2) a 14-level increase, which reflects losses of $400,000 to $1 million. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(G), (H).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-19\">M.M.: $273,631.86-$51,663.86</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-20\">$221,968.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-21\">D.O.: $169,321.33-$27,479.96</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-22\">$141,841.37</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-23\">C.J.: $325,592.13-$110,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-24\">$215,092.13</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-25\">M.B.: $275,643.60-$148,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-26\">$127,643.60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>An Addendum to the PSI explained that, in the event the district court agreed with Defendant Contreras\u2019s objection and subtracted the fees and costs from the loss amount, the revised loss amount would be $1,078,113.10.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the offense level increase would remain 16 levels because the loss amount would still be $1 million to $2.5 million. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">At the sentencing hearing on February 7, 2011, Defendant Contreras maintained her objection to the 16-level increase based on the PSI\u2019s loss calculations. Her counsel argued that the figures for the post-default sale amount of the properties were net sale-proceed figures, which did not include certain fees and costs that were subtracted from the sale amount. If added back to the sale value, this would have led to a loss calculation lower than $1 million. Her counsel explained the problem in light of the revised loss amount\u2019s proximity to the $1 million threshold necessary for a 16-level increase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-6\">Quite honestly, if the amount were substantially over $1 million, I would not be presenting this argument to the Court; but since it\u2019s so close to the $1 million figure, I\u2019m concerned that, if we were to look at the fees that are rolled \u2014 or subtracted from the sold amount in arriving at those numbers, that I\u2019m concerned that it would not meet the $1 million threshold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">After conferring privately with the prosecutor, Contreras\u2019s counsel asked the court \u201cto consider allowing the representation that the government\u2019s made that [the loss level] be ... just below $1 million, as opposed to over it.\u201d Contreras\u2019s counsel continued, \u201cwe would ask the Court to consider that as the range. And that would reduce [the offense level increase by] two levels.\u201d After further discussion, the prosecutor stated that he \u201cwould have no objection to the departure to the next level down just to cure\u201d any possible miscalculation of the loss level.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">The district court then asked Contreras\u2019s counsel whether agreeing to a loss level of below $1 million is \u201cwhat you and your client wish to do.\u201d Contreras\u2019s counsel, who had conferred with Contreras after discussing the loss amount with the prosecutor, confirmed that Contreras would stipulate to a loss amount of more than $400,000 but less than $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">As a result of the loss stipulation, the district court found that Defendant Contreras was subject to an offense level increase of 14, rather than 16, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H). This modification resulted in a total adjusted offense level of 18, yielding an advisory guidelines range of 27 to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Contreras requested a sentence of probation or home detention. The district court concluded that in light of Contreras\u2019s lack of criminal history, a downward variance was appropriate. However, the district court noted Contreras\u2019s repetitive fraudulent conduct and sentenced her to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, a variance of nine months below the advisory guidelines range. Contreras objected to the sentence as excessive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">Defendant Contreras appeals her 18-month sentence. For the first time on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>appeal, Contreras claims that the district court erroneously calculated the loss amount used to determine her guidelines range. Under the guidelines, loss equals the greater of actual loss or intended loss. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. (n. 3(A)). Under the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, actual loss is the \u201creasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. (n. 3(A)(i)). Contreras claims that because she intended no loss and the actual loss was attributable to an unforeseeable decline in the real estate market, her offense level should not have been increased at all under \u00a7 2B1.1. Contreras also argues that the district court did not apply the restrictive definition of \u201cactual\u201d loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, which requires the loss to be reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">We reject Contreras\u2019s arguments for several reasons. First, Contreras invited any alleged error in the district court and thus may not challenge it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The record shows that Defendant Contreras urged the district court to adopt the loss level and the resulting guidelines calculation she now appeals. Contreras\u2019s counsel asked the district court \u201cto consider allowing the representation that the government\u2019s made that [the loss level] be ... just below $1 million, as opposed to over it.\u201d Contreras\u2019s counsel continued, \u201cwe would ask the Court to consider [less than $1 million] as the range. And that would reduce [the offense level increase by] two levels.\u201d Contreras even stipulated to this loss range and the resultant offense-level increase of 14 rather than 16. Contreras\u2019s counsel verbally confirmed this stipulation and its effect on Contreras\u2019s offense level to the district court. Finally, the district court relied on Contreras and the government\u2019s stipulation and adjusted Contreras\u2019s offense level to 18. In sum, Contreras invited the court to rely on the loss calculation and guidelines calculation she now appeals. Accordingly, we are precluded from reviewing the purported error.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Defendant Contreras did not invite the district court to rely on the stipulated loss amount, we conclude the district court did not plainly err by finding that the appropriate loss amount was $400,000 to $1 million.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Contreras claims that because she could not have reasonably foreseen the market factors that caused the actual loss, her offense level should not have been increased under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Defendant Contreras has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred in calculating the actual loss. First, nothing in the record suggests that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>court did not adhere to the applicable guidelines or further guidance in the commentary. There is also no evidence that the losses here were occasioned entirely by market factors outside Contreras\u2019s control. In any event, Contreras cites no controlling precedent in criminal cases in this circuit or the Supreme Court that required the district court to conclude that a decline in real estate prices renders losses on fraudulent loans not foreseeable. <em>See United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]here the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d). There is certainly no such precedent under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Contreras\u2019s sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-9\">.

However, a party may not challenge as error a ruling if such error was invited by that party. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1216 (11th Cir.2005).
