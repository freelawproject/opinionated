We issued a certificate of appealability to address \u201c[wjhether the district court erred in finding that Bruce\u2019s attorney did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to strike Juror Lesleye Roberts.\u201d Because it was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for the Florida courts to conclude that Bruce failed to establish that his attorney acted deficiently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">Bruce proceeded to trial on charges of first degree murder, attempted armed robbery, unlawful possession of a firearm during a criminal offense, and two counts of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. During voir dire, a prospective juror, Roberts, stated that she remembered the facts of Bruce\u2019s case. Roberts, who was a correctional officer, told the trial court that she had heard about the case, but she did not recall any facts that suggested Bruce was guilty. The trial court asked Roberts if she would be able to render a verdict based on the evidence presented, and Roberts answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">Counsel questioned Roberts about Bruce. Roberts told a prosecutor that she was an officer at the Stockade, a center used for training and storing equipment for law enforcement and housing inmates in Dade County, Florida. Roberts stated that Bruce looked familiar, but Roberts could not identify how she recognized Bruce. In response to questions by Bruce\u2019s attorney, Roberts stated repeatedly that Bruce\u2019s face was \u201cfamiliar.\u201d Rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>erts also stated that she had \u201cworked at many facilities\u201d within the Stockade and, although she might have seen Bruce, he might also just \u201clook[ ] like someone\u201d at the center. When Bruce\u2019s attorney asked Roberts if she had seen Bruce\u2019s prison card, Roberts responded negatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The trial court also questioned Roberts about Bruce. The trial court asked Roberts if she could \u201cdecide [Bruce\u2019s] case solely upon what [she] hear[d] in court and be fair to [Bruce] and be fair to the State regardless of [her occupation],\u201d even if she \u201cperhaps [had] recognized him at the [Stockade],\u201d and Roberts responded, \u201cOf course.\u201d On a second day of voir dire, Roberts told the trial court that her profession as a corrections officer and her association with individuals in law enforcement would not affect her fairness of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Counsel also questioned Roberts on the second day of voir dire. A prosecutor asked Roberts if, given her profession, she could be fair, and she responded affirmatively. The prosecutor and Bruce\u2019s attorney each read a list of their respective witnesses to determine if they had any affiliation with a prospective juror and, when neither received any response, each attorney questioned Roberts. The prosecutor asked Roberts if she recognized any of the correctional officers sitting in the courtroom, and Roberts stated that the officers looked familiar, but she did not know them by name. Bruce\u2019s counsel asked Roberts if she recognized any of the defense witnesses, including \u201cJulie Stru-ve,\u201d and Roberts responded, \u201cNo, not by name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">At the conclusion of voir dire, Roberts remained on the jury panel. Both the prosecutor and Bruce\u2019s attorney approved the panel, but the district court did not administer an oath to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The next day, Roberts told the trial court that she knew Julian Struve, who was a corrections officer at the Stockade. When questioned by the trial court, Roberts stated that she did not \u201csocialize\u201d with Struve and that he was a \u201ccoworker\u201d who \u201cwork[ed] in a different shift.\u201d The trial court asked Roberts if she would \u201ctreat [Struve\u2019s] testimony any differently from anyone else\u2019s,\u201d and Roberts responded \u201cno.\u201d Counsel did not question Roberts, and Bruce\u2019s attorney did not object to the decision to leave Roberts on the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">After the jury found Bruce guilty of first degree murder, attempted robbery with a firearm, and possession of a firearm during a criminal offense, but before the penalty phase of Bruce\u2019s trial, the trial court held another hearing about Roberts. The trial court began the hearing by announcing that Roberts had reported making contact with Bruce at the Stockade after the jury returned its verdict. The prosecutor expressed doubt about whether Roberts could be fan\u2019 and asked the trial court to remove Roberts from the jury. When the trial court questioned Roberts, she stated that she was not \u201cable to continue\u201d and could not \u201cserve as a juror.\u201d Roberts commenced a narrative in which she insisted that she should not have been \u201cchosen\u201d to sit on the jury because \u201c[Bruce] looked familiar to [her],\u201d she worked where \u201cthe inmates [have] been housed since May of 2000,\u201d and Struve was \u201cassigned at [Roberts\u2019s] ... facility.\u201d Roberts vented about not being informed that Roberts \u201creside[d] in the area adjacent to where [she] workfed], where he [had] a complete visual of [her] whereabouts, of [her] coming and [her] going, and [her] interaction with other inmates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">During the narrative, Roberts stated that, \u201c[a]t [the] point [when she identified Struve before trial], [she] put the connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>tion together, that perhaps [Bruce] was housed there,\u201d but Roberts explained on further questioning that she did not realize at the time of trial that Bruce was incarcerated at the Stockade. Bruce\u2019s attorney asked Roberts if she \u201cbelieve[d] that there was a connection of officer [Struve] to [Bruce\u2019s] case,\u201d and Roberts responded \u201cno.\u201d Roberts explained that she knew Struve \u201cwas a witness,\u201d but \u201cfor what purpose ... [she][had] no idea.\u201d When Roberts stated that she was \u201cwaiting for [Struve\u2019s] testimony to determine what his connection was to the case,\u201d Bruce\u2019s attorney remarked that Struve \u201cdidn\u2019t testify in the guilt phase.\u201d Bruce\u2019s attorney asked Roberts if she \u201cbelieve[d] that [Bruce] was in fact an inmate at the [S]tockade,\u201d to which Roberts responded, \u201cNo, I did not.\u201d Roberts explained that Bruce \u201clooked familiar,\u201d but \u201c[w]here [she] knew him from, [she] was not certain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The trial court next questioned Roberts about the timing of her interaction with Bruce and what, if any, effect it had on the verdict. Roberts stated that she first learned that Bruce was housed in the Stockade \u201con Saturday,\u201d the day after the jury found Bruce guilty. Roberts stated that, \u201c[h]ad she known [Bruce] was housed in the [S]tockade, [she] would not have felt comfortable serving as a juror,\u201d but Roberts acknowledged that she did not learn of Bruce\u2019s location until \u201cafter the verdict had already been given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Bruce\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied. The prosecutor and Bruce agreed to excuse Roberts from the jury before the penalty phase of Bruce\u2019s trial. The trial court removed Roberts from the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury recommended that Bruce receive a sentence of imprisonment for life. The trial court sentenced Bruce to imprisonment for life for committing first degree murder and to a consecutive term of 30 years of imprisonment for his attempted robbery crime...</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Bruce moved a Florida court for post-conviction relief on the ground that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to remove Roberts from the jury venire, but the state court denied Bruce\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850. The Florida court ruled that, based on Roberts\u2019s responses during voir dire, including her statement that \u201cshe could be fair, [Bruce\u2019s] counsel was not ineffective in failing to strike her.\u201d A Florida appellate court affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Bruce filed a federal habeas petition and repeated his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, but the district court denied the writ. The district court ruled \u201cthat the state courts did not make an unreasonable factual finding or a decision contrary to federal principles in finding Bruce\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to strike Roberts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Borden v. Allen, </em>646 F.3d 785, 808 (11th Cir.2011). A petitioner is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus if the state court reached a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). A state court makes an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law if the court \u201c \u2018identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the] decisions [of the Supreme Court] but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts\u2019 of petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 2534-35, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>To prevail on an argument involving an unreasonable application of federal law, a petitioner \u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). Because the factual findings of the state court are \u201cpresumed to be correct,\u201d the petitioner bears \u201cthe burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Bruce must \u201c[s]urmount[ ] [a particularly] high bar\u201d to obtain a writ of habeas corpus on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1485, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). Not only must Bruce prove that his counsel committed an error and that error was \u201cso serious as to deprive [him] of a fair trial,\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), he also must overcome the \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d standard applied to the decisions of counsel in habeas corpus review. <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009). Based on the deference given the decision of the state court to deny Bruce\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance, the district court was required to determine \u201cnot whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable[,]\u201d but instead \u201cwhether there [was] any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Bruce was entitled to a fair adjudication of his criminal charges by a \u201cpanel of impartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors,\u201d but that did not require that veniremembers \u201cbe totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved,\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 1642, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961), or \u201cfree of opinion towards crime,\u201d <em>United States v. Tegzes, </em>715 F.2d 505, 507 (11th Cir.1983). The fairness of a trial is doubtful only when a veniremember reveals that she \u201chas such a fixed opinion, based on [her] bias [or a presumed bias], that [she] \u2018could not judge impartially the guilt of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Depree v. Thomas, </em>946 F.2d 784, 788 (11th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1035, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 2891, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984)). If the veniremember confirms that she can be impartial under questioning designed to \u201c \u2018create[ ] a reasonable assurance that prejudice would be discovered if present,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nell, </em>526 F.2d 1223, 1229 (11th Cir.1976) (quoting <em>United States v. Dellinger, </em>472 F.2d 340, 367 (7th Cir. 1972)), she is qualified to sit on the jury. \u201cIt is sufficient if the juror can lay aside [her] impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. at 1643.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">In <em>Depree, </em>we affirmed the denial of habeas relief to a petitioner who challenged the refusal of a Georgia court to remove two venirepersons who had connections to law enforcement. 946 F.2d at 788-92. Because the question of partiality is \u201c \u2018plainly a question of historical fact\u2019 \u201d and, based on the deference accorded the findings of state courts in habeas proceedings, we reviewed the voir dire that preceded Depree\u2019s trial to determine if the record supported the finding of the state court \u201c \u2018that the jurors ... would be impartial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788 (quoting <em>Patton, </em>467 U.S. at 1036, 1038, 104 S.Ct. at 2891, 2892-93). That review revealed that the venire-persons, despite their presumed biases, expressed that they could decide Depree\u2019s case impartially. Isaac Hodgkins admitted that he was \u201cafraid\u201d that his past employment as a deputy sheriff would affect \u201cthe way [he] would think,\u201d but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>state court reasonably found him qualified to serve as a juror because he \u201ccontinually asserted that he would be able to set aside his personal feelings in evaluating Depress case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789-90. The state court also reasonably determined that Sonya Reynolds was impartial. Although Reynolds admitted that her relationship with family members who served on the Atlanta police force \u201cwould have some influence over\u201d her decisionmaking, she stated that she did not \u201chave any doubt about being fair and impartial\u201d and could set aside any personal feelings to evaluate the evidence objectively. <em>Id. </em>at 791 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">As in <em>Degree, \u201c </em>\u2018there is fair support in the record for the ... conclusion [of the state court] that [Bruce\u2019s attorney had good reason to conclude that Roberts] ... would be impartial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788 (quoting <em>Patton, </em>467 U.S. at 1038, 104 S.Ct. at 2892-93). Roberts was questioned for two days by the trial court and counsel about her impartiality, and Roberts stated repeatedly that she could decide Bruce\u2019s case based on the evidence and that she could be fair to Bruce. None of Roberts\u2019s responses or actions suggest that her statements were deceitful, despite Bruce\u2019s assertions to the contrary. Roberts was forthcoming with information relevant to her qualification as a juror, including her occupation and her familiarity with defense witness Officer Stuve. When Roberts later interacted with Bruce at the jail facility, Roberts continued to be candid with the trial court and explained that she could no longer serve on the jury. Bruce argues that Roberts was biased and that became \u201cplain ... when she recused herself from the panel after she reached a jury verdict,\u201d but the record provides no reason to believe that Roberts would have been reticent about admitting any bias that existed before her encounter with Bruce. \u201cAt most, the record establishes that [Roberts] might have brought a bias to the courtroom door; it does not demonstrate that [Roberts] could not leave [her] bias outside that door\u201d when she was seated for the guilt phase of Bruce\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The district court correctly denied Bruce habeas relief. The Florida court reasonably determined that Bruce failed to establish that his counsel was ineffective. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient only if it falls below the wide range of competence under \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d of attorneys in criminal cases, <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, and must be evaluated in the light of the \u201cthe facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. Bruce alleged no facts to establish that his attorney overlooked a meritorious challenge to Roberts. <em>\u201cStrickland </em>does not guarantee perfect representation, only a reasonably competent attorney,\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 791 (internal quotation marks omitted), and based on the information available to Bruce\u2019s attorney at the time of trial, there was no reason for him to question Roberts\u2019s impartiality. See <em>Degree, </em>946 F.2d at 788-92; <em>see also United States v. Rhodes, </em>177 F.3d 963, 965-66 (11th Cir.1999) (affirming the denial of a new trial based on the perceived bias of a veniremember who was the cousin of a witness for the government). The state court reasonably concluded that Bruce\u2019s attorney did not act deficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">The denial of Bruce\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b841-10\">MARTIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AM2\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">I concur only in the judgment affirming the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Bruce\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
