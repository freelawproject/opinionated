Prior to the issuance of the order of removal, Tele-maque filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, seeking a declaratory judgment that he was a citizen or national of the United States who could not be removed as well as his immediate release from prison. The district court concluded that Telemaque was challenging his order of removal and that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5) it was without subject matter jurisdiction to consider Telemaque\u2019s petition. Telemaque argues here that he could not have been challenging his removal order since he filed his petition before he was ordered removed. He also contends that he never consented to proceed before a magistrate judge. Finally, he reiterates his request for a declaratory judgment that he is a citizen or national of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding jurisdiction. <em>Rios-Valenzuela v. Dep\u2019t Homeland Sec., </em>506 F.3d 393, 396 (5th Cir.2007). This court may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As Telemaque asserts, he filed his \u00a7 2241 petition before he was ordered removed. Thus, the basis for the district court\u2019s judgment, \u00a7 1252(a)(5), was incorrect. Nevertheless, the district court was still without subject matter jurisdiction to consider Telemaque\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">DHS instituted removal proceedings against Telemaque in June 2007, asserting that Telemaque was neither a citizen nor national of the United States and that Telemaque was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because of his conviction for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), \u00a7 846. Thus, when Telemaque filed his \u00a7 2241 petition in February 2010, Tele-maque\u2019s \u201cstatus as a national\u201d had already arisen in connection with a removal proceeding, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a)(1), and was currently at issue in a removal proceeding. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1503(a)(2). Accordingly, the district court was without subject matter jurisdiction to consider Telemaque\u2019s petition pursuant to \u00a7 1503(a). <em>See Rios-Valenzuela, </em>506 F.3d at 398 (affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to \u00a7 1503(a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Furthermore, we will not construe Tele-maque\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a petition for review. Even if we did, we would lack jurisdiction, pursuant to \u00a7 1252(d)(2), because the converted petition would be successive to Telemaque\u2019s first petition for review. <em>See Telemaque v. Holder, </em>No. 11-60198 (5th Cir.); <em>Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, </em>461 F.3d 605, 608 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Finally, Telemaque\u2019s argument that he never consented to proceed before a magistrate judge is without merit. Consent to proceed before a magistrate judge becomes relevant only if the magistrate judge conducts all proceedings and orders the entry of judgment in a case, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1), neither of which occurred in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
