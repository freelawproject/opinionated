Nicholas (\u201cNicholas\u201d), brought an action under the FDCPA and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 559.55 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cFCCPA\u201d), against Al-lianceone Receivables Management, Inc., (\u201cAllianceone\u201d), a debt collector. Specifically, Nicholas alleged in her complaint that Allianceone sought to collect on an alleged debt owned by Nicholas by leaving an excessive number of messages on Nicholas\u2019s voice mail when Allianceone failed to disclose the fact that it was a \u201cdebt collector,\u201d in violation of both federal and Florida state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-22\">Subsequently, the parties settled the case for $2,001.00 plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, to be determined by the court. Nicholas then filed a verified motion for an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees. In her motion Nicholas sought attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $3,314.50, representing 9.74 hours of work at an hourly rate of $350.00. Nicholas also sought to recover costs in the amount of $991.75. Additionally, in a supplemental declaration, Nicholas sought fees in the amount of $2,156.00, representing 6.16 hours of work at an hourly rate of $350.00, for fees incurred in litigating the attorney\u2019s fee issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-23\">The case was referred by the district court to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 <em>et seq. </em>The magistrate judge concluded that Nicholas was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the total amount of $4,689.00, representing $2,841.00 for 9.47 hours of work at an hourly rate of $300.00, and $1,848.00 for 6.16 hours of work also at an hourly rate of $300.00. The magistrate judge also found that Nicholas was entitled to a total of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>$430.00 in costs representing the filing fees ($350.00) and service calls ($30.00), as well as the cost associated with a cancelled deposition ($50.00).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">This appeal concentrates on the district court\u2019s ruling that Nicholas was not entitled to mediation fees because those costs are not taxable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. We agree with the district court\u2019s ruling and find persuasive our decision in <em>Gary Brown &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Ashdon, Inc., </em>268 Fed.Appx. 837, 845-46 (11th Cir.2008), denying a prevailing party\u2019s request for mediation expenses. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
