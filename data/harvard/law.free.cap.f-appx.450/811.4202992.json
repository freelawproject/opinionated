Gomez argues that the court erred in applying the number-of-images enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(A), because Congress\u2019s enactment of that provision violated the separation-of-powers doctrine. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>We review questions of law dealing with the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1314 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1315, 175 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2010). The Guideline at issue, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(A), derives from the Protect Act, Pub. L. No. 108-21, \u00a7 401(i), 117 Stat. 650, 672-73 (2003), under which Congress directly amended \u00a7 2G2.4(b) with increased offense levels corresponding to the number of images possessed. Under section 2G2.2(b)(7)(A), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by 2 if he possessed between 10 and 150 images of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The Sentencing Commission is established as an independent commission in the U.S. judicial branch. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(a). In <em>Mistretta v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that Congress\u2019s creation of the Commission, as well as the inclusion of federal judges on the Commission, did not violate the Constitution\u2019s nondelegation and separation-of-powers doctrines. 488 U.S. 361, 412, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Contrary to Gomez\u2019s arguments, we agree with our sister circuits that Congress\u2019s creation of the enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(A) was constitutional. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rodgers, </em>610 F.3d 975, 977-78 (7th Cir.2010) (persuasive authority) (holding that Congress\u2019s creation of the guideline provision was constitutional because Congress retained the power to amend the Sentencing Guidelines when it created the Sentencing Commission); <em>United States v. Bastian, </em>603 F.3d 460, 464-65 (8th Cir.2010) (persuasive authority) (holding that, under <em>Mistretta, </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) was created constitutionally). Indeed, in determining that the Sentencing Commission was \u201can independent agency,\u201d the Supreme Court in <em>Mistretta </em>held that \u201cthe Commission is fully accountable to Congress, which can revoke or amend any or all of the Guidelines as it sees fit.\u201d 488 U.S. at 393-94, 109 S.Ct. 647; <em>cf. United States v. Osburn, </em>955 F.2d 1500, 1504-05 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cFederal legislation mandating length of sentences does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
