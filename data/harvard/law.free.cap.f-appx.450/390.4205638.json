This court is now presented with his request to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>in forma pauperis (IFP) in an appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion for a writ of audita querela, which sought relief based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Davila attacks the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it presents no nonfrivo-lous issues. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Davila maintains that the writ of audita querela is available to him because <em>Booker </em>was unavailable when he was sentenced and because he would receive a significantly less harsh sentence if the principles enunciated in <em>Booker </em>were applied to his case. The writ of audita querela is not the proper procedural vehicle for this claim because redress is available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>599 F.3d 484, 488 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, Davila\u2019s inability to meet the requirements for bringing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not render the \u00a7 2255 remedy unavailable. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">This appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Consequently, Davila\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
