(\u201cN\u2019Site\u201d) to Omega Claims Solutions, Inc. (\u201cOmega\u201d), Omega filed suit in a Texas state court alleging that the award was in violation of 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3). N\u2019Site removed the case to federal court, and cross-motions for summary judgment were filed by N\u2019Site and Omega. The district court found Omega\u2019s challenge to the award to be meritless and entered a final judgment on December 17, 2009 for N\u2019Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">At the end of that order, the district court stated about Omega\u2019s counsel, Scott Rothenberg:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">As a final matter, and for the reasons discussed above, Omega has forced N\u2019Site to pursue a costly and time-consuming course to enforce the arbitration award made on December 19, 2008. The Court believes that Omega\u2019s counsel, Scott Rothenberg, spearheaded a campaign of misinformation and delay in a Quixotic quest to vacate an arbitration award that was, as this Court has found, decided thoughtfully, fairly, and well within the confines of the AAA Rules. Accordingly, the Court finds that Mr. Rothenberg\u2019s actions in this case are sufficient to warrant the <em>sua sponte </em>imposition of Rule 11 sanctions. However, in light of the Court\u2019s decision to award costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to [N\u2019Site] for the reasons stated above, the Court will exercise its discretion not to order any sanctions at this time for Omega\u2019s frivolous claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\"><em>Omega Claims Solutions, Inc. v. N\u2019Site Solutions, Inc., </em>No. 4:09-CV-1102, slip op. at 12 (S.D.Tex. Dec. 17, 2009). Rothenberg did not appeal that order. On March 29, 2011, N\u2019Site timely filed its notice of appeal of two later orders by the district court. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(3), Rothenberg filed his notice of appeal, appealing the December 17, 2009 order. N\u2019Site later voluntarily dismissed its appeal, leaving only Roth-enberg\u2019s appeal of the December 17, 2009 order pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">N\u2019Site argues that the December 17, 2009 order is not appealable because, it contends, the district court issued no sanction. Although not stylized as such in its brief, what N\u2019Site is arguing is that Rothenberg lacks standing because Rothenberg has suffered no injury-in-fact. <em>See K.P. v. LeBlanc, </em>627 F.3d 115, 122 (5th Cir.2010). Although in <em>Walker v. City of Mesquite, Tex., </em>129 F.3d 831 (5th Cir.1997), we held that damage to an attorney\u2019s professional reputation because of a sanction is sufficient to confer standing, <em>see id. </em>at 832-33, here, there was no sanction. The district court expressly stated it was \u201cexercis[ing] its discretion <em>not </em>to order any sanctions at this time.\u201d <em>Omega Claims, </em>No. 4:09-CV-1102, slip op. at 12. The mere conclusion that Rothenberg\u2019s actions were \u201csufficient to warrant the <em>sua sponte </em>imposition of Rule 11 sanctions,\u201d <em>id., </em>is neither sufficiently concrete and particularized nor actual and imminent to confer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS Rothenberg\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
