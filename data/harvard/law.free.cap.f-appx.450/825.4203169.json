The Guidelines range for his offenses was 188 to 235 months. Cruz asserts that his sentences are substantively unreasonable because the district court did not vary downward from the guidelines range. Cruz argues that such a downward variance would have been appropriate because (1) Cruz\u2019s co-defendants received lower sentences than he, even though they were more culpable for the conspiracy, and (2) Cruz\u2019s criminal history was over-represented. After review of the record and the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-22\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cOrdinarily, a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure is unreviewable on appeal. Such refusals are reviewable, however, if the district court refused a downward departure because of an erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to grant one.\u201d <em>United States v. Ortega, </em>358 F.3d 1278, 1279 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-23\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first ensure that the sentence was proeedurally reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If the sentence is proeedurally reasonable, we inquire whether the sentence is substantively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence in question. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323-24 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Generally, we do not second guess the weight the district court gave a certain factor. <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). Ordinarily, we expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-26\">Cruz argues first that his sentences are substantively unreasonable because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>are higher than his co-conspirators, including those with leadership roles in the scheme. The district court acknowledged this disparity, but found that Cruz\u2019s higher sentences were merited due to his criminal history. Cruz next argues that although his criminal history is technically correct, it was over-represented because two of his convictions relating to domestic abuse were closely related, involving the same victim (his wife) and occurring within a two-month period. Cruz asserts that the district court should thus have granted a downward departure. The district court rejected Cruz\u2019s request for a downward departure at sentencing, explaining that the fact that there were <em>two </em>offenses, both of which occurred after Cruz\u2019s wife had obtained a restraining order against him, demonstrated that Cruz \u201cjust didn\u2019t seem to get the message.\u201d The district court concluded that \u201cconsiderations of respect for the law and deterrence\u201d justified Cruz\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Because Cruz makes no assertion that the district court erroneously believed that it lacked the ability to grant a downward departure, we decline to review the district court\u2019s decision to deny the requested downward departure. Regarding the substantive reasonableness of his sentences,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cruz has not adduced any facts that establish that the court failed to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Upon review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court in imposing Cruz\u2019s 192-month sentences, which were near the bottom of the guidelines range for his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\">. Cruz makes no argument that his sentences were procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
