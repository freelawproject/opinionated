Jenkins, a pro se inmate, appeals the order of the District Court construing his petition under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, as one for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Because we conclude that this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">Following a jury trial in District Court, William R. Jenkins was convicted of several weapons and narcotics offenses. The District Court sentenced Jenkins in October 1998 to 570 months in prison. This Court affirmed. (C.A. No. 98-7557). In September 2000, Jenkins filed his first motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the District Court denied. On appeal, this Court held that the rule of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral view, and affirmed the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>333 F.3d 151 (3d Cir.2003). In 2006, we denied Jenkins\u2019 application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">In June 2011, Jenkins filed a petition under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, challenging his sentence and arguing that he is entitled to relief under the Act because he had no other means to attain relief. The Magistrate Judge recommended that the petition be construed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In August 2011, the District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation, dismissing and closing the case. Jenkins filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-18\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. A certificate of appealability is not required to appeal from the denial of this \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir. 2009) <em>(citing United States v. Cepero, </em>224 F.3d 256, 264-65 (3d Cir.2000)). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions, and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>See Vega </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In his petition, Jenkins seeks re-sentencing based, in part, on his claim that the sentencing court improperly relied on a prior state conviction to sentence him as a career offender. He argues that the conviction \u2014 simple assault \u2014 is no longer a crime of violence, and, therefore, that he is actually innocent of being a career offender pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cACCA\u201d). <em>See Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). He also argues that he is actually innocent of aiding and abetting the use or carrying of a firearm in a drug crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), based on <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). The District Court construed Jenkins\u2019 petition as having been filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the petition because Jenkins had an adequate and effective remedy for his sentencing claims in \u00a7 2255. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We agree that the All Writs Act does not apply to Jenkins\u2019 claims. \u201cWhere a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\u201d <em>Massey v. United States, </em>581 F.3d 172, 174 (3d Cir.2009) (internal quotation omitted). Jenkins\u2019 claims challenging his sentence should be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, we also agree that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the \u00a7 2241 petition because Jenkins could have properly challenged his sentence through a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002). Lack of success in a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, without more, does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>Id. </em>Jenkins could have raised his <em>Bailey </em>claim in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. Additionally, Jenkins\u2019 claim that <em>Begay </em>prohibits the use of his prior conviction for simple assault to enhance his sentence is also without merit. <em>Begay </em>held that a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol is a not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. 553 U.S. at 139, 128 S.Ct. 1581. Jenkins sentence was enhanced based on an assault conviction, and therefore <em>Begay </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
