The district court allowed the Appellants to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1). A magistrate judge issued a report recommending dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) because the Appellants failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and dismissed the Appellants\u2019 suit under \u00a7 1915(e). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-26\">Because the <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) provision allows persons to bring their claims in federal court without the usual costs associated with litigation, \u201cdistrict courts are vested with especially broad discretion in making the determination of whether an IFP proceeding is frivolous.\u201d <em>Green v. McKaskle, </em>788 F.2d 1116, 1119 (5th Cir.1986). Therefore, we review IFP dismissals under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Hicks v. Garner, </em>69 F.3d 22, 24 (5th Ch'.1995). We have said that \u201can IFP proceeding may be dismissed if (1) the claim\u2019s realistic chance of ultimate success is slight; (2) the claim has no arguable basis in law or fact; or (3) it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, although we \u201cliberally construe\u201d the filings of <em>pro se </em>litigants and \u201capply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>pro se </em>appellants must still brief the issues such that an appellate court can reasonably pass on them. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Here, the Appellants seek review of the district court\u2019s determination as to their FOIA requests and the district court\u2019s pre-answer dismissal of the Appellants\u2019 complaint. Though there are mentions in the Appellants\u2019 brief to NCLBA and the Civil Rights Act, there are no facts in the brief that could support a cause of action under either statute; it appears therefore that these claims have been abandoned on appeal. As stated above, the district court has broad discretion over IFP complaints and the mere fact that the district court did not see fit to require a responsive pleading is not an abuse of discretion. <em>Green, </em>788 F.2d at 1119. As to Appellants\u2019 FOIA complaints, it appears that the Appellants are upset about the Department of Education\u2019s withholding records with respect to \u201c08-462, 10-323, and 11-603.\u201d FOIA requires that those seeking records from a government agency \u201creasonably de-scribee ] such records\u201d sought. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3). Because of this failure to reasonably describe the records sought, the district court dismissed the Appellants\u2019 FOIA claims. As we cannot decipher which records the Appellants are seeking, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the suit on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Appellants\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
