Micklas argues that the district court erred in dismissing his suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Upon review of the briefs and record, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Micklas asserts his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which provides a remedy for deprivation of federal statutory and constitutional rights by a person acting under color of state law. <em>Almand v. De-Kalb Cnty., </em>103 F.3d 1510, 1512-13 (11th Cir.1997). Micklas\u2019s allegations relay his displeasure with having his claims for Social Security benefits denied. His claims do not, however, involve a violation of his rights by a person acting \u201cunder color of <em>state </em>law\u201d as required by \u00a7 1983. Instead, his complaints arise under federal law\u2014 the Social Security Act pursuant to which his claims for benefits were denied. We thus construe Micklas\u2019s complaint otherwise to \u201cdiscern whether jurisdiction ... can be founded on a legally justifiable base.\u201d <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 184, 187 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Construing Micklas\u2019s complaint as a <em>Bivens </em>action does not result in federal jurisdiction. Under <em>Bivens, </em>federal officials acting under color of federal law may be sued in their individual capacities for violating an individual\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 2005, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). A <em>Bivens </em>action is unavailable, though, where Congress has provided an alternate remedy. <em>Hardison v. Cohen, </em>375 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court, because of the remedies under the complex Social Security statutes and regulations, has expressly foreclosed extension of a <em>Bivens </em>action to persons who were improperly denied Social Security benefits as a result of alleged due process violations. <em>Schweiker v. Chilicky, </em>487 U.S. 412, 425-29, 108 S.Ct. 2460, 2468-71, 101 L.Ed.2d 370 (1988). Because Micklas alleges due process violations related to denial of his benefits, a <em>Bivens </em>actions is not available and cannot provide a basis of jurisdiction in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">Even construing Micklas\u2019s claim as one for review of the denial of benefits, federal jurisdiction is lacking. The Social Security Act limits a district court\u2019s jurisdiction over claims related to Social Security benefits determinations to the review of a \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the Commissioner. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). To obtain review in federal court under Section 405(g), a Social Security claimant must have (1) presented a claim for benefits to the Commissioner and (2) exhausted administrative remedies. <em>See Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cThis means claimant must have completed each of the steps of the administrative review process unless exhaustion has been waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Waiver is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">Here, the Commissioner submitted exhibits to the district court that demonstrated Micklas had not exhausted his administrative remedies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>exhibits established that Micklas had not proceeded beyond the second of the four-step administrative review process of the Social Security Administration. Upon review, we agree with the district court that Micklas has not exhausted his administrative remedies. The district court thus correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction over Micklas\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">. Because he proceeds <em>pro se, </em>we construe Micklas's pleadings liberally. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b881-12\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1255 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b881-17\">.Micklas also argues on appeal that it was improper for the district court to consider materials outside of the pleadings in determining the motion to dismiss for lack of sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>ject matter jurisdiction. It is well established, however, that when a party \"challenge[s] the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in fact, ... matters outside the pleadings, such as testimony and affidavits, are considered.\u201d <em>Lawrence v. Dunbar, </em>919 F.2d 1525, 1529 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
