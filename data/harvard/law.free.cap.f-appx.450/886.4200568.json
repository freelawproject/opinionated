Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Grim-shaw alleged that Metropolitan Life and its employees used mail and wire transmissions to \u201cdefraud[ ] [Grimshaw] and hundreds of other beneficiary and/or policyholders nationwide out of millions\u201d of dollars by diminishing beneficiary payments for life insurance policies issued before 1965 that had face values below $1,000. The district court ruled that Grimshaw failed to plead sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-19\">Grimshaw argues that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint based on the insufficient pleading of his claim of racketeering, but we disagree. Grimshaw asks that we remand so he can file an amended complaint, but a remand would be futile because even a \u201c \u2018more carefully drafted complaint [could not] state a claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silva v. Bieluch, </em>351 F.3d 1045, 1048 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Bank v. Pitt, </em>928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir.1991)). Grimshaw\u2019s complaint asserted that Metropolitan Life engaged in racketeering, but the facts alleged in his complaint cannot support a claim of racketeering.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-20\">Grimshaw also argues that the supplemental jurisdiction of the district court evaporated upon dismissal of the racketeering claim, but a district court has the discretion to \u201cexercise [supplemental] jurisdiction after dismissing every claim over which it had original jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Carlsbad Tech, Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc., </em>556 U.S. 635, 129 S.Ct. 1862, 1866, 173 L.Ed.2d 843 (2009). Grimshaw fails to challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>ruling that his complaint also failed to state a claim for relief under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">The dismissal of Grimshaw\u2019s complaint with prejudice is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
