He was sentenced to 46 months in prison, within the applicable guidelines range of 46 to 57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Lira-Trejo contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and results in excessive sentences; that the age of the burglary conviction used to enhance his sentence renders his sentence unreasonable; that his sentencing range overstates the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense, which he asserts is simply an international trespass; and that the district court did not take into account his history and characteristics. We review sentences for reasonableness, employing a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, and we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The lack of empirical basis for \u00a7 2L1.2 does not necessarily render a within-guidelines sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009). In a series of unpublished opinions, we have rejected the argument that the staleness of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction renders his within-range sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Valencia, </em>401 Fed.Appx. 888, 888-89 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Ortiz-Arriaga, </em>355 Fed.Appx. 849, 849-50 (5th Cir. 2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2133, 176 L.Ed.2d 752 (2010); <em>United States v. Gonzales-Torres, </em>288 Fed.Appx. 927, 928-29 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We likewise reject Lira-Trejo\u2019s contention that unlawful reentry \u2014 a federal felony carrying significant criminal penalties\u2014 is merely an international trespass. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Nor do we discern any improper weighing of the other factors cited by Lira-Trejo, including his personal history and characteristics. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). In short, the district court considered Lira-Trejo\u2019s arguments and the facts of the case before concluding that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. Lira-Trejo\u2019s mere disagreement with the court\u2019s assessment of those factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Heirera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
