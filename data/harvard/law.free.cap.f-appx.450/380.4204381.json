He contends the district court erred by: making a prejudicial remark that deprived him of a fair trial; sentencing him as a career offender; and, imposing a consecutive sentence without articulating reasons. Harris does not contest the substantive reasonableness of that sentence. As Harris did not raise these contentions before the district court, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Gracia, </em>522 F.3d 597, 599-600 (5th Cir.2008). To show reversible plain error, Harris must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>With respect to plain error at sentencing, the appellant bears the burden of showing a reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s error, he would have received a lower sentence. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">Regarding Harris\u2019 conviction, in overruling a Government objection during cross-examination of Harris (that he \u201cbe instructed to answer my question\u201d), the court stated: \u201cThe witness is answering your question. He\u2019s not helping himself so I would leave it along [sic] if I were you\u201d. Given the context of the comments, their isolated nature, and the court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard all of the court\u2019s comments, Harris has not shown the claimed error was clear or obvious; and, even assuming it is, he has not shown it affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1569, 1571-72 (5th Cir.1994) (judge's intervention must be \u201cquantitatively and qualitatively substantial\u201d; curative jury in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>struction \u201ccan operate against a finding of constitutional error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Regarding Harris\u2019 sentence, although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines sentencing range for use in deciding the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">For the career-offender challenge, the absence of binding precedent on whether Harris\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 offense is a crime of violence \u2014 supporting a career-offender sentencing enhancement \u2014 precludes any error\u2019s being plain (clear or obvious). <em>E.g., United States v. Henderson, </em>646 F.3d 223, 225 (5th Cir. 2011). Furthermore, pursuant to the above-discussed prejudice standard for plain-error review of claimed sentencing errors, Harris has not shown a reasonable probability that, but for this claimed error, he would have received a lower sentence. <em>E.g., Davis, </em>602 F.3d at 647. The court: found expressly the advisory Guideline sentencing range did not account adequately for Harris\u2019 behavior and criminal history; imposed a sentence one month below the statutory maximum and well above the advisory sentencing range; and, flatly rejected Harris\u2019 objection to the sentence, noting it was \u201cnot going to shift\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">For his final contention, Harris asserts the court\u2019s failure to articulate reasons for imposing a permitted consecutive sentence requires remand for resentencing. In the light of the district court\u2019s above-described reasons for imposing a sentence above the advisory range, Harris has not shown the claimed error affected his substantial rights (would have received a lower sentence). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
