He appeals his sentences on two grounds: (1) the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level by four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B) on a finding that his offenses involved more than 50 victims; (2) the district court, in fixing his criminal history category at III, plainly erred in assessing two criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c) for committing the misdemeanor offenses of failure to register as an ex-felon as required by Nevada law. While this appeal was pending, the district court announced that it had erred in finding that the offenses of conviction involved more than 50 victims; they involved 27 victims instead. The Government agrees and joins Williams in asking that his sentences be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing. We grant that relief after addressing Williams\u2019s second ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">We address that ground for plain error. <em>United States v. Chisholm, </em>73 F.3d 304, 307 (11th Cir.1996). The plain error standard is met only if three elements are satisfied: (1) there is error, (2) the error is plain or obvious, and (3) the error affects the appellant\u2019s substantial rights. An error cannot be \u201cplain\u201d where there is no precedent of the Supreme Court or this court establishing the error. <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But even if error that is plain has occurred, we will not upset the district court\u2019s judgment unless the error seriously affects \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation\u201d of the defendant\u2019s sentencing proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Under the Guidelines, prior sentences for misdemeanors are generally counted in the defendant\u2019s criminal history score. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c); <em>United States v. Horton, </em>158 F.3d 1227, 1227 n. 1 (11th Cir. 1998). However, under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l)(2008), sentences for certain enumerated offenses, and similar offenses, are only scored if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or a term of imprisonment of at least 30 days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to the instant offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 671 (11th Cir.1998). The enumerated offenses include driving with an invalid license, giving false information to a police officer, passing bad checks, trespassing, and non-support. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). Additionally, offenses such as fish and game violations, juvenile status offenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>truancy, loitering, public intoxication, and minor traffic infractions are never scored. <em>Id. </em>at (c)(2). The commentary to \u00a7 4A1.2(c) directs the court to compare unlisted offenses to the enumerated offenses under a multi-factor \u201ccommon sense approach,\u201d looking at (1) the punishment imposed, (2) the perceived seriousness, (3) the elements, (4) the level of culpability involved, and (5) the likelihood of recurring criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at. comment, n. 12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Under Nevada law, a \u201cconvicted person,\u201d who is either a resident or a registered nonresident, must notify local law enforcement within 48 hours of any change in address. Nev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 179C.110; <em>see also id. </em>at \u00a7 179C.010. Failure to do so is a misdemeanor. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 179C.220. Williams committed the offense on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">This misdemeanor offense of failure to register as an ex-felon is not specifically excluded under the Guidelines. Williams points out similarities between the offense and the minor offenses excluded under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) and (2), including the fact that he received short two-day jail sentences and that failure to register is a passive offense based on status, but these similarities did not inform the district court that is application of \u00a7 4A1.2(c) was erroneous. He cites cases from other circuits dealing with the issue, but no decision of the Supreme Court or this court\u2014 because there is none \u2014 resolving the issue. In short, nothing in the relevant precedent established that the assessment of two criminal history points under \u00a7 4A1.2(c) constitute error. Aside from the foregoing, Williams has not demonstrated that such assessment affected the public reputation, fairness, or integrity of his sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In sum, Williams\u2019s second ground for reversal fails. With this holding as part of our mandate, Williams\u2019s sentences are VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-10\">. Or the error is becomes clear because the language of the relevant statute or rule controls the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
