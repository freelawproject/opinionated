She appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress the marijuana found in the truck she was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Masterson drove a green 1997 GMC pickup truck to the United States Border-Patrol checkpoint located on Interstate Highway 35, north of Laredo, Texas. During the primary inspection, a border patrol canine named Bono-A alerted to the truck for the possible presence of narcotics. Masterson was referred to secondary inspection, and the dog pinpointed the source of the odor at the truck\u2019s gas tank. A fiber optic scope revealed 47.5 kilograms of marijuana inside the gas tank. A later search revealed another 28 kilograms of marijuana in the spare tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Masterson argues that the Border Patrol\u2019s secondary inspection of the truck and the prolonged detention were not based on reasonable suspicion or probable cause, as required by the Fourth Amendment. According to Masterson, Border Patrol Agent Francisco Garza was unable to articulate how he determined that Bono-A had alerted, and he was therefore unable to show probable cause or reasonable suspicion for the search. In essence, she argues that there was no alert because Agent Garza could not identify any specific behavior that constitutes an alert.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Agent Garza first encountered Master-son when she was at the checkpoint, south of the border. He testified at the suppression hearing that when she drove to the primary inspection booth, Bono-A \u201cgot in the middle.\u201d The wind was blowing from north to south, he said, and Bono-A \u201cgot an odor\u201d and \u201cstarted following the vehicle, alerting.\u201d Agent Garza testified that he was familiar with the way Bono-A alerts, explaining that Bono-A displays a \u201cchange in behavior, increased respiration,\u201d and wags his tail and perks up his ears.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">The district court found this testimony credible and found that Agent Garza credibly interpreted Bono-A\u2019s behavior as an alert. The testimony of Masterson\u2019s dog handling expert, Jerry Potter, was deemed irrelevant because alerting behavior is particular to the dog. In other words, each dog alerts in a different way, and the dog\u2019s behavior must be interpreted by his handler.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">When a dog alerts to the possibility of narcotics hidden in the vehicle, probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband is established. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>69 F.3d 27, 28 (5th Cir.1995). Viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, and giving due deference to the district court\u2019s assessment of the suppression hearing testimony, the evidence in the record does not show clear error in the district court\u2019s findings that Bono-A alerted. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Levine, </em>80 F.3d 129, 132 (5th Cir.1996). Given that the alert established probable cause for the search of the gas tank, Mas-terson has not shown that the district court committed error in finding that the search was constitutional. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>482 F.3d 315, 317 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Cir.2007). Accordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
