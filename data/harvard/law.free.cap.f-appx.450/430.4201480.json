A COA is required because the denial of Rule 60(b) relief was \u201cthe final order in a proceeding under section 2255.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); <em>see Ochoa Canales v. Quarterman, </em>507 F.3d 884, 888 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-22\">McBride argues that reasonable jurists could debate the denial of his Rule 60(b) motions because in the initial \u00a7 2255 proceeding the district court did not address a claim that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to challenge an allegedly invalid warrant and it failed to rule on two motions for production of grand jury transcripts. The district court denied the motions as unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motions. We agree that the motions were unauthorized successive petitions such that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider them. We dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-23\">McBride also moves to vacate the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 relief on the ground that the judgment lacks finality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>because it did not resolve all pending motions. That motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION TO VACATE DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
