The Board found that Yanes was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had been convicted of a crime of domestic violence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae. We deny Yanes\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-25\">The decision of the Board is consistent with the plain language of the statutes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>govern cancellation of removal. Section 1229b(b)(l) provides that, in cases of exceptional hardship, \u201c[t]he Attorney General may cancel removal of ... an alien who is inadmissible or deportable\u201d if he has remained in the United States continually for ten years, \u201chas been a person of good moral character,\u201d and \u201chas not been convicted of an offense under ... [8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 ]U82(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3).\u201d Section 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) prohibits an alien from committing \u201cany crime of violence ... against a current or former spouse.\u201d Yanes does not deny that, in 2002, he was convicted in a Georgia court of hitting his wife, which is a disqualifying offense under sections 1229b(b)(l) and 1227(a)(2). <em>See Matter of Cortez, </em>25 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 301, 310 (2010). Regardless of his status as an arriving alien or his eligibility for the exception for petty offenses, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii), Yanes is ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See Matter of Almanzar-Arenas, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 771, 776 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">We DENY Yanes\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
