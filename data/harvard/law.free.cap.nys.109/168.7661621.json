From so much of an order as directs the payment by the substituted trustee of $1,000 to plaintiff\u2019s attorneys as the condition of the withdrawal of plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment, Sarah Cecile Beloe appeals.

Originally the claim of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys was $7,500. By agreement this was reduced to $3,500. The referee allowed them $500, and found that $2,000 in addition would have been a proper credit, if paid. This $2,000 Mr. Justice Marean allowed, and the $1,000 in question here makes up the amount of $3,500. The order simply carries out the terms of the offer of settlement, which it appears was not improperly accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The order, in so far as appealed from, should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
