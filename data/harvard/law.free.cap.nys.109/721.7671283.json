It seems to us perfectly clear that the word \u201cissue\u201d was not used in this technical sense in the fifteenth clause of the will under consideration. The testator intended by the use of that word that it was to have a less extended meaning and to be applied only to descendants of a particular class at a particular time. Palmer v. Horn, 84 N. Y. 516. After providing, in a way which cannot be misunderstood, for a per capita taking in equal portions by all living grandchildren, he used words which unmistakably indicate that he intended that the issue of any grandchild who had died prior to such taking should take only the share which the parent would have taken if living, \u201cincluding,\u201d he says, \u201cthe issue of any grandchild or grandchildren then deceased, leaving issue then alive who shall take the same share together if more than one, which such deceased parent or parents would have taken if living.\u201d He knew his grandchildren. He had named them in the fourth clause of his codicil. These were the persons he particularly had in mind, and he desired they should share equally in the corpus of his estate; that, if any of them died before the termination of the trust created for his children leaving issue, then such issue should represent\u2014that is, take the place of\u2014the grandchild who would have taken if living. The words, \u201cwho shall take the same share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>together, if more than one, which such deceased parent or parents would have taken if living,\u201d when taken in connection with the testamentary scheme of the testator, indicate that he intended to treat the child or children of each grandchild as one class, and to divide the remainder equally among the different classes. Matter of Koogh, 112 App. Div. 414, 98 N. Y. Supp. 433, affirmed 186 N. Y. 544, 79 N. E. 1109; Vincent v. Newhouse, 83 N. Y. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs to each of the respondents who submitted briefs on this appeal, payable out of the estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
