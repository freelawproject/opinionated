The plaintiff\u2019s own evidence shows the facts to be substantially as follows, viz.: Plaintiff is a ladies\u2019 tailor, and defendants are woolen merchants and importers. Either in December, 1905, or February, 1906\u2014for plaintiff is uncertain of the date, while defendants are sure it was in December, 1905\u2014defendants\u2019 salesman said to plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-22\">\u201cI have the best piece of cloth in the market, and I want you to have one, and I will send you one up.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-23\">Plaintiff replied that he had no immediate use for it, but told the said salesman \u201cto send it in, and, if it is good, I will put it away on the table.\u201d A day or two later the cloth was delivered to plaintiff. This cloth was not manufactured by defendants, but imported by them from abroad. Plaintiff paid for the goods in May or June, 1906. The said cloth was placed, upon its delivery to plaintiff, upon the latter\u2019s stock table. Thereafter, but on some date not given, plaintiff\u2019s wife cut off <em>13y2 </em>yards from said piece of cloth. Thereafter, and in August, 1906, plaintiff cut off another <em>1% </em>yards from said roll of cloth. The whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>of the 15 yards of said cloth so cut off were used for plaintiff\u2019s purposes. In September, 1906, for the first time, plaintiff examined the roll itself and found holes in it. He then complained to defendant, and offered to return the remains of said piece of cloth, and demanded the return of the purchase price, which was refused. Thereupon plaintiff brought this action, and recovered a judgment for $84.86 damages, and $14.67 costs. Defendant moved for a new trial, which motion was denied. From said judgment, and order denying the motion for a new trial, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">There is no evidence as to the cause of the holes in the cloth, or the time of the making of the same, except that an expert testified that in his opinion the damage had been done by some machinery in the rolling; but he also stated that it might have been done subsequent to the rolling by some sharp instrument. The proof, therefore, of the damage having been done previous to the delivery of the goods to plaintiff, is extremely slight. The cloth apparently lay on plaintiff\u2019s table from either December or February, until September, before plaintiff discovered the defects, although a very ordinary inspection would have shown the said defects, had they existed at the time of delivery. Defendants claim, without contradiction, that had the defects been discovered, and the cloth returned, within a reasonable time, defendants could have returned it to the house from which they purchased, but that it was too late to do so at the time plaintiff finally made his discovery and complaint. As above stated, defendants yvere not manufacturers of the cloth, and there is no implied warranty of quality or fitness, even as to latent defects, and the defects in question, if there were any, were not latent, but easily discoverable, as we have seen. It can hardly be claimed that there was any express warranty, as the statement of the defendant\u2019s salesman that \u201che had the best piece of cloth in the market\u201d was at best a mere expression of opinion. It is evident that plaintiff so understood it, for he told the salesman \u201cto send it in, and, if it is good, I will put it away on the table.\u201d This implies an intention to examine the cloth, and ascertain whether or not it was good, before \u201cputting it away on the table.\u201d Instead of so examining it, plaintiff put it immediately on his table, subsequently used 15 yards of it, and finally, several months after the delivery of the cloth, examined it.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
