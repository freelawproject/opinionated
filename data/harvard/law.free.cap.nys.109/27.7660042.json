It is true that the defendant\u2019s answer displays a knowledge of certain transactions between itself and the plaintiff. These transactions, as recited in the answer, do not, however, appear to furnish grounds for an action for conversion such as plaintiff now brings. The defendant is therefore entitled to a bill of particulars showing upon what transactions the plaintiff claims that defendant has been guilty of conversion. It is a well-recognized function of a bill of particulars to amplify the complaint and define the issues to be litigated at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted. Settle, order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
