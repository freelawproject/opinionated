From the facts that appeared in the moving papers the plaintiff was entitled to the order; the claim of the defendant being that, as she was executrix of the decedent against whom the claim was presented and had no knowledge of any contract between the plaintiff and her testator, the witnesses that were to be examined were hostile witnesses, and that it was quite impossible for her to frame cross-interrogatories, and she therefore asked that an open commission issue. In view of this condition, the court might well have allowed the defendant to cross-examine the witnesses orally; but such right does not seem to have been asked for, the demand being that the testimony should have all been taken under an open commission, which was not necessary, so far as the direct interrogatories were concerned. It was stated on the argument of this appeal that the commission has been returned duly executed, and it can be ascertained whether the further cross-examination of the witnesses is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">The order should therefore be affirmed, without prejudice to an application by the defendant to the Special Term for leave to issue a new commission to orally cross-examine the witnesses, if it should appear, after an examination of the testimony as taken in the commission returned, that such cross-examination is necessary. No costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
