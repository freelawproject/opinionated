The lease provided that repairs were to be made by Aronowitz. Subsequently this plaintiff acquired title to the premises, and also became entitled to the rent under the lease, and the defendants herein succeeded to Mantel\u2019s rights under the lease. Thereafter these defendants attorned to the plaintiff. After June 1, 1907, repairs became necessary to the premises, and the tenants, made them to the extent of $61 in value. On December 1, 1907, the tenants refused to pay the rent of $65 due for that month, claiming an offset for said repairs to the amount of said $61, tendered the balance of $4 to the plaintiff, who refused the same, and brought this action, claiming $65; the defendants paying $4 into court and counterclaiming for $61 for said repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Two questions only are raised: (1) Does the covenant for repairs contained in the lease bind the plaintiff herein? and (2) can the sum expended by the tenants for repairs be counterclaimed in an action for rent ? The lower court decided these questions in favor of the defendants, and we think correctly so. A covenant for repairs runs with the land. Mott v. Oppenheimer, 135 N. Y. 312, 31 N. E. 1097, 17 L. R. A. 409; In re Coatsworth, 37 App. Div. 295, 55 N. Y. Supp. 753; Choplin on L. &amp; T. 273. The lease contained a covenant whereby the original owner and lessor agreed to make the repairs, and as grantee and assignee of the lease the landlord herein became liable on all covenants which run with the land and create a privity of estate. As to the second question there is no doubt about the right of the tenants to the counterclaim for the amount expended for repairs. Mayor v. Mabie, 13 N. Y. 151, 64 Am. Dec. 538; Ely v. Spiero, 28 App. Div. 485, 51 N. Y. Supp. 124; Kelsey v. Ward, 28 N. Y. 83; Greenwood v. Wetterau (Sup.) 84 N. Y. Supp. 287; section 2244, Code Civ. Proc.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
