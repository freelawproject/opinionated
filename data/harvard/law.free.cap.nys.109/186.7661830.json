The action is brought to set aside a,co-partnership dissolution agreement, on the ground that it was procured by fraud, misrepresentations, and concealments respecting the partnership property. A bill of particulars as to matters pertinent only to the accounting should not now be required. No accounting can be had, unless the plaintiff shall succeed in setting aside the dissolution agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">The defendant is entitled, however, to be furnished with a bill of particulars of the frauds which the plaintiff claims were practiced by the defendant upon the deceased partner to induce him to sign the dissolution agreement, and the acts of mismanagement, concealment, and secret dealings on the part of defendant which it is claimed made the account rendered a false and fraudulent one. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the plaintiff has not precise knowledge of all these, he can state his claim concerning them specifically, and thus properly apprise the defendant as to what he must meet upon the trial. This will be accomplished by requiring plaintiff to give a bill of particulars only as to those matters contained in paragraphs of the order numbered 1, 11, 19, 20, 30, 31, 32, 37 (to the words \u201cthe extent\u201d), 43, 44, 45, 63, 66 (to the words \u201cand the extent\u201d), 73, 74 (to the words \u201ctogether with\u201d), 77, 78, 80, 82, 89, 91, 96, 99, 104, 107, and 108. All the other numbered paragraphs of the order should be stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Even as thus modified, the preparation of the bill of particulars will necessarily occupy much time. The order appealed from allows only 5 days. That should be extended to 15 days from the notice of entry of the order on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The order appealed from should be modified as above stated, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
