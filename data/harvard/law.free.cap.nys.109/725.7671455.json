This changed the date of issue. The time when the last pleading is served determines and fixes the date of issue, and the clerk must place the case upon the calendar according to that date. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 977. Any delay caused by the amendment by reason of the necessity of filing a new note of issue was a proper consideration for the court, when leave was given to the defendants to amend. Ziegler v. Trenkman, 31 App. Div. 305, 52 N. Y. Supp. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">It is suggested that the amended answer was simply an amplification of the original one, and did not change the issue, and therefore there was no necessity for filing a new note of issue. The answer to this suggestion is that, so long as the amended answer remained as the pleading of the defendants who served it, that determined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>date of issue. The date of issue having been changed by such amended answer, the case was improperly upon the day calendar, having been noticed and note of issue filed before the service of such amended answer. The order for a preference therefore should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The order appealed from therefore is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
