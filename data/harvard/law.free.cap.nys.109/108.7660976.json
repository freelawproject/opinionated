J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZj\">The action is for rent for the month of June, 1907, under a written lease for the term of one year, commencing October 1, 1906, and terminating September 30, 1907. The defendant moved out of the premises the last day of May, 1907, having given plaintiff notice of his intention to move in a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>dated May 3, 1907. The defense to the action is a constructive eviction. As the court below found for the defendant, the appellate court will accept the defendant\u2019s version as correct as to disputed questions of fact. It appears that plaintiff\u2019s superintendent was in the habit of listening at the switchboard or at the telephone in her apartment when defendant\u2019s wire was in use, and of making insulting and even slanderous remarks concerning the defendant\u2019s wife to the elevator boys in plaintiff\u2019s employment. For a long time neither defendant nor his wife knew anything of this nefarious procedure on the part of plaintiff\u2019s superintendent. Consequently it cannot be said that the said acts formed the basis for or would justify a finding that the defendant was annoyed or disturbed in his possession at the time these acts were going on. Finally, however, when the elevator boys had been discharged by plaintiff, they informed defendant\u2019s wife of this reprehensible conduct of plaintiff\u2019s superintendent, and thereupon defendant\u2019s wife called on plaintiff and complained to him of the behavior of his said superintendent. There was also some trouble of a minor nature between the superintendent and defendant\u2019s wife, arising from a demand by the former that defendant\u2019s servant use the basement door only in going in and out of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A constructive eviction is something done, by a landlord, or his agents, which deprives a tenant of the full use, benefit, and enjoyment of the demised premises; and such acts of the lessor, or his agents, accompanied by an abandonment of possession by the lessee with reasonable promptitude, is deemed a virtual expulsion of the tenant, and, equally with an actual expulsio'n, precludes the recovery of rent. If the landlord suffers acts to be done which make it necessary for the tenant to remove, or if he permits interference by those acting under his authority which deprives the tenant of the means or power of beneficial enjoyment of the premises, or at least materially impairs such enjoyment, such acts must be considered an eviction. McAdam on Landlord &amp; Tenant, 1393; Tailman v. Murphy, 130 N. Y. 345, 351, 34 N. E. 716; Seigel v. Neary, 38 Misc. Rep. 300, 77 N. Y. Supp. 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Furthermore, the landlord is liable for the misconduct of his agent, when perpetrated by the latter in the course of his employment, even though the landlord did not authorize, justify, or know of the misconduct. McAdam on Landlord &amp; Tenant, 848. But, as before stated, the alleged acts of the superintendent not having been made known to the defendant or his wife personally, or made in their presence or hearing, it cannot be said that the defendant could base an eviction thereon. If, however, after notice to the landlord of the misconduct of his superintendent, the former had permitted the annoyance to continue, he would have been accountable for the acts of the superintendent. But there is no evidence whatever of any continuance of the said misconduct of the superintendent subsequent to the making of the complaint by defendant\u2019s wife to the plaintiff. The inference, therefore, is that such misconduct ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>So far as the question of laches in moving out of the premises is concerned, it may be said that the peculiar circumstances of the case were such that it cannot be said as a matter of law that the defendant lost the right to repudiate the hiring by reason of lack of reasonable promptitude in moving out. The question of reasonable promptitude in removing from the premises was a question of fact, to be determined by the court, sitting as a jury, from all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence, and his decision on that question should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">For the reasons above stated, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">BISCHOFF, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b138-6\">MacEEAN, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"AbS\">Without determining the question of constructive eviction, in this action for rent accruing after vacation by the tenant of the premises leased, by or through acts and conduct of an agent of the plaintiff in interfering with a maid of the defendant and in lending in and out of season a too willing ear at the telephone switchboard, rendering the tenancy, as declared, very unpleasant and annoying, even unbearable, the case is barren of such acts or conduct later than the middle of March, 1907, and, upon hearsay, later than some time, not appearing, in April, when the plaintiff was informed, and, though requested, refused to discharge that agent. Upon the occurrence of circumstances amounting to a constructive eviction, the tenant is put to his prompt election to tolerate what is unwelcome or to remove from the premises. If he does not speedily evince the latter determination, he will be held to have accommodated himself to the former alternative. Retention of the premises until the 25th of May, even upon written notice dated May 3, 1907, by the defendant that he would vacate and surrender on or before the 31st inst., without reason therein, may not, in view of the evidence, be determined to be a prompt election. The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
