The complaint alleges that on the 16th of September, 1906, plaintiff\u2019s intestate was in the employ of the defendant as an electrical worker on the tracks of the defendant at 107th street and Park avenue in the city of New York; that while so engaged the said deceased was run into and upon by locomotives with the cars thereto attached, which cars and locomotives were in the exclusive control and operation of the defendant;_ that the said collision was caused by the careless, negligent, and unlawful acts and omissions of the defendant, its agents and servants, and without any fault on the part of the said deceased which contributed thereto; that, in consequence thereof, the deceased sustained injuries which resulted in his death; and that plaintiff has caused to be served upon the defendant notice of the time, place, and cause of the injuries resulting in the immediate death of the deceased, pursuant to the provisions of the Employer\u2019s Liability Act of 1902, Laws 1902, p. 1748, c. 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-17\">Upon the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that his complaint was drawn on the broad ground of negligence; that the plaintiff elected to try his case as a cause of action for common-law negligence, supported by an amendment to the railroad law, chapter 657, p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906. The defendant objected to any claim under that statute, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the ground that there was no allegation in the complaint setting forth a cause of action under it, and upon the further ground that no notice had been served upon the defendant relating to a cause of action under that statute. The court then held that the plaintiff would have to elect whether he would try the case as a common-law action or whether he would try it under the employer\u2019s liability act, to which counsel for the plaintiff said that he relied upon the common-law theory. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the plaintiff\u2019s trying the case under either of the statutes, the employer\u2019s liability act of 1902 or chapter 657, p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906, and the court directed the counsel to proceed. When the plaintiff rested, defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the complaint, and objected to the claim of the plaintiff on the ground that there was no allegation in the complaint setting forth a cause of action under chapter 657, p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906; that no notice had been served upon the defendant of plaintiff\u2019s intention to rely upon the cause of action given by that act; and, further, upon the ground that when this objection was first raised plaintiff elected to proceed upon the theory of common-law liability, and, the case having proceeded upon that theory, the plaintiff could not recall his election and invoke the aid of chapter 657, p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906. This objection was overruled, and defendant excepted. The court then denied the motion to dismiss the complaint, and defendant excepted. At the end of the whole case the defendant renewed its motion to dismiss the complaint on the general grounds that there was no negligence of the defendant shown; that plaintiff was not free from contributory negligence; and that no cause of action was set forth in the complaint under chapter 657, p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906. The court denied the motion, and defendant excepted. After the court had charged the jury, the defendant requested the court to charge that the jury could not find the defendant liable on the ground that the engineer operating the engine drawing the shop train north on track No. 4 was negligent, which was declined, and to which defendant excepted. And the court was further requested to charge that if the accident occurred through the negligence or omission of the defendant\u2019s engineer running the engine drawing the north-bound shop train on track No. 4, or from the negligence or omission of the watchman to give a signal, that was the negligence of competent fellow servants of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and plaintiff cannot recover; which request was refused, to which defendant excepted. The request to charge that if the jury should find that the accident was owing to the fiegligence or omission of the watchman Connors to give a warning to plaintiff\u2019s intestate, that was the negligence of a fellow servant, and they must find for the defendant, was also declined, and defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the deceased, with a fellow workman, was at work upon track No. 4 of the defendant\u2019s railroad. At this point on the defendant\u2019s road there were four tracks; two for north-bound, and t-wo for south-bound, trains. The northbound trains used the west tracks. An employ\u00e9 working with the deceased left track No. 4 to go on track No. 3, and, on turning around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>and looking at the deceased, saw an engine 10 feet behind him. The man yelled, and the deceased looked towards the engine and then jumped. He had taken about three steps when the engine hit him; that it was the duty of one of the gang of workmen of which the deceased was a member to give signals to notify those working on the track of approaching trains, but this signal was not given; that the deceased was engaged in what was called \u201cbonding\u201d on the third rail of track No. 4; that this required the heating of the rail, which was done with a torch; that it would take the torch three to five minutes to heat the bond material before deceased could work at it; that the deceased stood with one foot upon the e^st rail, watching the third rail, when this train came up behind and struck him. Another man at work on the track just below the deceased saw the engine about four blocks out of the tunnel, and saw it strike the deceased; that the whistle did not blow before the deceased was struck, nor did the watchman whose duty it was to warn persons upon the track give any notice of the approach of the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">It is clear that but for the act of 1906 there would be no cause of action. The deceased was employed to work upon a track upon which trains were constantly passing. The danger of working upon such a track was apparent, and he was liable to be fun over by passing trains if he remained constantly on the track without watching. To protect him, the defendant provided a watchman whose duty it was to give notice of the approach of trains. The deceased had a helper who could easily have watched for trains while the deceased was at work; but at the time of this accident he was engaged in catching the string of a kite and not attending to his duties. The watchman whose duty it was to give notice of the approach of trains appears to have been on duty at the time and in his proper place, and the defendant thus performed its duty to the deceased in providing a proper watchman to give notice of the approach of trains. There was, therefore, no evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, unless an additional liability is imposed by the provisions of this act of 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The first question presented, therefore, is whether, to sustain a recovery under the provisions of this amendment of 1906, it is necessary to allege a cause of action under it in the complaint. The charge in the complaint is a general charge of negligence, and the liability charged against the defendant is based upon a collision caused by the negligent, careless, and unlawful acts and omissions of the defendant, its agents and servants. Section 42a of the Railroad Law, Laws 1890, p. 1082, c. 565, as amended by chapter <em>657, </em>p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201cIn all actions against a railroad! corporation * * * for personal injury to or death resulting from personal injury of any person, while in the employment of such corporation, or receiver, arising from the negligence of such corporation or of any of its or his officers or employees, every employee, or his legal representatives, shall have the same rights and remedies for an injury, or for death, suffered by him, from the act or omission of such corporation or receiver or of its or his officers or employees, as are now allowed by law, and in addition to the liability now existing by law, it shall be held in such actions that persons engaged in the service of any railroad corporation, foreign or domestic, doing business in this state, or in the. service of a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u25a0ceiver thereof, who are intrusted by such corporation or receiver with the authority of superintendence, control or command of other persons in the employment of such corporation or receiver, or with the authority to direct or <em>'\u25a0control </em>any other employee in the performance of the duty of such employee, who have, as a part of their duty, for the time being, physical control or direction of the movement of a signal, switch, locomotive engine, car, train or telegraph office, are vice-principals of such corporation or receiver, and are \u2022not fellow servants of such injured or deceased employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">If this act applies, I think there is a cause of action, as the man \u2022employed to give signals of the approach of trains would be a person in the employ of the defendant who had the \u201ccontrol or direction oi a movement of a signal.\u201d He would be the person placed by the defendant in control of a signal to give notice to its employ\u00e9s of the approach of trains, and the lives of the employ\u00e9s upon the track would depend upon the careful performance of this duty. But for the provisions of this section, the watchman was a fellow workman -of the deceased, and for his negligence the defendant would not be liable, and if the engineer was at fault, he also would be a fellow workman. The question of the liability of the defendant depends upon whether this statute gives a new cause of action which must be pleaded. The statute, in terms, imposes an additional or enlarged liability. It provides that in all actions against a railroad corporation' for personal injuries to an employ\u00e9, such employ\u00e9 shall have \u201cthe same rights and remedies for an injury, or for death, suffered by liim, from the act or omission of such corporation or receiver or of its or his officers or employ\u00e9s, as are now allowed by law, and, in addition to the liability now existing by law, it shall be held in such actions\u201d that certain persons specified are not fellow servants of the injured or deceased employ\u00e9. But the liability which is imposed is not to be enforced by a separate action, but that, \u201cin addition to the liability now existing by law, it shall be held in such actions\"\u2014namely, in actions brought to enforce the liability of a railroad corporation to its employ\u00e9 who has been injured or killed while in the service of the railroad corporation. There is no notice required to be given to the employer of an intention to hold the employer liable under this provision of the statute as there is in the employer\u2019s liability act \u2022of 1902. It seems to me that the effect of this provision is that a \u25a0certain rule of law by which certain employ\u00e9s of an employer were deemed fellow servants should not be applicable to railroad corporations, but such employ\u00e9s should be what the statute calls \u201cvice principals,\u201d or employ\u00e9s for whose negligence the master should be liable. The employer\u2019s liability act (chapter 600, p. 1748, of the Laws of 1902). expressly provides that no action for a recovery under the act could be maintained unless notice of the time, place, and cause of the injury is given to the employer. In Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 178 N. Y. 147, 70 N. E. 411, the Court of Appeals held that the employer\u2019s liability act gave an additional cause of action in that it prescribes that the master should be liable for the negligence of a superintendent or any person acting as such. But as no notice is required to be given to maintain an action to enforce a liability, created by the act \u25a0of 1906\u2014as the facts alleged in this complaint are sufficient to bring the plaintiff within the liability created by that act, and as it is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>public statute which does not have to be pleaded\u2014I cannot see why it is necessary to allege that the defendant is liable under its provisions. All that is required is that the complaint should contain a concise statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, and this complaint certainly complies with this provision. It seems to me that the complaint was sufficient to justify a recovery based upon the negligence of those employ\u00e9s of the defendant whose negligence caused the injury. If the defendant had wished to know which fellow servants had been negligent, or what the acts of negligence were, it should have applied either for a bill of particulars or to make the complaint' more definite and certain. The deceased was not guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. He was entitled to rely to some extent upon the fact that a watchman had been employed to warn him of the approach of trains or that the engineer would give him some notice of his approach. He was engaged in watching his work, and it was a question for the jury as to whether or not he did all that was required to protect himself. The defendant also contended that chapter 657, p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906, violates article 14, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution of the United States, but I think it is clearly a matter of state control.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The judgment and order should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">PATTERSON, P. J., and SCOTT, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b461-6\">McLAUGHLIN, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Agc\">The recovery is sought to be sustained under chapter 657, p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906, but, as I construe the complaint, that is not the cause of action alleged, nor is it the theory upon which the action was tried and submitted to the jury. There is not a reference in the complaint to chapter 657, p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906, or any facts set forth indicating that the action is brought under that statute, and at the beginning of the trial the plaintiff\u2019s attorney elected to try the action as one td recover under the common law, and the case was submitted to the jury upon this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 178 N. Y. 147, 70 N. E. 411, the court held that the employer\u2019s liability act (chapter 600, p. 1748, Laws 1902) gave an additional cause of action, in that it prescribed that the master should be liable for the negligence of a superintendent or a person acting as such. The act of 1906 gave an additional cause of action by extending the liability of the master beyond that imposed at common law and by the employer\u2019s liability act. The act expressly recites that it creates a liability for certain acts \u201cin addition to the liability now existing by law,\u201d and declares that persons who are intrusted with the authority of superintendence, control, or command of other persons, or who have, as a part of their duty, physical control or direction of the movement of a signal, switch, locomotive, engine, car, train, or telegraph office, are vice principals, and are not fellow servants of the injured or deceased employ\u00e9. By this act two classes of employ\u00e9s are declared to represent the master: (a) Those who exercise superintendence or have authority to direct or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>trol any other employe; and (b) those who have physical control or direction of some of the appliances for the movement of cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Where a recovery is sought under the employer\u2019s liability act (chapter 600, p. 1748, Laws 1902), the .complaint must show, by appropriate allegations, that the action is brought under that statute (Sutherland v. Ammann, 112 App. Div. 332, 98 N. Y. Supp. 574) ; and the same is true where a recovery is sought under chapter 657, p. 1682, of the Laws of 1906. Where the right to maintain an action depends upon a statute, the plaintiff must, by an appropriate pleading, bring the action within the terms and conditions of the statute (Lewis v. Howe, 174 N. Y. 340, 66 N. E. 975, 1101) ; in other words, the complaint must clearly and unmistakably indicate, either by a reference to the statute itself or by alleging certain facts, that the action is brought under the statute. The purpose of a complaint is to notify the person against whom a recovery is sought of the precise ground upon which that recovery is claimed. This purpose would be thwarted if a party could allege one cause of action and then recover upon another, or set forth general allegations entitling one to recover at common law and then recover under a statute. It is true a pleading is to be liberally construed, but this presupposes, in case of a complaint, that the plaintiff has complied with the statute by setting forth in his complaint a plain and concise statement of the facts constituting his cause of action, and, if a material statement is susceptible of two meanings, the one most unfavorable to the pleader must be taken. Clark v. Dillon, 97 N. Y. 370. It is no answer to these suggestions, as it seems to me, to say that if the defendant wished to know which fellow servant had been negligent it should have applied for a bill of particulars or. to make the complaint more definite and certain. It had a right to assume, inasmuch as no reference was made to the act of 1906, or any facts pleaded indicating that a recovery was claimed under that act, that the action was not brought to recover under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">For these reasons, I am unable to concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice INGRAHAM. I am of the opinion the judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">CLARICE, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
