A former employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff was a witness for the defendant, and the plaintiff was permitted to testify in rebuttal that he upbraided him for misappropriation of funds and brutally beating a boy in discharging him therefor. It is always relevant and material for a party to prove any fact from which it may be found that a witness of the other side is hostile to or biased against him. People v. Brooks, 131 N. Y. 321, 30 N. E. 189; Garnsey v. Rhodes, 138 N. Y. 461, 34 N. E. 199; Lamb v. Lamb, 146 N. Y. 317, 41 N. E. 26; Brink v. Stratton, 176 N. Y. 150, 68 N. E. 148, 63 L. R. A. 182. It is not a collateral but a material and relevant matter, and the denial of the witness on cross-examination is therefore not conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-17\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-18\">\u2022 Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
