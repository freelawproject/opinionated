Lamb against Henry M. Willis. From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-15\">The complaint is that \u201cthe defendant, by his agents and servants, entered into and upon the plaintiff\u2019s said premises\u201d and cut down and carried away the said timber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-16\">The evidence was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-17\">In February, 1905, the defendant sold the standing timber on his woodland to one Christ by a simple contract. In the following May the defendant conveyed the said land to the plaintiff by a full covenant warranty deed, which was at once recorded. Afterwards Christ entered on the land and cut down part of the timber and took it away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-18\">The defendant did not notify Christ that he had sold the land, and the latter did not know of that fact when he entered, etc., nor did the defendant inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the plaintiff nor did she have knowledge when he conveyed to her that he had sold the timber to Christ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-4\">The learned trial judge granted a nonsuit.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b104-5\">Argued before JENKS, HOOKER, RICH, MILLER, and GAYNOR, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-6\">John J.

If after conveying to the plaintiff the defendant had sold the timber to Christ the case would be different. Wall v. Osborn, 12 Wend. 40. But as it is the defendant did nothing after he conveyed to the plaintiff and put her in possession to authorize the trespass. The subsequent entry of Christ cannot be made the act of the defendant through his bill of sale to Christ. It creates no privity between the plaintiff and the defendant, nor does the defendant\u2019s breach of his contract with Christ.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Judgment affirmed, with, costs.
