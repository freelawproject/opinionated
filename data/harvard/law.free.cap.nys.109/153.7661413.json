At best, a party was produced who was willing to negotiate for a change of the terms, so far as they related to the presence of a mortgage shortly maturing, and no real transaction was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">The justice properly exercised his discretion favorably to the motion to set aside the verdict, and the order granting a new trial is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
