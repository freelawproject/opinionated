This particular stock was purchased on the recommendation of the defendants\u2019 manager, with whom the plaintiff dealt. Within a week, and without any notice to the plaintiff or demand for more margin, the defendants sold the stock at 33%, and a few weeks later the price of the stock rose to 33%. This action was brought to recover the loss of profits consequent upon the unauthorized sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">The relation between the defendants and their customer was that of pledgees and pledgor, and the sale by a broker of pledged stock without demand and notice is a conversion. Markham v. Jaudon, 41 N. Y. 235; Baker v. Drake, 66 N. Y. 518, 23 Am. Rep: 80; Gruman v. Smith, 81 N. Y. 25; Gillett v. Whiting, 120 N. Y. 402, 24 N. E. 790; Content v. Banner, 184 N. Y. 121, 76 N. E. 913. In the case last cited, Willard Bartlett, J., says (page 124 of 184 N. Y., page 913 of 76 N. E.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-10\">\u201cUnder the contract arising by operation of law out of the relation between the parties a sale of the stock by the brokers, without notice of the time and place of sale, constituted a conversion, in the absence of an agreement dispensing with such notice or providing for otherwise disposing of the pledged property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">The pledgees are liable for the damages sustained by the pledgor as a result of the conversion of the pledge. Gruman v. Smith, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">It follows that the dismissal of the complaint was error, which demands a reversal of the judgment; and a new trial should be granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
