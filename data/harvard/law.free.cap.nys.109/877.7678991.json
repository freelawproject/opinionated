The answer is a general denial. The jury found for defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Defendant signed a card in Finck\u2019s office, which he claims he signed at Finck\u2019s request, without knowing what it contained. The card reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-8\">Read this before signing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-9\">John Finck,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-10\">Mortgages and Real Estate,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-11\">39 West 42nd Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-12\">Telephones | \u00ae\u00aeg j- Bryant. New York, 7/15/07.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-13\">John Finck, Esq.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-14\">39 West 42nd Street, City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-15\">Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-16\">I hereby authorize you to accept on my behalf a second mortgage of $2,000 each at 6% for two years covering my property 426-428 E. 121 St. subject to a first mortgage of $6000 at 4% due Emigrant Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-17\">I further agree to pay fifteen per cent, of the loan, disbursements and recording tax (which shall include, when required, the regular charge of any Title Insurance Company for a policy of Title Insurance, survey and appraisal fee).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-18\">This authorization is to remain in force sixty days from this date or at any time thereafter until this contract is revoked by me in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-19\">Truly yours, Joseph Dillon ID. S.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-20\">Address 850 6th Ave., cor. 48th St.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-21\">I have read this Contract before signing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-22\">Defendant subsequently, after refusing the offer of Mr. McConihe to make' the loan at 6 per cent, obtained a loan from another party at 4% per cent. There -is no dispute that Finck procured McConihe, and that the latter was able and willing to make the loans in accordance with the terms of the above-quoted paper. Defendant offers evidence tending to show fraud on the part of Finck in obtaining defendant\u2019s signature to this paper. This testimony was inadmissible under the answer. Finck v. Schmitt, 48 Misc. Rep. 504, 96 N. Y. Supp. 197; Beadleston &amp; Woerz v. Furrer, 102 App. Div. 546, 92 N. Y. Supp. 879; Milbank v. Jones, 127 N. Y. 370, 28 N. E. 31, 24 Am. St. Rep. 454; Cohen v. Miller, 46 Misc. Rep. 107, 91 N. Y. Supp. 345. Plaintiff sufficiently raised objection to this line of evidence at the trial, and it was not necessary to keep continually repeating his objection to each question. Schutz v.
