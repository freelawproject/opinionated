Here the matter of necessity was sought to be established by nothing beyond the inference to be drawn from the fact that the debtor\u2019s monthly salary was $233.33, and that he maintained a home for a wife and two children, who were dependent upon him, in the city of New York. This, in our view, was not enough to justify the exemption, and there was apparently no question as to the fact that on November 1st (the date of the third party order) the debtor\u2019s salary for the month of October was due and payable. Matter of Trustees, etc., v. Harshu, 22 Misc. Rep. 645, 50 N. Y. Supp. 171. It may well be that, upon the submission of further proof as to the details of the debtor\u2019s necessary expenditures for his family, the exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>tion can be thoroughly justified; but upon these papers the order made is without support.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice to the merits of a new application upon further proof.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
