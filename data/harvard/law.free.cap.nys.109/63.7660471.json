Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-16\">The action is in ejectment. The plaintiffs are the heirs at law of their father, John Murphy, who left a will devising his property as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-17\">\u201cAfter all my lawful debts are paid and discharged, I give, devise and bequeath to Ann Murphy my wife for her industry and good management of our domestic affairs all my property both real and personal of all and every kind wherever the same may be and all and every kind of interest claim or demand which I now have or may hereafter have or may arise after my decease and I desire that my said wife at my decease shall take my place and shall have the right to sell and dispose of all or any of my real or personal estate as she may deem proper and for the best interest of our children and lastly if anything is left, it is my desire that she shall divide the same between our children as she in her good judgment may consider just and fair.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-18\">The said wife left a will devising the land in question to the defendant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b91-19\">Argued before JENKS, HOOKER, RICH, MILLER, and GAYNOR, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-20\">W.

It is in clear terms, and the later words do not cut it down. They could not do so unless they manifest that clear intention. It would not suffice that they raise a doubt on the question. The later words of the right of the wife to sell \u201cas she may deem proper and for the best interests of the children,\u201d do not reduce her estate to one for life or make her the trustee of the children. The expression of the testator\u2019s wish that if anything be left that she shall divide it among the children does not annex a condition to the devise that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the devisee do not dispose of the property by deed of conveyance it shall go to the children on her death. The words fall much short thereof. Campbell v. Beaumont, 91 N. Y. 466; Banzer v. Banzer, 156 N. Y. 429, 51 N. E. 291; Foose v. Whitmore, 82 N. Y. 405, 37 Am. Rep. 572; Post v. Moore, 181 N.
