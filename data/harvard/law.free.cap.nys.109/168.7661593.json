Case, individually and as trustee, against Sarah Cecile Beloe, as executrix of Charles R. Porterfield, deceased, and others. From an order denying a motion to modify the judgment for defendant against plaintiff, by striking therefrom an allowance of $2,000 and costs of $233.35 made to plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, defendant Sarah Cecile Beloe, as executrix, appeals.

The latter did not object to the form of the judgment, nor did any of the many other defendants, and the appellant is the representative of one who received from the plaintiff many thousands of dollars more than the latter should have paid him under the trust deed. The referee allowed the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys $500, but found that $2,000 in addition would have been a proper credit to allow the trustee for his attorneys, if it had been paid. The allowance objected to enables this $2,000 to be paid. It was a matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">The order denying the motion to modify the judgment should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
