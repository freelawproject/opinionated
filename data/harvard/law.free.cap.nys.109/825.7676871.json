Prior to his discharge he signed receipts having printed thereon in small type the words, \u201cIt is understood that I am engaged by the week only,\u201d but he offered no testimony to explain these receipts. The learned trial judge, in charging the jury, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-15\">\u201cThe mere fact that the receipts contain a clause in regard to the employment being limited to one week does not bind the plaintiff, unless such clause was called to his attention, or unless it is shown by the evidence that the plaintiff read the clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">This was excepted to. Defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge that \u201cin the absence of proof to the contrary it is to be presumed that the plaintiff knew what he was signing.\u201d The court said: \u201cI will leave that to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">The language charged constituted error. Prima facie, plaintiff was bound by the language of the receipt. He had the right to explain his act in signing it, but did not do so. The jury, therefore, had no evidence dehors the receipts, and the presumption that the plaintiff knew what he was signing, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, was a matter of law for the court. True, the defendant testified that he hired \u201cthe first and second gang for the season and gave them the same receipt\u201d; but the complaint alleges the specified employment of the plaintiff for a definite period. The answer is a general denial. What defendant did with \u201cthe gang\u201d was therefore, outside the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
