The relief demanded is that any transfer to the defendants of trust stock belonging to plaintiff be set aside, and said stock be redelivered to plaintiff, and that pending the action the defendants be' enjoined from holding any stockholders\u2019 meeting or from voting upon said stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">This complaint alleges a transfer by plaintiff of certain of his stock to Jester in trust for the benefit of the company, and the gravamen of his complaint is, or at least he attempts to allege, a diversion by Jester of the stock held in' trust for purposes other than those for which it was transferred. In other words, the plaintiff, the creator of the trust, for the benefit of the company, the cestui que trust, alleges that the trustee has violated the terms of the trust, and therefore demands that the trust be abrogated, and his contribution thereto be restored to him. This relief he certainly is not entitled to. The agreement to create the trust was fully executed, and it is not alleged that any fraud was committed against plaintiff to induce him to contribute his stock to the trust fund or pool. So far as the plaintiff was concerned the transaction was complete. Thereafter the company became the cestui que trust, owning the beneficial interest in the deposited stock and its proceeds, and the right to enforce the trust agreement, or to call the trustee to account for any diversion or misapplication of this fund rested primarily in the company, or in all the stockholders, if the company refused to proceed, but the plaintiff, as a contributor to the fund, shows no sufficient reason for rescinding his agreement to contribute to the fund and have his stock back. And it is only in his capacity as a contributor seeking to rescind the trust agreement that he sues. He does not undertake to sue on behalf of the company to enforce the trust. He does not sue in his own behalf, and in behalf of other stockholders similarly situated, nor does he allege that any demand has been made upon the company that it sue, or that such demand would necessarily be futile. It is not at all clear that the complaint even shows that the trustee has violated the trust agreement. The stock was deposited with him for sale; and it is nowhere alleged that he has not sold for value whatever stock he has disposed of. The complaint does not clearly state that McIntyre contributed stock to the pool, although it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>read as so alleging, and both appellants and respondent assume upon the briefs that he did so contribute, and that the complaint so alleges. If so, he is certainly a necessary party to the action, for he has a distinct interest in the question whether or not the trust agreement shall be abrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The judgment appealed from must be reversed, with costs and disbursements to each appellant, and the separate demurrers sustained with costs to each defendant-appellant, with leave to the plaintiff to amend his complaint within <em>20 </em>days upon payment of costs in this court and the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">INGRAHAM, McLAUGHLIN, and CLARKE, JJ., concur. HOUGHTON, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
