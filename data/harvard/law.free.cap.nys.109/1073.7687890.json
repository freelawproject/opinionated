When the case was here before it was reversed on a finding of fact that the material never went into or was not used in the construction of the vessel, although purchased and delivered for that purpose. 110 App. Div. 72, 96 N. Y. Supp. 1061; 184 N. Y. 568, 77 N. E. 9. On the present trial it was found that the material \u201cwas used in or toward the construction\" of the vessel, and that finding is sufficiently supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">The words of the lien law (section 30, c. 418, p. 526, Laws 1897) are that a lien may.be had \u201cfor work done or material or other articles furnished in this state for or towards the building, repairing, fitting, furnishing or equipping of such vessel.\" It is objected that the finding of fact is equivocal, and therefore finds nothing, in that it finds that the material was used \u201cin or toward\u201d the construction of the vessel, which, it is claimed, is not a finding that it was \u201cused in\u201d such construction. This argument is based on the motion that each of the two words \u201cin\u201d and \u201ctoward,\u201d as used in the finding, or \u201cfor\u201d and \u201ctowards,\u201d as used in the statute, means something different. But it is not so; the phrase in the finding, like that in the statute, which it substantially 'followed, is tautological.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">Section 32 provides that a \u201cdebt\u201d shall cease to be a lien upon a vessel unless a notice of lien be filed by the lienor within 30 days after such debt \u201cis contracted.\u201d The debt here was contracted November 14, 1903, and the lien was filed within 30 days thereafter, viz., December 2, 1903. By the subsequent part of the said section the notice of lien is required to contain \u201ca statement of the amount claimed to be due.\u201d In this case a credit of 30 days was given, so that the debt did not become due and payable until after the lien was filed, viz., on December 15th. It is therefore argued that as the lien was filed before the debt was due, and therefore could not truthfully state the amount claimed to be due, as there was nothing then due, it was prematurely filed, and therefore did not continue the lien of the debt. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>the previous requirement that the notice of lien be filed within 30 days after the debt is \u201ccontracted\u201d must govern. By subsequently requiring the lienor to state the amount claimed to be \u201cdue,\u201d that word was not used in the sense of payable, or due and payable; it was not meant to require the postponement of the filing of notice of lien until within 30 days after the debt became due and payable. The effect of giving credit is only to postpone the beginning of a proceeding to enforce the lien, not the time, of filing the notice of lien. Mott v. Lansing, 57 N. Y. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
