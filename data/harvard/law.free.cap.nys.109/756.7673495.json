The only question raised by this appeal, which requires discussion, it whether the title to the premises in question was so defective as to justify the plaintiff in refusing it. The alleged defect in the title consists in the fact that the deed of the property to the defendant was dated the 26th day of June, 1900, and the subscribing witness put the date \u201cJune 27, 1900,\u201d under his name. The acknowledgment to the deed is by the subscribing witness, who swears, in his acknowledgment, that \u201csaid subscribing witness was present and saw her [grantor] execute the same; and that he, said witness, thereupon subscribed his name as witness thereto.\u201d The revenue stamps upon the deed were canceled June 26, 1900, and the deed was recorded September 9, 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">The respondents claim that the discrepancy between the date of the deed and the date under the signature of the subscribing witness justified the rejection of the title by them. This contention seems to be based upon section 242 of the Real Property Law (Laws 1896, p. 607, c. 547), which declares that proof by a subscribing witness can be made only by some person, other than a party to the instrument, who wa's a witness of its execution and at the same time subscribed his name to the conveyance as a witness. The discrepancy as to date does not show that the subscribing witness did not sign \u201cat the same time\u201d that he witnessed its execution, and the acknowledgment is affirmative proof that he did. We think that there was no defect in the title shown to exist, and that the plaintiffs were not justified in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
