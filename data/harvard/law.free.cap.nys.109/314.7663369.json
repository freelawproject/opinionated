The amount claimed in the complaint was $9,450, with interest from December 7, 1900. A trial of the action resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The foreman of the jury, in announcing the verdict, said, \u201cWe find in favor of the plaintiffs for the full amount claimed, with interest,\u201d whereupon the learned trial justice said, \u201cBy full amount you mean the amount sued for in the complaint, which is $9,450?\u201d and the foreman of the jury answered, \u201cWe do,\u201d repeating the amount, and thereupon the clerk, in recording the verdict, said: \u201cGentlemen of the jury, hearken to your verdict as it stands recorded. You say you find in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant for the sum of $9,450; and so say you all?\u201d To which statement no dissent was made. The clerk then made the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>entry in his minutes: \u201cThe court charges the jury, who say that they find a verdict for the plaintiffs for $9,450\u201d\u2014and the jury was thereupon discharged. A few days thereafter the clerk, at the request of counsel for the plaintiffs, without consultation with the court and in the absence of any representative of the defendant, changed the verdict as recorded by adding thereto the words \u201cwith interest.\u201d Thereafter defendant moved to strike out the words thus inserted. The motion was granted, and plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The papers used upon the motion showed, in addition to the foregoing facts, which were stipulated, that the minutes of the stenographer at the trial contained the following: \u201cAfter deliberation the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $9,450, with interest.\u201d Tl.e affidavits of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and the foreman of the jury are also to the effect that the verdict was in favor of the plaintiffs \u201cfor the full amount claimed, with interest.\u201d The motion was properly granted. The clerk had no authority to change his minutes at the instance of one party, without the knowledge of the court or the other party. The change was material. If the verdict included interest on the amount found due the plaintiffs from the date for which interest was claimed in the complaint, the recovery was increased several thousand dollars. When the jury had announced its verdict, the clerk had entered it in his minutes, and the jur)r had been discharged, the verdict could not be changed by the clerk. The trial had terminated. Warner v. N. Y. C. R. R. Co., 52 N. Y. 437,11 Am. Rep. 724; Lee v. McLaughlin, 16 Civ. Pro. Rep. 151, 4 N. Y. Supp. 742; Herzberg v. Murray, 8 Jones &amp; Spencer, 271; Isbell-Porter Co. v. Braker, 120 App. Div. 384, 105 N. Y. Supp. 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">To permit an alteration of the clerk\u2019s minutes, which increases or diminishes a liability, as this alteration does, after the jury has been discharged, might lead to great abuses. Not only this, but the learned justice who presided at the trial, as appears from his opinion, does not entertain the view that the verdict as rendered by the jury included interest. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u201cIt has been my invariable practice, upon the coming in of a verdict, where the jury allow interest, to have the interest computed then and there, so that the jury may finally pronounce a verdict for a precise sum, which would include the interest.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">But it is said the words inserted did not change the legal effect of the verdict; that the plaintiffs were entitled as a matter of right to interest, the amount of which required only computation. The answer to this suggestion is that the trial court, after listening to the evidence, as also appears from his opinion, reached the conclusion that the plaintiffs were not entitled to interest on the verdict, and the evidence is not before us. Nor do I see, if the words which the clerk inserted in his minutes had not been stricken out, how a computation of interest could be made with any degree of accuracy. There is nothing to indicate from what date interest is to be computed. The complaint claims interest from a certain day; but can it be inferred, because the jury said \u201cwith interest,\u201d that it had that date in mind ? I do not think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>In either view, therefore, it seems to me the court properly granted the motion, and the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
