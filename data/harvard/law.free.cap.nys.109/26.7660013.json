As remarked Woodruff, J., in 1855:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">\u201cWe are very reluctant to interfere with a judgment of the court below when it rests upon a finding of facts on controverted evidence; but when * * * it is rendered against positive evidence, uncontradicted and unexplained by counter proofs, we are constrained to conclude that the judgment is rendered under some misapprehension respecting the rules of law by which the rights of the parties are controlled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
