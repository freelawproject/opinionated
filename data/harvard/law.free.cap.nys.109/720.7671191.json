Defendant testified that he had paid out more than $15,000 under his agreement; but on March 13, 1907, he wrote to plaintiff\u2019s attorney as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b748-19\">\u201cMr. Goldsmith writes me that you have been given the claim of George Griot and Regulus Cigar Co. for collection. Let me say that both were notified to present their bills at No. 63 last Tuesday and get their money. Every other creditor received theirs, except Mr. Fischer\u2019s friend, Fusy Bros.,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-20\">In view of this letter, it'would seem that defendant could not well claim that plaintiff\u2019s demand was not within the $15,000 he had agreed to pay, or at least he ought to have submitted testimony to show in detail the payment by him of bona fide debts of Fischer &amp; Flannery in excess of $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-21\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
