The answer is a general denial. The plaintiff recovered a verdict for $1,242, being the difference between $20 a week for 51 weeks and the guaranty of $500, less the amount admitted to have been earned of $278. From the order denying the motion for a new trial, and from the judgment entered upon the verdict, the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>The plaintiff and the defendant are brothers-in-law. The plaintiff claims that he was an experienced designer in cloaks and suits. He testified that on Sunday evening, the 18th of November, 1906, the defendant and his father came to the plaintiff\u2019s house, No. 139 Second avenue, and had an interview at which the plaintiff\u2019s wife was also present; that the defendant said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">\u201c \u2018Louis, I want you to come to work for me to-morrow. From to-morrow a year you shall work for me as a designer, and I will pay you $20 a week and 5 per cent, of the profit what I will make during the year.\u2019 And so, of course, I said: \u2018What will it amount to, the 5\"per cent, of the profits which you will make during the year?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Louis, I guarantee you at least $500 for yourself, the profits what I will make during the year.\u2019 He said: \u2018It will make at least $30 a week.\u2019 * * * I said: T am satisfied with the terms, but I cannot get to-morrow to work,\u2019 I told him, \u2018first, because I did not give notice to the party I work for, * * * and, the second thing, I did not receive pay yet.\u2019 So he said: \u2018That is nothing. You can go to-morrow to work, to your boss, I mean, and explain that you are going to work for your brother-in-law, and he would not object.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">Here were all the necessary elements of a contract of employment \u2014the offer, the acceptance, the rate of wages, and the term; but being for a year and to commence at a future day, and not being in writing, it would have been void under the statute of frauds. The plaintiff further testified that on the next day, November 19, 1906, he saw the defendant and told him that he had given notice to his boss, that he was going to leave him, and that the defendant said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">\u201c \u2018What did the boss say?\u2019 And I said: \u2018The boss asked me on what conditions I will make for my brother-in-law.\u2019 So I told him: T am going to get a salary and a percentage of the profit what he will make during the year.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">That the defendant then said to him:</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">\u201c \u2018Louis, go to work, of course, from to-day a year, as you work for me as designer, and I pay you $20 a week and 5 per cent, of the profit what I will make during the year, and that I will guarantee you $500 for your share of the profit what I will make during the year, and you will have at least $500, and this will make you at least $30 a week. * * * I said: \u2018All right.\u2019 I started to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">This testimony at once suggests that, if the plaintiff\u2019s story is true that on the previous evening at his house all the terms of the employment had been discussed and agreed upon, no necessity existed for the repetition upon the following Monday of the precise details of every element of the contract in the same language as used on the former occasion. The inference is permissible that the plaintiff had become instructed in the law, and that it was the necessity of the statute which caused the minute recapitulation of the details agreed upon on the night before to be testified to as having been had upon this following morning, in the attempt to establish a contract, as then made, upon the beginning of the term, and hence not required to be in writing. Plaintiff further testified that at the end of that week he was paid, and on the following Monday morning he was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">The defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s wife, and the defendant\u2019s father, the three people that plaintiff testified were present at the conversation on Sunday night, flatly contradict him. They say that a conversation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>took place that night at the father\u2019s house, No. 138 Forsyth street; that in consequence of the importunities of the plaintiff, his parents, and his sister, the defendant promised to give him a chance to show what he could do as a designer, and told him to come on the following Tuesday for a trial; that nothing was said about wages, or a percentage of the profits, or the term of the employment. The defendant testified that he did come on Tuesday, that the plaintiff undertook to design two patterns, that they were both unsatisfactory, that he remained but the one day, and that he was not paid anything for a week\u2019s service. Ginsberg, one of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s, testified that the plaintiff came to the shop on Tuesday only, of his efforts to make patterns, and that the defendant, after these efforts, said: \u201cYou can look for another position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s .story is entirely uncorroborated. He called a former employer to prove that he was a designer. That witness testified that he never had been a designer for him, but had merely been an examiner, and the written recommendation put in evidence by the plaintiff and bearing date December 11, 1905, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-6\">\u201cThe bearer, M. L. Stein, was in our employ since August, 1905, as an examiner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">There is thus presented the uncorroborated story of the plaintiff, inherently improbable, as already pointed out, because of its repetition upon two successive days of each minute detail of the alleged agreement, flatly contradicted in all essential particulars by four witnesses, and in an important collateral matter by a fifth. It is obvious that the verdict was clearly against the great weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">That being so, it follows that the judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
