Not only does it involve the title to the principal administrative office of the city, but it is quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>probable that its decision will turn upon questions of fact. For these reasons, it is proper that it should be tried before a jury specially selected. We consider, however, that an impartial and satisfactory jury can be more surely and speedily obtained by a resort to the special jury panel provided for by chapter 602, p. 1462, of the Laws of 1901, as amended by chapter 458, p. 1147, of the Laws of 1904, than by an attempt to procure a struck jury. Jerome v. New York Evening Journal Pub. Co. (Sup. Feb. 7, 1908) 108 N. Y. Supp. 801. The notice of motion asked for an order for a struck jury, or \u201cfor such other and further relief as to the court may seem just.\u201d It is unnecessary, therefore, to send the case back to the Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">The order appealed from will therefore be modified, without costs, so as to direct that the trial be had before a jury to be drawn from the special jury list. The number of jurors, the time when the drawing shall take place, and the term of the court, and the particular day of the term when such special jury must attend will be fixed by the order to be entered hereon, which must be settled on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
