The defendant\u2019s motion that the complaint be made more definite and, certain, so as to show whether the plaintiff\u2019s assignor is a corporation, and, if so, whether domestic or foreign, and, if the latter, \u201cthe state, country or government\u201d under whose laws it was created, also whether it is a \u201cstock, nonstock, or mixed\u201d corporation, and if the first whether it be a \u201cmoneyed, transportation or business\u201d corporation, was denied below. The motion was purely captious and vexatious. Section 1775 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires a plaintiff corporation to allege in the complaint that it is a corporation, whether it is domestic or foreign, and if the latter, the state or country under whose laws it was created. The plaintiff here is not a corporation. But if we should be willing to assume that it has to allege the status of its corporate assignor in the manner required by the said section, it has done so. The allegation that it is \u201ca Pennsylvania corporation,\u201d shows all that the said section requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ed, i. e., that- it is a corporation, that it is foreign, and the state of its origin. It may well seem strange that our over-burdened courts' are called upon by a learned bar to deal with frivolous questions like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
