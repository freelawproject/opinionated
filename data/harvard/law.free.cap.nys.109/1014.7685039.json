If the notification of death was in writing, it cannot prejudice the plaintiff in any way to give a copy of the writing; nor can it prejudice her to state the particular acts of omission or commission upon which she rests her claim that defendant has waived the requirements of its policy as to the furnishing of proofs of death, and as to the time within which action must be brought. This is not, in any proper sense, requiring the plaintiff to disclose her evidence, but merely .calling upon her to state the particular facts upon which she bases her general assertion of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>The order, in so far as it refuses to order these particulars, must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the defendant\u2019s motion granted in full, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
