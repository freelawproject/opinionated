The defendant\u2019s answer recites a covenant of quiet enjoyment, and alleges that plaintiff, in violation of said covenant, \u201clet and rented other apartments in said premises, and the same were used by the occupants thereof for immoral and illegal purposes, being the resort of bad characters, men and women.\u201d The answer further alleges that defendant notified plaintiff of such immoral and illegal use of said premises, and requested plaintiff to institute the necessary proceedings to evict such disorderly occupants, and \u201cthat plaintiff unlawfully neglected to institute such proceedings, or to cause said persons to be removed therefrom, but, on the contrary,. suffered and permitted said tenants to continue to occupy a portion of said premises for immoral purposes,\u201d and that therefore defendant was evicted. If the allegations set forth in the answer are true, the conduct of the plaintiff in thus permitting the disorderly tenants to remain in the premises has supplied the defendant with a good and sufficient defense.
