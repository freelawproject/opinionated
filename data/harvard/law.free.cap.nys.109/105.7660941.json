The relief demanded is that the defendant be enjoined and restrained from in any way making use of the word \"Sarony,\u201d and taking, making, or vending photographic portraits under any name with the word \u201cSarony\u201d therein'in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>eluded, and from carrying on or doing any photographic business under the name \u201cSarony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">I think this complaint sets forth a good cause of action, based, as it is, upon unfair competition in business. There can be no question, under these facts alleged, but that Napoleon Sarony when he died had established a business to which there was a good will attached, which included the use of the name \u201cSarony,\u201d and which became an asset of his estate. His executor, Otto Sarony, transferred that to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and the estate received, it must be assumed, the value of the use of the name \u201cSarony\u201d as a trade-mark._ The plaintiff, therefore, acquired the property right to use the name \u201cSarony\u201d as a part of his business. It was a right attached to his business which he had purchased, and he is entitled to be protected in the enjoyment of that property as against any one using the name \u201cSarony\u201d without authority. \u2022 The defendant Marceau then procured from the executor of Napoleon Sarony an agreement authorizing him to use the name \u201cSarony\u201d in the business of making photographs. The object of this transaction is perfectly apparent. It was not an attempt of a man to transact business in his own name, or to transfer to another the good will of an established business. Otto Sarony did not intend to go into business using his own name, and defendant Marceau was in the photographic business. Marceau, not satisfied with doing business under his own name, wished to conduct it under the name of \u201cSarony,\u201d and the only object he could have was thus to \"secure some of the business of the plaintiff. The executor of Napoleon Sarony, having got all he could from the plaintiff\u2019s assignor for the use of the name, seemed to have no objection to selling again to another the same right, which would necessarily seriously impair or tend to destroy what he had sold as executor to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor; and the desire of the defendant Marceau to acquire the right to use the name could only be for the purpose of getting away from the plaintiff or his assignor the benefit which had accrued to them by reason of the purchase of the right to use the name of \u201cSarony\u201d as taker or maker of photographic portraits. \u201cSarony\u201d meant nothing except so far as it represented the reputation or skill and artistic merit of the business transacted under that name. It was a fraud if the defendant represented that this company was either the successor of the business and methods established by Napoleon Sarony, or that any member of the Sarony family had any connection with it. It was a fraud upon the plaintiff, in that by the use of the name \u201cSarony\u201d it indicated that the Sarony, who had established the business known to the public as Sarony\u2019s photographic establishment, was connected with.it, and it was a fraud for Otto Sarony to make such an agreement with the defendant Marceau when he had transferred the right to use the name of \u201cSarony\u201d with the business established by Napoleon Sarony, and had received consideration therefor. As I understand it, there is no hard and fast rule by which it can be determined when the court will interfere by injunction to prevent what is practically a fraud upon a person engaged in business by the unfair methods of competition. Each case must depend upon its own facts, but, where it is clearly established that an attempt is being made by one person to get the business of another by any means that in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>volves fraud or- deceit, a court of equity will protect the honest trader and restrain a dishonest one from carrying out his scheme. I think the defendant Marceau is a proper party defendant. He made the contract with Otto Sarony. He organized the company and received substantially all its capital stock, and now, as president of the company, he is actually carrying on the business. It is proper to enjoin him from acting under the agreement that he obtained from Otto Sarony, as well as the company which is also acting under that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">I think, therefore, the judgment should be reversed, with costs, the demurrer overruled, with costs, with leave to the defendant to withdraw the demurrer arid to answer. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
