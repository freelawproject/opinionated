The defendant demurred to the complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court below overruled the demurrer, and from this interlocutory judgment, entered upon that decision, the defendant appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">The plaintiff cannot maintain an action against the defendant to recover damages because of the defendant\u2019s negligence in failing to keep his contract to repair.
