A right of possession was claimed by this appellant through assignments of a lease from the respondent, the owner, to one Elliott; but by a warrant in dispossess proceedings for nonpayment of rent this lease was terminated before the appellant\u2019s occupancy began, and whatever rights he took under th\u00e9 assignment\u2014made without the landlord\u2019s consent and in violation of a covenant of the lease\u2014came to an end. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2253. His paper title, or claim of title, did not protect him, because it amounted to nothing; and, notwithstanding the assertion of an entry under color of title, these proceedings were maintainable. \u2022 O\u2019Donnell v. McIntyre, 41 Hun, 100, reversing 16 Abb. N. C. 84, cited for appellant; 3 McAdam, L. &amp; T. (3d Ed.) p. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-17\">There is nothing to indicate that this defendant\u2019s assumed right of possession was in any way saved from the termination of the lease to Elliott. He (the defendant) was not in possession, and his rights, if any, were subject to immediate defeat through the tenant\u2019s summary removal. Rubenstein v. Rosenthal, 50 Misc. Rep. 313, 98 N .Y. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>681. The fact that Buchler, a predecessor, who was in possession and was disturbed without being made a party to the dispossess proceedings, obtained a favorable order in forcible entry and detainer proceedings, does not strengthen the defendant\u2019s rights, since there was no adjudication of title in Buchler, and the defendant came upon the premises, not as Buchler\u2019s tenant, with the same possession, but independently, as an assignee who took only such an interest as \"could pass by assignment, which Buchler\u2019s bare personal immunity from disturbance, while he remained in possession, was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The final order should be affirmed, with costs.
