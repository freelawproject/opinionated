One link in the complainants\u2019 chain of title is. a sheriff\u2019s deed set out in the bill. This deed was attacked as insufficient by demurrer. The chancellor overruled the demurrer and .permitted an appeal. The chief criticism of the sheriff\u2019s deed is the contention that it fails to show an execution issued and a levy made on the land conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>It has been declared in a number of decisions of this court tbat tbe deed of a sheriff, to be valid, must show .a proper judgment, execution, levy and sale. <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Wheatley, </em>62 Tenn. (3 Baxt.), 160; <em>Harlan </em>v. <em>Harlan, </em>82 Tenn. (14 Lea), 107; <em>Hyder </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>103 Tenn., 289; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Hannah, </em>30 Tenn. (11 Humph.), 122; <em>Lemons </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>65 Tenn. (6 Baxt.), 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In the first three of the cases cited the test was applied to sheriffs\u2019 deeds under consideration. In <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Wheatley </em>the deed held bad. In <em>Harlan </em>v. <em>Harlan </em>and in <em>Hyder </em>v. <em>Butler </em>the deeds were held good.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Hannah </em>the test stated was approved but the deed was held void because made to a person other than the purchaser at the execution sale without any showing of authority from the purchaser. Likewise in <em>Lemons </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>the test was approved but the deed was held bad because of a discrepancy between the deed and recitals of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The foregoing rule merely amounts to this, that the deed of a sheriff must, on its face, show the authority of that official to make such conveyance, tracing the authority back to a judgment or order of court. The deed herein is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201cAgreeable to an Order of Sale directed to me from the Hon. Circuit Court of McNairy County in the cause of W. J. Sipes v. J. F. &amp; R. W. Luttrell, coming to my hands on the 24th day of March, 1887, and after advertising and giving notice as the law directs, I proceeded, as Sheriff of said County, to sell the reversionary interest of B. W. Luttrell in and to the following tract of land, to-wit: A one-fourth (1/4) undivided interest in a tract of land lying and being in the 7th Civil District of Mc-Nairy County, Tennessee, Bounded on the North by B. L. Sanders, on the South by the heirs of Mary Jane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Sanders, on the East by Horner and the heirs of Mary Jane Sanders, on the West by McLuttrell, containing one hundred &amp; fifty acres, more or less. And after having advertised 30 days of the time &amp; place of sale, according to law, and having given the Deft. R. W. Lnttrell due notice, I offered the 1/4 undivided int. of said deft. R. W. Lnttrell for public sale on the 23rd day of April, 1887, at the court house door in the Town of Purdy, agreeably to said advertisement and notice, and W. J. Sipes being the highest and best bidder the same was struck off to him at the price of $116.55. Therefore, in consideration of the premises, I hereby transfer and convey to the said W. J. Sipes and his heirs and assigns forever all of the right, title and interest the said R. W. Lnttrell has in &amp; to said tract of'one hundred &amp; fifty acres for the said consideration of $116.55 to me paid, to have and to hold the same to the. said W. J. Sipes his heirs &amp;c. in as full &amp; ample manner as I as Shff can or ought to convey, but no further or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cIn witness whereof I set my hand &amp; seal Peby 22, 1888.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201cW. M. Brown, Shff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">This instrument was duly acknowledged and recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The language of the deed is: \u201cAgreeable to an Order of Sale directed to me from the Hon. Circuit Court of McNairy County in the cause of W. J. Sipes v. J. F. <em>&amp; </em>R. W. Luttrell, coming to my hands on the 24th day of March, 1887,\u201d etc., etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">This shows a judgment, or order of sale, and it shows that said order of sale was \u201cdirected\u201d to the sheriff. This could mean nothing except that there was a judgment and that the writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>-issued. That writ is nothing but a direction of the court to the sheriff to make the sale as ordered. The deed duly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>cites a sale after advertisement and notice, as the law directs. So that we have in this deed apt reference to judgment, execution and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">In <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Wheatley, </em>in <em>Harlan </em>v. <em>Harlan, </em>and in <em>Hyder </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>there was a money judgment and the writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issued in each case. To authorize a sale of particular property under that writ, a levy must be made on such property and that property brought into the custody of the law. A levy is essential to sale and conveyance under this process and must be set out in the deed of the sheriff by way of exemplifying his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">In the case before us, however, the sale and deed were made under the writ of <em>venditioni exponas. </em>The writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>does not issue unless there has been a previous levy or the land otherwise brought within the custody of the court. An order of sale of particular land is not made until that land has been impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We think the order of sale made by the Circuit Court of McNairy County, in the absence of anything in the record to the contrary, raises a conclusive presumption that a levy had been made on the land. <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>McCorkle, 112 </em>Tenn., 707; <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>Wynns, </em>132 Tenn., 513. We are, therefore, of opinion that the sheriff\u2019s deed before us is sufficient in its recitals. The recitals trace the authority of the sheriff back to an order of court, and that order cannot be questioned by parties or privies thereto except for want of authority appearing in the record itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Another criticism of the deed is one recitation by the sheriff that he proceeded to sell \u201cthe reversionary interest of R. W. Luttrell.\u201d' It is said that R. W. Luttrell had no reversionary interest in the land but a present interest, although undivided. Elsewhere it will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>observed the deed described the interest of it. W. Luttrell offered for sale as \u201ca one-fonrtb (1/4) undivided interest.\u201d Tbe deed undertook to convey to the purchaser \u201call of the right, title and interest\u201d of the said it. W. Luttrell in and to the land. It seems to us that the deed as a whole undertook to convey a present undivided one-fourth interest in the land, certainly all the interest of the judgment debtor, and that the reference to the estate of the judgment debtor as a reversionary interest in one recital of the deed was a mere irregularity which did not affect the validity of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Tbe deed shows that \u201ctbe 1/4 undivided int. of said deft. R. W. Luttrell\u201d was offered for sale \u201cagreeably to said advertisement and notice.\u201d The advertisement and notice having referred to a one-fourth interest, no injustice was done tbe judgment debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Other grounds of demurrer have been considered but do not require discussion. Tbe decree of the Chancellor is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
