The idea itself is not. When applying these two settled rules of law, how can a decisionmaker distinguish between an idea and its expression?</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Answering this riddle is the first step\u2014 but only the first \u2014 toward disposition of this case in which the court must decide, among other issues, (1) whether and to what extent plaintiff\u2019s computer spreadsheet program, Lotus 1-2-3, is copyrightable, (2) whether defendants\u2019 YP-Planner was, on undisputable facts, an infringing work containing elements substantially similar to copyrightable elements of 1-2-3, and (3) whether defendants\u2019 proffered jurisdictional and equitable defenses are meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Phase One of this case was tried to the bench. By agreement of the parties, in Phase One, the court shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">resolve all legal and factual issues concerning the liability, if any, of defendants ... for the claims of copyright infringement brought by plaintiff ... and all defenses thereto, including but not limited to all factual and legal issues concerning the copyrightability of Lotus\u2019 Works [1-2-3, releases 1.0, 1A, and 2.0], and <em>excluding only: </em>(1) issues of fact, if any, requiring jury determination concerning defendants\u2019 alleged copying of any protected expression from Lotus\u2019 Works in Defendants\u2019 Works [VP-Planner and VP-Planner Plus]; [and] (2) factual issues concerning defendants\u2019 possible copying of the source or object code for Lotus\u2019 Works____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Stipulation and Order Regulating Phased Trial, \u00a7 1(A) (Docket No. 246).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">This Opinion sets forth findings of fact and conclusions of law that are central to deciding this controversy. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The court adopts, as additional findings, all proposed findings to which no party objected. <em>See </em>Docket Nos. 250, 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">The outcome of this case depends on how this court, and higher courts on appeal, should answer a central question about the scope of copyrightability of computer programs. For the reasons explained in this Opinion, I conclude that this question must be resolved in favor of the plaintiff, Lotus.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">I. A BACKGROUND STATEMENT ABOUT COMPUTERS, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, AND COPYRIGHT-ABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">Though their influence in our society is already pervasive, digital computers\u2014 along with computer \u201cprograms\u201d and \u201cuser interfaces\u201d \u2014 are relatively new to the market, and newer still to litigation over \u201cworks\u201d protected by intellectual property law.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">Digital computers (hereinafter referred to as \u201ccomputers\u201d) are machines currently used to perform three types of functions electronically: (1) arithmetic calculations; (2) logical operations (e.g., comparing values to determine whether one is larger); and (3) storage and display of the results. Because computers can perform millions of operations of these types in a single second, they can be used to solve problems too complex, or too repetitious and boring, to be solved manually. Developments to the current state of the art have already transformed many areas of business, educational, and recreational activity, and they support speculations about more striking achievements in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>A personal computer system consists of hardware and software. The hardware includes the central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d), which contains the electronic circuits that control the computer and perform the arithmetic and logical functions, the internal memory of the computer (\u201crandom access memory,\u201d or \u201cRAM\u201d), input devices such as a keyboard and mouse, output devices such as a display screen and printer, and storage devices such as hard and floppy disk drives. The software includes one or more computer programs, usually stored magnetically on hard or floppy disks, along with such items as instruction manuals and \u201ctemplates,\u201d which are pieces of plastic that fit around the function keys on the keyboard, identifying the specific functions or commands that can be invoked by those keys. A personal computer system can also include \u201cfirmware,\u201d or \u201cmicrocode\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"AXF\">Microcode is a set of encoded instructions ... that controls the fine details of the execution of one or more primitive functions of a computer. Microcode serves as a substitute for certain elements of the hardware circuitry that had previously controlled that function.</p>\n<p id=\"AdH\">Samuelson, <em>CONTU Revisited: The Case Against Copyright Protection for Computer Programs in Machine-Readable Form, </em>1984 Duke L.J. 663, 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Computer programs are, in general, divided into two types: operating system programs and application programs. Operating system programs \u2014 such as DOS, XE-NIX, and OS/2 \u2014 are programs that control the basic functions of the computer hardware, such as the efficient utilization of memory and the starting and stopping of application programs. Application programs are programs that permit a user to perform some particular task such as word processing, database management, or spreadsheet calculations, or that permit a user to play video games.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">This case concerns two competing application programs \u2014 Lotus 1-2-3 and VP-Planner \u2014 which are primarily spreadsheet programs, but which also support other tasks such as limited database management and graphics creation. Programs such as these, because they can perform several different kinds of tasks, are called \u201cintegrated\u201d application programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Congress has defined \u201ccomputer program\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">A \u201ccomputer program\u201d is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (1988). This \u201cset of statements or instructions,\u201d in its literal or written manifestation, may be in the form of object code or source code. It may also be represented, in a partially literal manifestation, by a flowchart. A copyrightable work designed for use on a computer may include, as well, text that appears, for example, in a problem manual or a manual of instructions. These elements of text, however, ordinarily are not referred to in the industry as part of a \u201ccomputer program\u201d unless they appear on the computer screen and serve a purpose like that of the components of a \u201chelp screen\u201d available to a user whenever needed. Elements of this textual type are not at issue in this phase of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">Computer programs are typically written in some form of computer programming \u201clanguage.\u201d The \u201clowest\u201d-level computer programming language is machine language, which is a binary language written in \u201cbits\u201d (5/nary digiJIS). Each bit is equal to one binary decision \u2014 that is, to the designation of one of two possible and equally likely values, such as an \u201con\u201d-\u201coff\u201d or \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 \u201cno\u201d choice. These binary decisions, the only kind that a typical computer can understand directly, are commonly represented by 0\u2019s and l\u2019s. A sequence of eight bits (which allows 256 unique combinations of bits) is commonly called a \u201cbyte\u201d (\u201cby eight\u201d), and 1024 bytes form a \u201ckilobyte\u201d (commonly referred to as \u201cK,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>sixty-four kilobytes is \u201c64K\u201d). Machine language may also be represented in hexadecimal form, rather than in binary form, by the characters 0-9 and A-F, where \u201cA\u201d represents 10, \u201cB\u201d represents 11, and so on through \u201cF,\u201d which represents \u201c15.\u201d In hexadecimal machine language, only two rather than eight characters are required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>to allow for 256 unique combinations <em>{e.g., </em>37 instead of 00110111, each of which represents the 55th of 256 combinations; 7B instead of 01111011, each of which represents the 123rd of 256 combinations; EA instead of 11101010, each of which represents the 234th of 256 combinations). The computer is able to translate these hexadecimal instructions into binary form. Other versions of machine language are represented in decimal (0-9) and octal (0-7) form.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">An object program, or object code, is a program written in machine language that can be executed directly by the computer\u2019s CPU without need for translation. For example, in the machine language of a certain computer, the instructions to divide the value in \u201cB\u201d by the value in \u201cC\u201d and add that number to the value in \u201cA\u201d may be represented by the following sequence of instructions (in binary form):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">0010000000010001; 1000000011010010; 1101000000010000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">An \u201cintermediate\u201d-level programming language is assembly language. Rather than in bits, assembly code is written in simple symbolic names, or alphanumeric symbols, more easily understandable by human programmers. For example, the calculation described above may be represented, in the assembly language of a certain computer, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">LOAD B; DIY C; ADD A.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Because of the primitive nature of assembly language, even relatively simple computations can require long and complex programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">During the early period of computing, \u201cprogrammers\u201d ordinarily wrote programs exclusively in machine language. Today, object code is rarely written directly by computer programmers. Rather, modern programmers typically write computer programs in a \u201chigher\u201d-level programming language. These programs are called source programs, or source code. Although \u201csource code\u201d has been defined far more broadly in some of the literature in the field, and in some of the expert testimony in this case, more commonly the term \u201csource code\u201d refers to a computer program written in some programming language \u2014 such as FORTRAN <em>{FOR </em>mula TbANslation), COBOL <em>{CO </em>mmon business <em>O </em>riented <em>L </em>anguage), Pascal, BASIC, or C \u2014 that uses complex symbolic names, along with complex rules of syntax. In a typical higher-level programming language, for example, the above-described computation \u2014 that is, (A) + (B/C) \u2014 might be represented as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">A + B/C.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">Unlike machine language, which is unique to each kind of CPU and which is executed directly by the computer, source code programming languages are universal to almost all computers. As a consequence, source code is executed indirectly. Thus, a program written in source code must be translated into the appropriate object code for execution in one type of computer, and into a different object code for execution in another type of computer. The translation can be effectuated by an \u201cinterpreter\u201d program or by a \u201ccompiler\u201d program. An \u201cinterpreter\u201d program is a simultaneous translator that works in conjunction with the application program every time the application program is run, carrying out the instructions of the program one step at a time. In contrast, a \u201ccompiler\u201d program translates the program once and for all nto machine language, after which the translated program can be executed directly by the CPU without the need for any further resort to the compiler. A distinctive \u201cinterpreter\u201d or \u201ccompiler\u201d program is available for each type of source code programming language and each type of CPU.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">A partly literal and partly pictorial manifestation of a computer program, still farther removed from direct use with the computer, is the flowchart. A flowchart is a graphic representation of a computer program that is written in symbols, rather than in bits or symbolic names, and with a syntax that is graphic rather than grammatical. <em>See, e.g., </em>Breyer, <em>The Uneasy Case for Copyright: A Study of Copyright in Books, Photocopies, and Computer Programs, </em>84 Harv.L.Rev. 281, 341 n. 235 (1970) (providing simple flowchart). A flowchart can be thought of as a kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>symbolic outline or schematic representation of a computer program\u2019s logic, which is written by a programmer once he or she has a conceptualization of the goals of the program. Creating a flowchart (at least, an early draft) is thus, typically, an early phase in the development of a software system, which is followed by the translation of the flowchart into source code. <em>See </em>Menell, <em>An Analysis of the Scope of Copyright Protection for Application Programs, </em>41 Stan.L.Rev. 1045, 1051 (1989) (identifying five stages in the development of most application programs: (1) defining the desired task; (2) flowcharting; (3) encoding; (4) debugging; and (5) preparing documentation). On computers and computer programs in general, <em>see </em>Lewis Affidavit, HU 18-42 (Docket No. 274); Galler Declaration, \u00b6\u00b61 8-20 (Docket No. 257); A. Clapes, <em>Software, Copyright &amp; Competition: The \u201cLook and Feel\u2019\u2019 of the Law </em>47-64 (1989); R. Bradbeer, P. DeBono &amp; P. Laurie, <em>The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Computers </em>(1982); <em>McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms </em>(3d ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The parties agree, as a general proposition, that literal manifestations of a computer program \u2014 including both source code and object code \u2014 if original, are copyrightable. <em>Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman, </em>669 F.2d 852, 855 n. 3 (2d Cir.1982) (\u201cwritten computer programs are copyrightable as literary works\u201d); <em>Williams Electronics Inc. v. Artie International, Inc., </em>685 F.2d 870, 876-77 (3d Cir.1982) (object code copyrightable); <em>Hubco Data Products, Corp. v. Management Assistance Inc., </em>219 U.S.P.Q. 450, 454 (D.Id.1983) (same); <em>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., </em>714 F.2d 1240, 1243 (3d Cir.1983) (source and object code copyrightable), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>464 U.S. 1033, 104 S.Ct. 690, 79 L.Ed.2d 158 (1984); <em>GCA Corp. v. Chance, </em>217 U.S.P.Q. 718, 720 (N.D.Cal.1982) (same); <em>Midway Manufacturing Co. v. Strohon, </em>564 F.Supp. 741, 750 (N.D.Ill.1983) (same); <em>Digital Communications Associates, Inc. v. Softklone Distributing Corp., </em>659 F.Supp. 449, 454 (N.D.Ga.1987) (same). Also, it appears that flowcharts, if sufficiently detailed and original, are entitled to copyright protection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">Flowcharts ... are works of authorship in which copyright subsists, provided they are the product of sufficient intellectual labor to surpass the \u201cinsufficient intellectual labor hurdle\u201d____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works, <em>Final Report and Recommendations </em>43 (1978) (hereinafter <em>\u201cFinal Report\u201d), reprinted in </em>5 <em>Copyright, Congress and Technology: The Public Record </em>(N. Henry, ed.1980), <em>cited with approval in Whelan Associates, Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Laboratory, Inc., </em>797 F.2d 1222, 1241 (3d Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1031, 107 S.Ct. 877, 93 L.Ed.2d 831 (1987). <em>See also Synercom Technology, Inc. v. University Computing Co., </em>462 F.Supp. 1003, 1013 n. 5 (N.D.Tex.1978) (although taking a very narrow view of the scope of copyrightability of nonliteral elements of computer programs, court nevertheless noted in <em>obiter dictum </em>that \u201cit would probably be a violation to take a detailed description of a particular problem solution, such as a flowchart ... and program such a description in computer language\u201d) (Higginbotham, J.); <em>Data Cash Systems, Inc. v. JS &amp; A Group, Inc., </em>480 F.Supp. 1063, 1067 n. 4 (N.D.Ill.1979) (holding that copyright protection extends \u201cto computer programs in their flow chart, source and assembly phases but not in their object phase,\u201d court concluded that computer program written in object code was not copyrightable), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>628 F.2d 1038 (7th Cir.1980) (program at issue not copyrightable because publication without notice forfeited any copyright protection); <em>Williams v. Arndt, </em>626 F.Supp. 571, 578 (D.Mass.1985) (violation to take detailed prose description and program such description in source code).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Defendants vigorously dispute, however, the copyrightability of any nonliteral elements of computer programs. That is, defendants assert that only literal manifestations of computer programs are copyrightable. Plaintiff, on the other hand, maintains that copyright protection extends to all elements of computer programs that embody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>original expression, whether literal or non-literal, including any original expression embodied in a program\u2019s \u201cuser interface.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMX\">One difficulty with plaintiff\u2019s argument is the amorphous nature of \u201cnonliteral\u201d elements of computer programs. Unlike the written code of a program or a flowchart that can be printed on paper, nonliteral elements \u2014 including such elements as the overall organization of a program, the structure of a program\u2019s command system, and the presentation of information on the screen \u2014 may be less tangibly represented. Whether these elements are copyrightable, and if so, how the nonliteral elements that are copyrightable may be identified, are central to deciding this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">II. CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS</p>\n<p id=\"AIt\">In considering the legal issues relevant to whether nonliteral elements of Lotus 1-2-3 are copyrightable, and if so, to what extent, one may appropriately begin with a provision of the Constitution of the United States:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science ... by securing for limited Time to Authors ... the exclusive Right to their ... Writings ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8. The copyright law, codified in Title 17 of the United States Code, rests upon this explicit grant of legislative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Under this constitutional mandate, Congress has broad though not unlimited authority to grant copyright monopolies as needed to promote progress. If Congress were to determine, for example, that copyright protection is unnecessary to \u201cpromote the Progress of\u201d computer programming\u2014 because, for example, in Congress\u2019 view the financial incentives alone of developing new computer programs (without the added benefit of copyright) are enough to encourage innovation, or because incremental innovation might be stifled by expansive copyright protection \u2014 then Congress could, without offending the Constitution, provide no copyright protection for computer programs. At the other extreme, were Congress to find that strong copyright protection is necessary to promote the progress of computer programming, Congress could provide for expansive copyright protection for all aspects of computer programs, again without having strayed beyond the bounds of the constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Because the constitutional grant of power authorizes Congress to take either path \u2014 or to chart some middle course \u2014 this case does not raise constitutional issues. Rather, the issues at stake here are issues of statutory meaning. The central question is not whether Congress could render nonliteral elements such as those of 1-2-3 copyrightable, but whether it has done so. <em>Banks v.

The Statutory Language and the History of Amendments</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">a. <em>Pre-1976 Legislation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The First Congress extended copyright protection to \u201cany map, chart, book or books already printed.\u201d Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, \u00a7 1, 1 Stat. 124, 124 (repealed 1831). Congress quickly expanded this limited scope of copyright protection, adding designs, prints, etchings and engravings in 1802, \u201cmusical composition\u201d in 1831, \u201cdramatic composition\u201d in 1856, \u201cphotographs and the negatives thereof\u201d in 1865, and \u201cstatuary\u201d and \u201cmodels or designs intended to be perfected as works of the fine arts\u201d in 1870.

Rather, Congress used this phrase to extend copyright to new methods of expression as they evolve:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">The history of copyright law has been one of gradual expansion in the types of works accorded protection, and the subject matter affected has fallen into two general categories. In the first, scientific discoveries and technological developments have made possible new forms of creative expression that never existed before. In some of these cases the new expressive forms \u2014 electronic music, filmstrips, and <em>computer programs, </em>for example \u2014 could be regarded as an extension of copyrightable subject matter Congress had already intended to protect, and were thus considered copyrightable from the outset without need of new legislation. In other cases, such as photographs, sound recordings, and motion pictures, statutory enactment was deemed necessary to give them full recognition as copyrightable works.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">Authors are continually finding new ways of expressing themselves, but it is impossible to foresee the forms that these new expressive methods will take.

Most relevant to this case is the following limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any <em>idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, </em>regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) (1988) (emphasis added). Noting that this section applies to computer programs, the House Report declares: \u201cSection 102(b) is intended, among other things, to make clear that the <em>expression </em>adopted by the programmer is the copyrightable element in a computer program, and that the actual <em>processes or methods </em>embodied in the program are not within the scope of the copyright law.\u201d <em>House Report </em>at 57, <em>reprinted at </em>5670 (emphasis added);, <em>see also id. </em>at 54, <em>reprinted at </em>5667 (computer programs are copyrightable only \u201cto the extent that they incorporate authorship in the programmer\u2019s <em>expression </em>of original ideas, as distinguished from the <em>ideas </em>themselves\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">c. <em>CONTU and the 1980 Amendments</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3\">Most contemporaneous observers expected that the bill that eventually became the Copyright Act of 1976 would apply to computer programs. Toward the end of the twenty-year process of reconsidering the copyright law, however, Congress recognized that certain problems raised by computer and other new technologies were not adequately addressed in the pending bill. <em>See </em>House Report at 116, <em>reprinted at </em>5731. Accordingly, in 1974, Congress created the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (\u201cCONTU\u201d). Congress gave the Commission the following mandate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">(b) The purpose of the Commission is to study and compile data on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">(1) the reproduction and use of copyrighted works of authorship\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">(A) in \u2018 conjunction with automatic systems capable of storing, processing, retrieving, and transferring information ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">(c) The Commission shall make recommendations as to such changes in copyright law or procedures that may be necessary to assure for such purposes ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>cess to copyrighted works, and to provide recognition of the rights of copyright owners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Act of Dec. 31, 1974, Pub.L. 93-573, \u00a7 201(b)-(c), 88 Stat. 1873, 1873-74 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">It took seven months after enactment of the bill to constitute the Commission and appoint the Commissioners. Because of this delay, CONTU did not begin its deliberations until October 1975, and did not release its report and recommendations until July 1978, almost two years after the passage of the 1976 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">CONTU observed a need for copyright protection of creative expression embodied in computer programs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">The cost of developing computer programs is far greater than the cost of their duplication. Consequently, computer programs ... are likely to be disseminated only if ... [t]he creator can spread its costs over multiple copies of the work with some form of protection against unauthorized duplication of the work____ The Commission is, therefore satisfied that some form of protection is necessary to encourage the creation and broad distribution of computer programs in a competitive market, ... [and] that the continued availability of copyright protection for computer programs is desirable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT\">CONTU, <em>Final Report </em>at 20-21. Concluding, however, that the Act of 1976 already provided adequate protection, CONTU did not propose any statutory changes with respect to <em>copyrightability </em>of computer programs. On the other hand, CONTU did propose two amendments with respect to <em>permissible copying </em>of computer programs. These proposed amendments were subsequently adopted by Congress with only minor modifications and with little additional legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">First, tracking verbatim CONTU\u2019s recommendation, Congress amended section 101 to include the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">A \u201ccomputer program\u201d is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Act of Dec. 12, 1980, Pub.L. 96-517, 94 Stat. 3015, 3028 (codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101). Second, Congress also followed CONTU\u2019s recommendation by amending section 117 to allow the owner of a computer program to make additional copies or adaptations of the program:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 [which grants the copyright owner the exclusive rights to reproduce the copyrighted work], it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">(1) that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-15\">(2) that such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes only and that all archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-16\">Any exact copies prepared in accordance with the provisions of this section may be leased, sold, or otherwise transferred, along with the copy from which such copies were prepared, only as part of the lease, sale, or other transfer of all rights in the program. Adaptations so prepared may be transferred only with the authorization of the copyright owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alm0\"><em>Id. </em>(codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 117).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">Finally, although the Commission did not address explicitly the central issue of the present case \u2014 whether copyright protection extends to the nonliteral elements of computer programs at issue here \u2014 CONTU did re-emphasize, for purposes of copyright-ability of computer programs, the fundamental distinction between copyrightable expression on the one hand, and noncopyrightable methods, processes and ideas on the other. <em>Id. </em>at 37-46. Indeed, although his personal views are entitled to very little if any weight in the context of the court\u2019s determination of the statutory mandates, <em>Whelan, </em>797 F.2d at 1241, n. 37, it is interesting to note that Melville Nimmer, Vice-Chairperson of CONTU, testified about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Commission\u2019s intent, in <em>Evergreen Consulting v. NCR Comten, Inc., </em>No. 82-5946-KN (C.D.Cal. filed 1982). According to Nimmer, CONTU understood that the proposed repeal of former section 117 would extend copyright protection to nonliteral elements of computer programs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqe\">CONTU had no views, and made no recommendations which would negate the availability of copyright protection for the detailed design, structure and flow of a [computer] program under the copyright principles that make copyright protection available, in appropriate circumstances, for the structure and flow of a novel, a play or a motion picture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvG\">Nimmer Deck in <em>Evergreen Consulting, </em>\u00b6 28, <em>reprinted in </em>Note, <em>Idea, Process, or Protected Expression?: Determining the Scope of Copyright Protection of the Structure of Computer Programs, </em>88 Mich.L.Rev. 866, 889 (1990). <em>But cf. </em>conflicting views of Commissioner Arthur Miller and Executive Director Arthur Levine, discussed in <em>id. </em>at 888-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">3. Relevant Aspects of the Whole Law of Copyright</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">a. <em>\u201cNonliteral\u201d Expression</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">With respect to such things as musical, dramatic, and motion picture works, and works of \u201cliterature\u201d (as contrasted with \u201cliterary\u201d works in the broader statutory sense, <em>see </em>Samuelson, <em>Reflections on the State of American Software Copyright Law and the Perils of Teaching It, </em>13 Colum.-VLA J.L. &amp; Arts 61, 65 n. 15 (1988)), it is crystal clear that, to the extent original, the literal manifestations of such works are protected by copyright. Thus, during a period of copyright protection, one cannot copy an author\u2019s book, score, or script without authorization in law or in fact. It is also well settled that a copyright in a musical, dramatic, or motion picture work, or a work of literature, may be infringed even if the infringer has not copied the literal aspects of the work. That is, even if an infringer does not copy the words or dialogue of a book or play, or the score of a musical work, infringement may be found if there is copying of the work\u2019s expression of setting, characters, or plot</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">with a resulting substantial similarity. <em>Nichols v.

Macmillan, Inc., </em>789 F.2d 157, 162 (2d Cir.1986) (copy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>right in choreography for <em>The Nutcracker </em>ballet may be infringed by a book of photographs of the ballet if the series of photographs is substantially similar to the ballet). <em>See also Stewart v.

This type of copying of nonliteral expression, if sufficiently extensive, has never been upheld as permissible copying; rather, it has always been viewed as copying of elements of an expression of creative originality.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">b. <em>\u201cUseful Articles\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">A \u201cuseful article\u201d is defined by the Copyright Act as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZR\">an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information. An article that is normally a part of a useful article is considered a \u201cuseful article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (1988). Such articles \u2014 or more- accurately, the utilitarian aspects of such articles \u2014 are not works of authorship in which copyright can subsist. House Report at 55, <em>reprinted at </em>5668. However:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIS\">[T]he design of a useful article ... shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work [which <em>is </em>copyrightable] ... if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable <em>pf </em>existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (1988) (defining \u201cpictorial, graphic, and sculptural works\u201d). Put more broadly, the point is that .those elements of a useful article that can exist independently of the utilitarian aspects of the article are potentially copyrightable because those elements are elements of <em>expression </em>that can be distinguished from the utilitarian functions of the article. <em>See Whelan, </em>797 F.2d at 1236 (\u201cthe purpose or function of a utilitarian work [is] the work\u2019s idea, and everything that is not necessary-to that purpose or function [is] part of the expression of the idea\u201d); <em>Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Bally Manufacturing Corp., </em>568 F.Supp. 1274, 1279-80 (N.D.Ill.1983) (Congress intended to exclude from copyright protection functional elements of work, leaving only those aspects of work separable from utilitarian aspects copyrightable).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">4. The Objects and Policies of Copyright Law</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">The court\u2019s final task in divining the statutory mandates is to look to the \u201cobject and policy\u201d of the copyright law. <em>Kelly, </em>479 U.S. at 43, 107 S.Ct. at 358. This inquiry has received heightened attention in this case <em>{see </em>Part VII, <em>infra) </em>because defendants contend that extending copyright protection to nonliteral elements of computer programs is contrary to the objects and policies of copyright law as expressed in the copyright statute and in precedents. Although, of course, disputing defendants\u2019 conclusion, plaintiff does not contest the premise of this contention\u2014 that in construing the manifested meaning of the Copyright Act, the court is directed to look to the \u201cobject and policy\u201d of the copyright law.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Copyright monopolies are not granted for the purpose of rewarding authors. Rather, Congress has granted copyright monopolies to serve the public welfare by encouraging authors (broadly defined) to generate new ideas and disclose them to the public, being free to do so in any uniquely expressed way they may choose. <em>Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, </em>471 U.S. 539, 546, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 2223, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). As the Supreme Court has concluded, \u201cencouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through talents of authors and inventors in \u2018Science and useful Arts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mazer v. Stein, </em>347 U.S. 201, 219, 74 S.Ct. 460, 471, 98 L.Ed. 630 <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>347 U.S. 949, 74 S.Ct. 637, 98 L.Ed. 1096 (1954). <em>See also Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., </em>464 U.S. 417, 432, 104 S.Ct. 774, 783, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (\u201c \u2018The immediate effect of our .copyright law is to secure a fair return for an \u201cauthor\u2019s\u201d creative labor. But the ultimate aim is, by this incentive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.\u2019 \u201d) <em>(quoting Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, </em>422 U.S. 151, 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040, 2043, 45 L.Ed.2d 84 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">In construing the relevant statutory mandates, the court must be faithful to the statutory language and mindful of both the ultimate goal of copyright law \u2014 the advancement of public welfare \u2014 and Congress\u2019 chosen method of achieving this goal \u2014 private reward to the individual author. Courts should not draw the line between copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of computer programs in such a way as to harm the public welfare, nor should courts ignore the accommodation struck by Congress in choosing to advance the public welfare by rewarding authors. These mandates leave courts with a delicate task:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">Drawing the line too liberally in favor of copyright protection would bestow strong monopolies over specific applications upon the first to write programs performing those applications and would thereby inhibit other creators from developing improved products. Drawing the line too conservatively would allow programmer\u2019s efforts to be copied easily, thus discouraging the creation of all but modest incremental advances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Menell, <em>Scope of Copyright Protection for Programs, </em>41 Stan.L.Rev. at 1047-48. <em>See also </em>Note, <em>Scope of Copyright Protection of Computer Program Structure, </em>88 Mich. L.Rev. at 895; Note, <em>Defining the Scope of Copyright Protection for Computer Software, </em>38 Stan.L.Rev. 497, 498 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Rather than itself drawing the boundary line between copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of computer programs, Congress has mandated that courts use an evaluative standard in determining this boundary line \u2014 that is, a standard that distinguishes idea from expression and requires that a court, in applying this distinction, be sensitive to the object and policy of copyright law as manifested by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">When statutes establish evaluative standards for deciding cases, courts \u2014 by necessity \u2014 must locate boundaries in unchartered terrain, using the markers that Congress has placed. At some places a boundary may run straight as a surveyor\u2019s sight-line between markers; at others, it may meander like a stream, moving toward resolution of clashing objects and policies the markers identify. No marker Congress has placed may be disregarded or relocated by courts. Even in those instances where text and context make clear that literal description of a marker is contrary to manifested meaning (as where \u201cnot\u201d must be inserted or deleted to make sense of the statutory language) what the court is doing is aptly described as \u201clocating,\u201d not \u201crelocating,\u201d the marker Congress mandated. The fewer the markers Congress has placed, the more critical it becomes that courts assure that no marker escapes notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">\n<em>B. The Idea-Expression and Useful-Expressive Distinctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">Although the statutory mandates are ambiguous in some critical respects, one point on which they are clear (one marker of the boundary line) is this: at least some, but clearly not all, aspects of computer programs, if original, are \u201cworks of authorship\u201d in which copyright can subsist. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)(1); House Report at 54, reprinted at 5667; CONTU, <em>Final Report </em>at 21. How can a court determine which aspects are copyrightable?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">The interplay between sections 102(a) and 102(b), illumined by the related legislative history, manifests that the statute extends copyright protection to expressive elements of computer programs, but not to the ideas, processes, and methods embodied in computer programs. House Report at 54, 57, <em>reprinted at </em>5667, 5670. This dichotomy \u2014 which is often referred to as the \u201cidea-expression distinction,\u201d and which embraces also the process-expression, method-expression, and useful-expressive distinctions, <em>see </em>Note, <em>Determining the Scope of Copyright Protection of Computer Program Structure, </em>88 Mich.L. Rev. at 866-67 \u2014 has long been a fundamental part of our copyright law. <em>Baker v. Selden, </em>101 U.S. 99, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>In that seminal case, the Court held that the text of a book describing a special method of double-entry accounting on paper spreadsheets \u2014 the now almost universal T-accounts system \u2014 was copyrightable <em>expression, </em>but that the method itself, which embodied the <em>idea </em>of this particular kind of double-entry bookkeeping, was not. The Court thus concluded that Baker did not infringe Selden\u2019s copyright when Baker wrote his own treatise, in his own words, describing the special double-entry method of bookkeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">CONTU, too, concluded that the idea-expression distinction should be used to determine which aspects of computer programs are copyrightable. CONTU, <em>Final Report </em>at 37-46. The Commission recognized, though, that \u201c[i]t is difficult, either as a matter of legal interpretation or technological determination, to draw the line between the copyrightable element of style and expression in a computer program and the process which underlies it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">CONTU, of course, was not an official voice of Congress, and its views are not, without more, attributable to Congress. Thus, courts must not treat the CONTU report as legislative history, in the ordinary sense, much less as an authoritative statement about manifested legislative intent. <em>Whelan, </em>797 F.2d at 1241-42. The privately held views of Vice-Chairperson Nimmer and Commissioner Miller, and especially the privately held views of Executive Director Levine, <em>see </em>declarations in <em>Evergreen Consulting, </em>without some manifestation of congressional endorsement, are even less relevant to the determination of manifested congressional intent. <em>Id. </em>at 1241 n. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Congress, however, did not ignore CON-TU. Indeed, as already noted, Congress adopted practically verbatim the Commission\u2019s proposed statutory changes with respect to computer programs. Thus, the expressed views of the Commission, to the extent not repudiated by Congress, may help to explain the context in which Congress acted, which in turn may support inferences about the meaning of any otherwise ambiguous passages in what Congress declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">I conclude that, with the Copyright Act of 1976 and the 1980 amendments to that Act, Congress manifested an intention to use the idea-expression distinction as part of the test of copyrightability for computer programs. That is, rather than adopting some other test of copyrightability that made the idea-expression dichotomy irrelevant (such as defendants\u2019 proposed literalnonliteral distinction), Congress chose to extend copyright protection to original expression embodied in computer programs, but not to any idea, method, or process described by that expression. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(a), 102(b); House Report at 54, 57, <em>reprinted at </em>5667, 5670.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">That conclusion is consistent with the treatment of other kinds of intellectual works \u2014 specifically, with the treatment of nonliteral elements of expression in musical, dramatic, and motion picture works, and works of literature. It is also consistent with the treatment of useful articles. That is, as explained more fully in Part IV(A), <em>infra, </em>I conclude that the user interface and some other nonliteral aspects of computer programs are <em>not merely </em>articles \u201chaving an intrinsic utilitarian function.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (defining \u201cuseful article\u201d). When computer programs include elements \u2014 both literal and nonliteral \u2014 \u201cthat can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article,\u201d <em>id. </em>(defining \u201cpictorial, graphic, and sculptural works\u201d), they are potentially copyrightable.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Finally, this conclusion is also consistent with the objects and policies of copyright\u2014 to encourage the creation and dissemination of new <em>ideas </em>by protecting, for limited times, the specific way that an author has <em>expressed </em>those ideas.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">IV. THE LEGAL TEST FOR COPYRIGHTABILITY APPLICABLE TO THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">\n<em>A. Functionality, Useful Articles, and \u25a0 the Useful-Expressive Distinction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Defendants suggest that the user interface of Lotus 1-2-3 is a useful, \u201cfunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tion[al]\u201d object like the functional layout of gears in an \u201cH\u201d pattern on a standard transmission, the functional assignment of letters to keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard, and the functional configuration of controls on a musical instrument <em>{e.g., </em>keys of a piano). Lewis Affdvt. 1111 52-54. These \u201cfunctional\u201d \u201cuseful articles,\u201d defendants contend, are not entitled to copyright protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">A similar analogy was made in <em>Synercom </em>where the court concluded that a sequence of data inputs for a statistical analysis program was like the \u201cfigure-H\u201d pattern of a standard transmission. 462 F.Supp. at 1013. <em>Synercom, </em>though, was published less than a month after the publication of the CONTU report (which it never cites) and well before the 1980 amendments. Since then, congressional and judicial development of the law of copyright-ability of computer programs has advanced considerably, and <em>Synercom\u2019s </em>central proposition \u2014 that the expression of nonliteral sequence and order is inseparable from the idea and accordingly is not copyrightable\u2014 has been explicitly rejected by several courts. <em>E.g., Whelan, </em>797 F.2d at 1240, 1248 (\u201ccopyright protection of computer programs may extend beyond the programs\u2019 literal code to their structure, sequence, and organization\u201d); <em>Broderbund Software, Inc. v. Unison World, Inc., </em>648 F.Supp. 1127, 1133 (N.D.Cal.1986) (\u201ccopyright protection is not limited to the literal aspects of a computer program, but rather ... it extends to the overall structure of a program, including its audiovisual displays\u201d). Moreover, even those courts that have not gone as far as <em>Whelan </em>and <em>Broderbund </em>have still gone much farther in protecting computer programs than <em>Synercom. E.g., SAS Institute, Inc. v. S &amp; H Computer Systems, Inc., </em>605 F.Supp. 816, 830 (M.D.Tenn.1985) (\u201ccopying of the organization and structural details\u201d can form basis for infringement); <em>Manufacturers Technologies, Inc. v. CAMS, Inc., </em>706 F.Supp. 984, 993 (D.Conn.1989) (\u201cscreen displays or user interface\u201d copyrightable); <em>Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Phoenix Control Systems, Inc., </em>886 F.2d 1173, 1175 (9th Cir.1989) (nonliteral aspects such as \u201cstrueture, sequence and/or organization of the program, the user interface, and the function, or purpose, of the program,\u201d are copyrightable to the extent that they embody expression rather than idea); <em>Telemarketing Resources v. Symantec Corp., </em>12 U.S.P.Q.2d 1991, 1993, 1989 WL 200350 (N.D.Cal.1989) (holding that \u201c[cjopyright protection applies to the user interface, or overall structure and organization of a computer program, including its audiovisual displays, or screen \u2018look and feel,\u2019 \u201d but finding no infringement in this case); <em>Q-Co. Industries v. Hoffman, </em>625 F.Supp. 608, 615-16 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (similarity of \u201cstructure and arrangement\u201d can form basis of infringement suit, but here, structural similarities were dictated by functional considerations and hence were non-copyrightable ideas rather than copyrightable expression); <em>Pearl Systems, Inc. v. Competition Electronics, Inc., </em>8 U.S.P.Q.2d 1520, 1524, 1988 WL 146047 (S.D.Fla.1988) (\u201cCopyright protection of computer software is not limited to the text of the source or object code\u201d). <em>But see Softklone, </em>659 F.Supp. at 455, 465 (rejecting <em>Broderbund\u2019s </em>conclusion that audiovisual screen displays are copyrightable, although holding that separate copyright on status screen display was infringed where \u201ctotal concept and feel\u201d was copied); <em>Plains Cotton Cooperative Association v. Goodpasture Computer Service, Inc., </em>807 F.2d 1256, 1262 (rejecting <em>Whelan\u2019s </em>protection for structure, sequence, and organization, court instead held that sequence and organization, where dictated by market forces, is non-copyrightable idea rather than copyrightable expression), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>813 F.2d 407 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 821, 108 S.Ct. 80, 98 L.Ed.2d 42 (1987). In any event, <em>Synercom\u2019s </em>input formats are quite different from, and distinguishable from, the nonliteral aspects of 1-2-3 at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Defendant\u2019s proposed analogy is also similar to the analogy drawn by Commissioner Hersey between a computer program and an object that is designated to do work \u2014 for example, the cam of a drill. CONTU, <em>Final Report </em>at 58-60 (Hersey, C., dissenting). His view, however, was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>dissent, and not a view advanced by CON-TU. Because Congress adopted CONTU\u2019s recommendations practically verbatim, it is reasonable to infer that Congress did not adopt Commissioner Hersey\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Moreover, I conclude that defendants\u2019 contentions, to the extent they are similar to <em>Synercom\u2019s </em>central proposition and to Commissioner Hersey\u2019s views in dissent, are inconsistent with the legislative history and statutory mandates explained above. If, in a context such as that of <em>Synercom </em>or of this case, an idea and its expression were taken to be inseparable and the expression therefore not copyrightable, copyright law never would, as a practical matter, provide computer programs with protection as substantial as Congress has mandated \u2014 protection designed to extend to original elements' of expression however embodied. I credit the testimony of expert witnesses that the bulk of the creative work is in the conceptualization of a computer program and its user interface, rather than in its encoding, and that creating a suitable user interface is a more difficult intellectual task, requiring greater creativity, originality, and insight, than converting the user interface design into instructions to the machine. <em>See </em>Galler Decl. Ml 37, 39; Emery Decl. Ml 22, 25-28 (Docket No. 265); Reed Decl. MI 26-27 (Docket No. 290). Defendants\u2019 contentions would attribute to the statute a purpose to protect only a narrowly defined segment of the creative development of computer programs, and to preclude from protection even more significant creative elements of the process. Such a result is fundamentally inconsistent with the statutory mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Also, defendants\u2019 contention would have the additional consequence that computer programmers would have little, if any, more protection for nonliteral elements of expression embodied in their original works of authorship than is already provided by trade secret law. If the intellectual effort and creativity embodied in a user interface were protectable only by trade secret law, the length of protection for computer programs would be very short \u2014 merely the time it takes to examine a program and then duplicate the nonliteral elements in a newly written computer program. This short period of protection is fundamentally inconsistent with the mandates of the copyright law.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Defendants have advanced their \u201cuseful article\u201d (or \u201cfunctionality\u201d) argument in many forms. Never, however, have they stated every premise that is a step of the reasoning implicit in the argument. One set of unstated premises is the assumed meanings of \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201carticle,\u201d and \u201cuseful article.\u201d Indeed, different forms of their argument have depended on different assumed meanings for one or more of these three terms. Some illustrations will clarify this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Suppose, first, the form of the argument is this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">A \u201cuseful article\u201d is not copyrightable; a \u201ccomputer program\u201d is an \u201carticle,\u201d and a good \u201ccomputer program\u201d is \u201cuseful\u201d; therefore, a good \u201ccomputer program\u201d is not copyrightable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">In this illustration, \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201carticle,\u201d and \u201cuseful article\u201d are assumed to have meanings consistent with ordinary usage (with an exception to be noted below). The proposition that emerges when the words are interpreted in this way is, of course, plainly contrary to congressional mandates. Congress must have had some purpose in defining \u201ccomputer program\u201d and declaring that an \u201cowner of a copy of a computer program\u201d may make additional copies, in specified circumstances, without violating copyright laws. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101, 117. The clear implication of the 1980 amendments is that in some circumstances, at least, a good computer program <em>is </em>copyrightable. Otherwise, there would have been no need for Congress to enact these two provisions about a \u201ccomputer program\u201d and additional \u201ccopies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">It follows that, for this defense argument to make any sense and also be consistent with congressional mandates, defendants must be proposing that \u201cuseful\u201d, or \u201carticle,\u201d or \u201cuseful article,\u201d or all three, be interpreted in some sense different from their ordinary meanings. In what sense, though, they never say.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Suppose, second, a different form of the argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">A \u201cuseful article\u201d is not copyrightable; a \u201cscreen display\u201d is an \u201carticle,\u201d and a good \u201cscreen display\u201d is \u201cuseful\u201d; therefore, a good \u201cscreen display\u201d is not copyrightable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Here, the implicit meaning of \u201carticle\u201d is being stretched beyond ordinary usage to apply to what one would ordinarily think of as just one part of an article, rather than itself an article. Also, the implicit meaning of \u201carticle\u201d stretches beyond what one would ordinarily think of as something that, as part of a larger \u201carticle,\u201d is itself an \u201carticle.\u201d Thus, the implicit meaning of \u201carticle\u201d is broader still than the statutory mandate that \u201c[a]n <em>article </em>that is normally a part of a useful article is considered a \u2018useful article.\u2019 \u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (emphasis added). Are these expansions of the meaning of \u201carticle\u201d consistent with the text and with the object and policy manifested in the statute? We may be better prepared to answer after considering one more illustrative form of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Suppose, third, this form of the argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">A \u201cuseful article\u201d is not copyrightable; a \u201cuser interface\u201d is an \u201carticle,\u201d and a good \u201cuser interface\u201d is \u201cuseful\u201d; therefore, a good \u201cuser interface\u201d is not copyrightable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Here, the meaning of \u201carticle\u201d is plainly stretched beyond ordinary usage, and especially when we understand \u201cuser interface\u201d in a sense broad enough to include nonliteral elements such as the command structure. Moreover, unease that we are being led into a departure from statutory text and manifested object and policy grows deeper as we reflect still more on this illustrative form of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">One problem is that the argument depends on changing the assumed meaning of one or all of \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201carticle,\u201d and \u201cuseful article,\u201d to suit the needs of the copier who is advancing the argument as a defense against a claim of copyright infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">An even deeper fallacy of the argument, however, is that it assumes a meaning of \u201cuseful article\u201d in step one ( a \u2018useful article\u2019 is not copyrightable\u201d) that goes far beyond ordinary meanings of \u201cuseful\u201d and \u201carticle\u201d combined. That is, not merely does it assume a <em>descriptive </em>meaning of something that is an \u201carticle\u201d and is also \u201cuseful,\u201d but in addition it assumes that the definition of \u201cuseful article\u201d includes, as something built into it, a rule of law: Everything that is a \u201cuseful article\u201d in a descriptive sense is also, by rule of law, not copyrightable, and under this rule of law, nothing about a \u201cuseful article\u201d \u2014 no element, no aspect, no part of it \u2014 can ever be copyrighted. Merely to expose this assumed prescriptive meaning of \u201cuseful article,\u201d as defendants persistently use the phrase, is to demonstrate that any argument founded upon this meaning is fundamentally inconsistent with the mandates of the copyright statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">It may be quite true, with respect to \u201cuseful articles\u201d \u2014 indeed I believe it to be so \u2014 that their utilitarian aspects are not copyrightable, and that things that <em>merely </em>utter work, such as the cam of a drill, are not copyrightable. It is not true, however, that every aspect of a user interface that is \u201cuseful\u201d is therefore not copyrightable. For example, Lotus 1-2-3 is surely \u201cuseful.\u201d It does not follow that when an intellectual work achieves the feat of being useful as well as expressive and original, the moment of creative triumph is also a moment of devastating financial loss \u2014 because the triumph destroys copyrightability of all expressive elements that would have been protected if only they had not contributed so much to the public interest by helping to make some article useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">Defendants\u2019 contention misses this point by proceeding on an erroneous assumption about the role of \u201cfunctionality\u201d in copyright law. It is true that \u201cfunctionality\u201d of an article does not itself support copyright-ability. Thus, it never strengthens a claim for copyright to show that the \u201cwork\u201d for which copyright protection is claimed is useful. A congressional mandate that \u201cproof that an intellectual work is a \u2018useful article\u2019 does not support the author\u2019s claim for copyright\u201d is not, however, a mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>that \u201cif one who copied the author\u2019s work proves that the work was \u2018useful\u2019 or \u2018functional,\u2019 the author loses <em>all </em>copyright protection.\u201d Transforming a mandate that \u201cproof of usefulness <em>does not strengthen </em>a copyright claim\u201d to a mandate that \u201cproof of usefulness <em>destroys </em>a copyright claim\u201d is, to say the least, a remarkable intellectual leap. Defendants have not advanced such a proposition explicitly. But this is in fact an implicit premise of their contention \u2014 or a consequence of it, if one takes a hindsight view of having applied their proposed rule in decisionmaking. In effect, their proposed rule would work this way: Anything that is useful is a \u201cuseful article\u201d; nothing about a \u201cuseful article\u201d is ever copyrightable; because 1-2-3 is useful, and is an article, it is not copyrightable.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">A more sensible interpretation of the statutory mandate is that the mere fact that an intellectual work is useful or functional \u2014 be it a dictionary, directory, map, book of meaningless code words, or computer program \u2014 does not mean that none of the elements of the work can be copyrightable. Also, the statute does not bar copyrightability merely because the originality of the expression becomes associated, in the marketplace, with usefulness of the work to a degree and in dimensions not previously achieved by other products on the market. <em>Brandir International, Inc. v. Cascade Pacific Lumber Co., </em>834 F.2d 1142, 1147 (2d Cir.1987) (\u201c[A] copyrighted work ... does not lose its protected status merely because it subsequently is put to functional use.\u201d); <em>NEC Corp. v. Intel Corp., </em>645 F.Supp. 590, 595 (N.D.Cal.1986) (\u201cfunction performed by defendant\u2019s microprograms ... does not affect their status as copyrightable subject matter), <em>vacated on grounds of judge\u2019s recusal, see </em>835 F.2d 1546 (9th Cir.1988). To hold otherwise would be to deny copyright protection to the most original and least obvious products of the creative mind merely because the marketplace accepts them as distinctively \u201cfunctional.\u201d Such a rule would grant copyright protection for only those products that fall far short of being the best available. Rather than promoting and encouraging both the development and disclosure of the best, such a rule would offer incentives to market only the second, or third, or tenth best, and hold back the best for fear that it is too good for copyright-ability. Copyrightability is not a synonym for imperfection.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Accordingly, I conclude that a court, in determining whether a particular element is copyrightable, must not allow one statutory mandate \u2014 that functionality or usefulness is not itself a basis for copyrightability \u2014 to absorb and destroy another statutory mandate \u2014 that elements of expression are copyrightable. Elements of expression, even if embodied in useful articles, are copyrightable if capable of identification and recognition independently of the functional ideas that make the article useful. This mandate may be viewed as a corollary of the central distinction of copyright law between idea and expression, which is explored further immediately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\n<em>B. The Idea-Exyression Riddle: Four Additional Conceyts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">It is by now plain that an idea is not copyrightable and an expression may be. It does not follow, though, that every expression of an idea is copyrightable. To begin to get an understanding of the legally significant contrasts among an idea, non-copyrightable expressions of the idea, and a copyrightable expression, we must take account of four more concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Earlier parts of this Opinion refer to two of these four \u2014 \u201coriginality\u201d and \u201cfunctionality.\u201d The expression of an idea is copyrightable only if it is original \u2014 that is, if the expression originated with the author. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a); <em>see </em>Part 111(A)(2)(b), <em>suyra. </em>Even then the expression of the idea is not copyrightable if the expression does no more than embody elements of the idea that are functional in the utilitarian sense. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b); <em>see </em>Part IV(A) <em>suyra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The third concept is \u201cobviousness.\u201d When a particular expression goes no farther than the obvious, it is inseparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>from the idea itself. Protecting an expression of this limited kind would effectively amount to protection of the idea, a result inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute. <em>E.H. Tate Co. v. Jiffy Enterprises, Inc., </em>16 F.R.D. 571, 573 (E.D.Pa.1954) (small sketch and accompanying instruction \u201cApply hook to wall\u201d so obvious that it is not entitled to copyright protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">It is only a slight extension of the idea of \u201cobviousness\u201d \u2014 and one supported by precedent \u2014 to reach the fourth concept: \u201cmerger.\u201d If a particular expression is one of a quite limited number of the possible ways of expressing an idea, then, under this fourth concept, the expression is not copyrightable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">When the uncopyrightable subject matter is very narrow, so that \u201cthe topic necessarily requires,\u201d if not only one form of expression, at best only a limited number, to permit copyrighting would mean that a party or parties, by copyrighting a mere handful of forms, could exhaust all possibility of future use of the substance. In such circumstances it does not seem accurate to say that any particular form of expression comes from the subject matter. However, it is necessary to say that the subject matter would be appropriated by permitting the copyrighting of its expression. We cannot recognize copyright as a game of chess in which the public can be checkmated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Morrissey v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>379 F.2d 675, 678-79 (1st Cir.1967) (citations omitted). <em>See also Concrete Machinery Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., </em>843 F.2d 600, 606 (1st Cir.1988) (\u201cWhen there is essentially only one way to express an idea, the idea and its expression are inseparable and copyright is no bar to copying that expression.\u201d); <em>Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v.

Elements of the Legal Test for Copyrightability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">A \u201clegal test,\u201d as I use the phrase here, is a statement of the elements of fact, or law, or both fact and law, that must be addressed by a decisionmaker to decide a question potentially decisive of some claim or defense. \u201cCopyrightability\u201d of nonliteral elements of Lotus 1-2-3 is essential to the claim of the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">As already noted, the legal test for deciding copyrightability, in a factual context such as is presented here, has not been precisely defined either in the copyright statute or in precedents interpreting and applying it. Nevertheless, the statute and the precedents contain many mandates\u2014 \u201cmarkers\u201d of the borderline between copyrightability and non-copyrightability \u2014 that narrow the scope of the questions remaining to be answered to determine what test to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Drawing into one statement the fundamental truths about ideas and their expression that were sketched above, one may accurately say that the issue of copyright-ability of a \u201cwork\" turns not on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the work expresses ideas but instead on whether, in addition to expressing one or more ideas, in some material respect it does more, and in an original way. One need not totally disentangle the idea, from its expression in order to conclude that a particular aspect is expression. Indeed, to speak as if it were ever possible completely to disentangle an idea from an expression of that idea is to speak abstract fiction rather than real-life fact. Disentanglement, then, is not an \u201ceither-or,\u201d \u201c0-1,\u201d \u201cnegative-positive,\u201d or \u201cbinary\u201d matter. It is, instead, a matter of degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Still, even if the \u201cidea\u201d cannot be completely disentangled from its expression, to determine what is copyrightable a decision-maker must understand the meaning of \u201cidea\u201d within the idea-expression distinction. To do so one must take note also of another distinction \u2014 one between generality and specificity of conceptualizing the idea. Thus, a statement of the most significant elements of the legal test for copyrightability, consistent with precedents, begins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">FIRST, in making the determination of \u201ccopyrightability,\u201d the decisionmaker must focus upon alternatives that counsel may suggest, or the court may conceive, <em>along the scale from the most generalized conception to the most particularized, </em>and choose some formulation \u2014 some conception or definition of the \u201cidea\u201d \u2014 for the purpose of distinguishing between the idea and its expression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">As Learned Hand recognized in a 1930 case concerning the alleged infringement of the copyright of a play:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">Upon any work, and especially upon a play, a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is left out. The last may perhaps be no more than the most general statement of what the play is about, and at times might consist only of its title; but there is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his \u201cideas,\u201d to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended. Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX6\"><em>Nichols, </em>45 F.2d at 121 (citations omitted). <em>See also Shipman v. R.K.O. Radio Pictures, </em>100 F.2d 533, 538 (2d Cir.1938) (L. Hand, J., concurring) <em>(\u201cNichols ... </em>held that there is a point where the similarities are so little concrete (and therefore so abstract) that they become only \u2018theme\u2019, \u2018idea\u2019, or skeleton of the plot, and that these are always in the public domain; no copyright can protect them. The test is necessarily vague and nothing more definite can be said about it.\u201d) Thirty more years of experience in judging did not change Learned Hand\u2019s view: \u201cObviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying -the \u2018idea,\u2019 and has borrowed its \u2018expression.\u2019 Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc.\u201d <em>Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., </em>274 F.2d 487, 489 (2d Cir.1960) (L. Hand, J.). In another context, Hand described such \u201cad hoc\u201d decisionmaking as \u201cfiat.\u201d <em>Sinram v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>61 F.2d 767, 771 (2d Cir. 1932) (L. Hand, J.). In whatever way this kind of decisionmaking may be described, Hand offered us no formula for distinguishing between idea and expression like that he devised for the calculus of reasonable care in <em>United States v. Carroll Towing Co., </em>159 F.2d 169, 173 (L. Hand, J.) (articulating the \u201cBPL\u201d formula), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>160 F.2d 482 (2d Cir.1947). It seems the better part of wisdom, if not valor, not to press the search for a suitable bright-line test of copyrightability where Learned Hand, even after decades of experience in judging, found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">For all these reasons, as a practical necessity, whether explicitly or only implicitly, courts apply an abstractions scale in determining copyrightability. In doing so they make a decision involving choice and judgment of a type that human minds make regularly in daily affairs, but computers of the current state of the art cannot make.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Still, though \u201cjudgment\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>required and the answer to be given is not precisely \u201ccalculable,\u201d analogies to arithmetic calculations and to \u201cscales of justice\u201d may aid the human mind in choosing and \u201cweighing\u201d factors that properly go into the metaphoric calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">In summary, one among the principal elements to be weighed in determining copyrightability when the idea-expression distinction applies is to conceive and define the idea in a way that places it somewhere along the scale of abstraction (somewhere between the most abstract and the most specific of all possible conceptions). Illustrations from the evidence in this case will help to explain in a more concrete way this element of the legal test for copyrightability. <em>See </em>Part V(C), <em>infra. </em>Before turning to those illustrations, however, I state in a similarly abstract way, to be explained later by illustrations, two more elements that I conclude a decisionmaker must consider to determine copyrightability of a computer program like that at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In addition to taking account of the distinction between generality and specificity, to make use of Hand\u2019s abstraction scale for applying the idea-expression distinction we need to identify and distinguish between essential and nonessential details of expressing the idea. Some, but of course not all, details, are so essential that their omission would result in a failure to express <em>that </em>idea, or in the expression of only a different and <em>more general </em>idea. Accordingly, two more elements in the legal test for copyrightability are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">SECOND, the decisionmaker must focus upon whether an alleged expression of the idea is limited to elements essential to expression of <em>that </em>idea (or is one of only a few ways of expressing the idea) or instead includes identifiable elements of expression not essential to every expression of that idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">THIRD, having identified elements of expression not essential to every expression of the idea, the decisionmaker must focus on whether those elements are a substantial part of the allegedly copyrightable \u201cwork.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">In addressing this third element of the test for copyrightability, the decisionmaker is measuring \u201csubstantiality\u201d not merely on a quantum scale but by a test that is qualitative as well. <em>SAS Institute, </em>605 F.Supp. at 829-30 (\u201cthe piracy of even a quantitatively small fragment (\u2018a rose by any other name would smell as sweet\u2019) may be qualitatively substantial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">By its nature, a legal test that requires weighing of factors or elements such as these is not a bright-line or an either-or test. It requires of the decisionmaker, instead, an evaluative or \u201cjudgmental\u201d weighing of all relevant characteristics of the work in which a copyright is claimed, all relevant characteristics of the allegedly infringing work, and all of the relevant circumstances of their development and use. It requires, also, not a step-by-step decisionmaking process, but a simultaneous weighing of all the factors or elements that the legal test identifies as relevant. I do not suggest that the three elements identified here are an all-inclusive list. They do appear, however, to be the principal factors relevant to decision of copyrightability of a computer program such as Lotus 1-2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">If the decisionmaker, weighing the relevant factors, determines that the legal test applying the idea-expression distinction is satisfied, copyrightability is established. Issues may remain, of course, as to whether a copyright was perfected and whether the alleged infringing work, measured by the \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d test, did contain elements that infringed upon the copyrightable elements of the copyrighted \u201cwork.\u201d Also, issues may remain as to whether damages have been proved, or whether the controversy over infringement is instead \u201c \u2018a trivial pother,\u2019 a mere point of honor, of scarcely more than irritation, involving no substantial interest,\u201d <em>Fred Fisher, Inc. v. Dillingham, </em>298 F. 145, 152 (S.D.N.Y.1924) (L. Hand, J.) (citations omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ted), for which only statutory damages should be awarded. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(c) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<em>D. Incentives and the Role of Advocacy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The advocate of broad copyrightability who understands that the court will apply a legal test that focuses principally on these three elements has an incentive to urge that the court conceive the \u201cidea\u201d in a very generalized sense; then many different expressions of the idea would be possible, and protection might be claimed for the work. The advocate of freedom to copy \u2014 and of narrow copyrightability \u2014 has an incentive to urge that the court conceive the \u201cidea\u201d in a very particularized sense; then only one or a few expressions of an idea defined in such particularized terms would be possible, and no copyright protection for those few expressions would be available because the idea and expression would merge completely, or nearly so. Such extreme positions would fail to assist the court in determining, for purposes of the first element, where properly to place the idea along the abstractions scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">There is risk for each advocate, however, in yielding too readily to these respective incentives. The argument of an advocate who presses too far in one or the other of these directions of generality or specificity in defining the idea will not only lose the argument advanced but also lose credibility for later advancing a more sensible alternative that proposes a less extreme but still favorable position along the scale. Upon reflection, then, advocates on both sides will be \u2014 or at least should be \u2014 encouraged to moderate their ultra-contentious and extreme positions in favor of more supportable propositions that will more sharply focus the issue for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">There is an additional risk for the advocate of freedom to copy who attempts to persuade the court that Hand\u2019s abstractions scale, and the three-element test applying it, is irrelevant to computer programs. That advocate will be tempted to define the idea in the most generalized terms, hoping to persuade the court that, because the abstractions scale does not apply, all of the many different expressions of that idea are non-copyrightable and everyone is free to copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">In this case, defendants have in fact advanced such an argument. Yielding only to the near-uniformity of precedent for copyrightability of source code and object code, defendants have argued that every other form of expression of the \u201cspreadsheet metaphor\u201d is non-copyrightable. For reasons now to be explained, neither this extreme contention nor any of the alternatives the defendants have advanced for non-copyrightability can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Y. APPLICATION OF THE LEGAL TEST TO LOTUS 1-2-3</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">\n<em>A. \u201cLook and Feel\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">In musical, dramatic, and motion picture works, and works of literature, nonliteral elements that are copyrightable have sometimes been described as the \u201ctotal concept and feel\u201d of a work, <em>Roth Greeting Cards, </em>429 F.2d at 1110; <em>Krofft Television, </em>562 F.2d at 1167, \u201cthe fundamental essence or structure\u201d of a work, 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, <em>Nimmer on 'Copyright </em>\u00a7 13.03[A][1] (1989), or \u201cthe \u2018pattern\u2019 of the work,\u201d Chaffee, <em>Reflections on the Law of Copyright: Part I, </em>45 Colum.L.Rev. 503, 513 (1945). In the context of computer programs, nonliteral elements have often been referred to as the \u201clook and feel\u201d of a program, <em>e.g., Telemarketing Resources, </em>12 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1993; Samuelson and Glushko, <em>Comparing the Views of Lawyers and User Interface Designers on the Software Copyright \u201cLook and Feel\u201d Lawsuits, </em>30 Jurimetries 121 (1989). Initially, plaintiff too referred to these elements as \u201clook and feel,\u201d Amended Complaint \u00b6 13 (Docket No. 15), though plaintiff \u2014 in trial, at least \u2014 has not rested its contentions primarily on this terminology.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Despite its widespread use in public discourse on the copyrightability of nonliteral elements of computer programs, I have not found the \u201clook and feel\u201d concept, standing alone, to be significantly helpful in distinguishing between nonliteral elements of a computer program that are copyrightable and those that are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>One may argue that the phrase \u201clook and feel\u201d is analogous to the \u201ctotal concept and feel\u201d test developed in <em>Roth Greeting Cards, </em>429 F.2d at 1110, and used in <em>Krofft Television, </em>562 F.2d at 1167. In these cases, however, the \u201ctotal concept and feel\u201d test was not invoked \u2014 at least, not explicitly \u2014 as an aid to the court in determining which nonliteral elements were copyrightable and why. Rather, these courts used the concept, not in determining copyrightability, but, apparently assuming copyrightability, in applying the substantial similarity test to determine whether forbidden copying had occurred. For example, in <em>Roth Greeting Cards, </em>the court considered whether the \u201ctext, arrangement of text, art work, and association between art work and text\u201d of defendant\u2019s greeting cards were substantially similar to <em>{e.g., </em>copied the \u201ctotal concept and feel\u201d of) those elements of plaintiff's greeting cards. 429 F.2d at 1109. And in <em>Krofft Television, </em>the inquiry focused on whether defendant McDonald's, with its television commercials, copied the \u201ctotal concept and feel\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s H.R. Pufnstuf children\u2019s television series by copying its locale (both occurred in imaginary world with similar trees, caves, a pond, a road and a castle), fictional characters (both were inhabited by talking trees, mayors with disproportionately large round heads and long wide mouths, \"Keystone cops\u201d characters, crazy scientists, and a multi-armed evil creature), costumes and sets (created for defendant by former employees of plaintiff), voices (executed for defendant by same voice expert who did the voices for plaintiff\u2019s television series), and plot. 562 F.2d at 1161, 1167 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">It may be true that the issues of copyrightability and substantial similarity are so interrelated that these precedents are relevant. The fact remains that they are not directly in point for determining copyrightability in this case. Moreover, \u201clook and feel\u201d is a conclusion, and the useful-' ness and applicability of a precedent depends on the <em>reasons </em>the conclusion was reached in a particular context, not on the <em>conclusion </em>itself. Thus, in trying to understand the relevance of \u201cconcept and feel\u201d precedents, we need to look to details of those cases that appear to have been relied upon in reaching the conclusion, rather than merely embracing the conclusion without regard for underlying reasons. As we probe the circumstances of these precedents that closely, we are likely to do something akin to applying the three-element test described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\n<em>B. The User Interface</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Plaintiff in the present case, not now pressing any argument that the phrase \u201clook and feel\u201d is a satisfactory description' of the copyrightable elements of Lotus 1-2-3, suggests that the copyrightable nonliteral elements are more appropriately described by the phrase \u201cuser interface.\u201d According to plaintiff, the \u201cuser interface\u201d of 1-2-3 includes such elements as \u201cthe menus (and their structure and organization), the long prompts, the screens on which they appear, the function key assignments, [and] the macro commands and language,\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Post-Trial Brief at 53 (Docket No. 319). I turn now to examining these elements more closely.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Like manual spreadsheets, <em>Baker, </em>101 U.S. at 100, the electronic spreadsheet presents a blank form on which numerical, statistical, financial or other data can be assimilated, organized, manipulated and calculated. Galler Deck UTI101-103; Lewis Affdvt. If 92. In both Lotus 1-2-3 and VP-Planner, as in many other electronic spreadsheet programs, a highlighted element of the basic screen display resembles an \u201cL\u201d rotated ninety degrees clockwise with letters across the top to designate columns, and numbers down the left side to designate rows. <em>See </em>Appendices 1 (Visi-Calc), 2 (1-2-3), and 3 (VP-Planner). <em>Cf. </em>Multiplan, which also has a rotated \u201cL\u201d screen display, but which uses numbers for both columns and rows (Tr. Ex. (Trial Exhibit) 132). The intersection of each column and row is a \u201ccell\u201d in which a value <em>{e.g., </em>31,963), formula <em>{e.g., </em>one that adds a column of numbers), or label <em>{e.g., </em>\u201cCost of Goods\u201d) may be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Both programs utilize a \"two-line moving-cursor menu,\u201d which presents the user <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>with a list of command choices <em>{e.g., </em>\u201cfile\u201d, \u201ccopy\u201d, \u201cquit\u201d) and a moving cursor to use in communicating (\u201centering\u201d) the choice. The menu is called up to the screen by pressing the slash (\u201c/\u201d) key, and is located either above th\u00e9 rotated \u201cL\u201d (as in 1-2-3, <em>see </em>Appendix 2) or below the rotated \u201cL\u201d (as in VP-Planner, <em>see </em>Appendix 3). <em>Cf. </em>Multiplan, which uses a three-line moving cursor menu (Tr. Ex. 132); Excel, which has \u201cpull-down\u201d bar menus (Tr. Ex. 79).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The top line of the two-line menu contains a series of words, each of which represents a different command. For example, the top line of the first, or main, menu in 1-2-3 reads: \u201cWorksheet Range Copy Move File Graph Data Quit\u201d. <em>See </em>Appendix 2; <em>cf. </em>Appendix 3 (main menu in VP-Planner). The first word of the line is highlighted to signify the command that will be chosen if the \u201center\u201d key is pressed; the highlighting, or \u201ccursor,\u201d moves to the right or left if the right or left cursor key is pressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The second line of the menu displays a \u201clong prompt,\u201d which contains further information about the highlighted command. In some cases, the long prompt is a description of the highlighted command <em>(e.g., </em>for command \u201cCopy\u201d, the long prompt reads: \u201cCopy a cell or range of cells\u201d); in other cases, the long prompt provides a list of the menu command subchoices that will be available if the highlighted command is chosen <em>(e.g., </em>for command \u201cWorksheet\u201d, the long prompt reads: \u201cGlobal, Insert, Delete, Column-Width, Erase, Titles, Window, Status\u201d; <em>see </em>Appendix 2; <em>cf. </em>Appendix 3 (VP-Planner)). In the latter ease, if the highlighted command is subsequently chosen, the words that appeared in the long prompt will now appear as second-level menu command choices on the top line of the menu, and a new long prompt will take its place on the second line.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In addition to having the option of selecting a command by moving the cursor to the command and pressing the \u201center\u201d key, a user may instead press the key representing the first letter of the command word <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cC\u201d for \u201cCopy\u201d, \u201cW\u201d for \u201cWorksheet\u201d). For this reason, each word representing each command on a given menu line must start with a different letter. <em>See </em>Galler Affdvt. \u00b6\u00b6 105-117; Lewis Deck 1I1\u00cd 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Function keys present an additional way for the user to communicate with, and operate, the programmed computer. Each program assigns certain frequently-used commands to the various \u201cfunction keys\u201d (labelled \u201cFI\u201d, \u201cF2\u201d, \u201cF3\u201d, etc.) on the keyboard. For example, in 1-2-3, \u201cFI\u201d corresponds to the command \u201cHelp\u201d, and \u201cF2\u201d to the command \u201cEdit\u201d. Galler Deck \u00b6 125. VP-Planner, in contrast, assigns the function keys to the commands on the top line of the menu. Thus, for example, when VP-Planner is in its main menu mode, \u201cFI\u201d corresponds to the command \u201cHelp\u201d, \u201cF2\u201d to the command \u201cWorksheet\u201d, \u201cF3\u201d to the command \u201cRange\u201d, \u201cF4\u201d to the command \u201cCopy\u201d, and so on. <em>See </em>Appendix 3 (function key numbers listed before command terms).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Typically, users adapt particular spreadsheets to their specific needs. Suppose, for example, that in order to achieve a desired result, a user must perform the same sequence of commands repeatedly in order to cause the computer to execute the same functions repeatedly <em>(e.g., </em>calculating depreciation based on certain financial data, or saving the spreadsheet and printing a copy of it). Rather than going step-by-step through the same sequence of commands each time there is a need to perform a particular function, the user may store a sequence of command terms as a \u201cmacroinstruction,\u201d commonly called a \u201cmacro,\u201d and then, with one command stroke that invokes the macro, cause the programmed computer to execute the entire sequence of commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In 1-2-3, the command terms within a macro may consist of menu choices <em>(e.g., </em>\u201c/C\u201d to copy a cell or range of cells, or \u201c/PPRAl.F19{enter}AGQ\u201d \u2014 for the command sequence \u201cPrint, Printer, Range, Cell A1 to Cell F19, Align, Go, Quit\u201d \u2014 to print the specified range of cells from the spreadsheet). Also a macro may include keyboard commands (such as function keys, cursor keys, or the \u201center\u201d key), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>special macro commands invoked by the command \u201c/X\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>\u201c/XI\u201d is a macro command that performs an \u201cif-then\u201d logical function). Because macros may contain many menu choices, the exact hierarchy\u2014 or structure, sequence and organization\u2014 of the menu system is a fundamental part of the functionality of the macros. Also, because macro commands are typically invoked by entering the first letter of command choices <em>(e.g., </em>\u201c/C\u201d for copying, \u201c/PPRAl.F19{enter}AGQ\u201d for printing the specified range of cells), the first letter of each command choice on a particular menu is a vital element of the functionality of macros. <em>See </em>Galler Decl. Ml 121-124; Lewis Affdvt. Mi 109-115.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\n<em>C. Elements of the User Interface as Expression</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Applying to 1-2-3 the legal test stated in Part IV(C), <em>supra, </em>I consider first where along the scale of abstraction to conceive the \u201cidea\u201d for the purpose of distinguishing between the idea and its expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">At the most general level of Hand\u2019s abstractions scale, <em>Nichols, </em>45 F.2d at 121 \u2014 the computer programs at issue in this case, and other computer programs that have been considered during the course of trial, are expressions of the idea of a computer program for an electronic spreadsheet. Defendants are quite correct, then, in asserting that the idea of developing an electronic spreadsheet is not copyrightable \u2014 that the core idea of such a spreadsheet is both functional and obvious, even to computer users who claim no technical competence. Thus, even though programs like VisiCalc, 1-2-3, Multiplan, SuperCalc4, and Excel are very different in their structure, appearance, and method of operation, each is, at the most basic level, just a different way of expressing the same idea: the electronic spreadsheet. It does not follow, however, that every possible method of designing a metaphorical spreadsheet is obvious, or that no form of expressing the idea of the spreadsheet metaphor can possibly have such originality in pressing beyond the obvious as is required for copyrightability, or that no special form of metaphorical spreadsheet can possibly be a distinctive expression of a particular method of preparing financial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The idea for a two-line moving cursor menu is also functional and obvious, and, indeed, is used in a wide variety of computer programs including spreadsheet programs. Nevertheless, it does not follow that every possible method of designing a menu system that includes a two-line moving cursor is non-copyrightable.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Of course, if a particular expression of the idea of an electronic spreadsheet communicates no details beyond those essential to stating the idea itself, then that expression would not be copyrightable. The issue here is whether Lotus 1-2-3 does go beyond those details essential to any expression of the idea, and includes substantial elements of expression, distinctive and original, which are thus copyrightable.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The idea for an electronic spreadsheet was first rendered into commercial practice by Daniel Bricklin. As a student at Harvard Business School in the late 1970\u2019s, Bricklin envisioned a \u201cmagic blackboard\u201d that would recalculate numbers automatically as changes were made in other parts of the spreadsheet. Eventually, aided by others, he transformed this idea into Visi-Calc, the first commercial electronic spreadsheet. <em>See </em>Bricklin Affdvt. MI 48-96 (Docket No. 217). Bricklin\u2019s idea for Visi-Calc was a revolutionary advance in the field of computer programming. Dauphinais Affdvt. \u00b6 98 (Docket No. 280).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Although VisiCalc was a commercial success, implementational characteristics limited the scope and duration of its marketability as a spreadsheet product. Most notably, VisiCalc was originally programmed for use on the Apple II computer, which had limited memory (32K of RAM), limited screen display capabilities (only 40 characters per line), and limited keys available on the keyboard (no function keys and no up and down cursor keys). When VisiCalc was later rewritten for use on the IBM PC (which was introduced in August 1981), it was transferred with minimal changes and without taking advantage of many of the PC\u2019s more extensive capabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Mitchell Kapor and Jonathan Sachs,, the original authors of 1-2-3, exploited this opportunity. Building on Bricklin\u2019s revolutionary idea for an electronic spreadsheet, Kapor and Sact\u00f3 expressed that idea in a different, more powerful way. 1-2-3 took advantage of the IBM PC\u2019s more expansive memory and more versatile screen display capabilities and keyboard. 1-2-3, like many electronic spreadsheet programs since, could thus be thought of as an evolutionary product that was built upon the shoulders of VisiCalc.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Just as 1-2-3 expressed the idea of an electronic spreadsheet differently from VisiCalc, so did Microsoft\u2019s Excel. Originally written for the Apple Macintosh computer, it exploits the enhanced graphics capabilities of the Macintosh, as well as the mouse input device that is standard with the Macintosh. Excel has pull-down bar menus rather than a two-line moving-cursor menu, and a very different menu-command hierarchy. Tr. Ex. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">As already noted, these three products\u2014 VisiCalc, 1-2-3, and Excel \u2014 share the general idea of an electronic spreadsheet but have expressed the idea in substantially different ways. These products also share some elements, however, at a somewhat more detailed or specific point along the abstractions scale. One element shared by these and many other programs is the basic spreadsheet screen display that resembles a rotated \u201cL.\u201d <em>See </em>Appendices 1 (Visi-Calc), 2 (1-2-3), and 3 (VP-Planner). Although Excel uses a different basic spreadsheet screen display that more closely resembles a paper spreadsheet, there is a rather low limit, as a factual matter, on the number of ways of making a computer screen resemble a spreadsheet. Accordingly, this aspect of electronic spreadsheet computer programs, if not present in every expression of such a program, is present in most expressions. Thus the second element of the legal test weighs heavily against treating the rotated \u201cL\u201d screen display as a copyrightable element of a computer program. <em>Morrissey, </em>379 F.2d at 678-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Another expressive element that merges with the idea of an electronic spreadsheet\u2014 that is, that is an essential detail present in most if not all expressions of an electronic spreadsheet \u2014 is the designation of a particular key that, when pressed, will invoke the menu command system. The number of keys available for this designation is limited for two reasons. First, because most of the keys on the keyboard relate either to values <em>{e.g., </em>the number keys and mathematical operation keys) or labels <em>{e.g., </em>the letter keys), only a few keys are left that can be used, as a practical matter, to invoke the menu command system. Without something more, the programmed computer would interpret the activation of one of these keys as an attempt by the user to enter a value or label into a cell. Second, because users need to invoke the command system frequently, the key designated for this purpose must be easily accessible. For example, the user should not be required to press two keys at the same time (such as \u201cShift,\u201d \u201cAlt,\u201d or \u201cCtrl\u201d along with another key).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">As just noted, when all the letter, number, and arithmetic keys are eliminated from consideration, the number of keys remaining that could be used to invoke the menu command system is quite limited. They include the slash key (\u201c/\u201d) and the semi-colon key (\u201c;\u201d). The choice of the creators of VisiCalc to designate the slash (\u201c/\u201d) key to invoke the menu command system is not surprising. It is one of very few practical options. Thus the second element of the legal test weighs heavily against copyrightability of this aspect of VisiCalc \u2014 and of 1-2-3. This expression merges with the idea of having a readily available method of invoking the menu command system.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Other elements of expression a decision-maker may regard as either essential to every expression of an electronic spreadsheet, or at least \u201cobvious\u201d if not essential, include the use of the \u201c+\u201d key to indicate addition, the \u201d key to indicate subtraction, the key to indicate multiplication, the \u201c/\u201d key within formulas to indicate division, and the \u201center\u201d key to place keys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>troke entries into the cells. <em>See </em>Dauphinais Affidavit, \u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Each of the elements just described is present in, if not all, at least most expressions of an electronic spreadsheet computer program. Other aspects of these programs, however, need not be present in every expression of an electronic spreadsheet. An example of distinctive details of expression is the precise \u201cstructure, sequence, and organization,\u201d <em>Whelan, </em>797 F.2d at 1248, of the menu command system.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Consider first the menu command system of VisiCalc. The main menu command line reads: \u201cCommand: BCDEF-GIMPRSTVW-\u201d. <em>See </em>Appendix 1. Each of these letters (or, to use defendants\u2019 experts\u2019 preferred terminology, \u201csymbolic tokens\u201d) stands for a different command \u2014 in this case: Blank, Clear, Delete, Edit, Format, Global, Insert, Move, Print, Replicate, Storage, Titles, Version Number, Window, and \u201c-\u201d for \u201cLabel Repeating.\u201d Many of these commands invoke submenus which also contain a series of letters, each of which represents a submenu command choice. <em>See </em>VisiCalc Command Structure Chart (Tr. Ex. 140, pp. 3-3 and 3-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">This particular expression of a menu structure is not essential to the electronic spreadsheet idea, nor does it merge with the somewhat less abstract idea of a menu structure for an electronic spreadsheet. The idea of a menu structure \u2014 including the overall structure, the order of commands in each menu line, the choice of letters, words, or \u201csymbolic tokens\u201d to represent each command, the presentation of these symbolic tokens on the screen <em>(i.e., </em>first letter only, abbreviations, full words, full words with one or more letters capitalized or underlined), the type of menu system used <em>(i.e., </em>one-, two-, or three-line moving-cursor menus, pull-down menus, or command-driven interfaces), and the long prompts \u2014 could be expressed in a great many if not literally unlimited number of ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The fact that some of these specific command terms are quite obvious or merge with the idea of such a particular command term does not preclude copyrightability for the command structure taken as a whole. If particular characteristics not distinctive individually have been brought together in a way that makes the \u201cwhole\u201d a distinctive expression of an idea \u2014 one of many possible ways of expressing it \u2014 then the \u201cwhole\u201d may be copyrightable. The statutory provisions regarding \u201ccompilation,\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101, 103, are not essential to this conclusion, but do reinforce it. A different total structure may be developed even from individual components that are quite similar and limited in number. To determine copyrightability, a court need not \u2014 and, indeed, should not \u2014 dissect every element of the allegedly protected work. Rather, the court need only identify those elements that are copyrightable, and then determine whether those elements, <em>considered as a whole, </em>have been impermissibly copied. <em>Atari Games Corp. v. Oman, </em>888 F.2d 878, 882-83 (D.C.Cir.1989) (rejecting \u201ccomponent-byeomponent analysis,\u201d and ruling instead that focus must ultimately be on \u201cwork as a whole\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">It is plain that plaintiff did not impermissibly copy copyrighted elements of Visi-Calc. Lotus 1-2-3 uses a very different menu structure. In contrast with Visi-Calc\u2019s one-line main menu that reads \u201cCommand: BCDEFGIMPRSTVW-\u201d, the main menu of Lotus 1-2-3, which uses a two-line moving-cursor menu system, reads: \u201cWorksheet Range Copy Move File Graph Data Quit\u201d. <em>See </em>Appendix 2. Most of the submenus similarly present a list of up to about ten full-word menu choices, presented in order of predicted frequency of use rather than alphabetically. <em>See </em>Lotus 1-2- 3 Command Tree Chart (Tr. Ex. 176, pp. 3- 2 and 3-3). Other spreadsheet programs have also expressed their command structures in completely different ways. <em>Cf. </em>Multiplan (Tr. Ex. 132, p. 279-374), Framework II (Tr. Ex. 131, pp. QR7-QR8), SuperCalc4 (Tr. Ex. 133, Quick Reference Card Number 1), Excel (Tr. Ex. 79, Reference Guide, p. 90); Symphony (Tr. Ex. 130, Reference Manual, pp. 127-190); MathPlan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>(Tr. Ex. 134, pp. 169-380); and PFS: Professional Plan (Tr. Ex. 135).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">I conclude that a menu command structure is capable of being expressed in many if not an unlimited number of ways, and that the command structure of 1-2-3 is an original and nonobvious way of expressing a command structure. Emery Decl. \u00b6 15. Accordingly, the menu structure, taken as a whole \u2014 including the choice of command terms, the structure and order of those terms, their presentation on the screen, and the long prompts \u2014 is an aspect of 1-2-3 that is not present in every expression of an electronic spreadsheet. It meets the requirements of the second element of the legal test for copyrightability.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Finally, I consider the third element of the legal test \u2014 whether the structure, sequence, and organization of the menu command system is a substantial part of the alleged copyrighted work \u2014 here Lotus 1-2-3. That the answer to this question is \u201cyes\u201d is incontrovertible. The user interface of 1-2-3 is its most unique element, and is the aspect that has made 1-2-3 so popular. That defendants went to such trouble to copy that element is a testament to its substantiality. Accordingly, evaluation of the third element of the legal test weighs heavily in favor of Lotus.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Taking account of all three elements of the legal test, I determine that copyright-ability of the user interface of 1-2-3 is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">VI. COPYING OF LOTUS 1-2-3</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">As noted at the beginning of this Opinion, the parties\u2019 stipulation regulating this first phase of trial reserved for a later, jury phase, any issues of fact requiring jury determination with respect to any alleged copying of Lotus 1-2-3. If in this first phase the court had rejected Lotus\u2019 claim of copyrightability of nonliteral elements of the user interface, a jury phase would plainly have been required under that stipulation to determine whether any copying of source code or object code had occurred. Because, however, the court has decided instead that Lotus prevails on this issue, the court must next consider whether any issue remains that must be submitted to a jury before the court considers whether defendants are liable for infringement of Lotus\u2019 copyright in 1-2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">For the reasons stated below, the answer to that inquiry must be \u201cno.\u201d Not only is the copying in this case so \u201coverwhelming and pervasive\u201d as to preclude, as a matter of law, any assertion of independent creation, <em>see Midway Manufacturing Co. v. Bandai-America, Inc., </em>546 F.Supp. 125, 141 n. 11, 149 (D.N.J.1982) (\u201coverwhelming and pervasive\u201d copying can preclude, as a matter of law, finding of independent creation, and can support grant of summary judgment for plaintiff, but such virtual identity not shown in this case), but also, defendants in this case have <em>admitted </em>that they copied these elements of protected expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Dr. James Stephenson, founder of defendant Stephenson Software, is the original developer of the program that was eventually released as VP-Planner. Like Kapor and Sacks, Stephenson recognized that VisiCalc, although a \u201cpioneering spreadsheet approach,\u201d Stephenson Affdvt. \u00b6 19 (Docket No. 287), was not sufficient to meet the financial planning needs of some companies and did not take advantage of technological advances in computer hardware. Accordingly, in January 1982, Stephenson began to develop his own electronic spreadsheet that he referred to as FIPS (\u201cFinancial Information and Planning System\u201d). <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 13-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">By January 1983, Stephenson had developed much of the user interface for his spreadsheet program including the menu command hierarchy. <em>See </em>Tr. Ex. 1014. By April 1983, Stephenson installed at his client\u2019s business an operational version of his spreadsheet program, which had substantially the same menu hierarchy as the January 1983 version. That hierarchy is differently expressed from the hierarchy of both VisiCalc and 1-2-3. <em>See </em>Tr. Ex. 1019; Stephenson Affdvt. \u00b611156-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Stephenson first saw 1-2-3 in operation in February 1983, after he had developed the menu hierarchy for FIPS. Throughout the rest of that year, he continued to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>prove FIPS, changed its name to VP-Planner, and began to consider marketing his program. By December 1983, Stephenson -entered into a letter of intent with Adam Osborne regarding publication of VP-Planner. Osborne thereafter organized defendant Paperback Software. Stephenson Affdvt. 111166-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Throughout 1984, defendants continued to improve VP-Planner. In the autumn, they recognized the success of 1-2-3 and reached the conclusion that spawned this litigation: VP-Planner, in order to be a commercial success, would have to be \u201ccompatible\u201d with 1-2-3. \u201cThe only way to accomplish this result,\u201d defendants believed, \u201cwas to ensure that <em>the arrangement and names of commands and menus in VP-Planner conformed to that of Lotus 1-2-3.\u201d Id. </em>at 11117 (emphasis added). <em>See generally id. </em>at U1I 99-130. Such compatibility would allow users to transfer spreadsheets created in 1-2-3 to VP-Planner without loss of functionality for any macros in the spreadsheet. Also, such compatibility would allow users to switch from 1-2-3 to VP-Planner without requiring retraining in the operation of VP-Planner.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">To some degree at least, defendants\u2019 premises have proved incorrect in hindsight. That is, first, as Excel has proved, a spreadsheet program did not have to be exactly compatible with 1-2-3 in order to be a commercial success. Second, copying the menu structure was not the <em>only </em>way to achieve aspects of this desired compatibility. For example, defendants could have instead added a macro conversion capability as the creators of Excel have successfully done (the Microsoft Excel Macro Translation Assistant), and could have provided an on-line help function that would show users the VP-Planner equivalent for 1-2-3 commands. <em>See Excel Reference </em>Guide at 491, 425-26 (Tr. Ex. 79). <em>See also </em>Morgan Decl. 11113-7 (Docket No. 308) (Lotus itself created a \u201cmacro conversion utility\u201d to translate macros among different-language editions of 1-2-3 <em>(e.g., </em>North American, international English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish)); Turner Decl. \u00b6 10 (Docket No. 309). These points do not weigh significantly in the present decision, however, because. even if VP-Planner otherwise would have been a commercial failure, and even if no other technological ways of achieving macro and menu compatibility existed, the desire to achieve \u201ccompatibility\u201d or \u201cstandardization\u201d cannot override the rights of authors to a limited monopoly in the expression embodied in their intellectual \u201cwork.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Defendants admit that, once these fateful decisions were made by Stephenson and Osborne, defendants converted VP-Planner into a program more like 1-2-3 \u2014 indeed, a program that they have publicly advertised as a \u201cworkalike for 1-2-3.\u201d <em>VP Planner </em>Manual 1.11 (1985) (Tr. Ex. 9). It is incontrovertible that, in the process, they copied the expressive elements of 1-2-3 that the court has concluded are copyrightable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avr\">[Mjaking the changes required for macro compatibility meant that we had to revise existing elements of the [VP-Planner] spreadsheet interface, including the hierarchical menu structure; ensure that keystroke sequences would bring about the same operational result in both programs; add certain functional elements found in Lotus 1-2-3 which VP-Planner did not yet support; and discard certain features which, although beneficial, were inconsistent with the macro compatibility requirement.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">Several types of changes were required in the VP-Planner program to achieve keystroke macro compatibility. First, the menu structure had to be altered so that all menu commands would have the same first letter and be in the same location in the menu hierarchy as in Lotus 1-2-3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Stephenson Affdvt. 1111144,146. <em>See generally id. </em>at 1111142-157. After these changes were made, the VP-Planner manual could truthfully declare:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">VP-Planner is designed to work like Lotus 1-2-3, keystroke for keystroke____ VP-Planner\u2019s worksheet is a feature-for-feature workalike for 1-2-3. It does macros. It has the same command tree. It allows the same kind of calculations, the same kind of numerical information. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Everything 1-2-3 does, VP-Planner does.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><em>VP-Planner </em>Manual at xi, 1.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The court\u2019s comparison of the 1-2-3 menu command hierarchy and the VP-Planner menu hierarchy confirms that VP-Planner \u201chas the same command tree\u201d as 1-2-3 \u2014 that is, that defendants copied the expression embodied in the 1-2-3 menu hierarchy. It is true that there are some differences between 1-2-3\u2019s menu structure and VP-Planner\u2019s menu structure. For example, most VP-Planner menu lines begin with a help (\u201c?\u201d) command, and some additional commands are included at the end of some menu lines <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cDBase, Multidimensional\u201d on the \u201c/File Erase\u201d menu line; and \u201cPage #, No Page #, Row/Col. #, Stop Row/Col. #, Background\u201d on the \u201c/Print Printer Options Other\u201d menu line). Other differences between the two. programs appear in the start-up screens, the placement on the screen of the menu lines, the exact wording of the long prompts, the organization of the help screens, the increased width of the VP-Planner screen, and the ability of VP-Planner to hide certain columns. <em>See </em>Stephenson Affdvt. <em>K </em>161-176. The works are, nevertheless, substantially, indeed, strikingly, similar. As Judge Learned Hand held in a copyright case involving a pattern on a bolt of cloth that was used to make dresses, infringement may be found despite some differences between two works:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8O\">the ordinary observer, unless he set out to detect the disparities, would be disposed to overlook them, and regard their aesthetic appeal as the same. That is enough; and indeed, it is all that can be said, unless protection against infringement is to be denied because of variants irrelevant to the purpose for which the design is intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\"><em>Peter Pan Fabrics, </em>274 F.2d at 489, <em>quoted in part with approval, Concrete Machinery, </em>843 F.2d at 607. <em>See also Atari v. Philips, </em>672 F.2d at 618 (\u201c[A] laundry list of specific differences ... will not preclude a finding of infringement where the works are substantially similar in other respects____ When analyzing two works to determine whether they are substantially similar, courts should be careful not to lose sight of the forest for the trees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">From the perspective of both an expert and an ordinary viewer, the similarities <em>overwhelm </em>differences. Thus, as in <em>Peter Pan Fabrics, </em>the two works at issue are substantially similar. Indeed, by using the option in VP-Planner that allows a user to move the menu from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen, a user could easily think 1-2-3 rather than VP-Planner was the program in use. Certainly purchasers of a book designed to teach users how to master <em>1-2-3, </em>which is distributed with demonstration copies of <em>VP-Planner, </em>would be likely to overlook the disparities between 1-2-3 and VP-Planner. <em>See </em>L. Ingalsbe, <em>Lotus 1-2-3 with Version 2.0 for the IBM PC </em>(1987) (Tr. Ex. 215).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Moreover, even if some elements of VP-Planner were very different, it would not give defendants a license to copy other substantial elements of 1-2-3 verbatim. If one publishes a 1,000-page book of which only a 10-page segment is an unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material, and if the 10-page segment is a qualitatively substantial part of the copyrighted work, it is not a defense to a claim of infringement that the book is <em>99% </em>different from the copyrighted material. <em>Sheldon, </em>81 F.2d at 56 (\u201cno plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work he did not pirate\u201d); <em>SAS Institute, </em>605 F.Supp. at 829-30. Thus, defendants\u2019 proof that VP-Planner has many features that are different from Lotus 1-2-3 is off point. The more relevant question is: does it have significant features that are substantially similar? I conclude, on the record before me, that there is no genuine dispute of material fact on this question. The answer to this question must be \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Accordingly, I conclude that it is indisputable that defendants have copied substantial copyrightable elements of plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted work. I therefore conclude that, subject to consideration of other contentions advanced by defendants, liability has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>VIL A POSTSCRIPT ON THE NATURE OF DECISIONMAKING IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\n<em>A. Policy Arguments and Limitations on the Role of Courts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Although Parts I through VI of this Opinion are sufficient to demonstrate that defendants have impermissibly copied copyrightable elements of expression embodied in 1-2-3, it may be useful to pause, before reaching the merits of defendants\u2019 proffered defenses to liability, to consider the proper use of policy in determining statutory meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">As noted in Part 111(A)(1), <em>supra, </em>the court is directed to look to the \u201cobject and policy\u201d of the law in determining the manifested meaning of the law. <em>Kelly, </em>479 U.S. at 43, 107 S.Ct. at 358. The court must, however, be careful that its weighing of the \u201cobject and policy\u201d implicit in the law does not override the mandates that are either explicit in the statutory text or implicit in the provisions of the whole law.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Defendants\u2019 arguments in this case have urged the court to violate that limitation on the judicial use of policy considerations. That is, in the name of the \u201cobject and policy\u201d of copyright law, defendants have argued: (1) that the idea-expression distinction creates unnecessary and counter-productive uncertainty that could be avoided by a bright-line test of copyrightability; (2) that the policy of promoting creativity favors extremely narrow copyright protection in computer programs for anything beyond source code and object code; and (3) that the policy of encouraging standardization mandates the conclusion that a user interface is not copyrightable. Also, in advancing these policy arguments, defendants have obscured the nature of important issues in the case by strained analogies and word games.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Policy arguments advanced without focusing on whether they are inconsistent with the mandates of legislation \u2014 along with strained analogies and word games\u2014 are fundamentally flawed because they do not take account of limitations on the role of courts, to which counsel as well as courts are obliged to be sensitive. Courts must enforce the mandates of legislation, and even when answering questions of law not answered by those mandates, must do so in a way that respects legislative policy choices, whether explicit or implicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">Each of defendants\u2019 policy arguments addressed below suffers from this fatal flaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">\n<em>B. Strained Analogies and Word Games</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">The reasoning that lawyers propose in arguments and judges use in deciding cases often builds on simile, metaphor, and allusion. All such reasoning is within the scope of what we call analogy, in the broadest sense. When strictly logical deductions from authoritative declarations of law \u2014 in constitutions, statutes, and precedents \u2014 do not provide answers to questions of law that must be decided in the case before the court, the court turns to analogy. <em>Cf Kelly, </em>479 U.S. at 43, 107 S.Ct. at 358 (\u201cwe must ... look to the provisions of the whole law\u201d). Thus, similes, metaphors, and other forms of allusion are appropriately a part of our efforts to communicate ideas. They are not to be mistaken, however, for logically compelled inferences from authoritative declarations. They are aids to understanding the meaning, not yet authoritatively determined, of the authoritative declarations as applied to circumstances those declarations did not explicitly address.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">Defendants strongly urged the court to accept an analogy between a computer program and a \u201cuseful article.\u201d As explained in Part IV(A) of this Opinion, that proposed analogy is deeply flawed because of an unstated implicit premise that the fact that a computer program is \u201cuseful\u201d utterly precludes copyrightability of any expressive elements in it. In the same breath, though, defendants concede, that source code and object code are copyrightable. This concession is itself a demonstration of the vulnerability of the \u201cuseful article\u201d argument. The concession makes clear a flaw in the analogical argument for treating a computer program that is \u201cuseful\u201d as necessarily nothing more than a \u201cuseful article.\u201d If no explanation is offered for the exception other than precedent, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>analogy itself is challenged by the precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Thus, labeling a computer program as a \u201cuseful article\u201d in relation to a claim for copyrightability of nonliteral elements of the user interface, but not a \u201cuseful article\u201d in relation to a claim for copyrightability of source code and object code, is engaging in a word game rather than focusing on the merits of the copyrightability issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">An even more striking word-game argument is defendants contention that in copying the 1-2-3 user interface, they have only copied a \u201clanguage,\u201d and that languages are not copyrightable. <em>See, e.g., </em>Deposition of Steven Cook at 153:23-154:10 (Docket No. 327); Kocher Affdvt. 111113-18 (Docket No. 272); Defendants\u2019 Post-Trial Brief at 87-103 (Docket No. 325). Although defendants have not explicitly stated all the essential steps of this argument, by filling the gaps in trying to understand the argument, one may infer the following elements and corollaries of the argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">(1) Although expression is copyrightable, the language in which the expression is written is not copyrightable. Thus, a book written in English or French may be copyrightable, but the English and French \u201clanguages\u201d are not works in which copyright may subsist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">(2) Like books, computer programs, written in computer programming \u201clanguages,\u201d may be copyrightable, but only the \u201csets of statements or instructions,\u201d and not the \u201clanguage\u201d in which they are written, are copyrightable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">(3) 1-2-3 has a macro capability or facility that allows a user to \u201cwrite\u201d her or his own macros. When the user writes a macro, he or she is actually writing a kind of computer \u201cprogram.\u201d <em>See </em>1-2-3 Release 1A User\u2019s Manual at 117 (macro \u201cfacility gives the 1-2-3 user a true programming capability\u201d) (Tr. Ex. 72); 1-2-3 Release 2.01 User\u2019s Manual at 3-10 (\u201c1-2-3 includes a number of macro commands that create a powerful programming language\u201d) (Tr. Ex. 72B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">(5) The macro, or \u201cprogram,\u201d that the user writes may be copyrightable if original and nonobvious. The \u201clanguage\u201d in which the macro is written is never copyrightable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">(6) Thus, when defendants copied the menu command hierarchy from 1-2-3, they did not copy a copyrightable element that embodied expression, but rather, copied only the \u201cmacro facility language\u201d of 1-2-3, a non-copyrightable element in the public domain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">The vulnerable steps of this argument include, at a minimum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">(1) That \u201clanguage\u201d has a single, invariable meaning in all discourse about \u201clanguages\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">(2) That not only languages such as English and French but all other languages as well \u2014 including Esperanto, and <em>Reiss\u2019 </em>coined words, 276 F. at 718, and Pascal\u2014 are automatically ineligible for copyright protection (as to vulnerability of this step of the argument, defendants, though invited at trial to do so, have cited no precedent that supports the contention that a \u201clanguage,\u201d even if original, is not copyrightable);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">(3) That \u201clanguage\u201d and \u201csets of statements or instructions\u201d are opposites, and never the twain shall meet \u2014 that is, anything that is a \u201cset of statements or instructions\u201d is not a \u201cprogramming language,\u201d and anything that is a \u201cprogramming language\u201d is not \u201ca set of instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">Just to state these implicit elements of defendants\u2019 argument is sufficient to demonstrate that the argument depends on arbitrary definitions of words, adopted for undisclosed reasons. In human experience, words have variable meanings; dictionaries seldom list a single definition for a word. An argument that depends on the proponents\u2019 undisclosed definitions of words\u2014 and even different definitions as a word is used in different steps of the argument\u2014 becomes a word game that obscures the substantive meaning of the argument and is an obstruction rather than an aid to the court\u2019s use of the adversary process to inform and thus improve decisionmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Having explored the argument fully to try to understand its true nature, I conclude that defendants\u2019 \u201clanguage\u201d argument about the macro facility of Lotus 1-2-3, like defendants\u2019 \u201cuseful article\u201d argument examined in Part IV(a), <em>infra, </em>is totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\n<em>C. Policy Arguments for Bright-Line Rules</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">One of the themes in defendants\u2019 bundle of policy arguments is a plea for bright-line certainty. Indeed, it is a persistent theme throughout defendants\u2019 submissions: Software developers would like to know what they may and what they must not copy. The idea-expression distinction, defendants argue, fails to achieve this policy goal; therefore, the court should adopt instead the bright-line literal-nonliteral distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The yearning for certainty is not unique to this case or to copyright law. But certainty has a price. It reflects a hope that the court will apply hard-and-fast rules despite circumstances that cry out for a judgmental standard of decisionmaking that takes account of circumstances an impartial observer would think relevant to a \u201cjust\u201d disposition of the case \u2014 which, after all, is one of the declared objectives of the legal system. <em>E.g. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 1 (\u201cjust, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The more deeply one probes, whether as lawyer or judge, or as an interested observer or critic of the legal system, the clearer it becomes that in many circumstances hard-and-fast rules, despite their initial attractiveness and false promise of certainty, have consequences that offend one\u2019s sense of justice. For example, hard-and-fast rules, because they allow for little or no evaluation and discretion, sometimes fail to take account of the competing values underlying the relevant law, and fail even to attempt to find an accommodation that serves conflicting high-value interests as well as possible, and at the lowest possible detriment to each. Professionals in law are forced by the nature of their work to do more probing into the disadvantages of bright-line rules than other observers generally are likely to do. For this reason, professionals are less likely than other observers to expect decisionmaking based on hard-and-fast rules that, in hindsight, seems arbitrarily to disregard relevant circumstances and to deserve the pejorative label \u201clegalistic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">In this case, defendants have nevertheless proposed a bright-line rule that would extend copyright only to source code and object code, and never to nonliteral elements of computer programs. That proposal must be rejected. Not only is the proposed distinction contrary to the statutory mandates discussed throughout this Opinion, but also, it reflects the false hopes that are endemic to trying to apply bright-line rules where judgmental, evaluative standards are more appropriate. <em>Nichols, </em>45 F.2d at 121; <em>Peter Pan Fabrics, </em>274 F.2d at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">In any event, as noted in Part II, Congress could have constitutionally drawn defendants\u2019 proposed bright-line \u2014 providing protection only to computer program code and not to nonliteral elements of computer programs \u2014 but Congress has not done so. Without a congressional mandate, it would be an abuse of authority for this court, in deciding this case, to use a bright-line test of copyrightability that makes the literalnonliteral distinction decisive. Instead, the court must adjudicate within the area of protection mandated by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">\n<em>D. Opinion Evidence and Premises of Legal Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Defendants, though disavowing any intent to invite the court to engage in lawmaking, have goiie to extraordinary lengths in this case to advance policy arguments that a court can appropriately consider only if, in order to decide the case <em>sub judice, </em>it must answer previously unanswered questions about the meaning of relevant constitutional, statutory, and judicial sources of authority. Whether such a determination of previously undetermined meaning of an authoritative declaration is described as lawmaking, as I believe it to be, or instead in some other way \u2014 for example, as determining what \u201cold statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>have since become\u201d in circumstances materially different from those existing when the statute was enacted, R. Dworkin, <em>Law\u2019s Empire, </em>248-50 (1986) \u2014 is of less consequence than how a court goes about deciding meaning for the case at hand. What \u201cfacts\u201d or \u201cevidence\u201d shall the court consider? Shall the court consider expert opinions about what the circumstances were at the time the statute was enacted, and how they differ now?</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Defendants\u2019 submissions have failed to address directly these basic questions about the appropriate role of courts. Implicitly, however, they have asked the court to consider policy arguments as freely as if the court were under no constraints in this respect. Defendants, for example, offered the following opinion testimony of a witness qualified as an expert in computer software development:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">If the law is interpreted to say that a developer may not make a new program that can use the data files and inputs accepted by existing programs, then computer advancement as we know it will be slowed____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">I believe that such a decision would throw the entire software industry into confusion____ [T]here would be a chilling effect on development and advancement in many areas____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">This case has implications about whether or not new, improved programs can read and execute data users created for themselves with an older program. The quantity of data to be affected by this decision is ineomprehensively vast. It is not a case about \u201ccheap copies\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">If aspects of screen displays that are governed by functionality (such as a command language like the 1-2-3 command structure) are held to be within the scope of copyright protection, then progress in application and systems computer programs could be dramatically slowed in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Bricklin Affdvt. 1111176-77, 179-80. <em>See also </em>Samuelson &amp; Glushko, <em>Comparing the Views of Lawyers and User Interface Designers, </em>30 Jurimetrics at 137 (concluding on basis of survey that leading user interface designers oppose strong copyright protection for elements of a user interface because such protection would be harmful, rather than helpful, to the industry).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">By rulings during trial, the court received opinion evidence of this kind into the \u201crecord\u201d in the broadest sense, even though excluding it from consideration in relation to any material adjudicative fact that might be in dispute. Not surprisingly, defendants, though explicitly invited to do so, were never able to identify any \u201cadjudicative fact\u201d question, as that term is used in Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, to which opinion evidence such as this would be relevant. The court nevertheless received this evidence, over plaintiff\u2019s objection on the ground of irrelevance, because courts are free to consider \u201cevidence\u201d of this type when deciding \u201clegislative\u201d (or \u201cpremise\u201d) facts. That is, courts may consider such evidence to resolve disputable assertions of an evaluative nature (either about the past or about the future) or assertions about historical facts, or predictions about future consequences of adopting one or another rule of law, as premises for deciding what legal ruling to make. <em>Cf </em>F.R.E. 201(a), Notes of Advisory Committee (explaining \u201clegislative facts\u201d). <em>See also In re Asbestos Litigation, </em>829 F.2d 1233, 1245-52 (3d Cir.1987) (concurring opinion of Becker, J.), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1029, 108 S.Ct. 1586, 99 L.Ed.2d 901 (1988). This is not to say, however, that either the trial court that allows the evidence to be received into the record or an appellate court on review is limited by the rules of admissibility and the standards of review that apply to disputed issues of \u201cadjudicative\u201d fact. <em>Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, </em>264 U.S. 543, 548, 44 S.Ct. 405, 406, 68 L.Ed. 841 (1924) (\u201cthe Court may ascertain as it sees fit any fact that is merely a ground for laying down a rule of law\u201d). <em>Cf.

Innovation has been the key to market success____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\"><em>Second, </em>to the extent that defendants attempt to characterize this struggle as pitting large heartless corporate giants against lonely and defenseless developers working out of their dens and basements, the defendants do not understand what is at stake here. If the elements of a computer program at issue here were to lose their copyright protection, the biggest losers of all would be the small developers. The history of this industry has been one of creative designers who identify an unfilled need in the market and then design and build a superior product to fill that need____ [T]he developers\u2019 ability to realize substantial rewards for their creative efforts has depended entirely upon the legal protection copyright has afforded their work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">If the defendants could rewrite the law, however, those days would be over. The first time a developer demonstrated an attractive new product at Comdex or Softeach or some other industry gathering, hundreds of programmers in corporate research laboratories around the world would set to work creating their own versions of the program to compete with the original. A major firm, with a staff of talented programmers, could fairly promptly create a clone of almost any new program and, in so doing, rob the author of much of the value of his creative efforts. The original author might have a head start, but that would provide little comfort once the major firms hit the market with their \u201cnew\u201d products____ If copying were legal, the creators would lose out. It is - as simple as that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-13\">It is no accident that the world\u2019s strongest software industry is found in the United States, rather than in some other jurisdiction which provides weaker protection for computer programs. Thesystem is working, and there is no reason to change it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s Post-Trial Brief at 87-89; <em>see also </em>Tarter Deck \u00b6\u00b6 72-73 (Docket No. 289) (\u201c[Interface design represents one of the most crucial aspects of software design.

For this reason, it has little, if any, value in illuminating issues of law presented in this case. It is relevant, of course, that both the text and history of the copyright law manifest a purpose of encouraging innovation and of doing so through copyright protection. At the time of congressional action, however \u2014 even as late as the 1976 Act and the 1980 amendments \u2014 it was not possible to know how the computer programming industry would change over the ensuing years, and what exact scope of protection would best advance the policy goals in newly developed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>and now foreseeably developing circumstances. In light of that uncertainty, shall the court consider expert opinions about what the law ought to be today? What if those opinions appear to be inconsistent with the accommodation, struck by the statute now in effect, among competing and to some extent conflicting public policy justifications for broader or narrower copyright protection?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">I conclude that a court would be going well beyond even the precedents most receptive to consideration of legislative history if it took into account expert opinions of persons experienced in the field of computer software development that are manifestly inconsistent with the accommodation that Congress struck when it enacted the Copyright Act of 1976 and the most recent amendments of the copyright law. In the 1976 Act, Congress manifested an intention to encourage innovation in the computer programming field, and to do so through copyright law that explicitly gives substantial protection to innovative <em>expression </em>in intellectual \u201cworks,\u201d including computer programs. Congress made this decision despite expert testimony that extending copyright protection to computer programs might have \u201cdisastrous consequences ... on standardization in electronic data processing,\u201d <em>Copyright Law Revision: Hearings on S. 597 Before the Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, </em>90th Congress, 1st Session 589 (1967) (Testimony of Professor Anthony Oettinger), despite academic criticism of the decision to extend copyright protection to computer programs, Breyer, <em>Uneasy Case for Copyright, </em>84 Harv.L.Rev. at 340-351 (concluding that \u201c[cjomputer programs should not receive copyright protection at the present time\u201d), and despite explicit proposals that copyright protect only \u201cthe instructions themselves\u201d while leaving others free to otherwise \u201creplicate [another\u2019s] program exactly.\u201d <em>Hearings on S. 597 </em>at 571-73 (Statement of EDUCOM) (\u201cBroad copyright protection for programs is unwise and improper ... [H]ad programming been constantly carried out under the threat of infringement actions charging plagiarism of existing copyrighted programs, it is doubtful whether the growth of programs and programming techniques of recent years would have been possible.\u201d); The 1980 amendments, too, plainly went farther in protecting the interests of the creators of an original software product than defendants\u2019 experts now propose (and than some experts at the time proposed, <em>e.g., </em>CONTU, <em>Final Report </em>at 56-76 (Hersey, C., dissenting)), even though they did not go as far as proposed by others to whose views Congress then had access.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">When a court determines the meaning of the copyright statute in a new context, different from what could have been known to even the most prescient observer at the time Congress acted, the court must respect the congressional mandate \u2014 especially with respect to congressional determinations of premise facts\u2014 and is constrained to search not for what the court might now independently consider to be the best accommodation of competing interests but instead to determine an accommodation in this new context that is consistent with the accommodation that Congress enacted for the context to which it spoke. To the extent that expert opinions illumine the comparison between the context to which Congress spoke (the circumstances of software development then existing and predictable future circumstances) and the current context (the changing circumstances of software development now existing and now predictable for the future) the court may and should take them into account. To the extent, however, that expert opinions propose solutions inconsistent with the congressional accommodation, they must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">On the basis of the complete record now before me, I conclude that defendants\u2019 policy arguments in this case are inconsistent with the accommodation struck by Congress in passing the Copyright Act and its amendments. Moreover, defendants have not demonstrated any significant changes in the premise facts upon which Congress acted, and upon which CONTU rested its recommendations. If anything, user interfaces have become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>more expressive and more communicative since 1976 and 1980. I thus conclude that I must disregard defendants\u2019 experts\u2019 predictions of doom for the computer programming industry if copyright is extended to the user interface and other nonliteral elements of computer programs that embody expression, just as Congress disregarded Professor Oettinger\u2019s gloomy prediction of \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d and Commissioner Hersey\u2019s dissent. Rather, this legal issue must be resolved in such a way as to extend copyright protection, clearly and unequivocally, to those nonliteral elements of computer programs that embody original expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\n<em>E. Defendants\u2019 Policy Arguments Founded On the OTSOG Principle</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">One more of defendants\u2019 policy arguments deserves attention. Despite statutory mandates supporting the conclusion that elements of the user interface of 1-2-3 are copyrightable, defendants argue that the need to achieve compatibility and standardization compels rejection of that conclusion on policy grounds. Copyrightability of a user interface, they argue, will frustrate the public interest in allowing programmers to achieve innovation by \u201cborrowing\u201d and improving upon ideas of other programmers, and will undermine attempts to achieve compatibility and standardization among different programs. Especially in the vital area of user interfaces, defendants contend, copyrightability will have adverse consequences on encouraging innovation and on the broader public welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Defendants\u2019 general contention \u2014 that \u201cProgress of Science and useful Arts\u201d cannot occur unless authors and inventors are' privileged to build upon earlier progress and earlier innovation \u2014 has long been a virtually unchallenged premise in all branches of the law of intellectual property. An early expression of the point is Newton\u2019s declaration: \u201cIf I have seen further it is by standing on ye sholders of Giants.\u201d Sir Isaac Newton, Letter to Robert Hooke, February 5, 1675/1676, <em>quoted in </em>R. Merton, <em>On the Shoulders of Giants: A Shandean Postscript </em>31 (1965).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This principle, which Merton has referred to as \u201cOTSOG\u201d (based on the modernized \u201con the shoulders of giants\u201d), <em>id. </em>at 270, is also firmly established in our case law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">In truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if any, things, which in an abstract sense, are strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known and used before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-11\"><em>Emerson v. Davies, </em>8 F.Cas. 615, 619 (C.C. D.Mass.1845) (No. 4,436) (Story, J.). <em>See also Ecclesiastes </em>1:9-10 (\u201c[Tjhere is no new thing under the sun. Men may say of something, \u2018Ah, this is new!\u2019 \u2014 but it existed long ago before our time.\u201d). Defendants, however, attempt to squeeze something from the OTSOG cornerstone that is not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">Two possible applications of OTSOG in the field of computer programming are relevant to this case. First, innovation in computer programming is advanced as each programmer builds upon the ideas of previous programmers. Second, some of the innovative ideas may be expressed in a particular way that is so effective or efficient that the expression becomes standardized throughout the field even though the idea is capable of being expressed in other ways \u2014 that is, even though the particular expression is not an essential detail to every expression of the idea. Although both of these corollaries of OTSOG are impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tant to the future of computer programming, neither was embraced by Congress (as explained below) in such a way as to override the public interest in conferring upon an author a right to a limited monopoly in the author\u2019s \u201cwork.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The metaphorical \u201cshoulders of giants\u201d on which successors may legally stand are not as broad as defendants contend. The legally relevant shoulders of programming giants are their ideas \u2014 and do not extend to all of their expressions. The encouragement of innovation requires no more. It is sufficient that programmers are privileged to borrow and improve upon previous ideas \u2014 such as the ideas for an electronic spreadsheet and a two-line moving cursor menu. Adequate room for innovation remains even though successors are barred from copying earlier authors\u2019 particular expressions \u2014 such as the particular structure, sequence, and organization of a menu command system. <em>Pearl Systems, 8 </em>U.S.P. Q.2d at 1525.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Of course, if a previous programmer\u2019s idea can be expressed in only one or a limited number of ways \u2014 such as the rotated \u201cL\u201d screen display or the use of the slash key to invoke the menu command system \u2014 then the expression, too, may be copied. <em>Morrissey, </em>379 F.2d at 678-79. Where, in contrast, the idea is capable of countless ways of being expressed, only inexpensive cloning, and not innovation, would be advanced by allowing programmers to copy the particular way the ideas have been expressed by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The second corollary of the \u201cOTSOG\u201d principle relevant to this case concerns standardization. Defendants have argued that 1-2-3, and specifically, 1-2-3\u2019s menu structure and macro command facility, has set a <em>de facto </em>industry standard for all electronic spreadsheets. Thus, defendants had no choice, they argue, but to copy these expressive elements from 1-2-3. Had they not copied these elements (including the macro facility), users, who had been trained in 1-2-3 and had written elaborate macros to run on 1-2-3 spreadsheets, would be unwilling to switch to VP-Planner. VP-Planner would be a commercial failure. Neither the factual nor the legal predicate of the argument is supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">First, defendants\u2019 argument ignores the commercial success of Excel, an innovative spreadsheet program that is not compatible with 1-2-3, either in its menu structure or in its macro command facility. Also, defendants argument ignores the alternatives to direct copying that were legally available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">As already explained, to the extent that VP-Planner was concerned with compatibility for macros written originally for 1-2-3, VP-Planner could have provided for a translation device that could read 1-2-3 macros and convert them, automatically, into macros that could be run on VP-Planner. Microsoft Corporation successfully included such a capability in Excel and Lotus itself has written such a capability for translating macros among different-language versions of 1-2-3. Defendants have not offered persuasive evidence to show that they could not have done the same with VP-Planner. That \u201c[i]t would have been an extremely complicated task\u201d and would have cost defendants more to do so, Dauphinais Affdvt. \u00b6 163, is not a reason for denial of copyright protection to 1-2-3. Copyright protection always has consequences of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Moreover, to the extent that VP-Planner is an incremental improvement upon 1-2-3 because of its multidimensional database capabilities, defendants could have (1) sought a license to use 1-2-3\u2019s menu structure and command facility; (2) offered to sell their new expression of ideas to Lotus for inclusion in future versions of 1-2-3; or (3) marketed VP-Planner as an \u201cadd-in\u201d to 1-2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">An \u201cadd-in\u201d program is a program designed to be used in conjunction with another program. For example, HAL is a program that is used in conjunction with 1-2-3 \u2014 a user must have both HAL and 1-2-3 \u2014 which allows a 1-2-3 user to enter commands in simple sentences such as \u201ccopy column B to E\u201d rather than by selecting commands from the menus. Tr. Ex. 176. To encourage the creation of add-in programs (which, in turn, make 1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>2-3 a more attractive program to potential customers), Lotus has published a product called Lotus Developer Tools that helps developers write add-in programs. Tr. Ex. 138. Thus, even if. defendants found the first two alternatives unattractive or unattainable (for example, because of Lotus\u2019 nonconsent except on unfavorable terms, <em>see Stewart, </em>110 S.Ct. at 1764 (\u201ca copyright owner has the capacity arbitrarily to refuse to license one who seeks to exploit the work\u201d)), they could have marketed their multidimensional database capability as an \u201cadd-in\u201d for those users interested in that capability. Transaction and marketing costs of the third option would tend to screen out the new product unless its innovative features made it very attractive to potential users, but this functional effect of copyright law would be entirely consistent with the objects and policies of that law as manifested in the copyright statute and judicial precedents. By instead selling a stand-alone product that completely replaces 1-2-3, defendants have not merely sold and profited from only their incremental additional expression. Rather, they seek permission to profit also from copying Lotus\u2019 protected expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Defendants\u2019 standardization argument is flawed for another reason as well. As explained above, one object of copyright law is to protect expression in order to encourage innovation. It follows, then, that the more innovative the expression of an idea is, the more important is copyright protection for that expression. By arguing that 1-2-3 was so innovative that it occupied the field and set a <em>de facto </em>industry standard, and that, therefore, defendants were free to copy plaintiff\u2019s expression, defendants have flipped copyright on its head. Copyright protection would be perverse if it only protected mundane increments while leaving unprotected as part of the public domain those advancements that are more strikingly innovative. .</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Finally, the entire argument about standardization may be questioned on a more fundamental ground. Defendants have cited no statutory provision or precedent that has ever declared that standardization, when not achieved <em>de jure, </em>is necessarily in the public\u2019s best interest. The court is aware of no such precedent or legislative mandate. A moment\u2019s reflection is enough to disclose that the public interest in extensive standardization is a sharply debatable issue. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tarter Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-45; <em>cf. </em>the QWERTY typewriter keyboard (discussed in Farrell, <em>Standardization and Intellectual Property, </em>30 Jurimetrics 35, 36-38 (1989)). Decisive against defendants\u2019 contention, in any event, is that the particular way they propose that the court resolve this dispute would reduce copyright protection far below the mandate of the copyright act.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">VIII. OTHER DEFENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">\n<em>A. Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Section 411 of Title 17 provides that an infringement action may not be brought unless the author has applied for registration of the copyright. If the application is denied, the infringement action may not be brought unless the author serves a copy of the complaint on the Register of Copyrights. \u201cCopyright registration under \u00a7 411(a) is a [jurisdictional] condition precedent to filing an infringement action.\u201d <em>Quincy Cablesystems, Inc. v. Sully\u2019s Bar, Inc., </em>650 F.Supp. 838, 850 (D.Mass.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Defendants argue that plaintiff\u2019s allegations of copyright .infringement in 1-2-3\u2019s user interface are, in reality, allegations of copyright infringement in 1-2-3\u2019s \u201cscreen displays.\u201d Defendants further argue that plaintiff\u2019s registration certificate for 1-2-3 covers only the literal code of 1-2-3, that plaintiff has failed to register, the \u201cscreen displays\u201d of 1-2-3 as separate audiovisual works, and that this court consequently lacks jurisdiction over allegations of infringement of the \u201cscreen displays\u201d of 1-2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">This contention borders on the frivolous. First, I emphatically reject defendants\u2019 premise, based on yet another word game, that equates the user interface of 1-2-3 with 1-2-3\u2019s \u201cscreen displays.\u201d In ruling that defendants have infringed plaintiff\u2019s copyright, I have not ruled that defendants are liable because they copied the \u201cscreen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>displays\u201d of 1-2-3. Rather,' I have concluded that defendants copied protected nonliteral elements of expression in the user interface and the underlying computer program.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Second, I conclude that, in any event, plaintiff\u2019s registration certificates are sufficient to extend to the \u201cscreen displays\u201d of 1-2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">By focusing only on \u201cscreen displays,\u201d defendants have failed to take due notice of the statutory language as it bears on whether copyrightable elements of computer programs include the \u201cuser interface\u201d and other nonliteral aspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Depending on the sense in which the phrase \u201cscreen display\u201d is used, it may be quite correct to say that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMa\">copyright protection of a computer program does not extend to screen displays generated by the program____ This distinction results from the fact that the same screen can be created by a variety of separate and independent computer programs. It is somewhat illogical to conclude that a screen can be a \u201ccopy\u201d of many different programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-8\"><em>Softklone, </em>659 F.Supp. at 455-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">It is not, though, the screen display itself, in this narrow sense, that is a copyrightable \u201ccomputer program\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201ca set of statements or instructions ... to bring about a certain result,\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The screen display, understood in this narrow sense, is useless for this purpose unless it is integrated with other parts of the computer program so as to become indirectly part of the means by which the user communicates instructions through the total program to bring about the desired result. Thus, the copyrightable element is not, strictly speaking, the screen display, narrowly understood, but the literal and nonliteral elements of not only the display but also the distinctive way of creating it. Indeed, the <em>Softklone </em>court recognized this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">Therefore, it is this court\u2019s opinion that a computer program\u2019s copyright protection ' does not extend to the program\u2019s screen displays, and that copying of a program\u2019s screen displays, without evidence of copying of the program\u2019s source code, object code, <em>sequence, organization, or structure, </em>does not state a claim of infringement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">659 F.Supp. at 456 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">Accordingly, just as using different dialogue does not sanitize from claims of infringement a play that copies the plot and characters from some other copyrighted work with resulting substantial similarity, the fact that the screen display <em>could </em>easily be created in. many other ways \u2014 either to perform the same or to perform very different functions \u2014 does not sanitize it from claims of copyright infringement. The critical question, instead, is whether copyright protection is available against creating and using such a screen display\u2014 including the manifestation of structure, sequence, and organization in that display \u2014 as a part of the \u201cset of statements or. instructions\u201d in a program that is designed \u201cto be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">In any event, it is appropriate to consider \u201cscreen displays\u201d in a broader sense that also includes the structure, sequence, and organization of the underlying program as manifested in the menus presented on the screen displays. I conclude that plaintiff\u2019s certificates of copyright registration in the \u201centire work\u201d of 1-2-3 are sufficient to extend copyright protection to the \u201cscreen displays,\u201d in this-broader sense, of Lotus 1-2-3. <em>See </em>TX 1-233-501 (Tr.

As Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>gress recognized, however, the seven distinct categories of copyrightable works that are listed as examples in section 102(a) are not mutually exclusive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">The items are ... overlapping in the sense that a work falling within one class may encompass works coming within some or all of the other categories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU4\">House Report at 53, <em>reprinted at </em>5666.

Some computer programmers, however \u2014 notably authors of video games \u2014 have instead registered for copyright the screen displays created by the program. <em>Stem Electronics, </em>669 F.2d at 855 (plaintiff \u201ceschewed registration of its program as a literary work and chose instead to register the sights and sounds of [the video game] as an audiovisual work\u201d); <em>M.

This form of registration is particularly appropriate where the chief function, and the bulk of creative expression, of a particular computer program is the creation of a series of pictorial images on the computer screen as .with video games.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Other authors of computer programs have applied for dual registrations for computer programs \u2014 one \u201cliterary\u201d registration to cover the code, and a separate \u201caudiovisual\u201d registration to cover the screen displays. <em>See Softklone, </em>659 F.Supp. at 455-56. This practice has since been rejected by the Copyright Office as duplicative. <em>See </em>Library of Congress, Copyright Office, <em>Registration of Computer Screen Displays, </em>Docket No. 87-4, 53 Fed.Reg. 21,817 (1988) (\u201call copyrightable expression owned by the same claimant and embodied in a computer program, including computer screen displays, is considered a single work and should by registered on a single application form\u201d); Copyright Office, \u201cComputer Programs and Related Screen Displays\u201d (Tr.

Defendants have failed to sustain either part of that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">According to defendants, beginning as early as April 30, 1985, \u201cthe trade press trumpeted Paperback\u2019s soon-to-be-released spreadsheet product [VP-Planner], making no secret that it would look and work like Lotus 1-2-3.\u201d Defendants\u2019 Post-Trial Brief at 120. VP-Planner was eventually released on October 30, 1985, but, defendants\u2019 charge, Lotus waited until January 12, 1987, 438 days later, to bring suit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Even if Lotus did wait fourteen-and-a-half months after learning of VP-Planner\u2019s release before commencing this litigation, I find that this delay was neither unreasonable nor inexcusable. Defendants cite <em>Worcester Brewing Corp. v. Rueter &amp; Co., </em>157 F. 217, 219 (1st Cir.1907), for the proposition that a fifteen-month delay barred plaintiff\u2019s trademark infringement damage claim. That case, though, involved a relatively simple claim that defendant infringed plaintiff\u2019s trademark \u201cSterling Ale.\u201d Here, as evidenced by the court\u2019s lengthy Opinion, plaintiff\u2019s claim of copyright infringement in nonliteral elements of the user interface of 1-2-3 was a far more complicated claim, and one that required much more time to evaluate and prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">In circumstances such as these, a delay of fourteen-and-a-half months is not only reasonable, but, in fact, is likely to serve both party and public interests in appropriate use of public and private resources for resolution of disputes. As plaintiff aptly asserts: \u201cPrudent business judgment, Rule 11 and basic common sense required Lotus first to ascertain that the threat to its intellectual property interest was serious and that its legal position was sound before filing suit.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Post-Trial Brief at 83. <em>See </em>Manzi Deck \u00b6\u00b6 8-11 (Docket No. 293); <em>Roulo v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co., Inc., </em>886 F.2d 931, 942 (7th Cir.1989) (twenty-one-month delay in filing infringement suit reasonable where \u201cdelay in filing was due to [plaintiff\u2019s] inquiry into the facts to determine the merit of her claim against [defendant]\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 1124, 107 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">Defendants nevertheless argue that, during the fourteen-and-a-half-month delay, plaintiff at least had a duty to notify defendants that plaintiff considered VP-Planner objectionable and that plaintiff intended to claim proprietary rights in 1-2-3\u2019s user interface. Not only did plaintiff fail to so notify defendants, defendants assert, but, in fact, plaintiff affirmatively led defendants to infer that VP-Planner was not objectionable. Accordingly, defendants contend, plaintiff is estopped from recovering against defendant. Defendants\u2019 Post-Trial Brief at 131 n. 66 <em>(citing Precious Metals Associates, Inc. v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, </em>620 F.2d 900, 908 (1st Cir.1980) (\u201c \u2018A person is estopped from denying the consequences of his conduct where the conduct has been such as to induce another to change his position in good faith or such that a reasonable man would rely upon the representations made.\u2019 \u201d) (in turn <em>quoting Bergeron v. Mansour, </em>152 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1945))).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">In support of this contention, defendants cite a form letter that plaintiff\u2019s Supervisor of the Information Center sent to Paperback in January 1986 inquiring as to wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>er Lotus could use its copy of VP-Planner at any location at plaintiff\u2019s business. Tr. Ex. 201. Defendants argue that this letter \u201csuggested that Lotus treated VP-Planner as it treated any other non-objectionable software product.\u201d Defendants\u2019 Post-Trial Brief at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">First, defendants have failed to offer any evidence that they did, in fact, draw that inference. Indeed, Steven Cook, Paperback\u2019s former president, testified that the form letter was simply returned to plaintiff with the appropriate box checked, and that Paperback did not even retain a copy of the letter. Cook Affdvt. \u00b6 24 (Docket No. 299). Second, the court is unable to fathom how any reasonable person could draw that inference from Lotus\u2019 form letter. In any event, defendants have cited no authority to support the proposition that Lotus\u2019 letter, and Lotus\u2019 failure to notify defendants of its internal investigation into possible legal action during the fourteen-and-a-half month hiatus, constitute the kind of actions that support laches or equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Another reason that defendants have failed to sustain a laches defense is that they have failed to demonstrate, any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">At the core of defendants\u2019 asserted prejudice is the following contention advanced by Paperback\u2019s former president:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">If Lotus had sued Paperback within three or four months after the release of VP-Planner, then Paperback would not have continued to market, sell, or develop VP-Planner in its Lotus-compatible form, whether or not the litigation had any merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Cook Affdvt. If 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">In light of defendants\u2019 belief that their spreadsheet product, to be successful, had to be compatible with 1-2-3, and defendants\u2019 strident insistence that 1-2-3\u2019s user interface is not copyrightable, this contention is simply not credible. In hindsight, perhaps, the expense of this lawsuit looms immense, but the court does not credit the testimony that the mere threat of a lawsuit, especially one that defendants' assert they deemed frivolous, would have caused defendants' to retreat from marketing a 1-2-3 \u201cworkalike\u201d spreadsheet program. I find that defendants have not shown that they were prejudiced by any delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Accordingly, I find that defendants have failed to sustain either element of a laches defense, or an equitable estoppel defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">IX. RESERVED RULINGS ON OBJECTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Although ruling on most evidentiary objections during the trial, the court reserved ruling on some Rule 402 objections until after the court had an opportunity to consider the relevance of certain evidence in the context of the entire case. Most notable is evidence proffered by defendants with respect to VisiCalc, which plaintiff asserted was irrelevant to any issues raised by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">Although I agree that the \u201cVisi-Calc story,\u201d in the decisionmaking process reflected in this Opinion, has turned out to be not relevant to any of the equitable defenses, and not relevant to defendants\u2019 contention that Lotus itself copied aspects of VisiCalc with 1-2-3, I conclude that the \u201cVisiCalc story\u201d is relevant for background purposes. <em>See Granite Music Corp. v. United Artists Corp., </em>532 F.2d 718, 720-21 (9th Cir.1976) (admitting evidence of similar musical phrases appearing in works that predate both plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s song proper to show, for background purposes, that certain elements were of such ordinary and common occurrence that the probability of independent coincidental production was great). Also, I conclude that this evidence may appropriately be considered for the purpose of deciding premise facts upon which the conclusions of law with respect to eopyrightability rest. <em>See generally </em>Part VII(D), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">With respect to all other reserved evidentiary rulings, the court concludes that they are moot in view of the findings and rulings stated in this Opinion. Moreover, even if the court were to rule explicitly that all of the evidence was admissible, I find as factfinder that none of this evidence alone, nor all of it taken together, would change any of the findings and conclusions contained in this Opinion. That is, even when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>taken into account, this evidence has so little probative weight that it does not change any finding. Nevertheless, any party wishing an explicit ruling on any reserved evidentiary objection may so move on or before July 19, 1990, identifying specifically each objection on which a more explicit ruling is requested with references, if available, to specific pages in the transcript of the first phase of this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">For the reasons explained in this Opinion and on the findings and conclusions stated, it is hereby ordered:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">(1) Liability for infringement by defendants\u2019 is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">(2) Any party wishing an explicit ruling on any reserved evidentiary objection may so move on or before July 19, 1990, identifying specifically each objection on which a more explicit ruling is requested with references, if available, to specific pages in the transcript of the first phase of this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">(3) A conference with respect to further proceedings will be held as specified in the Joint Procedural Order of this date.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>APPENDIX 1</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>APPENDIX 2</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>APPENDIX 3</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\">. This case was originally consolidated with <em>Lotus Development Corporation v. Mosaic Software, </em>Civil Action No. 87-74-K, which involves Mosaic's computer spreadsheet program The Twin. Although Phase One of this case was intended to resolve certain additional legal and factual issues concerning the liability of Mosaic Software for plaintiff's claims of copyright infringement, that case was severed on the second day of this first phase of trial for reasons not here relevant. <em>See </em>Docket No. 174 (February 8, 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">.
