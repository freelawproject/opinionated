The resolution also set forth a \u201ccommunity development plan\u201d calling for the city to acquire property in the \u201cblighted area\u201d by appropriation and to sell the acquired property to River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corporation (\u201cRiver Place\u201d) for redevelopment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Defendant is the owner of a parcel of real property located within the area declared blighted by Resolution 135X-80. Defendant\u2019s property consists of a lot measuring approximately eighty-five feet by forty-five feet, on which is located a three-story brick building containing approximately twenty rooming house units.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">In June 1985, defendant\u2019s predecessor-in-interest, AAAA Enterprises, Inc., brought an action against the city seeking a declaratory judgment that the area in which its property was located had been improperly declared a \u201cblighted area\u201d under R.C. 1728.01(E), as well as a permanent injunction against the city\u2019s appropriation of its property. Following two appeals to this court and one appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, both'of these issues were resolved in the city\u2019s favor. <em>AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 553 N.E.2d 597, affirming (Sept. 22, 1988), Franklin App. No. 87AP-876, unreported, 1988 WL 99351; on appeal following remand, (1991) , 74 Ohio App.3d 170, 598 N.E.2d 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">On March 27,1990, the city filed a petition to appropriate defendant\u2019s property. Defendant filed his initial answer on May 24, 1990, and on May 27, 1992, filed an amended answer setting forth ten defenses to the city\u2019s appropriation of his property; the city responded with a motion seeking to have defendant\u2019s defenses stricken on the basis of <em>res judicata. </em>The trial court granted the city\u2019s motion, and thus determined that the city properly could appropriate defendant\u2019s property-</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Following a jury trial to determine the compensation owed to defendant for the loss of his property, the jury returned a verdict awarding defendant $410,000 as fair-market value of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Defendant appeals both the appropriation and compensation aspects of the trial court\u2019s judgment, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u201c1. Error of trial court quashing deposition of builder-developer based on <em>res adjudica </em>[sic] decision in that decision cannot be a mandate for the parties for events that can or will occur with new facts by the parties after the decision. Specifically they are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u201ca. In 1992 developer was in default of his agreement to develop,</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u201cb. in 1992 developer did not have the financial means to carry out the purchases of the land or the financing in place after 12 years to construct the redevelopment,</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u201cc. in 1992 developer was taking land for parking investment purposes and had constructed nothing in 12 of the 20 years, thus causing land to be transferred from present landowners to another private landowner(s)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201c2. Misconduct of witness expert for city using illegal and improper appraisal methods</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u201c3. Verdict against the manifest weight of the evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\u201c4. Misconduct of trier by <em>not </em>allowing jury to (1) take notes and (2) to have for review a method to refresh their memories of trial hearing facts</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">\u201c5. Trial court confusion on the law and thereby causing the jury instructions to be in error and causing error by failure to properly instruct jury when jury had an at law question</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">\u201c6. Ineffective assistence <em>[sic </em>] of counsel to subpoena plaintiffs other appraisals to show city and builder\u2019s improper and illegal appraisal methods of prior land taking to impeach and discredit plaintiff at trial</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">\u201c7. Misconduct of trial court in not allowing the discharge of defendant counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">\u201c8. Ineffective assistence [sic ] of counsel for not admitting into evidence for the jury, defendant\u2019s proposed building model</p>\n<p id=\"b280-17\">\u201c9. Ineffective assistance of counsel and trial court error in not allowing a view by jury of other actual similar already built buildings that were similar to defendant\u2019s proposed building</p>\n<p id=\"b280-18\">\u201c10. Misconduct of trial court and ineffective assistence [sic ] of counsel to apply for a cease and desist order and to grant same while plaintiff threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>defendant with criminal actions in order to gain an advantage in this civil action.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is presented in the context of the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the deposition of River Place\u2019s owner, Bernard Schottenstein. However, the crux of defendant\u2019s argument is that the trial court erroneously found each of his ten defenses to the city\u2019s proposed appropriation to be barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Preliminarily, we note that the lower court, as well as the parties, refer to the city\u2019s argument as <em>res judicata; </em>while this is not incorrect, collateral estoppel more precisely describes the doctrine applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The term <em>res judicata </em>technically encompasses both the doctrines of claim preclusion and issue preclusion. See <em>Whitehead v. Gen. Tel. Co. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 108, 112, 49 O.O.2d 435, 437, 254 N.E.2d 10, 12. However, in ordinary use, the term <em>res judicata </em>generally refers to the doctrine of claim preclusion, while the term collateral estoppel refers to the doctrine of issue preclusion. See <em>Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 75, 77, 104 S.Ct. 892, 894, 79 L.Ed.2d 56, 59, fn. 1. <em>Res judicata </em>(claim preclusion) bars the relitigation of the same cause of action between the same parties. <em>Karam v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 137, 139-140, 27 OBR 169, 171, 500 N.E.2d 358, 361. Collateral estoppel, on the other hand, precludes the relitigation of an issue that actually and necessarily has been litigated and determined in a prior action based on a different cause of action. <em>Whitehead, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Because the prior action brought by defendant was an action for injunction and declaratory judgment and the current action is for appropriation, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>(claim preclusion) does not apply in this case. However, to the extent defendant\u2019s defenses raise issues which were or should have been litigated in his prior action for injunctive and declaratory relief, these defenses are barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <em>DiPaolo v. DeVictor </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 166, 171, 555 N.E.2d 969, 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Defendant\u2019s prior action raised two issues: (1) whether the area in which defendant\u2019s property is located was properly declared a \u201cblighted area,\u201d and (2) whether any future appropriation of defendant\u2019s property located in the \u201cblighted area\u201d in furtherance of the urban renewal plan would amount to an unconstitutional taking of private property for a <em>private </em>use as a result of the city\u2019s plan to sell the appropriated property to private developers. Defendant\u2019s first, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and tenth defenses raise precisely the same two issues. Therefore, those seven defenses were properly found to be barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Defendant\u2019s second, fourth and ninth defenses raise the issue of whether the city\u2019s appropriation of defendant\u2019s property is \u201cnecessary,\u201d an issue which neither was nor could have been raised in the prior action and thus is not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Nonetheless, the trial court properly struck defendant\u2019s defenses relating to that issue, albeit for the wrong reason. Specifically, R.C. 163.08 states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u201c * * * The agency\u2019s right to make the appropriation, the inability of the parties to agree, and <em>the necessity for the appropriation shall be resolved by the court in favor of the agency unless </em>such matters are specifically denied in the answer and <em>the facts relied upon in support of such denial are set forth therein </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Since defendant\u2019s answer lacks any facts to support denial of the city\u2019s claim of necessity, the city is entitled to judgment on the issue of necessity based upon defendant\u2019s failure to properly plead his defenses. See <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(1984), 20 Ohio App.3d 307, 308, 20 OBR 408, 409, 486 N.E.2d 103, 104. Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error relate to the compensation aspects of the trial court\u2019s judgment. In particular, defendant\u2019s third and fifth assignments of error raise the issue of the standard to be used in valuing defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">In testifying on the issue of the value of defendant\u2019s property, the city\u2019s expert appraiser stated that the \u201chighest and best use\u201d of defendant\u2019s property was as a speculative investment property, given the likelihood of future development in the surrounding area, and that the best \u201cinterim use\u201d of defendant\u2019s property was as an office building. Further, when asked to place a value on defendant\u2019s property, the city\u2019s appraiser stated that the property had a value <em>of </em>$236,000 at its \u201chighest and best interim use.\u201d Defendant\u2019s expert, by contrast, set the \u201chighest and best use\u201d of the property to be for speculation, and valued the property at $800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Generally, \u201c[cjompensation for land taken for public use is determined by fair market value of the property on the date of taking * * *.\u201d <em>Masheter v. Ohio Holding Co. </em>(1973), 38 Ohio App.2d 49, 53, 67 O.O.2d 262, 264, 313 N.E.2d 413, 415. In defining fair market value, this court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">\u201cFair market value is the amount of money which could be obtained on the open market at a voluntary sale of the property. It is the amount that a purchaser who is willing, but not required to buy, would pay and that a seller who is willing, but not required to sell, would accept, when both are fully aware and informed of all circumstances involving the value and use of the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Market value is determined by the most valuable and best uses to which the property could reasonably, practically, and lawfully be adapted which is referred to as \u2018the highest and best use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 67 O.O.2d at 264-265, 313 N.E.2d at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Under the foregoing parameters, the city\u2019s expert employed an improper standard in valuing the property according to its \u201chighest and best <em>interim, </em>use,\u201d rather than its \u201chighest and best use.\u201d Defendant, however, raised no objection to the admission of the testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">At the close of the trial, the trial court instructed the jury on the legal standard to be used in determining the value of defendant\u2019s property. Despite the technical correctness of this jury instruction insofar as it defined fair-market value to be the \u201chighest and best use\u201d in accordance with <em>Masheter, </em>the instruction as a whole was somewhat confusing in its mixed references both to present and to future possible uses. Specifically, the trial court instructed:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u201cThere is evidence of possible changes that may take place in the future commercial development. This evidence may be considered only if you find that possible future uses are sufficiently probable that they reflect upon the value of the land as it exists today.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u201cThe evidence of the existing business operations on the premises and of future, possible business uses may be considered in determining the fair market value of the premises. However, the owner is compensated only for the land and building.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\u201cIn this case you became acquainted with the nature, the condition, and the present and possible future uses of the property. You heard opinions of its value. You must consider these facts along with all the evidence, and arrive at an amount that is fair, just and reasonable without prejudice or sympathy for either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">In light of the confusing testimony from the experts, as well as the jury instructions which seem to suggest that the interim use may be a \u201cpresent\u201d use worthy of consideration, questions from the jury perhaps could be anticipated. Indeed, shortly after beginning deliberations, the jury returned a series of questions to the court. The second question asked, \u201cIs the highest possible use only the interim or future ultimate use too?\u201d The trial court\u2019s response to the question instructed the jury to \u201cPlease read the written instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">The jury\u2019s question reflects a confusion regarding the appropriate legal standard for determining fair-market value. Even though the jury\u2019s question presented a legitimate question of law based on the evidence before it, the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question did not guide the jury or clarify the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Defendant\u2019s counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s questions. Defendant, however, attempted an objection, stating \u201cI\u2019m objecting to the comments he [the judge] makes. And I object to the third [sic ]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> comment the judge makes, and that there\u2019s still confusion in the jury instructions in the\u2014 when they ask the question of highest and best use, the jury \u2014 .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Defendant\u2019s failure to object to the city\u2019s expert testimony on \u201cinterim use\u201d during trial did not relieve the trial court of its inherent duty to make certain that the jury clearly understood the correct legal standard to be applied, especially in light of defendant\u2019s attempt to note the error. Like the jury instructions themselves, a trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question regarding matters of law should not only be legally correct, but also should be so explicit as not to be misconstrued or misunderstood by the jury in the proper application of the law to the facts in evidence. See <em>Gallagher v. Cooper </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 41, 43-44, 14 OBR 438, 440, 471 N.E.2d 468, 470; <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Reed </em>(1877), 33 Ohio St. 283, 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In this case, all witnesses agreed that the highest and best use for the property was speculation, or holding the property for future development. Since the jury\u2019s function is to resolve disputed factual issues, the jury in this case did not need to consider the issue of highest and best use, given the lack of factual dispute on the issue. As a result, the trial court should have instructed the jury that the highest and best use was speculation, then submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration the value of the property at the time of trial, given that use. Even if defendant did not object to the instructions as given, on proper objection at the time of the jury\u2019s questions, the trial court should have clarified the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In combination with the foregoing, we note that defendant, prior to closing argument, attempted to discharge his counsel. While the trial court retains some discretion to refuse a party\u2019s request to change counsel which necessarily will cause delay or other prejudice to the opposing party, defendant herein apparently sought to discharge counsel and represent himself, with no delay accruing as a result of his decision. Under the unusual circumstances of this case, we are unable to ascertain any reason defendant should not be able to discharge the counsel he engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">As a result of defendant\u2019s attempt to discharge counsel, which the trial court refused, a mutual approach to trial strategy between defendant and his counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>was lacking at the time the jury\u2019s deliberation questions arose. Given the presence of counsel, the trial court apparently ignored defendant\u2019s attempted objection to the response. Absent defendant\u2019s attempt to discharge counsel, defendant would be deemed to speak through counsel and to have waived objection to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question. However, under the somewhat unique circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow defendant to represent himself, coupled with the trial court\u2019s resulting failure to note defendant\u2019s objection and to eliminate the confusion arising from the jury instruction, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The issue then resolves to whether the error was prejudicial. The jury\u2019s verdict was $410,000, whereas the evidence gave the jury only one figure to consider regarding the undisputed highest and best use for the property: $800,000 posited by defendant\u2019s expert. The jury\u2019s question, however, suggests the jury was influenced by the irrelevant evidence regarding interim use posited by the city and potentially compromise the values given by the city\u2019s expert and defendant\u2019s expert; we cannot know to what extent. While the only evidence of \u201chighest and best use\u201d was $800,000, the jury was not required to accept that testimony, although their verdict suggests they believed it to some degree. Combining the foregoing considerations with the confusion explicitly expressed in the jury\u2019s question, we are compelled to conclude that a different verdict would have been rendered absent the confusion about the appropriate standard for determining fair-market value; thus reversal is appropriate. See <em>Little Miami RR. Co. v. Wetmore </em>(1869), 19 Ohio St. 110, 134. Defendant\u2019s third and fifth assignments of error are sustained to the extent indicated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Our disposition of defendant\u2019s third and fifth assignments of error renders defendant\u2019s second, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth assignments of error moot; therefore, we need not address them. Without addressing the merits thereof, we overrule those assignments of error pursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Having overruled defendant\u2019s first, second, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth assignments of error, but having sustained defendant\u2019s third and fifth assignments of error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part and reversed in part and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-9\">Whiteside and Bowman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">. Given that it was the judge\u2019s second rather than third response which addressed the jury's question regarding the \"highest and best use\u201d standard, defendant apparently misspoke when he referred to the judge\u2019s \u201cthird\u201d comment. In any event, however, the remainder of defendant\u2019s statement is sufficient to constitute an objection to the judge\u2019s response to the jury's question regarding \u201chighest and best use.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
