Varisco, appeals from the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee, Mary E. Varisco. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Andrew is the brother of Alfred Varisco, Mary\u2019s deceased husband. Andrew claims that between March 1980 and March 1981 he lent Alfred $9,260. On April 14, 1983, Alfred died intestate with this claimed debt unpaid. Alfred\u2019s sons, Donald and David Varisco, were named co-administrators of Alfred\u2019s estate by the Medina County Probate Court on May 23, 1983. On February 2, 1984, Donald and David as co-administrators entered into an agreement with Mary in which they would transfer all of Alfred\u2019s real estate to Mary in consideration for Mary assuming all debts of Alfred\u2019s estate. The estate debts listed in this agreement did not include the claimed debt to Andrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In 1986, Andrew filed an action seeking to collect the claimed debt from Mary, Donald and David. During this action, Andrew took Mary\u2019s deposition in November 1986 and Donald\u2019s in January 1987. From these depositions it appears that shortly after Alfred died in 1983, Donald found a small notebook of Alfred\u2019s containing the notation \u201cowed Andrew ninety-two sixty.\u201d According to Donald\u2019s deposition, he and Andrew discussed this notation and Andrew\u2019s claimed debt at Alfred\u2019s funeral. Mary asserted in her deposition that Andrew gave the money to Alfred as a gift and not as a loan. For reasons not contained in the record, Andrew voluntarily dismissed this first action on April 11, 1990, pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On April 4, 1991, Andrew brought this present action against Mary seeking to collect on the claimed debt. On July 8, 1992, Andrew moved for summary judgment. Mary filed a reply to Andrew\u2019s summary judgment motion and additionally moved the court to strike from Andrew\u2019s motion the depositions taken during the first action. Mary also moved for summary judgment. The record indicates that Andrew did not respond to Mary\u2019s motion to strike or her motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">On February 23, 1993, the trial court granted Mary\u2019s motion to strike and her motion for summary judgment. The court found that because Andrew did not present his claim in writing to the co-administrators of Alfred\u2019s estate within three months of their appointment as required by R.C. 2117.06, Andrew\u2019s claim against the estate was barred as a matter of law. Andrew appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Assignment of Error 1</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to consider the depositions filed with the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Andrew argues that under Civ.R. 32(A)(4), the depositions taken in his previous action against Mary, Donald and David could be properly submitted in this present action against Mary because this action involves the same parties and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>subject matter as his first action to collect the claimed debt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record submitted to this court, however, does not indicate that Andrew responded to Mary\u2019s motion to strike or argued against the motion in the trial court based on Civ.R. 32(A)(4). Consequently, it appears that Andrew failed to raise the issue of the applicability of Civ.R. 32(A)(4) in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">A fundamental rule of appellate review is that a reviewing court will not consider as error any issue that a party was aware of but failed to bring to the trial court\u2019s attention. <em>Schade v. Carnegie Body Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 207, 210, 24 O.O.3d 316, 317-318, 436 N.E.2d 1001, 1003. Thus, a party has waived the right to contest an issue on appeal if that issue was in existence prior to or at the time of trial and the party did not raise it at the appropriate time in the court below. <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 22 OBR 199, 202, 489 N.E.2d 277, 279-280; <em>Van Camp v. Riley </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 457, 463, 16 OBR 539, 544-545, 476 N.E.2d 1078, 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Accordingly, because nothing in the record indicates that Andrew raised the application of Civ.R. 32(A)(4) as an issue in the court below, Andrew has waived any error on appeal. Andrew\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Assignment of Error 2</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant-appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard used by the trial court. <em>Parenti v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 826, 829, 586 N.E.2d 1121, 1122-1123. Thus, under Civ.R. 56(C), the entry of summary judgment is proper only if, after viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, the court determines that no genuine issues of material fact remain for trial, entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law because reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion which is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">In granting summary judgment to Mary, the trial court found that as a creditor Andrew did not satisfy the statutory presentment requirements under R.C. 2117.06 because he had failed to present his claim to the co-administrators of Alfred\u2019s estate in writing. Andrew argues that his discussion of the debt with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Donald combined with the fact that Alfred\u2019s notation of the debt was in Donald\u2019s possession amounted to notice and knowledge of the debt by Donald as co-administrator of Alfred\u2019s estate and that this notice and knowledge of the debt substantially complied with the presentment requirements of R.C. 2117.06. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">First, evidence concerning Andrew\u2019s discussion with Donald and Donald\u2019s possession of Alfred\u2019s notation was contained in the depositions stricken by the trial court from Andrew\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Thus, these facts were not before the trial court. Nevertheless, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that these facts were before the trial court, Andrew still failed as a matter of law to satisfy the presentment requirements for a creditor under R.C. 2117.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">At the time of Alfred\u2019s death, R.C. 2117.06 provided in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ll creditors having claims against an estate shall present their claims to the executor or administrator in writing * * * within three months after the date of the appointment of the executor or administrator * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This presentment requirement is mandatory. <em>Fortelka v. Meifert </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 476, 480, 27 O.O.2d 439, 442, 200 N.E.2d 318, 321-322. Moreover, under R.C. 2117.06, only a written presentment provided to the administrator during the statutory time period can constitute the presentment of a claim within the meaning of the statute. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the presentment of a claim in writing to the administrator of an estate is a condition precedent to a creditor bringing suit on that claim. <em>Morgan v. City Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1964), 4 Ohio App.2d 417, 418, 33 O.O.2d 504, 504-505, 212 N.E.2d 822, 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">It is clear from the record in this case that Andrew did not present his claim against Alfred\u2019s estate in writing to Donald or David within three months of their appointment as co-administrators of Alfred\u2019s estate. Andrew, however, relies upon <em>Gerhold v. Papathanasion </em>(1936), 130 Ohio St. 342, 4 O.O. 425, 199 N.E. 353, and <em>Gladman v. Carns </em>(1964), 9 Ohio App.2d 135, 38 O.O.2d 149, 223 N.E.2d 378, to support his argument that he substantially complied with R.C. 2117.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">In <em>Gerhold, </em>the Supreme Court found that the owner of a promissory note did not have to present his claim to the administrator of an estate under G.C. 10509-112, a predecessor section to R.C. 2117.06, where the administrator was already in possession of the note at the time of his appointment. The court, though, specifically limited its holding to the unusual circumstances presented by the case. <em>Gerhold </em>involved two different administrators. The first administrator, a trust company, was in possession of the note and actually made payments to the plaintiff-creditor on the note during the statutory limitation period. The second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>administrator, the decedent\u2019s wife, was a comaker of the note. The court concluded that this was not an ordinary case and that the administrators were in such a position that they could have been expected to have had knowledge of the existence and status of the debt during the limitation period. <em>Id. at 345, 4 </em>O.O. at 426, 199 N.E. at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Unlike the version of R.C. 2117.06 being considered by this court, G.C. 10509-112 did not require that a creditor present his claim in writing. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 4 O.O. at 426, 199 N.E. at 354. Since then, such a requirement has been added to the statute, and the Supreme Court has clearly held that a writing is necessary for the presentment of a claim under R.C. 2117.06. <em>Fortelka, </em>176 Ohio St. at 480, 27 O.O.2d at 442, 200 N.E.2d at 321-322.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Additionally, the unusual facts involved in <em>Gerhold </em>are not present here. Neither Donald or David was a comaker on the claimed debt to Andrew, nor did Donald or David as co-administrators ever make any payments to Andrew on the debt after Alfred\u2019s death. In fact, according to Mary\u2019s deposition, the existence of the debt has always been disputed. Thus, in stark contrast to the facts in <em>Gerhold, </em>the facts here do not indicate that Donald and David could have been expected to have had knowledge of the existence and status of Andrew\u2019s claimed debt during the limitation period. See, also, <em>Devers v. Schreiber </em>(1935), 50 Ohio App. 442, 4 O.O. 183, 198 N.E. 601 (presentment of the plaintiffs claim to the executor was necessary even though the executor had knowledge of the claim and had negotiated with the plaintiff about it); <em>Prudential Ins. Co. v. Joyce Bldg. Realty Co. </em>(App.1943), 44 Ohio Law Abs. 481, 65 N.E.2d 516 (the executor\u2019s listing of a creditor\u2019s claim in the estate\u2019s schedule of debts did not waive the creditor\u2019s obligation of presentment).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Likewise, the decision in <em>Gladman v. Carns </em>is not helpful to Andrew\u2019s argument. The <em>Gladman </em>court, in finding that the plaintiffs presentment was in substantial compliance with the requirements of R.C. 2117.06, adopted the statement in 74 A.L.R. 369 that \u201c[a] claim against a decedent\u2019s estate need not be in any particular form; it is sufficient if it states the character and amount of the claim, enables the representatives to provide for its payment, and serves to bar all other claims by reason of its particularity of designation.\u201d 9 Ohio App.2d at 138, 38 O.O.2d at 152, 223 N.E.2d at 381. Although the opinion is unclear, we believe the <em>Gladman </em>court was referring to the form of the writing used by the plaintiff and not to the form of the presentment itself. Regardless, the controlling case law is clear. Under R.C. 2117.06, the presentment of a creditor\u2019s claim must be in writing. <em>Fortelka, supra, </em>176 Ohio St. at 480, 27 O.O.2d at 442, 200 N.E.2d at 321-322; <em>Morgan, supra, 4 </em>Ohio App.2d at 418, 33 O.O.2d at 504-505, 212 N.E.2d at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court properly found that Andrew did not satisfy the presentment requirements of R.C. 2117.06 as a matter of law. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b586-6\">Quillin, P.J., and Dickinson, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-11\">.
