His conviction was affirmed by this court. He filed a motion to vacate his conviction because he contended that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly investigate the case against him. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion without further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In his single assignment, the appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion without making necessary findings of fact and conclusions of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Findings of fact and conclusions of law are mandatory under R.C. 2958.21 if the trial court dismisses the petition. <em>State v.
