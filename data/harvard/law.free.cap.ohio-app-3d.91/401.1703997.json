Hall, appeals from the court of common pleas\u2019 affirmance of the State Board of Landscape Architect Examiners\u2019 determination that Hall failed section 3 of the Uniform National Examination. Because the common pleas court did not apply the correct standard for an administrative review, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Hall took section 3 of the Uniform National Examination from June 17 to June 19, 1991. He received a score of 85. He needed a score of 94 to pass. On December 6, 1991, Hall appeared before the State Board of Landscape Architect Examiners (the \u201cboard\u201d) and appealed the grading of his exam. The board upheld the original grading.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">On January 2, 1992, Hall appealed the board\u2019s decision to the common pleas court. After hearing the matter, the court remanded the case to the board to make findings of fact. On January 8, 1993, based on the findings of fact, the court raised Hall\u2019s exam score by six points to 91, still a failing score. Hall then argued that the board\u2019s factual determinations as to five of the questions were incorrect because they were not based on reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court determined that in the absence of arbitrary, or capricious grading, it would not substitute its judgment for that of the board and therefore upheld the board\u2019s decision. Hall appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Assignment of Error 1</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\u201cThe lower court erred in holding that it cannot interfere with what the grader of the examination had done unless the record shows that * * * \u2018The questions were improperly, arbitrarily or capriciously graded.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Hall argues in his first assignment of error that the trial court did not apply the correct standard for an administrative review. We agree. The trial court\u2019s order stated in pertinent part:'</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">\u201cIn the absence of arbitrary or capricious grading, a court will not substitute its judgment for that of a professional licensing board as to grades received by an applicant for admission to the practice of a profession. <em>Cox v. State Medical Board of Ohio </em>(1948), 83 Ohio App. 316 [38 O.O. 389, 54 Ohio Law Abs. 244, 83 N.E.2d 648].</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">\u201cThis Court finds no evidence of arbitrary or capricious grading as to questions 9.6, 3.1, 3.2, 6.1, and 6.2. Therefore, this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the Board concerning these disputed questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">Under R.C. 4703.33(A), the board\u2019s authority to control the profession of landscape architecture is governed by R.C. Chapter 119. In reviewing an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>of an administrative agency under R.C. 119.12, the common pleas court\u2019s standard of review generally requires the court to affirm the agency\u2019s order unless it finds that the order is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is not in accordance with the law. <em>Bottoms Up, Inc. v. Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 726, 728, 596 N.E.2d 475, 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Here, the judgment entry indicates that the common pleas court did not apply the proper standard of review. The common pleas court was correct in that as a reviewing court it \u201cmust give due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts\u201d and therefore must not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. <em>Hawkins v. Marion Corr. Inst. </em>(1990), 62 Ohio App.3d 863, 870, 577 N.E.2d 720, 724 (quoting <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>[1980], 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 67, 407 N.E.2d 1265, 1267). However, R.C. 119.12 still requires the court to consider the entire administrative record and any additional evidence the court has admitted in order to determine if the agency\u2019s decision is \u201csupported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.\u201d The court\u2019s judgment entry in this case does not reflect that it made such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Additionally, the common pleas court\u2019s reliance on <em>Cox </em>is misplaced. The standard of review in <em>Cox </em>was whether the medical board had abused its discretion in grading the plaintiff\u2019s exam. 83 Ohio App. at 320, 38 O.O. at 391, 54 Ohio Law Abs. at 248, 83 N.E.2d at 650. Here, the landscape architect board\u2019s authority is statutorily controlled by R.C. 119.12, which specifically provides that the standard of review is reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Thus, the <em>Cox </em>decision is not applicable to the facts in this case. Accordingly, Hall\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Assignment of Error 2</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u201cThe judgment of the lower court is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">R.C. 119.12 does not provide for a \u201cmanifest weight\u201d standard in administrative appeals. <em>Bottoms Up, Inc., supra. </em>Hall\u2019s second assignment of error, therefore, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Because the common pleas court did not apply the proper standard of administrative review under R.C. 119.12, its judgment entry is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-12\">Cook, P.J., and Baird, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
