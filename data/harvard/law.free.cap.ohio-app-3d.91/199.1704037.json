Richard, Sr. (hereinafter \u201cappellant\u201d) brought this action for malicious prosecution against Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Clark Rice. Appellant alleged that Rice knowingly allowed two witnesses to perjure themselves in connection with the criminal prosecution brought against him for the alleged felonious assault of Donnie Garner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted Rice\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis of absolute prosecutorial immunity. For reasons which follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred and/or abused its discretion when subsequent to denying the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss (based upon immunity) the court vacated the order and improperly granted the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss where the appellee was sued in his individual capacity as is expressly set forth in the complaint at 5, thus the instant action was brought in the appellee\u2019s personal capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>In <em>Imbler v. Pachtman </em>(1974), 424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128, the Supreme Court held that a prosecutor enjoys absolute immunity against suit for actions which are performed pursuant to his or her function as advocate for the state. Actions falling within the scope of the so-called advocacy function are defined as those \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 96 S.Ct. at 995, 47 L.Ed.2d at 143; <em>Willitzer v. McCloud </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 447, 6 OBR 489, 453 N.E.2d 693. Although the Supreme Court declined expressly to decide the question in <em>Imbler, </em>this court, relying on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Willitzer, supra, </em>has stated that administrative and investigative functions performed by prosecutors are entitled to only qualified immunity. See <em>Bender v. Diemert </em>(Apr. 22, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 62206, unreported, 1993 WL 127091.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">While it is not always clear whether a given action falls within the prosecutor\u2019s advocacy function, there is little doubt that the use of alleged perjured testimony does. In <em>Imbler, </em>a majority expressly held that the alleged use of perjured testimony could not defeat a claim of absolute immunity. <em>Imbler, supra, </em>at 431, 96 S.Ct. at 995-996, 47 L.Ed.2d at 144, fn. 34. Further, appellant\u2019s argument that Rice enjoys absolute immunity only in his official capacity and is amenable to suit in his individual capacity would completely defeat the policies served by the immunity doctrine. See <em>Imbler, supra, </em>at 422-423, 96 S.Ct. at 991, 47 L.Ed.2d at 139 (\u201cThe common-law immunity of a prosecutor is based upon the same considerations that underlie the common-law immunities of judges and grand jurors acting within the scope of their duties. These include concern that harassment by unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the prosecutor\u2019s energies <em>from </em>his public duties and the possibility that he would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.\u201d). This court expressly declines to adopt such an anomalous interpretation of the doctrine of absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the motion to dismiss filed by Rice was properly granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by dismissing the action without allowing the parties to conclude discovery proceedings and where appellant had pending (interrogatories, request for production of documents and request for admissions).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>In light of our determination that the trial court was correct in dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint on the basis of absolute prosecutorial immunity, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-7\">Patton, P.J., Nugent and Ann McManamon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b240-8\">Ann McManamon, J., retired, of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-16\">.
