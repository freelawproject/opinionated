Emil Balanzo.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5Zi\">Before Brown, C.

Before Corbet, P. J,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-9\">From the record it appeared that defendant, Emil Balanzo, in company with four other men, was walking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>along a public street in the Borough of Midland, Beaver County, about midnight on May 12, 1917. They met Michael T. Ford and Edward McKay, two police officers of the said borough, on duty. Ford wore the full uniform of a police officer, but McKay was in plain clothes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-3\">The prisoner and the men in company with him, on the approach of the officers, started to scatter. The officers then commanded defendant and the others to stop and to submit to a search. The men in company with the defendant stopped and were searched, but the prisoner attempted to get away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-4\">Ford followed defendant and was in the act of turning him around preparatory to making a search for concealed weapons when defendant drew a revolver and fired five shots at him, one of which passed through his chest, one through his abdomen, and one through the ball of his foot. Ford died about nine hours later in a hospital.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">On the trial no dying declaration of the deceased was offered in evidence, the only evidence as to what he said being that while in the hospital he made certain incoherent utterances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">The trial judge sustained an objection to the question put to one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, on cross-examination, as to what statement the doctors made to the deceased in the hospital (3, 4, 5, and 6).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">On the trial the district attorney exhibited deceased\u2019s coat to the jury stating \u201cthis is the place where the bullet came out\u201d (indicating) (14). Later during the trial he stated that the story of one of defendant\u2019s witnesses was \u201ccooked up\u201d (26), and at another time that \u201cdefendant was telling his story the way his attorneys wanted him to tell it\u201d (27), the court directed the jury to disregard the first and last mentioned utterances and ruled that the reference to the testimony of defendant\u2019s witness as \u201ccooked up\u201d was not improper, as it was made by the district attorney in addressing the court in reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>what he intended to prove in rebuttal, and no exception to- such ruling was taken at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\">Defendant\u2019s fifth point for charge and the court\u2019s answer thereto were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">\"There is no evidence in this case that the deceased and his fellow officer had any information or even suspicion that the prisoner had a weapon on his person, and it being admitted that there was no warrant against the prisoner or any of his companions, the attempted search of the prisoner for weapons was an unlawful act upon the part of the deceased and his fellow officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-7\">\"Answer. Affirmed. Nevertheless, a mere attempted search without more, would not justify or excuse the killing of the officer. One is not warranted in taking human life to repel or redress a wrong of small magnitude.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-8\">Defendant\u2019s sixth point for charge and the court\u2019s answer thereto were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-9\">\"If the prisoner and his companions were walking quietly and peaceably along the public street, the deceased and his fellow officer had no legal right to stop them and search them without a warrant, and in so doing the deceased and his fellow officer were guilty of an unlawful act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-10\">\"Answer. Affirmed. Nevertheless, so doing, without more, would not justify or excuse the killing of Michael T. Ford.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-11\">Defendant\u2019s seventh point for charge and the court\u2019s answer thereto were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-12\">\"If the jury believed from the evidence that the deceased assaulted the prisoner with his club, and the prisoner\u2019s life was in danger, or he was actually in danger of great bodily harm, or if it so reasonably appeared to him, and the danger, either real or apparent, was so great that it could not be averted, without inflicting serious injury upon the deceased or even taking his life, the prisoner would be excusable under the law in so doing, in order to save his own life or avert great bodily harm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cAnswer. Affirmed. But reasonable apprehension of such danger as is referred to in this point, where the apparent danger turns out to be apparent only, and not actual, must have a reasonable basis on which to rest, before the taking of human life would be warranted thereby.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-3\">The jury found a verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter upon which the maximum sentence was thereafter imposed. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-4\"><em>Errors assigned, </em>among others, were various rulings on evidence (3, 4, 5, and 6), alleged improper remarks by the district attorney (14, 26, and 27), and the charge of the court (32, 33, and 34) and the judgment of sentence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-5\"><em>Lawrence M.
