The son then went to Pittsburgh and did not return home until late that night when he found his mother dead, and the bedroom showing evidence of a violent struggle. The drawer in which the $70 had been put had been forced open and the money taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">The defendant was arrested later the same night. The condition of his raincoat and trousers then indicated that they had been recently washed. There was blood on his raincoat, spectacles, and on his underwear. There were scratches on defendant and finger marks on the back of his raincoat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">There was evidence that on the evening of the murder defendant was in the washroom of a hotel in Jeannette washing his raincoat and trousers, that immediately thereafter he boarded a street car on which he several times displayed a roll of bills, stated that he had $50, and paid a stranger\u2019s car fare.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\">It appeared that the day of the commission of the crime was pay day at the plant at which defendant worked, and that he had received only $2.50, and on the pay day of the previous Aveek had been paid only $9.25. A short time before February 16, 1917, he borrowed money from a friend stating that he was out of funds. He had not paid his board bill for months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-9\">The defendant admitted that he had committed the crime to officers in the lockup after his arrest and later in jail to his brother in the presence of a friend.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The jury found a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree, upon which sentence of death was subsequently passed.

The jury found him guilty of that crime, and, on this appeal from the judgment pronounced against him, his main complaint is that the learned trial judge erred in defining robbery to the jury. While it is the felonious and forcible taking from the person of another of goods or money to any value by violence or putting in fear, the. offense is complete if they are taken in the presence of the owner by violence or putting in fear. In other words, it is not necessary for the completion of the offense that they be taken from the person of the owner: 2 East P. C. C. 16, section 124; 2 Roscoe\u2019s Criminal Evidence, 935; 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, section 1081; Trickett\u2019s Pennsylvania Criminal Law, 664; United States v. Jones, No. 15494 Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Cases, 663. The first four assignments are dismissed. The ingredients necessary to constitute murder of the first degree having been proved to exist, the fifth assignment is overruled and the judgment is affirmed, with direction that the record be remitted for the purpose of execution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
