The section prohibiting any charge \u201cwhatsoever\u201d for treatment by students in schools of beauty culture\u2014the section here in controversy was amended to read as follows: \u201cNo school of beauty culture shall, directly or indirectly, charge any money whatsoever for treatment by its students and may charge only for the actual cost of materials used in such treatments, but no charge shall be made for service supplie[s] (sic).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>In 1961 the General Assembly undertook to define a \u201cstudent\u201d as one \u201cengaged in learning or acquiring the knowledge of the practice of hairdressing and beauty culture for tuition or fee in a duly authorized school\u201d; it defined a \u201cschool of beauty culture\u201d as a \u201cpremises where such instruction was given a student for tuition or fee.\u201d It discarded the mundane terms of \u201chairdressers and beauty culturists\u201d by providing that wherever that terminology had been used in the statute those who pursued such a calling were thereafter to be scientifically classified as \u201ccosmetologists.\u201d **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">At the same session, in supplementation of the prohibition against such schools of beauty culture charging \u201cany money whatsoever for treatment by its students,\u201d the General Assembly enacted a new section [Art. 43, \u00a7 537 (b), Ann. Code (1971 Repl. Vol.)] which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any school of beauty culture to advertise a list of prices for services to be performed by students other than by posting such a list within the school building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Despite this legislative history and revision no steps were apparently taken to enforce Art. 43, \u00a7 537 (a) until March 6, 1962, when the members of a newly-constituted Board of Cosmetology, by letter, admonished the various private schools of beauty culture within the State \u201cto reduce their clinic prices to \u2018cost of materials\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The appellants, comprising fifteen (15) separate privately operated schools of beauty culture and the Maryland Association of Beauty Schools, Inc., on March 15, 1963, in the Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City, filed a petition requesting that Art. 43, \u00a7 537, be declared unconstitutional and the Board of Cosmetology be enjoined from enforcing it. After a hearing the lower court (Jones, J.), on April 10, 1963, without prejudice, issued an interlocutory injunction (and maintained the <em>status </em>quo) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>against the enforcement by the Board of the statute, pending decision on the merits. See Md. Rule BB70 c.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">After a demurrer on behalf of the Board had been overruled (Perrott, J.) and its Answer filed, both the appellants and the Board filed Cross-Motions for Summary Judgments\u2014each alleging that there was \u201cno genuine dispute as to material fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">After a hearing on the respective motions\u2014but before they were decided\u2014the appellants, on January 12, 1972, filed a petition to amend their complaint and to ask, by way of alternative relief, that the court pass an order construing the phrase \u201cthe cost of materials\u201d, \u201cso as to allow a reasonable schedule of prices to be charged by the beauty school clinics.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The Chancellor (Cardin, J.) on January 17, 1972 by his memorandum and decree, denied the appellants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, granted the Board\u2019s Motion and declared that the provisions of Art. 43, \u00a7 537 (a) were constitutional. At the same time, \u201cat the request of counsel\u201d, the court retained jurisdiction over the subject-matter relating to any \u201cschedule of prices\u201d and referred that issue to the Board \u201cin order that they may promulgate rules and regulations by which the \u2018cost of materials\u2019 may be determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The appellants, from the decree upholding the constitutionality of the statute, here contend: (a) that it was error for the trial court to have denied their Motion for Summary Judgment because the pleadings \u201cestablished a genuine dispute as to material facts\u201d, (b) that it was error to grant the Board\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment upon the uncontroverted facts presented by the pleadings, (c) that Art. 43, \u00a7 537 (a), limiting the charges made in beauty school clinics to \u201ccost of materials\u201d is unconstitutional and invalid, and (d) that the State Board of Cosmetology is estopped, or barred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>laches, from enforcing the statute \u201cby virtue of the prior rules, regulations and policy of the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\n<em>(a) and (b) RULING ON MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The appellants, in support of their contention that their Motion for Summary Judgment was improperly denied and the Board\u2019s Motion erroneously granted, contend that no allegations of facts were made by the Board attempting to controvert the allegations set forth in their petition; that the \u201cregulations and practice of the Board should have been given weight in view of the reliance [thereon] by the beauty school industry for a period of twenty-eight years\u201d; and that the Board had failed to controvert the appellants\u2019 allegations that they had expanded their facilities, made improvements and established new schools in reliance upon the practice authorized by the Board, nor was their allegation controverted that in the event they were limited to charging the \u201ccost of materials\u201d, then tuition would have to be increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The Board, by its Answer, admitted the majority of the allegations made by the appellants, but denied that it \u201cby its rules and regulations had allowed the schools to reflect in their charges the cost of administration and the cost of materials.\u201d It was further denied that the provisions of Art. 43, \u00a7 537, were not a valid exercise of the police power and denied that the appellants would suffer \u201cirreparable injury.\u201d As to the remainder of the appellants\u2019 allegations, the Board pleaded that it was \u201cwithout knowledge\u201d\u2014amounting to a denial, under Maryland Rule 372 a 2.<footnotemark>6a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The appellants earnestly argue that the Answer filed by the Board established a genuine dispute as to material facts and it was thus error to grant the Board\u2019s Motion; by the same logic\u2014though they allege the pleadings establish a genuine dispute as to material facts\u2014they contend that they were entitled to summary relief.'</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The function of the summary judgment procedure is not to try the case or decide the issues of fact raised; it is merely to determine whether or not an issue of fact is to be tried and if there is none, to cause judgment to be rendered accordingly. <em>Greenwell v. American Guaranty Corp., </em>262 Md. 102, 277 A. 2d 70 (1971); <em>Trustees of Broadfording Church of the Brethren v. Western Maryland Railway Co., </em>262 Md. 84, 277 A. 2d 276 (1971). The purpose of the hearing on the motion, at the trial level, is to decide if a real dispute as to material facts does exist and if the pleadings, depositions, admissions and affidavits (if any) show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment should be granted. <em>Brown v. Suburban Cadillac, Inc., </em>260 Md. 251, 272 A. 2d 42 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">A bare allegation in a general way that there is a dispute as to material facts is never sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Melbourne v. Griffith, </em>263 Md. 486, 283 A. 2d 363 (1971); nor is the mere filing of an Answer to a bill of complaint necessarily fatal to a motion for summary judgment, particularly where the Answer does not warrant a finding that there is a genuine dispute as to material facts between the parties. <em>Burrell v. Frisby, </em>212 Md. 181, 129 A. 2d 75 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Even where it is shown that there is a dispute as to a fact, when the resolution of that factual dispute is not material to the controversy, such dispute does not prevent the entry of summary judgment. <em>Shaffer v. Lohr, </em>264 Md. 397, 287 A. 2d 42 (1972); S. <em>L. Hammerman Organization, Inc. v. Community Health Facilities, Inc., </em>264 Md. 37, 50, 284 A. 2d 599, 605 (1971); <em>Meola v. Bethlehem Steel Co., </em>246 Md. 226, 239-40, 228 A. 2d 254, 262 (1967); a dispute as to facts relating to grounds upon which the decision is not rested is not a dispute with respect to a <em>material </em>fact and such dispute does not prevent the entry of summary judgment. <em>Daniel v. Kensington Homes, Inc., </em>232 Md. 1, 13, 192 A. 2d 114 (1963); <em>Parklawn v. Nee, </em>243 Md. 249, 254, 220 A. 2d 563 (1966); <em>Rooney v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Statewide Plumbing, </em>265 Md. 559, 564, 290 A. 2d 496 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">As aptly stated by Judge Powers, for the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Knisley v. Keller, </em>11 Md. App. 269, 272-3, 273 A. 2d 624 (1971), \u201c. . . The function of the trial judge [in connection with a motion for summary judgment] is much the same as that he performs at the close of all the evidence in a jury trial when motions for directed verdict or requests for peremptory instructions require him to decide whether an issue requires resolution by a jury, or is to be decided by the court as a matter of law.\u201d See also <em>Rooney v. Statewide Plumbing, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In reviewing the propriety of the granting of a summary judgment our concern is primarily with deciding whether a factual issue does exist which is material to the resolution of the controversy. See <em>Brown v. Suburban Cadillac, supra; Rooney v. Statewide Plumbing, supra. </em>Where the record shows that there is no such genuine dispute as to any material fact necessary to resolve the controversy as a matter of law, and that the movant is entitled to judgment, the entry of summary judgment is proper. <em>S. L. Hammerman Organization, Inc. v. Community Health Facilities, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">As a general rule constitutional questions are not to be dealt with abstractly and this court will not decide constitutional questions except when concrete and specific issues are raised by actual ones. See <em>Hammond v. Lancaster, </em>194 Md. 462, 471, 71 A. 2d 474, 479 (1950) (Motion to Stay denied, 339 U. S. 908); <em>Tanner v. McKeldin, </em>202 Md. 569, 580, 97 A. 2d 449, 454 (1953); <em>Givner v. Cohen, </em>208 Md. 23, 37, 116 A. 2d 357, 363 (1955); <em>State v. Cherry, </em>224 Md. 144, 167 A. 2d 328 (1961); <em>Board of Public Welfare v. Myers, </em>224 Md. 246, 252, 167 A. 2d 765, 768 (1961). The provisions of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Art. 31A) have been invoked to obtain a declaration whether or not a statute is constitutional, when the complainant alleges that he will be directly damaged, in person or in property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>if the statute is enforced; that such enforcement will result in infringement of his constitutional rights and that the defendant, who is charged with the duty of enforcing the statute, is enforcing it, or is about to enforce it. <em>Davis v. State, </em>183 Md. 385, 37 A. 2d 880 (1944); <em>Tanner v. McKeldin, supra; Liberto v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>223 Md. 356, 164 A. 2d 719 (1960); <em>Bruce v. Director, Dept. of Chesapeake Bay Affairs, </em>261 Md. 585, 276 A. 2d 200 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In <em>State\u2019s Attorney v. Triplett, </em>255 Md. 270, 257 A. 2d 748 (1969), and in <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 237 A. 2d 35 (1968), the summary judgment procedure was used in actions brought under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act to pass upon the constitutionality of statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In <em>Triplett, supra, </em>Judge Barnes, for the Court, after pointing out that \u201c. . . every presumption favors the validity of the statute and it will not be held to be unconstitutional and void unless it plainly contravenes a constitutional provision,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201cIn our opinion, the Chancellor should not have granted a summary judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional as denying due process of law and the equal protection of the law. There may be cases involving statutes where the denial of due process of law and of equal protection of the law are clear <em>on the face of the statutes or upon consideration of quite limited evidence, </em>but, in our opinion, the statute involved in the present case is not of this type, especially in view of the issues arising in regard to the possible restrictive effect of the provisions of the title of the Act upon the construction of the language in the body of the Act.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) [255 Md. at 285-6, 257 A. 2d at 755.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>a bill for declaratory relief was heard on demurrer, by agreement of the parties; a declaratory decree was entered declaring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the rights of the parties and entering judgment for the defendants without the demurrer having been ruled upon. We noted there that since there was no genuine dispute of fact, and as the answer to the contentions turned solely on questions of law, the declaration entered by the court could be treated as a summary judgment. Chief Judge Hammond, after citing Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments, </em>369-70 (2d Ed. 1941), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\">\u201cBorchard, <em>op. cit. </em>p. 432, says further:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">\u201cA question has been raised by a series of cases in New York, whether a motion to dismiss a complaint or a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be entertained and granted in an action for a declaratory judgment, or whether, as in <em>Neubeck v. McDonald </em>[220 N.Y.S. 761], the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, should refrain from entertaining such a motion until the trial shall have clarified the facts and enabled the court to determine whether the complaint has any basis in fact or law. Since such motions are entertained in actions for coercive relief, there is no reason whatever why they should be rejected in declaratory actions. <em>Where motions are granted it indicates that the court </em>either finds no \u2018cause of action\u2019 or lacks jurisdiction or <em>can decide on the face of the pleadings, without the taking of evidence, that either plaintiff or defendant is right, </em>a decision which is appealable. On the other hand, where the court refuses to entertain or grant the motion, it is apparent that the court is unable to determine the issue presented by the motion on the complaint or the pleadings and wishes to hear evidence from both sides before making up its mind. <em>There is no basis, therefore, for the suggestion that the declaratory action in this respect differs from any other proceedings.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">\u201cIn the case before us we think Judge Clapp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>permissibly found that there was no genuine dispute of fact and that the answer to the contentions of the parties turned solely on questions of law which the parties had agreed to submit to the court. This being so, there was every reason to declare how the controlling law governed the essentially undisputed facts. <em>American Auto Ins. Co. v. Indemnity Co. </em>(E. D. Pa.), 108 F. Supp. 221, <em>aff\u2019d </em>228 F. 2d 622.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">\u201cThe appellant\u2019s present claim that there existed a genuine factual dispute is inaccurate. There is no dispute as to the operative facts which led to the filing of the petition and which are therein alleged. The claimed dispute is as to legislative and administrative history, and the only facts as to these proffered are not challenged by the appellees and, as we indicated earlier, lend as much support to the appellees\u2019 interpretation of the statutes as they do to that of the appellants.\u201d [248 Md. at 413-414, 237 A. 2d at 40.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Although the appellants alleged in their petition that \u201csince 1935, by its rules and regulations,\u201d the Board has allowed the schools to reflect in their clinic charges the cost of administration, including the cost of materials, and alleged in their Motion for Summary Judgment that such charges \u201cwere approved by regulation and practice of the Board,\u201d no copies of any such purported rules or regulations were filed as exhibits accompanying their petition or Motion. Indeed, we take judicial notice, as we did in <em>Wrenn v. Vincent et Vincent of Langley, Inc., </em>235 Md. 466, 201 A. 2d 768 (1964) (involving an identical contention), that no such rules or regulations have as yet been filed with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals pursuant to the provisions of Art. 41, \u00a7 9 and \u00a7 246 of the Annotated Code. In <em>Wrenn, supra, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u201c. . . We may note that Code, 1963 Supp. Art. 43, \u00a7 548, empowers the State Board of Cosme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>tologists to \u2018prescribe such sanitary and safety rules as it may deem necessary, with particular reference to the precautions necessary to be employed to prevent the creating and spreading of infectious and contagious diseases,\u2019 and that Code 1957, Art. 43, \u00a7 544, gives the Board power to \u2018prescribe reasonable rules * * * generally for the conduct of persons * * * affected by this subtitle.\u2019 We may take judicial notice that no rules under this provision (or its statutory precursors) have been filed with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals pursuant to Code, 1957, Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 246.\u201d [235 Md. at 470, n. 2, 201 A. 2d at 770.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The appellants\u2019 reliance upon the alleged existence of rules and regulations of the Board, to say the least, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">It must additionally be pointed out that the parties in their Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment each represented to the court that there was \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material facts in this matter.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Chancellor, in his memorandum, stated: \u201cAll parties having assured the court, both in their oral arguments and Memoranda, that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, disposition is forthwith made upon those Motions.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The actions of an attorney within the scope of his employment are binding upon his client under the ordinary principles of agency. <em>McGinnis v. </em>Chance, 247 Md. 393, 399-400, 231 A. 2d 63, 67 (1967); <em>Bob Holding Corp. v.

This is particularly true concerning the stipulation of counsel in open court. See <em>Posko v. Climatic Control Corp., </em>198 Md. 578, 84 A. 2d 906 (1951); citing <em>Bloom v.

The pleadings and the Motions presented the lower court with a \u201cconcrete and specific issue.\u201d It was not error for the trial court, without the taking of testimony concerning the allegations made by the appellants to render summary judgment on the limited issue of the constitutionality of the Section on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\n<em>(c) THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATUTE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The appellants in their attack upon the constitutionality of Art. 43, \u00a7 537 (a), contend that it is an invalid exercise of the police power because it has no \u201crelationship with the health, safety or welfare of the people\u201d; that as a \u201cprice control\u201d statute it imposes unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions arbitrarily interfering with private business and lawful occupations and that it is discriminatory in that no such equal restrictions are imposed \u201cin the barber school clinics.\u201d The statute reads as. follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u201c\u00a7 537.

The court recognized that \u201c. . . The health, safety and welfare of the public is concerned from standpoints of sanitation, minimization or spread of communicable diseases and professional and technical competence of those who propose to practice the profession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The court observed that the Legislature was confronted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>with contentions by school operators that the economics of their operation did not permit tuition charges to their students to be sufficient to operate the schools, without income from such \u201cpractical demonstrations,\u201d as a result of which, the public was invited to come to such schools for beauty work, performed by students, and received such services for a charge less than that made for comparable services by registered public beauty shops; and that the registered shops contended that such practice on the part of the schools was in effect the operation of \u201ccut-price\u201d beauty shops, making the profit motive on the part of such schools prejudicial to both student training and the industry. It was also noted that under the practice of treating the \u201cmodel\u201d\u2014the patron-customer at the school\u2014reduced the amount of constructive criticism between the instructor and the student to the detriment of the student and that this aspect of the school operation reduced the competence of its graduates to the detriment of subsequent licensed employers and of the graduating students themselves when they attempted to become independent operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">In holding that: \u201cOur statute is not <em>per se </em>constitutionally unequal and discriminatory in application, and the establishment and posting of \u2018the reasonable cost of supplies and materials used\u2019 to govern the charge to the \u2018model\u2019 is valid,\u201d the court pointed out in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax6\">\u201cEmphasis on vocational training on the one hand and emphasis as a business enterprise on the other need not be irreconcilable, but if the legislature has found that it is, it is within its prerogative. . . .

The charge made for materials used shall not exceed the reasonable cost thereof. No school shall advertise for patrons to be used at the clinical work.\u201d In implementation of the statute the Board of Health issued an order that: \u201cNo school may charge a patron more than the reasonable cost of materials used\u201d and set up a list of services and a determination of \u201creasonable cost of materials consumed in the rendition of each [such] service.\u201d The rule also provided that any school might apply to the Board for an order establishing other maximum amounts of \u201ccost of materials\u201d upon furnishing adequate proof that the cost of the materials used by them did exceed those set by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">That court, after observing that \u201cIf a beauty school, so-called, practices cosmetic art it becomes a beauty parlor, the services being rendered by the students rather than by operators and apprentices,\u201d and after pointing out that by statute no person shall engage in the practice of cosmetic art unless he or she has been licensed by the Board to do so, stated in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cIt is considered that the chapter in question as applied to the teaching of cosmetic art is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>a price fixing statute. The power to fix the price of materials used is an exercise of police power to prevent imposition upon the public and evasions of the provisions of the statute. The schools of cosmetic art are not engaged in the business of selling materials, they are engaged in qualifying students to become practitioners of the art. There seem to be many sound reasons for requiring schools of cosmetic art to remain within their particular field in the exercise of the power of the state to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public.\u201d [239 Wis. at 110, 300 N.

In discussing the reasoning behind the adoption of the rule the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">\u201c. . . [w]hen a student performs any \u00f3f the enumerated practices \u2018for payment either directly or indirectly,\u2019 he is undertaking the practice of barbering and is subject to the laws relating to the barber profession which, among other things, forbids the practice of said profession without a certificate. ... To hold the rule unreasonable would be to allow unlicensed students to perform services of the same kind, though perhaps not of as high a quality, as those of licensed barbers, without complying with statutory provisions governing such work. With such a rule, the compensated service of the stu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>dent becomes amenable to the same regulations which apply to services of the licensed barber.\u201d [188 Okla. at 218, 107 P. 2d at 1020]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In <em>State v.

[I]t is clear that the statute does not deprive them of their property by prohibiting them from charging customers for services rendered by their students. Students in a school are prohibited from barbering for compensation.

The statutory provision to which objection is made is reasonable and is necessary to insure to the public protection from untrained and unauthorized barbers.\u201d [54 R.

That court, stating that it could find \u201cno rational connection between the promotion of public health and the interdiction of such a charge\u201d, held the statute unreasonable and void insofar as it prohibited <em>any </em>charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>for the materials furnished to models by the schools.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Massachusetts statute was amended in 1958 by striking the prohibition against charges for materials used. See <em>Maine Beauty Schools v. State Board of Hairdressers, supra, </em>at 429. A prohibition against the making of <em>any </em>such charges was enacted by the Maryland Legislature in 1935, as hereinabove noted; it was amended in 1947 to allow for the \u201cactual cost of materials used\u201d, but continued the prohibition against any charge for services rendered by the student.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In both <em>Moler v.

W. 133 (1939), statutes which prohibited the making of any charge by students or apprentices, respectively in barber colleges and in schools of cosmetology, were held to be unconstitutional in that they were held to violate respectively provisions of the Missouri Constitution (Art. 2, \u00a7 4) and of the Iowa Constitution (Art. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 9), and are here inapposite in view of the lack of any similar provisions in our State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Similarly, the holdings in <em>Ex Parte Kazas, </em>22 Cal.

W. 547 (1936), are equally here inapplicable since each declared unconstitutional statutes which undertook to establish <em>minimum </em>prices which licensed barbers could charge for their services.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The nature of the work encompassed within the definition of \u201cbeauty school\u201d as set forth in Art. 43, \u00a7 529 (a), <em>supra, </em>involving as it does contact with the human face and scalp, the exposure of the public to the use of dyes, chemicals, bleaching and coloring agents, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>as the removal of unwanted hirsute adornment by the use of mechanical or electrical appliances\u2014the use of many of which may involve personal injury if not expertly applied\u2014is patently affected with sufficient public interest to bring the practice of such artisans within the ambit of the police power of the State in order to protect and promote the public health and safety of the citizenry.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Beauty schools by virtue of their very nature, their curriculum, training and the supervision of their students in clinics, determine the skill and expertise of those who, after licensing and registration, will, in the future, hold themselves available to the public for the performance of these services. It goes without saying that the educational and training procedures for the practice of cosmetology is equally clothed with a public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In enacting the statute here under attack the Legislature, in the interest of the training of potential cosmetologists, has undertaken to restrict the schools of beauty culture to the primary function for which they are licensed by law\u2014a concentration on the training of the students enrolled. By undertaking to limit the charges which the schools can make to the \u201cmodel\u201d to the cost of materials used, the model is more readily aware not to expect a semi-professional result from a student-trainee. The obligation of attempting to please the \u201cmodel\u201d is removed and a freer exchange of criticism and instruction is encouraged between the student and the supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">As we noted in <em>Gino\u2019s v. Baltimore City, supra, </em>and in <em>Eutaw Enterprises of Baltimore City, supra, </em>it must be assumed that there existed before the General Assembly a state of facts similar to that noted in <em>Maine Beauty Schools, Inc. v. State Board of Hairdressers, supra, </em>as a basis for the enactment of Art. 43, \u00a7 537 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The Legislature obviously concluded that the service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>to the public by beauty schools without restriction on the nature of the charges which could be made was detrimental to the training of students and their ultimate competence. Emphasis on vocational training on the one hand and a business enterprise on the other, need not necessarily be irreconcilable, but if the Legislature has found it to be, it is within its legislative prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In view of the prohibition against the practice of cosmetology without examination, licensing and registration (see Art. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 530, 531) and in view of the prohibition (Art. 43, \u00a7 538) against the practice of beauty culture in other than a registered beauty shop, the reasoning in <em>Schwarze v. Clark, et al., supra, </em>becomes particularly pertinent in that the beauty schools, save for such a prohibition would be entitled to charge\u2014indirectly at least\u2014for cosmetology services performed by unlicensed students and would circumvent the prohibition against the practice of beauty culture in other than a registered beauty shop. The prohibition in Art. 43, \u00a7 537 (a), against making any charge whatsoever for the clinical work performed by students in the beauty schools has a substantial direct relationship with the health, safety and welfare of the public, and thus, on its face, is within the police power of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">That the statute may undertake indirectly to, control prices and affect competition does not <em>per se </em>render it invidious or unconstitutional; such a form of regulation is unconstitutional \u201conly if arbitrary, discriminatory or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the Legislature is free to adopt and hence an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with individual liberty.\u201d See <em>Nebbia v.

The courts are without authority either to declare such policy or, when it is declared by the legislature, to override it. If the laws passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process are satisfied and judicial determination to that effect renders a court <em>functus officio </em>. . . and it is equally clear that if the legislative policy be to curb unrestrained and harmful competition by measures which are not arbitrary or discriminatory, it does not lie with the courts to determine that the rule is unwise . . . .\u201d [291 U.

It is only when the object of price-cutting is sinister that the sale of goods at less than cost may constitute an economic evil.

As applied to the teaching of cosmetic art the statute is not a price-fixing statute; the proprietors of beauty schools have no more right to charge or to receive compensation for the services performed by their students than the unlicensed, unregistered students themselves could charge. The schools are not engaged in the business of supplying services to the public, but are engaged in qualifying students to become practitioners of the art; to permit such schools to make charges for the services supplied by their students would result in the operation of \u201ccut-rate\u201d, unregistered beauty shops and would be inconsistent with the primary function of such schools\u2014the education and training of those pursuing this vocation. We cannot say, to the extent it may \u201ccontrol prices\u201d or affect competition, that the statute is unreasonable or that it does not bear a real and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>substantial relationship to the object sought to be attained\u2014the regulation of the training of students of cosmetology and the protection of the general public who might come to expect a certain expertise if a charge for services was not prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Nor is the statute in its application to schools of beauty culture arbitrary or discriminatory. If all persons who are in like circumstances or affected alike are treated under the laws the same, there is no deprivation of the equal protection of the law. Conversely, a law which operates upon some persons or corporations, and not upon others like situated or circumstanced or in the same class is invalid. See <em>Oursler v.

Director, Dept. of Chesapeake Bay Affairs, </em>261 Md. 585, 276 A. 2d 200 (1971), is misplaced. In <em>Bruce </em>we held unconstitutional certain sections of Art. 66C of the Maryland Code (1970 Repl.

The statutes restricted such pursuits to the county of one\u2019s residence. In holding that the statutes in question were invalid in that they represented \u201can unreasonable exercise of police power\u201d we observed that they created \u201can unlawful classification of persons\u201d and a discrimination between the residents of the various counties; we nonetheless recognized that \u201cthe constitutional need for equal protection does not shackle the Legislature. It has the widest discretion in classifying tnose who are regulated and taxed. Only if the group is without any reasonable basis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>and so entirely arbitrary, is it forbidden . . .\u201d [261 Md. at 601-2].</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The appellants\u2019 contention further that the statute is discriminatory in that it does not apply to barber schools overlooks the prohibition set forth in Art. 43, \u00a7 318B (b), against the receipt of any remuneration by a student performing barbering work at a barber school. Since the statutory prohibition here in question applies equally to every school of beauty culture within the State it is not unconstitutionally arbitrary or discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We are not here confronted with the issue of the reasonableness of any formula by which the \u201ccost of materials\u201d might be determined since the Cha\u00f1cellor remanded that issue to the Board for the promulgation of rules and regulations pertaining to the computation of \u201ccost of materials\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>(d) ESTOPPEL\u2014LACHES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The appellants, apparently conceding the constitutional validity of the statute, as their last thrust, contend that the Board should be estopped, or barred by laches, from attempting to enforce its provisions \u201cby virtue of prior rules, regulations and policy of the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">As heretofore pointed out, we took judicial notice that no such rules or regulations have been filed with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals, pursuant to the provisions of Art. 41, \u00a7 9 and \u00a7 246 of the Annotated Code.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We must thus conclude that no such rules or regulations were ever promulgated. The record here is devoid of any evidence of a purported policy on the part of the Board, other thafn the inevitable conclusion that, notwithstanding the existence of the statutory prohibition since 1947, no attempt had been made, prior to March 6, 1962, by the members of former Boards, to enforce its provisions due solely to inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Judge Barnes for the Court in <em>Savonis v. Burke, </em>241 Md. 316, 216 A. 2d 521 (1966), succinctly reviewed the doctrine of \u201cequitable estoppel\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">\u201cPomeroy, in his <em>Equity Jurisprudence </em>(5th ed., vol. 3), \u00a7 804, page 189 defines equitable estoppel as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">\u2018Equitable estoppel is the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might have otherwise existed, either of property, or contract or of remedy, as against another person who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse and who on his part acquires some corresponding right, either of property, of contract, or of remedy.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201cWe have adopted and have continually applied this definition of equitable estoppel. <em>Bayshore Industries v. Ziats, </em>232 Md. 167, 175, 192 A. 2d 487, 492 (1963); <em>Webb v. Johnson, </em>195 Md. 587, 595, 74 A. 2d 7, 10 (1950); <em>Crane Co. v.

Parr, </em>164 Md. 222, 164 A. 743 (1933), laches is an inexcusable delay, without necessary reference to duration, in the assertion of a right, and, unless mounting to the statutory period of limitations, mere delay is not sufficient to constitute laches, if the delay has not worked a disadvantage to another. See <em>Bradford v. Futrell, </em>225 Md. 512, 525, 171 A. 2d 493, 500 (1961). \u201cThe doctrine of laches is an application of the general principles of estoppel.\u201d <em>Oak Lawn Cemetery v.

Boehm, </em>182 Md. 254, 269, 34 A. 2d 447, 454 (1943). Prejudice or injury to the party raising \u201claches\u201d is an essential element. <em>Simpers v. Clark, </em>239 Md. 395, 403, 211 A. 2d 753, 757 (1965). So long as the position of the parties is not changed and there is no prejudice from the delay laches are inapplicable. <em>Oak Lawn Cemetery v. Baltimore County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Although it is recognized that estoppel may operate against the State by acts done in its proprietary capacity, the doctrine of estoppel will not be applied against the State in the performance of its governmental, public or sovereign capacity or in the enforcement of police mea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>sures. 28 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Estoppel and Waiver, </em>\u00a7 123, \u00a7 124; 31 C.J.S., <em>Estoppel, </em>\u00a7 140 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In <em>Comptroller v. Atlas Industries, </em>234 Md. 77, 198 A. 2d 86 (1964), the appellant sought to invoke the doctrine of estoppel based upon the contention that the \u201cdelay\u201d from 1954 until 1961 in demanding the payment of sales taxes was because the \u201cprevious administration \u2018did not care to force the issue\u2019\u2014but the present administration did.\u201d Judge Prescott (later Chief Judge), concerning this contention, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u201cIt seems to be universally recognized that, generally, a State cannot be estopped by the acts and conduct of its officers or agents in the performance of the governmental function of collecting taxes legally due. The reason for the rule is obvious: no administrative officer is vested with the power to abrogate the statute law of the State, nor to grant to an individual an exemption from the general operation of the law. <em>United States v.

Baltimore Transit Co., </em>140 Fed. 2d 51, 55 (1944) (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>64 S. Ct. 848, it was similarly held that the principles of equitable estoppel cannot be applied \u201cto deprive the public of the protection of a statute because of mistaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>action, or lack of action, on the part of public officials.\u201d See also <em>Utah Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Ed. 791 (1916); Annotations, 1 A.L.R.2d, pp. 341-346.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">It is equally well settled that laches on the part of the state in bringing suit is not a defense in a case which is founded on the exercise of a sovereign right or the exercise of a governmental function. As it is sometimes expressed, the mere acquiescence, laches, lapse of time or non action on the part of the public agents or officers will not be imputed to the government to work an estoppel. 27 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Equity, </em>\u00a7 156, 30A C.J.S., <em>Equity, </em>\u00a7 114, 31 C.J.S., <em>Estoppel, </em>\u00a7 138.

Ct. 1303, 10 L.Ed.2d 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">This contention by appellants is similar to that raised in <em>Atkinson v. Sapperstein, </em>191 Md. 301, 60 A. 2d 737 (1948), wherein the appellee sought to have declared invalid the provisions of Art. 56, \u00a7\u00a724 and 25 of the Code of 1939, which required a license to be obtained by ice cream vendors. One of his challenges to the constitutionality of the statute alleged that the statutes had been \u201cdisregarded throughout the State by practically all the law enforcement agencies charged with their enforcement, not out of an intent to flout the pronouncements of the Legislature, but because of their recognition that the enactments are unreasonable and invalid.\u201d Judge Collins, writing for the Court and in rejecting this contention, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201cIn the case at bar the appellee is not contending for an interpretation of the statutes here in question. He is asking this Court to declare them null and void because he alleges that the law enforcement agencies have not enforced them. It is one thing to interpret a statute <em>according to the way it has been administered. </em>It is entirely a <em>different thing to declare a stat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>ute null and void on account of its total non-enforcement. </em>In <em>Arnreich v. State, supra, </em>the administrative authorities interpreted the statute there in question to exempt those who operated stalls in the markets. The provisions of the code here in question have been amended many times by the Legislature, as late as the year 1937. We cannot say, as was said in <em>Arnreich v. State, supra, </em>that the Legislature has acquiesced in an administrative declaration that these provisions are invalid. The instant case comes within the limitation of the rule set out in <em>Arnreich v. State, supra, </em>where the Court said at pages 105 and 106 of 150 Md., at page 436 of 132 A: \u201cWe are not unmindful of the limitation upon this rule as expressed in the case of <em>Smith v. State, </em>134 Md. 473, [480], 107 A. 255, in which it was said: \u2018When the question is presented to it of a <em>laxity in enforcement, </em>or misconception of the intent of the law by administrative officers whose duty it was to carry out the act of the Legislature, such omission or misconception of clear statutory provisions <em>cannot </em>be allowed to stand in the way of giving to the act of the Legislature the proper interpretation.\u2019 This limitation, as thus expressed, is supported by the great weight of authority.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) [191 Md. at 312.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">See also <em>Brown v. State, </em>177 Md. 321, 9 A. 2d 209 (1939), sustaining the action of the lower court in excluding evidence of previous failure on the part of the police in Baltimore to enforce the \u201cHawkers and Peddlers\u201d license laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">There is no evidence here of any \u201clong standing and consistent administrative interpretation acquiesced in by the Legislature\u201d, but even if there were, since the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous any such administrative interpretation contrary to that clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>unambiguous meaning could not be given effect. See <em>Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Co. v. Dept. of Assessment and Taxation, </em>252 Md. 173, 183, 249 A. 2d 180, 186 (1969); <em>Beneficial Finance Co., etc. v. Administrator of Loan Laws, </em>260 Md. 430, 441-2, 272 A. 2d 649, 655 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Since the prohibition here under attack has been part of the statutory law of the State since 1947 and since the knowledge of that law is imputed to the appellants\u2014and to all others <footnotemark>23</footnotemark>\u2014they cannot here successfully contend that there has been \u201cany change in the position of the parties\u201d as a result of inaction on the part of predecessor Boards in enforcing compliance with the statute. Indeed, it appears that from 1962, when this litigation was instituted, up until the hearing of the respective Cross-Motions, the appellants undertook\u2014unsuccessfully\u2014to obtain legislative relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The statute, with its express prohibition, is self-enforcing. The only \u201cpolicy\u201d attributable to the Board on the record before us is one of inaction. Any such inaction or acquiescence by predecessor Boards in failing to call upon the appellants for enforcement of the statute cannot abrogate a statute which has been enacted in furtherance of the police power of the State. To hold otherwise would be to permit administrative officers of the State by inactivity or apathy to effectively bring about a repeal of a validly enacted statute and a resultant veto of a legislative enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Since no formula has been adopted by the Board by rule or regulation as to what may be encompassed within the definition of the \u201ccost of materials\u201d, the Chancellor properly retained jurisdiction over that subject-matter and remanded that issue to the expertise of the Board for the promulgation of such a rule or regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The interlocutory injunction issued on April 10, 1963, served its office and purpose until the final decree was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>issued; no order of dissolution was necessary to the validity of the decree here appealed. <em>Musgraove v.
