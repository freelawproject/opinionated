The trial judge, Harris, J., sitting without a jury, thought it \u201cclear from the evidence that efforts by all parties to locate . . . [the $7,567.09] have shed no light on the mystery.\u201d Counsel, at our invitation, volunteered conflicting theories in respect of its disappearance which, to be sure, they readily conceded lacked evidentiary support. Although we have been left neither wiser nor better informed, we think the judgment of the court below must nevertheless be reversed. The parties seem not to be in significant disagreement in respect of the facts, at least as they are set forth in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In November 1968 the appellee (Korvette) and the appellant (carrier) agreed in writing that, for a period of two years, the carrier would \u201ccall for sealed shipments containing moneys, checks, and/or securities, to receipt therefor, and to deliver same in like condition to\u201d The Equitable Trust Company (the bank).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Korvette\u2019s money room, significantly perhaps, is where it all began. This was, and perhaps still is, the domain of Eva Kegan and Pauline Thrasher who were responsible for the counting of the money, for certain accounting functions pertinent thereto, and whose testimony is the source of much of what follows. They were responsible also for the preparation of the \u201csealed shipments\u201d to be \u201ccall[ed] for\u201d by the carrier. In the afternoon of 10 March 1970 one or the other of them, perhaps both, prepared the $7,567.09 for shipment. The deposit slip <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> indicated it consisted of currency, coin and checks, all of which were placed in a #5 cloth bag. The bag was tied with strong twine the ends of which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>run through holes in a lead slug. When the ends of the twine were pulled tight the lead slug was run up against the neck of the bag and crimped with a tool which made impossible any movement of the twine and consequently any access to the inside of the bag; at the same time the crimper imprinted on the slug the words \u201cEJK. 35 Towson.\u201d Then there was tied to the neck of the bag a cardboard tag upon which was stamped or printed, \u201cFor Deposit Only Pay to the order of The Equitable Trust Co., Baltimore, Md. Korvettes #35. Division of Arlen Realty &amp; Development Corp. 611-0120-1.\u201d The identity of the carrier was written on the tag and, according to Mrs. Kegan, a figure supposed to indicate the aggregate amount of the currency, coin and checks inside the bag. Sometimes, she added, they would \u201cthrow in\u201d an extra deposit but they \u201cdon\u2019t put that on the outside of the bag.\u201d In fact, she admitted the possibility that the bag might have contained another deposit. Then there was entered upon a printed receipt form (the book) the date \u201c3-9\u201d and under the column entitled \u201cSaid to contain\u201d was entered the figure $7,567.09. At the top of each page of the book there is printed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">\u201c. . . It is agreed that all these sealed packages are to be distinctively and securely sealed by the consignor and that Bonded Armored Carrier, Inc., shall in no event be liable for any shortage claimed in any such sealed package delivered to it not so distinctively and securely sealed. <em>Each package to have marked thereon the amount said to be contained therein, </em>and in case of the loss of any sealed package Bonded Armored Carrier, Inc., shall in no event be liable for more than the value so marked thereon and stated herein.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Finally the bag was placed in the money room vault where it remained overnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">During the morning of 11 March $10,500 in currency was prepared for shipment. The money together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the deposit slip was placed in a larger #12 bag and tied, crimped and tagged in like manner. The entry in the book was made as before except that the date entered was \u201c3-10.\u201d The bag was then placed in the vault and the crimping tool<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was returned to the locked drawer where it was kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Later in the same day another deposit, $4,972.95 ($1,360.00 in currency and $3,612.78 in checks), was prepared for shipment. Since the carrier\u2019s agents had not yet arrived the #12 bag containing the $10,500 deposit prepared earlier was cut open. The twine, the crimped slug and the tag were discarded. The new deposit, $4,972.95, was put into the same bag with the $10,500 and the bag was retied with twine, the slug was crimped, and a new tag indicating that the bag was supposed to contain an aggregate amount of $15,472.95 was attached. The $10,500 figure in the book was erased and in lieu thereof $15,472.95 was inserted. The next column is headed \u201cNo. of Items.\u201d Most of the figure \u201c2\u201d was written so as to appear to apply to the \u201c3-10\u201d entry. The upper loop could be said to apply to the \u201c3-9\u201d entry. Who put the figure \u201c2\u201d there or when is not clear. The bank, as shown in the next column, is the indicated consignee. The two bags (the #5 and the #12) were then tied together and placed in the vault.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The carrier\u2019s armored truck, manned by a driver and two guards, arrived shortly before 3:25 p.m. on 11 March. Guard Bennett and his \u201cback-up man\u201d presented themselves at the \u201ccounter of the money room.\u201d They did not enter the money room nor did either of them have any access to the locked drawer where the crimper was kept. Bennett was handed the two bags still tied together. He wrote 3:25 in the column headed \u201cTime rec\u2019d\u201d in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>manner suggesting it might apply to both the \u201c3-9\u201d item and the \u201c3-10\u201d item but a perpendicular line above the time 3:25 suggests the \u201c3-9\u201d item might have been excluded. In the column headed \u201cRec\u2019d by\u201d he signed his name along an angular extension of the \u201c3-10\u201d line. They returned to the truck and locked the two bags in the rear. Bennett then made some notations on another form (the register) provided by the carrier. After inserting the date \u201c3-11-70,\u201d in the column headed \u201cReceived From\u201d he wrote Korvette-Towson; in the column headed \u201cDelivered to\u201d he wrote ET-Parkville; in the column headed \u201cBag\u201d he wrote CB (for cloth bag) ; in the column headed \u201cNo.\u201d he put the number 2; in the column headed \u201cCoin\u201d he put a check mark. The remaining columns headed respectively \u201cPennies, Nickels, Dimes, Quarters, Halves, Standards\u201d were left blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Bennett, to be sure, was not the best of witnesses and his testimony, given 26 months after the incident, while clear enough in significant respects is, in other respects, not so clear as it might be. At the time of trial he had been employed by the carrier for about three years. He did not \u201cinspect\u201d the lead slugs when the bags were handed to him but he was sure they were securely sealed. Had this not been so, he said, he would immediately have been aware of it. Asked if he checked the figures on the tags against the figures in the book he said he didn\u2019t remember. Asked if he \u201cnormally check [ed] those figures\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to.\u201d Although counsel did not press the point we think one would very nearly be obliged to infer that normally he did <em>not </em>check the tags against the book. Without doubt his testimony suggests his confusion in respect of the source of the $15,472.95 figure he wrote on the register after he returned to the truck. In one place he said he got this figure \u201coff one of the tags.\u201d He could not recall whether he checked the second tag. Asked if he added \u201cthe two tags together\u201d he replied, \u201cNow you got me on that. I really don\u2019t remember to tell you the truth.\u201d Recalled at the court\u2019s request he thought he might have added the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>amounts on the two tags. In another place he seemed to be saying that he got the figure from the book in the money room. The court and counsel made much of Bennett\u2019s confusion in this regard but, as we shall point out later on, we think it has very little significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">After they left Korvette\u2019s store Bennett and his assistant returned to the carrier\u2019s garage where the contents of the truck, including Korvette\u2019s two bags, were unloaded and placed in the carrier\u2019s vault. Thereafter Bennett had nothing to do with the bags. In the morning the two bags were taken from the vault and placed in the truck for delivery to the bank. For this trip the driver was A, Jones and the guard was Anton Talking-ton. Talkington testified that before he left the garage he had inspected the bags and found them to be properly sealed. At 11:04 a.m. he delivered the two bags, still sealed, to the bank. In the last column of the register, headed \u201cRec\u2019d by,\u201d there appears the signature of L. Carson.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Talkington said he delivered the two bags to Mrs. Lorraine Carson but that she did not open them in his presence and that he had no way of knowing what, if anything, was in the bags. Mrs. Carson testified that before she signed the register she satisfied herself that the amounts shown on the tags agreed with the amount shown on the register and, she added, the aggregate amount of the two tags was $15,472.95. She cut the twine, opened the bags and counted the contents. In the #5 bag there was a deposit slip in the amount of $4,-972.15 and currency and checks to match. In the #12 bag there was $10,500 in currency and a deposit slip to match. There were credited to Korvette\u2019s account on 12 March two amounts, one for $4,972.15 and one for $10,500. Validated copies of the deposit slips were sent to the Korvette store and to the New York accounting office. At no time during the month of March 1970, she said, did the bank receive a deposit of $7,567.09 from Korvette.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>All was quiet until late in May when someone in Korvette\u2019s New York accounting office telephoned the store manager and suggested an investigation; it seems they could not find the reported $7,567.09 deposit on the bank\u2019s statement. After discussing the matter with the bank manager, the store manager questioned his own subordinates. He succeeded only in lurching into a quandary. For all we know he is still there.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In March 1971 Korvette sued the carrier and the bank. In the first count of its declaration it alleged the agreement of November 1968, the preparation on 10 March of the $7,567.09 deposit for shipment, the preparation on 11 March of the $10,500 and the $4,972.95 deposits for shipment, the delivery of two bags to the carrier, the receipt of the carrier and the loss of the $7,567.09 deposit. It should be noted that negligence was not mentioned. In the second count (against the bank) it alleged the forwarding of the three deposits to the bank, the receipt thereof by the bank, and the bank\u2019s failure or refusal to credit to its account the sum of $7,567.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The case came on for trial before Judge Harris, sitting without a jury, in May 1972. At the conclusion of the entire case he granted the bank\u2019s motion to dismiss and he denied a like motion by the carrier. On 8 June judgment absolute for $7,567.09 in favor of Korvette and against the carrier was entered and from that judgment the carrier has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Judge Harris thought it appeared reasonably certain, from the evidence, that the carrier was negligent in handling the shipments and that this negligence was the proximate cause of the disappearance of the $7,567.09. \u201cIn any event [he continued], assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Korvette\u2019s employees made a mistake in the preparation of the deposits, Bonded had the last clear chance to avoid the loss.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The evidence which seems to be relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>to support these conclusions is simply that Bennett did not compare the amounts on the tags with the amounts the bags were <em>said to contain, </em>as shown in the book, which Judge Harris presumed \u201che was obligated to do.\u201d Korvette, in this Court, adopts and expands the theory underlying these conclusions. Even if Korvette\u2019s employees stole the money Bennett\u2019s negligence, it says, made the theft or mistake possible. We do not agree that the evidence can support a finding of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">It will be recalled that in the contract between the carrier and Korvette the carrier agreed \u201cto call for <em>sealed </em>shipments containing moneys, checks, and/or securities, to <em>receipt . . </em>. [for <em>sealed </em>shipments], and to deliver same <em>in like condition </em>to a designated consignee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We do not see in this record, nor have we been shown, any basis for a presumption, much less a finding, that the carrier\u2019s employees were \u201cobligated\u201d to compare the tags with the book. There is no such provision in the contract. There is no evidence that the carrier ever promised, either orally or in writing, to do so; there is no evidence that Korvette ever suggested or demanded any such procedure, nor does it appear that it ever relied upon the carrier to discover any discrepancies between the tags and the book. Indeed the only evidence that the carrier may have required its employees to make such a comparison is Bennett\u2019s testimony that the guards were \u201csupposed to\u201d do it. If there was such a requirement it seems to have been as much honored in the breach as in the observance and without any objection from Korvette. We think the dollar figures in the book were intended to serve only as Korvette\u2019s identification of the shipment. The carrier, by the signature of Bennett, acknowledged no more than that he had taken in hand two bags which Korvette identified as \u201csaid to contain\u201d certain sums. There was no way for Bennett to know what was in the bags. They might be \u201csaid to contain\u201d a million dollars but, in fact, they might contain nothing but old newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Our scrutiny of the book persuades us that, at best, it was an informal, untidy and inaccurate source of information. The dates shown thereon seem not to be the dates the bags were delivered to the carrier, although the time of day is shown. What follows is an excerpt from the book:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u201cDate 3-5 3-5 Said to Contain 6,319.52 )' 6,500.00 ) No. of items Consignee Equitable Trust Co. Time Ree\u2019d 2:35 Rec\u2019d by Steven Walton</p>\n<p id=\"A2l\">12,819.52) 2:35 Steven Walton</p>\n<p id=\"AmC\">3-5 12,630.47 3:45 Francis Roach</p>\n<p id=\"ASm\">3-6 18,500.00 3:45 Francis Roach\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-23\">Except for the fact that $12,819.52 is the sum of the two figures above it one could very well argue that Stephen Walton, on <em>\u201c3-5,\u201d </em>receipted for two bags, one containing $6,319.62 (or $6,500) and the other containing $12,819.-52. The deposits, $6,319.52 and $6,500.00, were actually made by the bank on Monday, 9 March. The next two items, one dated 3-5, and the second dated 3-6, made up a two bag shipment which Francis Roach receipted for at 3:45, probably on Saturday, 7 March. The deposits were made on Monday but the truly extraordinary and astonishing circumstance is that the \u201c18,500\u201d item of \u201c3-6\u201d had shrunk to \u201c14,000\u201d on Monday when the deposit was made. One wonders whether the bag contained $18,500 or $14,000. What was on the tag we can never be sure but the testimony in the case at bar suggests it almost certainly was $14,000. In the light of Korvette\u2019s position here it would seem that someone had made off with $4,500 which, perhaps, it should also be trying to collect from the carrier. At any rate this circumstance denigrates the accuracy of the book. And, one might add, the erasure of the figure first entered on 11 March (supposed to have been $10,500) and the substitution of $15,472.95 violates one of the primary rules of bookkeeping, i.e., \u201cerase nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-24\">Judge Harris, without actually saying so, seems to have accorded Mrs. Kegan and Mrs. Thrasher full credibility. If their testimony is to be taken at its face value then it must be accepted as a fact that the tag on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>one bag showed $7,567.09 and that the tag on the other bag showed $15,472.95. In that case it would not have mattered to Korvette whether Bennett did or did not compare the tags with the book. One must then believe that someone succeeded in penetrating the carrier\u2019s security screen, armed with a knife or scissors, a piece of the special twine used to tie the bags, two blank slugs, two of the special tags Korvette used to tie the bags, and Korvette\u2019s crimping tool. If one can believe all that then one must believe that someone cut the twine on both bags, discarded the twine and the slugs, removed from the #5 bag the deposit slip, $4,482.00 in currency, 36 cents in coins, and $3,084.73 in assorted worthless (to him) checks; one must believe also that he removed from the #12 bag the $1,360 in currency, 17 cents in coin, $3,612.78 in checks and the deposit slip for $4,972.95, and that he then placed the $4,972.95 and the deposit slip in the #5 bag. Having gotten this far one must believe also that he tied and crimped both bags, attached the two tags with corresponding amounts written thereon and tied both bags together. But one would need to be credulous indeed to believe that a thief with that much skill, information and expertise would take the risks and the trouble involved for some negotiable currency the amount of which he would not know until he opened the bags. Of course, there is not a shred of evidence to support any such theory and, in any event, what thief in those circumstances would not have taken the entire $16,342 in currency. We find it utterly incredible just as we must find incredible the testimony of Mrs. Kegan and Mrs. Thrasher that they affixed to the bags tags conforming to the figures in the book. We think one must believe that the tags Mrs. Carson compared with the amount on the register and with the deposit slips were the same tags that were on the bags when they were handed to Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Despite the fact that Bennett was a poor witness his testimony does make a certain amount of sense. He very well may have thought he was acknowledging the receipt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of two bags containing a total of $15,472.95. The figure <em>\u201c2\u201d </em>is peculiarly juxtaposed to the heavily written $15,-472.95 and in fact he did receive two bags the tags on which added up to that amount. That is the amount he wrote on his register and that is the amount that arrived at the bank. One would have to be hard-nosed indeed to characterize this as negligence, especially as he was under no legal obligation to do otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">We find less than persuasive the subsidiary theory advanced at argument by Korvette that even though its employees may somehow have been at fault the negligence, assuming there was negligence, of the carrier\u2019s employees made the loss possible. It seems to us that before such a theory can be accorded merit it is incumbent upon Korvette to show how the loss was made possible. Otherwise it is nothing more than an empty insinuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Both briefs discuss the law of bailments but we do not think it is applicable here. The carrier has done what it contracted to do. It received two sealed bags, identified by Korvette in one place as \u201csaid to contain\u201d $7,567.09 and $15,472.95 and further identified by tags upon which were marked the \u201camount [s] said to be contained therein.\u201d If Judge Harris found as a fact, and this is not so clear as it might be, that the tags were marked with the amounts $7,567.09 and $15,472.95 we think his finding was clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 886. We think this record permits no finding other than that they were marked with the amounts $4,972.95 and $10,500. The carrier delivered these same bags, intact, to the bank, which entered the proper credit to Korvette\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">As we said early on, we invited counsel for Korvette to venture his own personal theory in respect of what happened to the $7,567.09. He assumed of course that, when the bags were delivered to the bank, the tags still conformed to the figures in the book. He thought that when Mrs. Carson became aware, upon signing the register, that the amount involved was only $15,472.95, she found herself with a surplus of $7,567.09. His im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>plication, of course, was that she appropriated it to her own use. We think counsel has drawn the longbow. She would have known that Korvette had retained a copy of the deposit slip and that both the store and the New York office would be expecting copies showing that the deposit had been made. The record suggests that whatever else Mrs. Carson may have been, she was not stupid. And in this regard, recalling her testimony that duplicate deposit slips had been mailed to the store and to the New York office within the week and that the bank statement had been mailed at the end of the month, it is odd indeed that the disappearance of the $7,567.09 was not discovered until the end of May and then by some faceless individual in New York rather than by the people in the store. The judgment against the carrier will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">.
