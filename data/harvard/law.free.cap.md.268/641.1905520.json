Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol., 1972 Supp.) Art. 56, \u00a7 225 (a) requires the Commission \u201cat least ten days prior to the date set for the hearing [to] notify in writing the . . . license holder of the charges made . . . .\u201d He is to be afforded \u201can opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel.\u201d The \u201cnotice may be served by delivery of same personally to the . . . license holder, or by mailing same by registered mail to the. last known business address of such . . . license holder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In this case notice was timely mailed to the business address of the appellee. However, it was mailed certified mail, return receipt requested, <em>with delivery restricted to the addressee. </em>Notice was left for the appellee by the postal authorities, but he did not pick up the letter. Of course, he could have had a dozen employees at his place of business, but if the delivery were restricted to the addressee it would have been necessary for him to go to the appropriate post office window during its regular hours if he were not personally present on the premises when the postman arrived. The appellee was personally served by an investigator for the Commission two days before the Commission\u2019s hearing. Since this service quite obviously failed to comply with the statutory requirement of ten days\u2019 notice, the order of the trial judge must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">We are reluctant to dismiss the appeal <em>ex mero motu </em>when the case was submitted on brief by the appellant, no brief was filed by the appellee and no consideration has been given to the right of the Commission to appeal. We have grave doubts that the Commission has a right of appeal. <em>Cf. e.g., Insurance Commissioner v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>268 Md. 428, 302 A. 2d 200 (1973); <em>Board of Zoning Appeals v. Guns, </em>259 Md. 368, 269 A. 2d 833 (1970); <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Pack, </em>250 Md. 306, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>310, 242 A. 2d 506 (1968); <em>Liquor License Board v. Leone, </em>249 Md. 263, 239 A. 2d 82 (1968); Md. <em>Pharmacy Board v. Peco, </em>234 Md. 200, 203, 198 A. 2d 273 (1964); <em>Roeder v. Brown, </em>192 Md. 639, 65 A. 2d 333 (1949); <em>Mayor &amp; C. C. of Balto. v. Shapiro, </em>187 Md. 623, 51 A. 2d 273 (1947); and <em>Zoning Appeals Board v. McKinney, </em>174 Md. 551, 199 A. 540, 117 A.L.R. 207 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We wish to make it abundantly clear that in not dismissing the appeal we do not intend to indicate in any way that such a right of appeal by the Commission exists. The Commission in any subsequent appeals during the present state of the law should be prepared to brief and argue before us any such asserted right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
