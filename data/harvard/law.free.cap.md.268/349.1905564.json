On 13 September 1971, Officer John Seibold of the Baltimore City Police Department, armed with a search and seizure warrant, went to Gatewood\u2019s house in Baltimore, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>was admitted by Gatewood. In a brown paper bag in Gatewood\u2019s bedroom were four bags of heroin, a bottle of marijuana and a bank money bag containing $1,862.10 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Gatewood was convicted on 8 November 1971. On 18 April 1972, at a time when the $1,862.10 was still in the custody of the Police Department, Gatewood filed in the Criminal Court of Baltimore a petition seeking a return of the money, to which was attached an assignment to his attorney of all his right, title and interest in it. About a week later, the State countered with a petition for forfeiture, filed under Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 297. The cases were consolidated for trial and resulted in the order which gave rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The following is an excerpt from the statute here controlling :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u201c\u00a7 297. Forfeitures and seizures generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">(a) <em>Property subject to </em>forfeiture.\u2014The following shall be subject to forfeiture and no property right shall exist in them:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">(6) All money or currency which shall be found in close proximity to contraband controlled dangerous substances or controlled paraphernalia or which otherwise has been used or intended for use in connection with the illegal manufacture, distribution, dispensing or possession of controlled dangerous substances or controlled paraphernalia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">(b) <em>Seizure of property subject to forfeiture. </em>\u2014Any property subject to forfeiture under this subheading may be seized upon process issued by any court having jurisdiction over the property except that seizure without such process may be made when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">(1) The seizure is incident to an arrest or a search under a search warrant or an inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tion under an administrative inspection warrant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">(2) The property subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the State in a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding under this subheading;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">(3) There is probable cause to believe that the property is directly or indirectly dangerous to health or safety; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">(4) There is probable cause to believe that the property has been used or intended to be used in violation of this subheading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">In the event of seizure pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, proceedings under subsection (d) of this section shall be instituted promptly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">(c) <em>Seized property not repleviable; sealing or removal of seized </em>property.\u2014Property taken or detained under this section shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the person who seized said property subject only to the orders and decrees of the court or the official having jurisdiction thereof. Whenever property is seized under the provisions of this subheading, the person who seized said property may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">(1) Place the property under seal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">(2) Remove the property to a place designated by the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">(d) <em>Disposition of forfeited </em>property.\u2014 Whenever property is forfeited under this subheading, the political subdivision in which such property was seized, or, if the property was seized by State authorities, the State may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">(1) Retain the property for official use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">(2) Sell any forfeited property which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is not harmful to the public, provided that the proceeds be disposed of for payment of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>proper expenses of the proceedings for forfeiture and sale including expenses of seizure, maintenance of custody, advertising and court costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">(3) Require an appropriate agency to take custody of the property and remove it for disposition in accordance with law, or destruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">On appeal, Gatewood raises two questions: (i) that Art. 27, \u00a7 297 is unconstitutional because he has been deprived of his property without due process and that there is a denial of equal protection; and (ii) that the trial court was in error when it failed to consider whether the cash was in close proximity to the contraband and refused to rule that a delay of five months between conviction and the institution of the forfeiture proceeding did not comply with the statutory mandate that the proceeding be instituted promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">As regards the constitutional challenge, the statute, its predecessors and its successor have been considered by us before, the predecessors in <em>Commercial Credit Corp. v. State of Maryland, </em>258 Md. 192, 265 A. 2d 748 (1970); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blue Bird Cab, </em>263 Md. 655, 284 A. 2d 203 (1971); the statute here concerned in <em>State v. Greer, </em>263 Md. 692, 284 A. 2d 233 (1971) and <em>State v. One 1967 Ford Mustang, </em>266 Md. 275, 292 A. 2d 64 (1972); and its successor in <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. One 1969 Opel, </em>267 Md. 491, 298 A. 2d 168 (1973). It would serve no purpose to repeat the careful explication of the constitutional problems inherent in forfeiture statutes made for the Court by Judge Digges in <em>Blue Bird, supra, </em>263 Md. at 662, which we adopted in <em>One 1969 Opel, supra. </em>We remain unpersuaded by the due process and equal protection arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The proximity point requires little discussion. The uncontroverted testimony was that the cash, the heroin and the marijuana were in the same brown paper bag. The fact that the cash happened to be in a bank money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>sack which was also in the paper bag can scarcely be said to negate the concept of proximity, and the lower court so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The argument that the State failed to proceed with dispatch is equally unpersuasive, since it is grounded on a misreading of the statute. What it says in \u00a7 297 (b) (4) is that a forfeiture proceeding must be instituted promptly if seizure is accomplished under \u00a7 297 (b) (3) (\u201c. . . probable cause to believe that the property is directly or indirectly dangerous to health or safety\u201d) or under \u00a7 297 (b) (4) (\u201c. . . the property has been used or intended to be used in violation of this subheading.\u201d). The first condition is patently inapplicable to cash or currency, as is the second, without additional proof, which was absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">As the court below pointed out, 30 days, within which an appeal could have been entered, followed the conviction on 8 November 1971. From December 1971 to April 1972, involved a delay of some four months. The State conceded that discussions looking toward the development of a uniform procedure in forfeiture cases occupied much of this time, and it was seemingly stirred into action by the filing of Gatewood\u2019s petition in mid-April. Whatever the reason, in the absence of a clear contrary expression of legislative intent, we cannot regard this as an impermissible delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">One final question remains. The State moved to dismiss on the ground that the appellant failed to print in his record extract any part of the proceedings below other than the opinion of the lower court, in contravention of the requirement of Maryland Rule 828 b. Because the case came to us on what amounted to (but was not characterized as) an agreed statement of facts, we are not inclined to grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss denied; order affirmed, costs to be paid by appellant, Bland R. B. Gatewood.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-12\">. Gatewood\u2019s discomfiture is only exceeded by that of his counsel, to whom the $1,862.10, while still in the custody of the police, had been assigned in payment of his fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
