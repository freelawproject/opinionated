J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABM\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">This appeal is from an order of the Baltimore City Court (Harris, J.) granting a writ of mandamus directing that appellants, Board of Fire Commissioners of the City of Baltimore (the Fire Board), the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the City) and the Trustees of The Fire and Police Employees\u2019 Retirement System of the City of Baltimore (Retirement System) pay appellee, Thomas F. Potter (Potter), his full salary from December 11, 1970 to June 3, 1971; and commanding the Retirement System to revise its records to indicate June 3, 1971 as the effective date of Potter\u2019s retirement from the Fire Department on special disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">Potter, a Battalion Chief with thirty-four years service with the Fire Department, was placed \u201c.off-duty\u201d by the Department\u2019s physician on June 12, 1970 due to a \u201cline of duty\u201d injury to his right heel sustained on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>3, 1970. He thereafter was hospitalized three times and underwent surgery four times prior to December of 1970. On December 4, 1970, at the Department\u2019s suggestion, Potter applied to the Retirement System for special disability retirement benefits pursuant to Baltimore City Code (1966 Ed.), Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cUpon the application of a member or the head of his department, any member who has been totally and permanently incapacitated for duty as the result of an injury arising out of and in the course of the actual performance of duty, without wilful negligence on his part, shall be retired by the Board of Trustees, provided that the medical board shall certify that such member is physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, that such incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that such member should be retired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Informed by the Retirement System of Potter\u2019s application, the Fire Board removed Potter from the Department\u2019s payroll on December 11, 1970. Shortly thereafter, the Fire Board promoted another employee to fill Potter\u2019s position as Battalion Chief. From December 11, 1970 to January 4, 1971, Potter received no payments from either the Fire Board or the Retirement System. Between January 4, 1971 and April 1, 1971, the Retirement System paid Potter ordinary service retirement benefits as a voluntary stop-gap measure pending final decision on his application for special disability benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">On April 1, 1971, the Retirement System approved Potter\u2019s application for special disability benefits to \u201cbecome effective the first day following the last day for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>which he will be paid on the regular departmental payroll.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On April 5, 1971, the Fire Board, having received confirmation that the Retirement System had approved Potter\u2019s application for special disability benefits, requested a supplemental appropriation from the City to pay Potter his full salary from December 11, 1970 to June 3, 1971 pursuant to Baltimore City Code, Article 9, \u00a7 13, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cAny member of the Fire Department of the City of Baltimore, receiving injury or becoming disabled, while in the discharge of his duties, so as to prevent him from following his daily occupation or attending to his duties as a member of said department, such member shall, for the space of twelve months, provided his disability shall last that time, receive his usual salary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The Fire Board\u2019s request for the supplemental appropriation was denied; the denial was based on an opinion of the City Solicitor, dated June 25, 1971, which concluded that because salary benefits payable under Article 9, \u00a7 13 can only be made to a \u201cmember of the Fire Department,\u201d after Potter was determined to be within the mandatory retirement provisions of Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e), he was no longer a \u201cmember\u201d of the Department and thus was not entitled to benefits under Article 9, \u00a7 13. The City Solicitor ruled that the effective date of Potter\u2019s retirement on special disability benefits was December 4, 1970, this being the date of Potter\u2019s application therefor, and that he was eligible for full salary benefits under Article 9, \u00a7 13 only from June 3, 1970 to December 4, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Potter claimed that he was entitled to one year full salary under Article 9, \u00a7 13, and, at the expiration of that year, to special disability retirement benefits under Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e). He urged that the benefits provided by Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e) supplemented those provided un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>der Article 9, \u00a7 13, the latter providing protection to the injured employee during the fixed and definite recuperative period of a year (provided his disability shall last that time), and the former section providing for his retirement benefits in the event the injuries he sustained were found by the Retirement System to be permanent and the employee no longer able to perform his duties in the Fire Department. In support of his position, Potter maintained that both ordinances were mandatory; that they were not inconsistent with each other; that they could be construed so as to complement each other; that the ordinances constituted remedial legislation and required a liberal construction in favor of the employee in order to effectuate their benevolent purposes; and that administrative officials charged with their enforcement had consistently so construed the ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Answering Potter\u2019s suit, the appellants contended that he was entitled to full pay through December 11, 1970, but that after that time, when it became apparent from Potter\u2019s physical condition, and from his application for special disability retirement benefits, that his injury would permanently incapacitate him, the provisions of Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e) became operative and interdicted Potter\u2019s claim to full salary benefits under Article 9, \u00a7 13. Applying the definitions contained in the \u201cPension Ordinance,\u201d Article 22, \u00a7\u00a730 and 31,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellants maintained that from the date Potter received pension benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>he was no longer a \u201cmember\u201d of the Fire Department within the meaning of Article 9, \u00a7 13. Appellants maintained that by enactment of Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e), Article 9, \u00a7 13 was repealed, either expressly by Article 22, \u00a7 40 (c) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or by necessary implication to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The parties agreed that Potter was not entitled to simultaneously receive both Article 9, \u00a7 13 salary payments and Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e) special disability retirement benefits; that the former required that the recipient be a member of the Department, the latter that he be retired from that position as a beneficiary of the Retirement System; and that the requirements were mutually exclusive and the monies could not be simultaneously received.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">At the trial before Judge Harris evidence was introduced\u2014not disputed by appellants\u2014that prior to Potter\u2019s case it was the long-standing administrative practice of the City and the Fire Board to pay a fireman, injured in the line of duty, his full salary for one year subsequent to his date of injury (if his disability lasted that long) in accordance with the provisions of Article 9, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In deciding that Potter was entitled to his full salary for one year under Article 9, \u00a7 13, and thereafter to special disability retirement benefits under Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e), Judge Harris, in a very lucid analysis, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u201cAn examination of Article 9, Section 13 and Article 22, Section 34 (e) reveals, although different verbiage is used, that both ordinances relate to employees who have been injured in the course of their employment i.e., \u2018line of duty\u2019 injuries. Statutes which relate to the same general subject matter, and which are not inconsistent with each other, should be construed to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>gether so that, if possible, they will harmonize with each other and be consistent with their general object and scope, even though they were passed at different times and contain no reference to each other. <em>May v. Warnick, </em>227 Md. 77 (1961). However, if the provisions of such statutes are irreconcilable, the later statute governs to the extent of the conflict. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles v. Greyhound Corp., </em>247 Md. 662 (1967). (Article 22, Section 34 (e) is the later ordinance here, having been enacted in 1962; Article 9, Section 13 was originally enacted in 1879).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">\u201cThus, the inquiry of this Court narrows to the question of whether there is any manifest inconsistency between Article 9, Section 13 and the relevant sections of Article 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201cThis Court finds no inconsistency between them. The only limitation which Article 9, Section 13 places upon a member of the Fire Department, in collecting his full salary for a twelve month period subsequent to the date of his injury, is that the injury must last for that period of time. Article 22, Section 34 (e), does not place any limitation on the period of time in which a member must be retired to be paid special disability benefits. Compare Sections 34 (a) (Service Retirement Benefits) and 34 (c) (Ordinary Disability Retirement Benefits), under which the Board of Trustees must retire a member in service not less than thirty nor more than ninety days following the date of the filing of the application for retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u201cIf Article 22, Section 34 (e) included a time period during which it becomes mandatory for a fireman, injured in the line of duty, to be retired, perhaps the defendants\u2019 argument would be valid. However, absent any. express authorization in the ordinance for the defendants to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>move the petitioner from the \u2018active\u2019 payroll, and absent any mandatory retirement period (less than the twelve month period following the injury as provided in Article 9, Section 13), the defendants are without authority to refuse to pay petitioner his full salary for a twelve month period following his injury, providing only that his injury lasts that long. The action of the defendants in removing Chief Potter from the payroll as of December 11, 1970, flies in the face of the clear, mandatory language of Article 9, Section 13. The defendants cannot prevent Chief Potter from being a \u2018member\u2019 of the Fire Department by summarily removing him from the payroll when he filed his application for retirement. Under Article 9, Section 13, petitioner must be paid his full salary for a period of twelve months subsequent to the date of his injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cThe result of this case could impose an unjustified economic burden on the taxpayers of Baltimore City, for it is certainly improvident to pay an employee his <em>full </em>salary during a twelve month period in which he cannot work. If the situation is to be remedied, the City Council can repeal Section 13 of Article 9. In the meantime, however, the Court must interpret the law as it is written.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201cThe petitioner, of course, is not entitled to collect his full salary, and at the same time retain the benefits that were awarded to him between January 4, 1971 and April 1, 1971. Financial adjustments will have to be made to assure that the petitioner will receive not more than his full salary from June 3, 1970 to June 3, 1971. As of June 4, 1971, petitioner is entitled to \u2018special disability benefits\u2019 pursuant to Article 22, Section 34 (e).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>We fully agree with the conclusions reached by Judge Harris and since we cannot improve upon his opinion, we adopt its substance in affirming his order granting the writ of mandamus. In doing so, we especially note that Article 9, \u00a7 13 was enacted by Ordinance No. 35 on March 24, 1871 at a time when there was neither a retirement system, nor medical or workmen\u2019s compensation benefits available to members of the Department injured in the line of duty. In 1880, the Mayor and City Council were authorized \u201cto appropriate a sum of money, annually, for the relief of disabled and superannuated firemen of Baltimore City . . . under the control and supervision of the Board of Fire Commissioners of Baltimore City.\u201d Laws of Maryland 1880, ch. 409. See Code of Public Local Laws (1888), Article 4, \u00a7\u00a7 315, 315A. When the City instituted its Employees\u2019 Retirement System in 1926, available to members of the Department, Article 22, \u00a7 6 (e), the prototype for the later enacted Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e), provided accidental disability benefits. In 1962, the Fire and Police Employees\u2019 Retirement System was created as a separate branch of the Retirement System, and Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e) was enacted in its present form.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">At no time throughout these various changes was any modification made in Article 9, \u00a7 13, despite the fact that the consistent practice of the administrative bodies entrusted with dispensing these benefits had been to allow the full year of salary before commencing payment of special disability retirement benefits. The uncontested testimony at trial of the Executive Secretary of the Fire Board for the past eighteen years was to this effect; and such was the practice previously noted by us, but never directly considered. <em>See Saxton v. Board of Trustees of Fire and Police Employees Retirement System, </em>266 Md. 690, 691, 296 A. 2d 367 (1972); <em>Severn v. City of Baltimore, </em>230 Md. 160, 163, 186 A. 2d 199, 200 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In <em>Montgomery County v. Bigelow, </em>196 Md. 413, 423, 77 A. 2d 164, 168 (1950), we said: \u201cIf two legislative acts can reasonably be construed together so as to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>effect to both, such a construction is to be preferred.\u201d <em>See also May v. Warnick, </em>227 Md. 77, 175 A. 2d 413 (1961). Since Article 9, \u00a7 13 and Article 22, \u00a7 34 (e) \u201care neither irreconcilable nor mutually repugnant, they should be construed in harmony with their respective objects and tenor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Gray Concrete Pipe Company, Inc., </em>267 Md. 149, 155, 297 A. 2d 721, 725 (1972), and cases there cited. There being no conflict between the two ordinances, we need not consider the question of repeal by implication, a construction never favored by the courts. <em>See Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Silver, </em>263 Md. 439, 283 A. 2d 788 (1971), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>409 U.S. 810, 93 S. Ct. 38, 34 L.Ed2d 65 (1972); <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Silkor Development Corp., </em>246 Md. 516, 229 A. 2d 135 (1967); <em>Kirkwood v. Provident Savings Bank, </em>205 Md. 48, 106 A. 2d 103 (1954). And by so harmonizing the two enactments, proper weight is afforded the long continued administrative practice followed under the ordinances. <em>See Williams v. Associated Professors of Loyola College, </em>257 Md. 316, 263 A. 2d 5 (1970); <em>Alban Tractor Co., Inc. v. State Tax Commission, </em>219 Md. 593, 150 A. 2d 456 (1959); <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. M.E. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 107 A. 2d 93 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">That Potter accepted payments from the Retirement System from January 4 to April 1, 1971 does not constitute a waiver of his rights to full salary benefits under Article 9, \u00a7 13, particularly since he was removed from the departmental payroll and induced to apply for retirement, the payments received by him were unsolicited service retirement benefits for which he had not applied, and he relied on the long-standing administrative practice controlling the payment of such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">As the vacancy created by Potter\u2019s \u201cretirement\u201d has already been filled (and as Potter has been conclusively determined to be disabled from further duty), a supplemental appropriation will be required to pay his salary for six.months, as ordered by the lower court. If, as Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Harris so cogently observed, the application of these ordinances places an undue burden on the taxpayers of Baltimore City, their resort is to the City Council to amend or repeal Article 9, \u00a7 13. <em>See Saxton v. Board of Trustees of Fire and Police Retirement System, supra, </em>266 Md. at 694, 296 A. 2d at 369. The courts are without power to alter the existing ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\n<em>Order affirmed; appellants to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\">.
