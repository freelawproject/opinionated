Judge Smith, for the Court, has recounted the dreary details of that litigation in <em>Barrier v. Marine Midland Trust Company of Southern New York, </em>263 Md. 596, 284 A. 2d 418 (1971). We shall not repeat them here. It is necessary, however, to examine State National\u2019s cross-claim against Marine Midland for it is out of that cross-claim that this appeal arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">State National, in the first count of its cross-claim, filed on 26 February 1971, alleged, in substance, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">1. On 18 May 1970 Marine Midland requested State National to assist in the collection of a claim against Barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">2. Marine Midland agreed to indemnify State National and save it harmless \u201cfrom and against any and all claims, damages, losses and action resulting from or arising out of its efforts to collect the said claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">3. As a result of its efforts Barrier sued State National, Marine Midland, and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">4. Thereafter Marine Midland and State National agreed to pay Barrier $1,000 in full settlement and make a public apology.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">5. State National agreed to contribute $250 and mailed a check for that amount to Marine Midland which cashed the check. Barrier signed a release running to both banks; it was delivered to counsel for Marine Midland.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">6. The apology was published in the newspapers ; it received wide publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">7. Thereafter, without the knowledge and consent of State National, Marine Midland refused to pay Barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>8. In spite of State National\u2019s repeated demands Marine Midland \u201cwillfully, wrongfully, and maliciously refused and continues to refuse\u201d to complete the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">9. As a result Barrier moved to amend his declaration so as to charge conspiracy and breach of contract (Counts 4 and 5) against Marine Midland and State National.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">10. On 4 February 1971 his motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">11. As a consequence State National\u2019s reputation has been damaged and it has been forced \u201cto incur great expenses in connection therewith, <em>including counsel fees.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In the second count of the cross-claim State National, repeating paragraphs 1 through 10 of the first count, alleged that Barrier\u2019s claims arose from its efforts to comply with Marine Midland\u2019s request, that its acts in that regard have been neither negligent nor unauthorized, that it is entitled \u201cto be indemnified and saved harmless\u201d against \u201cany and all claims, losses and actions\u201d arising or resulting from its effort to collect from Barrier, that if Barrier recovers on counts 4 and 5 of his amended declaration it will be the fault of Marine Midland, not State National, that any damages sustained by Barrier under counts 4 and 5 \u201care embraced within the indemnification agreement . . . wherefore, it demands judgment . . . together with any <em>counsel fees </em>and other costs . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">A copy of the cross-claim was served on counsel for Marine Midland at or about the time of its filing. Neither plea nor demurrer nor responsive pleading of any kind has ever been filed by Marine Midland.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Two months later, on 26 April 1971, State National moved for the entry of a judgment by default on the cross-claim \u201cwhich has never been answered.\u201d As a part of its motion, it also asked the court to set a date for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>presentation of \"its proof of damages.\u201d A copy of the motion was served on counsel for Marine Midland at or about the time of filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">On 29 April there was a hearing before Taylor, J., on Marine Midland\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Barrier and State National\u2019s motion for a judgment by default. Judge Taylor noted the pendency of <em>both </em>motions before the hearing began. Also he remarked, rather pointedly, that although \u201cmore than the time allowed by the rule [Maryland Rules 807 and 310 b] [had] expired\u201d there was no plea or answer to the cross-claim. When counsel for Marine Midland objected to the entry of the judgment by default, the colloquy which follows took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cThe Court: Well, you had notice of it. Weren\u2019t you served with a notice of the cross-claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cMr. Miller: Yes, your Honor, and we did not plead, and also the motion for the default, and we didn\u2019t answer that, because we knew that the motion for summary judgment was coming today. We didn\u2019t know that the motion for default was coming up today, and we assume that today\u2019s hearing will dispose of everything.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cThe Court: Did you assume it would dispose of everything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201cMr. Miller: I\u2014let me say that I definitely assume that as confident as we are that the Court will grant our motion for summary judgment that once that was done everything else would fall into place. But we would like an opportunity to be heard on the motion for default judgment. And as far as I am concerned I am willing to do that at the time that\u2014if a time comes that there is a necessity for proof to be offered to damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">When Judge Taylor announced his intention to grant Marine Midland\u2019s motion for summary judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Barrier, his (Barrier\u2019s) counsel indicated his intention to appeal to this Court. The court then took up State National\u2019s motion for a judgment by default. Counsel for State National made explicit reference during the colloquy to Marine Midland\u2019s obligation to indemnify it \u201cagainst any costs or losses . . . including attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d The colloquy went on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u201cMr. Miller: He is asking for default judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cThe Court: Which really doesn\u2019t hurt you, does it, unless it comes back, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cMr. Miller: Maybe I should ask the Court for, first to deny default judgment on the basis of the argument I just made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cSecond, to permit leave to file a plea to the cross-claim against us and for this reason, therefore, to say that I always took the position, and, therefore, never felt really the obligation to enter a plea, and it may have been a mis judgment, if this motion for summary judgment would just wrap the whole thing up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u201cThe Court: How long ago did you file the motion cross-claim, Mr. \u2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">\u201cMr. Frosh: February 23, your Honor. I don\u2019t think there is a question they are obligated to us. We have an indemnification agreement which says we agree to indemnify and save you harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, and actions resulting from or arising out of your efforts to collect the above claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">\u201cThe Court: I tell you what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll deny your request for relief, Mr. Miller. I\u2019ll grant motion for judgment by default.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">\u201cIf you are right, it doesn\u2019t hurt you. If you are wrong, well, you have got to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">\u201cMr. Miller: Thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>On the same day, 29 April, Judge Taylor signed and filed [as of 11 May) the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201cThe Defendant State National Bank\u2019s Motion for Default Judgment having been filed, read and considered by the Court; and after arguments in open court; it is by the Court this 29 day of April, 1971,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cORDERED that judgment be entered in favor of The State National Bank of Bethesda against Marine Midland Trust Company of Southern New York for all sums which the State National Bank shall have incurred, including attorney\u2019s fees in connection with the within cause, all as set forth in the cross-claim of the Cross-Plaintiff State National Bank, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cORDERED that a hearing to determine such damages be set after the final conclusion of all proceedings in this cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">A copy was sent to counsel for Marine Midland on 10 May.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">On 13 May Barrier noted his appeal from Marine Midland\u2019s summary judgment for $2,152.22. On 8 December 1971 we reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case for trial on counts 4 and 5 of Barrier\u2019s amended declaration. <em>Barrier v. Marine Midland Trust Company of Southern New York, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Following the remand Marine Midland settled with Barrier. State National neither knew of nor participated in the settlement although it was named in the release. On 3 February counsel- for State National sent to the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County the letter which follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">\u201cWould you be kind enough to set a date in the above captioned cause for a hearing on the ex-parte proof by State National Bank on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>judgment by default against Marine Midland Trust Company of Southern New York. You will note in the docket entries in this case (Law. No. 44,697) that on May 11, 1971 a \u2018judgment by default entered in favor of The State National Bank of Bethesda and against Marine Midland Trust Company of Southern New York, subject to ex parte proof\u2019 was entered. We understand that the matter has now been settled between Mr. Barrier and Marine Midland Trust Company of Southern New York, and that a Line of Dismissal of all parties will soon be filed by Mr. Barrier, so that it is now appropriate for our ex parte hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cI would appreciate the earliest possible date on this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Pursuant to counsel\u2019s request the case came on for a hearing before Bowie, J., on 29 February 1972. What follows is an excerpt from the colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201cNow, I [counsel for State National] have been in touch with Mr. Miller [counsel for Marine Midland], and I submitted to Mr. Miller my time sheets as counsel to State National Bankfor the time that was expended by counsel ever since May of 1970 up through today</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">\u201c. . . I have heard nothing from Marine Midland or Mr. Miller that would contradict the time involved, and these are the direct out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">\u201cThe Court: . . . [B]ut you are not really disputing the technical proof or the proffer of proof that he has given regarding the $5,500, the submitting of the hours, the number of hours, the amount of the rate he charges, the $250 advance figure or the brief figure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201cMr. Miller: That is right, your Honor. What he has he has.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Judge Bowie took the case under advisement and gave both sides an opportunity to \u201csubmit points and authorities.\u201d Counsel for Marine Midland made no effort to submit \u201cpoints and authorities\u201d in respect of the issue of damages. Instead he filed, on 23 March 1972, a motion to strike and vacate the judgment by default entered 29 April 1971. Judge Bowie, after considering the \u201cdivers and numerous memoranda\u201d filed by the parties, found, among a number of other things, that \u201cneither the necessity nor the reasonableness of the fees was disputed.\u201d On 31 May he denied the motion to strike and vacate and he entered judgment for State National against Marine Midland for \u201c$5,500 attorney\u2019s fees and costs of suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Marine Midland pelted Judge Bowie with a barrage of contentions and authorities which might well have required serious consideration had they been presented at a hearing on a demurrer to the cross-claim or, after a proper defensive pleading, in the course of a defense on the merits. With equal fervor it has fired the same barrage at us. It makes much, for instance, of the notion that counsel fees are not within the scope of indemnity agreements and, to be sure, there are cases that so hold. But the problem here is not the construction of an indemnity agreement; it is the integrity of a judgment obtained as a result of the deliberate, multiple, inexplicable and unexplained default of Marine Midland. And that judgment is a hard, cold, ineluctable fact. Were we to overturn it we might as well make a bonfire out of the Maryland Rules and a number of our recent decisions as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In <em>Millison v. Ades of Lexington, Inc., </em>262 Md. 319, 328, 277 A. 2d 579 (1971), Judge Smith, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">\u201c. . . \u2018Like every other judgment, it is conclusive of every fact necessary to uphold it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Freeman on Judgments, </em>sec. 330. . . .\u2019 This Court cannot go behind the judgment by default to examine into and determine upon the validity of the cause of action upon which suit is instituted, <em>Stansbury v. Keady, </em>29 Md. 361, 368 (1868), and any testimony offered to contradict liability is inadmissible, <em>Betz v. Welty, </em>116 Md. 190, 195, 81 A. 382 (1911).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Quite recently, in <em>Ventresca v. Weaver Brothers, Inc., </em>266 Md. 398, 403-05, 292 A. 2d 656 (1972), Judge Levine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">\u201cRule 625 a provides in relevant part that after a judgment becomes enrolled by the expiration of 30 days following its entry, the court has \u2018revisory power and control over such judgment, only in case of fraud, mistake or irregularity.\u2019 As a result of a host of decisions too numerous to list completely here, it is now axiomatic that the power of the court to revise and control an enrolled judgment is no longer discretionary. <em>Berwyn Fuel &amp; Feed Co. v. Kolb, </em>249 Md. 475, 240 A. 2d 239 (1968); <em>Suburban Properties Management, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>236 Md. 455, 204 A. 2d 326 (1964); <em>Tasea Inv. Corp. v. Dale, </em>222 Md. 474, 160 A. 2d 920 (1960), and <em>Williams v. Snyder, Adm\u2019r, supra, </em>are but a few of the cases which stand for that proposition......</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">\u201cFrom numerous decisions applying Rule 625 a, there have also emerged the requirements that, in addition to proving \u2018fraud, mistake or irregularity,\u2019 one seeking to set aside an enrolled judgment must also establish that he is acting in good faith, with ordinary diligence, and that he has a meritorious defense. <em>Temple </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Hill Baptist Church, Inc. v. Dodson, </em>259 Md. 515, 270 A. 2d 802 (1970); <em>Grantham v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>251 Md. 28, 246 A. 2d 548 (1968); <em>Eliason v. Commissioner of Personnel, </em>230 Md. 56, 185 A. 2d 390 (1962); <em>Berwyn Fuel &amp; Feed Co. v. Kolb, </em>and <em>Tasea Inv. Corp. v. Dale, </em>both <em>supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">\u201cIn <em>Grantham v. Board of County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>where <em>Berwyn Fuel &amp; Feed Co. v. Kolb, supra, </em>was quoted with approval, the burden which the party seeking to strike out an enrolled judgment must meet was summarized as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cAs was pointed out in <em>Tasea Investment Corp. v. Dale, </em>222 Md. 474, 160 A. 2d 920 (1960) and in <em>Murray v. Fishman Construction Co., </em>241 Md. 538, 217 A. 2d 357 (1966), the trial court, besides requiring the party, who moves to set aside an enrolled judgment, to prove that he is acting in good faith and with diligence and that he has a meritorious defense, should also require a showing of such facts and circumstances as will establish the fraud, mistake or irregularity allegedly used to obtain the judgment sought to be vacated.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Put bluntly Marine Midland has not alleged in its motion to strike, nor has it shown, anything within a country mile of what we have said is required to vacate an enrolled judgment. Judge Digges provided us with an appropriate coda for this case when he said, for the Court, in <em>Maggin v. Stevens, </em>266 Md. 14, 19, 291 A. 2d 440 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">\u201cWe have no hesitancy in concluding that the judgment here results from inattention to the requirements necessary to prevent its entry; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>was certainly not procured by either fraud, mistake or irregularity. Since more than thirty days had elapsed from the entry, on 10 December 1970, of the judgment by default until a motion was filed to vacate that order, Chief Judge Shook was without power to set aside the judgment on 14 May 1971. Judge Moore was correct in reinstating the judgment by default.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"An3C\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\">.
