In substance, this Rule provided that a party\u2019s right of removal shall be regarded as having been waived unless a written suggestion of removal shall have been filed within 45 days after a case is at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Concomitantly, Maryland Constitution, Art. IV, \u00a7 8, which conditions a party\u2019s right of removal on the filing of a \u201csuggestion in writing under oath,\u201d was also controlling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>On 26 November 1971, the Dillons, defendants below and appellants here, filed a suggestion of removal, which was not under oath. At that time, the case was not at issue but became so when the Dillons\u2019 plea was filed on 2 December 1971. Five days later, the trial court denied the Dillons\u2019 suggestion of removal because it failed to comply with the mandate of our Constitution that it be under oath. From 2 December 1971, 45 days passed during which the Dillons did nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Finally, on 25 May 1971, the Dillons filed a suggestion and affidavit of removal, in proper form. From an order of 5 June 1972, denying the suggestion, the Dillons have appealed.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>In <em>Shreffler v. Morris, </em>262 Md. 161, 277 A. 2d 62 (1971), we upheld the validity of Sixth Circuit Rule 542. For the reasons which underlay the Rule, <em>see Smith v. Fredericktown Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>258 Md. 141, 143-44, 265 A. 2d 236 (1970) and 2 Poe, <em>Pleading and Practice </em>\u00a7 103 at 79-80 (5th ed. Tiffany 1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The appellants advance the tenuous contention that the nonconforming suggestion of removal which they filed on 26 November 1971 was either legitimatized by the suggestion which they filed in proper form on 25 May 1972, or alternatively, that it should be regarded as evidence of an intent not to waive their right of removal. They argue that the denial of the May suggestion somehow amounts to an infringement of their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">While a constitutional provision granting the right of removal is to be liberally construed, such right \u201cmay be subject to reasonable procedural restraint to promote administration of justice,\u201d <em>Shreffler v. Morris, supra, </em>262 Md. at 169. As the Supreme Court commented in a parallel situation, \u201cNo procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right. . . .\u201d <em>Yakus v. United States, </em>321 U. S. 414, 444, 64 S. Ct. 660, 88 L. Ed. 834 (1944); <em>Singer v. United States, </em>380 U. S. 24, 36-37, 85 S. Ct. 783, 13 L.Ed.2d 630 (1965); <em>Michel v. Louisiana, </em>350 U. S. 91, 99, 76 S. Ct. 158, 100 L. Ed. 83 (1955); <em>Williams v. Georgia, </em>349 U. S. 375, 382-83, 75 S. Ct. 814, 99 L. Ed. 1161 (1955). This Court requires faithful and seasonable compliance with the constitutional provisions upon which effective removal is conditioned. The facts in this case indicate an \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938) and a resultant acquiescence in the jurisdiction of the court in which the action was first brought. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the intent of the Rule and its policy of minimizing opportunities for the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>dilatory tactics in pretrial procedure through reasonable regulation. <em>See Smith v. Fredericktown Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>258 Md. at 143-44 and <em>Houston v. Lloyd\u2019s Consumer Acceptance Corp., </em>241 Md. 10, 14-24, 215 A. 2d 192 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The short answer is that pleading, although now stripped of many of its hoary technicalities, may still be likened to a game which must be played by the rules, one of which is that the play is over when the whistle blows.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For a period of 45 days from 2 December 1971, when the case was at issue, and certainly for a period of 40 days from 7 December 1971, when their first suggestion of removal was denied, the Dillons knew that they had missed the mark. That they did not endeavor to cure the deficiency until 25 May 1972 was a choice which was theirs alone, and by then the game was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\">. \u201cRule 542.

It should be emphasized that the case is not controlled by Maryland Rule 542 a. 3 Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol. 9B, 1972 Supp.) which became effective 1 June 1972. It differs from the Sixth Circuit rule in requiring that the suggestion be filed within 60 days:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u201c3. Waiver of Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">\u201cThe right of removal provided for in this Rule is waived by a party unless the written suggestion is filed within sixty (60) days after the action is at issue or after an issue from an Orphans\u2019 Court or appeal from a Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission is filed, or within sixty (60) days of the docketing of any action removed from another county or transferred from the District Court. Thereafter an action may be removed only by order of court for good cause shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b162-12\">.
