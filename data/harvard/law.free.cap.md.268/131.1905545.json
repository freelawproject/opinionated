At the time the Maragousises bought the property, about one acre, abutting the southwest quadrant of the intersection of Maryland Routes 2 and 214, was zoned Heavy Commercial; the remainder, Agricultural. In a comprehensive rezoning of the First District by Bill 88-71 adopted by the County Council on 30 December 1971, the Maragousises\u2019 property was reclassified as Deferred Development District.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The Maragousises, believing themselves aggrieved by the action of the County Council, sought declaratory relief in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From a decree declaring \u00a7\u00a7 13-320 through 13-320.4 of Article VI of the County\u2019s zoning regulations unconstitutional as applied to the Maragousises\u2019 property, the County has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Anne Arundel County Code (1967, as supplemented) Art. VI, \u00a7 13-320, described the underlying purpose of the Deferred Development District classification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">\u201cDeferred development districts shall allow for orderly development in accordance with the general development plan by preventing premature piecemeal development that is non-comprehensive in nature, and is detrimental to the economic viability of the county.

He found, and we agree, that a literal reading of this section would deprive the owner of a three-acre parcel of any reasonable use of his property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which amounts to an unconstitutional taking without compensation, <em>Spaid v.

Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>264 Md. 691, 694, 288 A. 2d 119 (1972); <em>Mandel v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>238 Md. 208, 215, 208 A. 2d 710 (1965); <em>Yorkdale Corporation v. Powell, </em>237 Md. 121, 124-28, 205 A. 2d 269 (1964),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <em>compare Springloch Area Citizens Group v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>252 Md. 717, 723, 251 A. 2d 357 (1969). The amendment of \u00a7 3-320.1 and of \u00a7 13-320.3 marked the opening of an entirely new ball game, because the uses permitted by \u00a7 3-303.1 were obviously much wider in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In its reply brief, the County pointed out that \u00a7 13.-320.3 (b), added by Bill 159-72, had made it possible for the Maragousises to use their lot as a site for a residence. In argument before us, however, the County conceded that the definition of \u201clot\u201d contained in \u00a7 13-300.2 (47) of the County Code,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">\u201c [A] portion of a subdivision, or any other par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>cel of land (whether immediate or future), not including multifamily development\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">clearly did not encompass the Maragousises\u2019 tract, which was not a <em>portion </em>of anything. As a consequence, the County said, \u00a7 13-320.3, which reappeared as \u00a7 13-320.3 (a) in Bill 159-72, and required that each principal structure be located on \u201ca lot having a net area of not less than five (5) acres\u201d does not apply to the Maragousises\u2019 land, which now may be used for any of the uses permitted by \u00a7 13-303.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Since neither this concessum nor Bill 159-72 was before the lower court, the whole picture has been drastically altered. It may well be that the Maragousises are no longer denied any reasonable use of the property. The mere fact that they may be denied the use they had in mind\u2014a gasoline filling station\u2014does not necessarily mean that they have been denied due process. Our cases have uniformly held that a restriction on use which results in economic loss to the landowner, absent his possession of some vested right, is not necessarily an arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious exercise of the zoning power, <em>Montgomery County v. Laughlin, </em>255 Md. 724, 735, 259 A. 2d 293 (1969); <em>Helfrich v. Mongelli, </em>248 Md. 498, 502-03, 237 A. 2d 454 (1968); <em>Tauber v.

The Maragousises\u2019 expert witness testified that the value of the tract dropped from $70,000.00 to $6,380.00 as a consequence of the rezoning; Mr. Maragousis thought the value had dropped from $80,000.00 to $3,000.00 or $4,000.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-15\">.
