There can be no judgment by default against a plaintiff. The sanction provided under Maryland Rule 417 d properly applicable to the plaintiff-appellant here was for the trial court to \u201cdismiss the action.\u201d In other words, to enter a judgment of <em>non pros. See 2 </em>Poe, <em>Pleading &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7\u00a7 362 and 365, at 348-351 (5th ed. Tiffany 1925). Entry of \u201cjudgment by default\u201d was a nullity. The interests of justice dictate prompt trial on the merits upon the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\n<em>Order vacated and case remanded for trial; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
