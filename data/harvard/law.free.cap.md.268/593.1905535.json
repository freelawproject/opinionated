J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATe\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The testator in this case, William L. Benjamin, Sr., died on August 4,1971, at the age of fifty, from an overdose of barbiturates. In due course, a petition for probate and a will dated July 12, 1971 were filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Prince George\u2019s County by appellee, Kenneth S. Woodring, Jr., as Personal Representative of the testator\u2019s estate. Shortly thereafter, the appellant, Betty L. Benjamin, the testator\u2019s wife, filed a petition and caveat, together with an earlier will executed by the testator on November 27, 1968; she sought to have the 1968 will admitted to probate, claiming that the 1971 will was null and void for want of testamentary capacity. The issue of testamentary capacity was certified to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and a jury was impanelled. At trial, Judge William H. McCullough presiding, appellant undertook to establish that when the testator executed the 1971 will, he was suffering from an insane delusion with respect to her marital fidelity, and that the will, as a product of that delusion, was improperly admitted to probate. The court directed a verdict in appellee\u2019s favor at the end of the appellant\u2019s case, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The evidence at trial showed that appellant and the testator began living together in 1962, and had one son, William L. Benjamin, Jr. (known as David), born August 30, 1963. They were married on December 24, 1966. Each had children by previous marriages; no other children were born after the marriage. Appellant testified that the testator was \u201ca very, very jealous man, and while he never really accused me of any particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>man at any time during our entire married life, if I had talked to another man he automatically assumed that they wanted to go to bed with me.\u201d She said that she had given her husband no reason to doubt her fidelity during their married life, and that he had never accused her of being unfaithful. She testified that during the last six months of their marriage, the testator had become \u201cvery reserved in communication with me,\u201d but that otherwise things were \u201cpretty much the same.\u201d She said that they had never discussed divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Ben Schwartz testified that the testator was his \u201cdearest friend\u201d; that in the month of July 1971, and on several prior occasions within six months of his death, the testator indicated to him that he was considering divorcing the appellant. Schwartz testified that in early July 1971 the testator told him that he was preparing a will \u201cto make sure, I think, the children were protected, and he wanted to make sure PGP [Prince George\u2019s Properties, Inc.] was protected.\u201d Schwartz recalled \u201csomething . . . [the testator] did say about infidelity to me at one time there.\u201d He said that he tried to make the testator \u201cunderstand at the time that I felt that he was more or less overreacting\u201d; that \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that this was so at all.\u201d When asked exactly what the testator said with respect to the appellant\u2019s infidelity, Schwartz replied: \u201cHonestly before God, I cannot remember what he actually did say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Appellant also called Dr. Charles Springate, an assistant State medical examiner who had examined the testator\u2019s remains. The court advised the jury that according to the death certificate prepared by Dr. Springate \u201cthe immediate cause of death was an overdose of barbiturates.\u201d Upon appellee\u2019s objection, the court refused to admit into evidence the death certificate which expressed Dr. Springate\u2019s opinion that death resulted from suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Three documents pertinent to the issue of insane delusion were admitted into evidence: the 1968 and 1971 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>wills, and a note written in the testator\u2019s handwriting to the appellant. By the terms of the 1968 will, the testator\u2019s entire estate was given to appellant with the further provision that if she predeceased the testator, the estate would go to their five named children in trust during the minority of any of them, \u201cabsolutely and in fee simple\u201d when the last shall have attained his majority. By the terms of his 1971 will, the testator limited appellant to her statutory share of his estate;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he made specific bequests to three children,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and two non-relatives ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he directed a continuation of payments in the amount of present alimony to his first wife; and he gave the residue of his estate to \u201cDavid\u201d Benjamin in trust during his minority. The 1971 will also directed the Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>sonal Representative, upon David\u2019s majority, to sell all shares of Prince George\u2019s Properties, Inc. (the testator\u2019s main business interest) with first right of refusal granted to specified \u201cfaithful and trusted employees,\u201d' the proceeds to be divided equally among the three children. The total amount of the estate is not indicated in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The testator\u2019s handwritten note admitted into evidence was found by appellant in a briefcase shortly after his death; dated June 28, 1971\u2014approximately two weeks before the will in question was executed, and approximately five weeks before the testator\u2019s death\u2014the testator\u2019s note to the appellant was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">\u201cBetty Benjamin</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">I guess there is so much to say I find it difficult in starting.

Rody, </em>180 Md. 471, 477-478, 25 A. 2d 457, 460 (1942). To set a will aside on the ground of a delusion, it is necessary for the caveator to show (1) that the delusion was an insane delusion, and (2) that the will was the consequence or the product of the delusion. <em>Sellers v. Qualls, </em>206 Md. 58, 110 A. 2d 73 (1954); <em>Doyle v. Rody, supra; Johnson v. Johnson, </em>105 Md. 81, 65 A. 918 (1907); <em>Jones v. Collins, </em>94 Md. 403, 51 A. 398 (1902). An insane delusion, in the legal sense, is \u201ca belief in things impossible, or a belief in things possible, but so improbable under the surrounding circumstances, that no man of sound mind could give them credence,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, supra, </em>105 Md. at 85-86, 65 A. at 919; otherwise defined, an insane delusion is \u201ca false belief for which there is no reasonable foundation, and which would be incredible under similar circumstances to the same person if he were of sound mind, and concerning which his mind is not open to permanent correction through argument or evidence,\u201d <em>Doyle v. Rody, supra, </em>180 Md. at 479, 25 A. 2d at 461.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also Townshend v. Townshend, </em>7 Gill 10 (1848). The testator may be outwardly competent in every other area and yet have an insane delusion or \u201cmonomania.\u201d <em>Brown v. Ward, </em>53 Md. 376, 394 (1880). The law of insane delusion, as expounded in England by Chief Justice Cockburn in <em>Banks v. Goodfellow, </em>5 L.R.Q.B. 549, 560, 565, was quoted by us with approval in <em>Doyle, </em>180 Md. at 478-79, 25 A. 2d at 461, <em>viz.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\u201c \u2018The pathology of mental disease and the experience of insanity in its various forms teach us that while, on the one hand, all the faculties, moral and intellectual, may be involved in one common ruin, as in the case of the raving maniac, in other instances one or more only of these faculties or functions may be disordered, while the rest are left unimpaired and undisturbed; that while the mind may be overpowered by delusions which utterly demoralize it and unfit it for the perception of the true nature of surrounding things, or for the discharge of the common obligations of life, there often are, on the other hand, delusions, which, though the offspring of mental disease and so far constituting insanity, yet leave the individual in all other respects rational, and capable of transacting the ordinary affairs and fulfilling the duties and obligations incidental to the various relations of life. No doubt when delusions exist which have no foundation in reality, and spring only from a diseased and morbid condition of the mind, to that extent the mind must necessarily be taken to be unsound .... It is essential to the exercise of such power . . . that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties\u2014that no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made. ... If the human instincts and affections, or the moral sense, become perverted by mental disease; if insane suspicion, or aversion, take the place of natural affection; if reason and judgment are lost, and the mind becomes a prey to insane delusions, calculated to interfere with and destroy its functions, and to lead to a testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>mentary disposition, due only to their baneful influence\u2014in such a case it is obvious that the condition of the testamentary power fails, and that a will made under such circumstances ought not to stand.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The law in Maryland on insane delusions is in accord with the law in other jurisdictions. <em>See </em>1 Page, <em>Law of Wills </em>631, \u00a7\u00a7 12.29, <em>et seq. </em>(Bowe-Parker Revision 1965); Atkinson, <em>Handbook of the Law of Wills, </em>242-48 (2d Ed. 1953); 94 C.J.S. <em>Wills </em>\u00a7 18 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In determining whether appellant produced evidence legally sufficient to survive the motion for a directed verdict, we must resolve all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the caveatrix, and assume the truth of the evidence produced thereby, as well as all reasonable inferences in her favor that may be drawn from the evidence. <em>Ingalls v. Trustees of Mt. Oak Methodist Church Cemetery, </em>244 Md. 243, 247, 223 A. 2d 778, 779 (1966). We thus are not concerned with the weight of the evidence produced by the caveatrix (which appellant concedes, <em>arguendo, </em>is slight and which she characterizes in a more affirmative vein as \u201csophisticated\u201d and \u201csubtle\u201d), but rather its legal sufficiency to carry the case to the jury under the test above articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The testator\u2019s handwritten note contains statements from which the jury could reasonably infer that he believed his wife was unfaithful to him, both before and after their marriage, and that he had recently given up hope that she would change her ways. The testimony of Schwartz tended to corroborate the existence of this suspicion in the testator\u2019s mind. Appellant testified that she had never given the testator any reason to doubt her fidelity; her testimony was buttressed by that of Schwartz, the testator\u2019s \u201cdearest friend,\u201d when he said: \u201cI tried to make him [testator] understand . . . that I felt that he was more or less over-reacting. I didn\u2019t feel that this was so at all.\u201d From this evidence we think a jury could have found that the testator, during a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>within weeks of the execution of the 1971 will, was suffering from an insane delusion, as defined by cases such as <em>Doyle, i.e., </em>\u201ca false belief for which there is no reasonable foundation, and which would be incredible under similar circumstances to the same person if he were of sound mind, and concerning which his mind is not open to permanent correction through argument or evidence.\u201d Interwoven among the implications of infidelity and misconduct contained in the testator\u2019s note to the appellant are references to intended changes in his will (\u201cI made some changes, which I\u2019m sure will stand up any court you appeal to\u201d; \u201cI didn\u2019t leave you anything and I hope the shop get involved in the estate\u201d), which, when considered in light of the provision actually made in the will limiting her to the bare minimum required by law, could lead a jury reasonably to conclude that the diminishment in appellant\u2019s share of the testator\u2019s estate, comparing the 1968 and 1971 wills, was the result of an insane delusion entertained by him concerning his wife\u2019s fidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We think, therefore, that legally sufficient evidence was adduced by appellant to require submission of the case to the jury on the question of testamentary capacity at the time the testator executed his 1971 will. In so concluding, we neither give nor imply any view as to the proper resolution of the substantive issue; we hold only that on the state of the record before us, the trial court was in error in taking the case from the jury and directing a verdict against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">As heretofore indicated the trial court advised the jury of the parties\u2019 stipulation that the death certificate prepared by Dr. Springate, the assistant medical examiner, stated that the immediate cause of the testator\u2019s death was an \u201coverdose of barbiturates.\u201d The court refused, however, to admit the death certificate itself into evidence on the ground that it contained Dr. Springate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>opinion that the testator\u2019s death resulted from suicide. Appellant challenges the court\u2019s ruling, contending that the death certificate was admissible in its entirety. She claims that the issue of suicide is relevant in the case; that even though not constituting proof per se of the testator\u2019s suffering from insane delusions, it can be, together with the other facts in evidence, a fact bearing upon testamentary capacity at the time the will was executed, consistent with our holding in <em>McElwee v. Ferguson, </em>43 Md. 479 (1876). Since on retrial of the case the issue is likely to arise again, we shall express our views for the guidance of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The record shows that appellant proffered a certified true copy of the \u201cMedical Examiner\u2019s Certificate of Death.\u201d Over the signature of Dr. Springate, it contained the name of the testator, factual information as to his sex, race, date of birth, date pronounced dead, address, marital status, and on line 17 \u201cInformant\u201d indicated <em>\u201c\u00c9etty L. </em>Benjamin.\u201d The following responses (italicized) were contained in the section marked \u201cMEDICAL CERTIFICATION:\u201d line 18, \u201cDeath was caused by: Immediate cause\u201d <em>\u201cOverdose of </em>barbiturate\u201d; line 21c \u201cHow injury occurred,\u201d <em>\u201cTook overdose of barbiturate.\u201d </em>Line 22a of the same \u201cMEDICAL CERTIFICATION\u201d section read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cI certify that I took charge of the remains described above,, held on Autopsy \u25a1, <em>Inspection </em>[x|, Inquiry \u25a1, and in my opinion death resulted from: Natural causes \u25a1, Accident \u25a1, <em>Suicide </em>(x|, Homicide \u25a1, Undetermined manner</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Dr. Springate testified that his inspection of the remains of the testator consisted of an external examination of the body, and three fluid tests which showed blood barbiturates at 3.27 milligrams per cent (short acting barbiturate type); blood alcohol negative; carbon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>monoxide level normal. He said that the 3.27 milligrams per cent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201c. . . is extremely high because it is considerably higher than the blood barbiturate level, that is, short acting barbiturate level, that we ordinarily find in cases of people who die as a result of an overdose of barbiturate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The court ruled that that part of the death certificate expressing Dr. Springate\u2019s opinion that death resulted from suicide was inadmissible in evidence under Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Article 43, \u00a7 26, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">\u201cCertificates of birth, death and fetal death filed within one year after the event, and certified copies of such certificates shall be prima facie evidence of the <em>facts therein stated. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The court explained its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">\u201cThe Court feels that the statute does not say that the certificate shall be prima facie evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>of all the matters required to be incorporated in the statute. The statute, in making the certificate prima facie evidence, confines itself to \u2018facts\u2019 and makes no reference to indications, inferences, or conclusions drawn by the certificate maker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The court had earlier indicated that, on the basis of three blood tests and an external examination, Dr. Springate lacked a foundation for his opinion that the overdose was deliberate rather than accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">There are no Maryland cases bearing on the question whether, under Article 43, \u00a7 26 or Article 22, \u00a7 8, recitals in a death certificate constitute admissible proof that death resulted from suicide; under similar statutes, however, the question has been frequently involved in litigation in other jurisdictions (in suits to recover insurance proceeds, and in workmen\u2019s compensation, wrongful death, and homicide cases). See cases collected in: Annot., (\u201cOfficial Death Certificate As Evidence Of Cause of Death in Civil or Criminal Action\u201d) 21 A.L.R.3d 418 (1968); Annot., (\u201cInsurance: coroner\u2019s verdict or report as evidence on issue of suicide\u201d) 28 A.L.R.2d 352 (1953); 5 Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>588-90, \u00a7 1646 (3d Ed. 1940); 30 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1009 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Prior to the enactment of statutes such as Article 22, \u00a7 8 and Article 43, \u00a7 26, Maryland courts refused to admit a death certificate in evidence, finding that it was subject to a hearsay objection among others. <em>Standard Gas Equipment Corp. v. Baldwin, </em>152 Md. 321, 325-26, 136 A. 644, 646 (1927); <em>Supreme Council of the Royal Arcanum v. Brashears, </em>89 Md. 624, 629, 43 A. 866, 868 (1899); <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. of New York v. Anderson, </em>79 Md. 375, 378-79, 29 A. 606, 607 (1894). Subsequent cases insisted on strict adherence to the statutory requirements, <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. State ex rel. Blueford, </em>173 Md. 267, 270, 195 A. 571, 573 (1937), <em>Rasnick v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 564, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>568-69, 256 A. 2d 543, 545-46 (1969), but held that when such requirements were met, pertinent parts of the certificate were admissible. <em>State ex rel. Schiller v. Hecht Co., </em>165 Md. 415, 424, 169 A. 311, 314 (1933). <em>Cf. Carroll v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 412, 274 A. 2d 677 (1971). None of these cases, however, directly involved the question whether the entry on the death certificate of an opinion as to the manner of death (accident, homicide, suicide), as opposed to demonstrable medical facts as to the cause of death (overdose of barbiturate), constitutes evidence admissible under the cited Maryland statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">On this issue, the cases in other jurisdictions are divided, some courts holding that opinions or conclusions contained in a properly certified death certificate are admissible as \u201cfacts therein stated,\u201d <em>see, e.g., California State Life Ins. Co. v. Fuqua, </em>40 Ariz. 148, 10 P. 2d 958 (1932), other courts strictly limiting the statutory language to \u201cfacts,\u201d refusing to admit portions of the certificate which plainly represent opinions or conclusions of the maker, <em>see, e.g., Carson v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>156 Ohio St. 104, 112-14, 100 N.E.2d 197, 202-03 (1951). We think the latter position is the better-reasoned in light of the statutory duties imposed upon medical examiners in this State under Article 22 of the Code. Under the Maryland statutes, post-mortem examiners are expressly denied the power formerly held by coroners\u2014whom they replaced in 1939\u2014to summon a jury of inquisition to inquire into the circumstances surrounding death; instead, the investigative duties of medical examiners are limited to \u201cessential facts concerning the <em>medical </em>causes of death.\u201d Article 22, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 9. It was the evident intention of the Legislature when enacting Article 22 to separate the former duties of coroners into two separate spheres, delegated to persons possessing the requisite expertise in each sphere\u2014the medical duties to be performed by the medical examiner, and the non-medical investigatory function committed to State\u2019s Attorneys. Article 22, \u00a7 8. Indeed, the distinction is recognized in the wording of the death certificate form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>itself which, on line 22a, calls for an \u201copinion\u201d by the medical examiner as to whether death resulted from natural causes, accident, suicide, homicide, or by an \u201cundetermined manner,\u201d the \u201copinion\u201d being distinct from the other facts required to be recited in the medical certification. <em>See </em>41 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 242 (1956), noting that while it is not within the province of medical examiners to determine the \u201cmanner of death,\u201d nevertheless it is incumbent upon them in completing the form to state their \u201copinion\u201d on the question. We conclude therefore that that part of the death certificate setting forth the medical examiner\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d that the testator\u2019s death resulted from suicide was not admissible in evidence, as held by Judge McCullough.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in refusing to admit into evidence medical records of the testator from 1950-1951 and from 1962-1963, as well as medical testimony with reference thereto. She claims that the proffered medical records and testimony would \u201cpaint a picture of a man who had been certified permanently insane by the United States Navy, schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type, and discharged on that basis in 1952\u201d; that such proffered records and testimony would show that in 1963 when examined by Dr. Williams, the testator was suffering from psychosomatic complaints and was diagnosed as having schizo-depression. Appellant maintains that it was her intention to show by the medical history that the testator suffered from delusional behavior starting in 1950; that the behavior was never treated; that the testator \u201chad an episode reported in 1962 and early 1963\u201d; and that he continued to exhibit delusional behavior which culminated in his focusing the delusions on his wife and child.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">None of the witnesses testifying about the testator\u2019s medical records were prepared by personal knowledge to connect his past medical history to the will executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>many years later on July 12, 1971, although appellant did make the proffer that she would later produce a psychiatric expert to tie all the evidence together to show \u201cthat this will was the product of insane delusion, that he was suffering from delusions, and that his character was delusional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In sustaining appellee\u2019s objections to the admissibility of all such evidence, the trial court ruled that none of it was admissible \u201cbecause of the remoteness in time.\u201d Since it is likely that these evidentiary questions will present themselves again upon retrial of the case, we shall consider them in an effort to be of assistance to the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In cases concerning general testamentary capacity, we have recently reaffirmed the long-standing rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201c. . . that while testimony tending to establish competency may relate to periods preceding or succeeding the execution of the will, testimony tending to establish incompetency must reasonably relate to the date of execution . . . .\u201d <em>Webster v. Larmore, </em>268 Md. 153, 164, 299 A. 2d 814, 820 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Of course, in any challenge to testamentary capacity, the nature of the insanity claimed will largely determine how remote the evidence may be, Page, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 29.58 at 538. We are not persuaded, however, to announce a different rule in cases, as here, where the alleged testamentary incapacity is based on the existence of an insane delusion. In the instant case, the testator\u2019s proffered past psychiatric history concerned symptoms not shown to be within the legal definition of an insane delusion; further, the symptoms were unconnected to the specific insane delusion claimed to have invalidated the will. As Judge McCullough so cogently noted, the rejected evidence predated the testator\u2019s association with appellant, and any \u201cdelusions\u201d harbored during that period could not possibly have related to her. We think the testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>history twenty years ago shows no more than an \u201cindefinite future expectation\u201d of little probative value and great potential prejudice. <em>Cf. Waple v. Hall, </em>248 Md. 642, 657, 238 A. 2d 544, 551-52 (1968); <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>249 Md. 170, 238 A. 2d 852 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Nor do we think that the conclusions recited in the testator\u2019s naval records (1951) bring this case within the rules applicable where a finding of permanent insanity has been made. <em>See Arbogast v. MacMillan, </em>221 Md. 516, 158 A. 2d 97 (1960); <em>Acker v. Acker, </em>172 Md. 477, 192 A. 327 (1937). The proffered Navy records indicate, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\u201c. . . (5) his [the testator\u2019s] disability is considered to be twenty (20) per centum in accordance with the standard schedule of rating disabilities in current use by the Veterans Administration, Code Number 9003 (Dementia praecox, paranoid type, <em>in partial remission, </em>with definite impairment of social and industrial adaptability 30% but that he suffered from the illness with slight impairment 10% at the time of his recall to active duty) ; and that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201c(6) accepted medical principles indicate that his <em>disability is of a permanent </em>nature.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">In <em>Townshend v. Townshend, supra, </em>it was alleged by the caveators \u201c. . . that upon the subject of the disposition of his estate, the said . . . [testator] always thought and believed, that he was acting under the immediate agency of the Almighty, and under the conviction, that he had seen and conversed with God face to face, and that he had been told by God, to make such a will . . . .\u201d We there held at page 31 that the maxim <em>\u201csemel fun-bundles, semper furibundus </em>presumitur\u201d (\u201conce insane, presumed to be always insane\u201d) is neither unqualified nor of universal application, and recognized the distinction between temporary and habitual delusion with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>spect to the presumption. We noted in that case that the delusion claimed to have invalidated the will (personal conversations with God) was the same delusion claimed to have existed, at different intervals from 1816 to 1842, and during the year 1845, and on the date of the execution of the will in 1846. We think the presumption of continuation of permanent delusion is subject to the qualification that the prior permanent delusion must be of the same character as that delusion claimed to have invalidated the will. Therefore, the evidence of the testator\u2019s general delusional behavior and psychosomatic symptoms in the circumstances of the instant case, antedating by many years the execution of the will in question, does not constitute probative evidence of the existence on July 12, 1971 of an insane delusion within the testator\u2019s mind that his wife was unfaithful.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial; appellee to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-4\">.
