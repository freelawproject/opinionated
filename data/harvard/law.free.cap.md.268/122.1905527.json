Della Ratta counterclaimed. The trial judge, Miller, J., sustained objections to the evidence offered by Della Ratta in support of his counterclaim. From the ensuing judgment for costs against him (and his wife) Della Ratta has appealed. He argues here that the proffered evidence was admissible. We agree. There is no appeal from the judgment on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">The nature of his counterclaim can best be exposed by the edited version which follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>1. On 19 December 1969 Della Ratta, Harkins, and Behrl Hirschman agreed in writing to form a joint venture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">2. On 18 February 1970 the same three agreed \u25a0 in writing to terminate the joint venture and to provide for certain other related matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">3. As an additional consideration for the execution of the 18 February agreement by Della Ratta, Harkins promised to assign and deliver to him certificates of stock representing his one-half interest in Equity Land Co., Inc. (Della Ratta owned the other half interest.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">4. Della Ratta has performed or has provided for the performance of all of his undertakings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">5. Harkins has refused to deliver the stock. Wherefore Della Ratta prayed for the delivery of the stock, or the value thereof, plus damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">The learned trial judge, after having sustained every objection to the evidence offered by Della Ratta to prove his counterclaim, asked counsel if he wished \u201cto make a proffer.\u201d Counsel replied affirmatively and stated that Della Ratta \u201cwould, if permitted, testify substantially [edited] as follows:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">On 7 November 1969 Equity Land Co., Inc. entered into a contract (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 for identification) with the Prince George\u2019s County Housing Authority for the construction of certain improvements on the land therein described, and the conveyance of that property by Equity Land Co., Inc., to the Authority with the completed improvements 425 days after 7 November 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">On 19 December 1969 Della Ratta, Behrl Hirschman and Harkins formed a joint venture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>(Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1) for the purposes set forth therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">Pursuant to the provisions of the December agreement a construction contract dated 7 January 1970 (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 2) was entered into between Equity Land Co., Inc., and Thomas P. Harkins, Inc., which called for completion of the improvements within 10*4 months of the issuance of the notice to proceed thereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">That agreement was submitted with all the other closing documents to the construction lender, the Maryland National Bank, which required, among other things, that it be modified to provide for the completion of the improvements within the time required by the Housing Authority, namely, 425 days after November 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">When Della Ratta brought these circumstances to Harkins\u2019s attention he (Harkins) stated he would have to consider whether his company could comply with that agreement for the time of performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">Della Ratta discussed this further with Harkins who indicated he was not willing to change the time for performance fixed by his contract whereupon Della Ratta said, \u201cWe will have to get another contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">Harkins, as a member of the joint venture, declined to agree to that, but ultimately agreed to Della Ratta\u2019s forming a company to act as the builder of the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">In those discussions it became clear that Harkins was getting out of the joint venture and he agreed to give up his interest in the Equity Land Co., Inc., by transferring it to Della Ratta as soon as approval could be obtained from the Housing Authority as required by the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>A meeting was held in the office of Andrew Isaacson (who was present in court during the proffer) where a number of the documents involved in the closing of the construction loan with Maryland National Bank were examined and reviewed and at that time, in Isaacson\u2019s presence and in Harkins\u2019s presence, Della Ratta confirmed the agreement that he and Harkins had made in respect of the ultimate transfer of the Equity Land Co., Inc., stock, as soon as the Housing Authority\u2019s permission could be obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">The transaction closed on the basis of the oral understanding that Della Ratta had with Harkins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">Della Ratta went to the Housing Authority and obtained its approval of the transfer of the stock. Subsequently he came to Harkins and requested the transfer, indicating the Housing Authority had approved, but Harkins refused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">The executive director of the Housing Authority, Mr. Schmelich (who was present in court), would corroborate, if permitted, Della Ratta\u2019s testimony to the effect that he sought and obtained the Housing Authority\u2019s approval of the transfer of the stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201cThis [counsel concluded] is the proffer of the substance of the evidence we would offer to support the existence of a binding agreement between Harkins and Della Ratta that related to the transfer of the stock of Equity Land Company which is the subject matter of the counterclaim in this case, and I would now ask the Court if Your Honor is ruling as to whether that line of testimony a moment ago would be applicable to that evidence? If it is, I would rest my case, sir, after noting my objection to the Court\u2019s ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Judge Miller replied that he did \u201cnot feel that this is a collateral oral agreement which is an exception to the parol evidence rule . . . .\u201d It is an attempt by Della Ratta, he said, \u201cto vary by parol evidence the terms of a written agreement . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">That parol evidence will not be admitted to vary or contradict the terms of an integrated written instrument is too well established to require the citation of authority. But there are equally well established exceptions, one of which is the \u201ccollateral\u201d oral agreement. In <em>Rinaudo v. Bloom, </em>209 Md. 1, 9-10, 120 A. 2d 184 (1956), Chief Judge Brune, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201cIn <em>Markoff v. Kreiner, supra </em>[180 Md. 150, 23 A. 2d 19 (1941)], and <em>Kikas v. Baltimore County, </em>200 Md. 360, 89 A. [2d] 625 [1952], a three-fold test of what constitutes a \u2018collateral\u2019 agreement is stated. Under this test it is necessary (1) that the agreement be independent, separate and distinct from the original agreement, (2) that it be consistent with the provisions of that contract and (3) that it be such an agreement as the parties could not reasonably be expected to embody in the main contract and would naturally make a separate agreement. The first and third of these requirements tend to shade into each other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In respect of the application of the \u201cthree-fold\u201d test, Judge Bru\u00f1e went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">\u201cIt is evident that the parol agreement alleged in the instant case might run afoul of the tests in the <em>Markoff </em>and <em>Kikas </em>cases. The trial court did not pursue the course recommended by Professor McCormick in his work on Evidence (p. 441) of hearing testimony out of the presence of the jury on the alleged oral agreement, including the evidence of substantiating circumstances, comparing the oral agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ment with the written agreement and then, depending upon whether or not he finds that the agreement was such as might normally be made by parties situated as were the parties to the contract, either admitting the testimony or excluding it from consideration by the jury. For similar views see also <em>Wigmore on Evidence, </em>3rd Ed., Sec. 2430, <em>Corbin, Parol Evidence Rule, </em>53 Yale Law Journal 603, at 628-633. See also <em>Restatement, Contracts, </em>Sec. 240. We think that the solution above suggested affords a practical means of applying the tests of the <em>Markoff </em>and <em>Kikas </em>Cases. The logical difficulty or paradox of determining the applicability of the parol evidence rule by first receiving or considering the evidence is thus obviated by making its original consideration by the court a purely preliminary matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In the case at bar the chancellor refused to hear the evidence but, as has been seen, he allowed the proffer which, in our judgment, at least as presented by counsel in the case at bar, is equally satisfactory. In <em>Hughes v. Averza, </em>223 Md. 12, 18, 161 A. 2d 671 (1960), Judge Horney, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u201c. . . Ordinarily, an exception to the exclusion of evidence may only be presented and reserved for appellate review by first asking the witness a proper and pertinent question, and then, upon objection thereto, by stating to the court in a somewhat detailed summary what the testimony would have been had the witness been permitted to answer the question. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">To the same effect <em>see Canatella v. Davis, </em>264 Md. 190, 286 A. 2d 122 (1972); <em>Sellman v. Sellman, </em>236 Md. 1, 9, 202 A. 2d 372 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Perhaps, at this point, it should be observed that Della Ratta does not argue that Harkins\u2019s refusal to deliver the Equity Land stock must be treated as a failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>consideration in respect of the $13,500 note. Indeed, in August 1972 Della Ratta paid Harkins $15,520.50 in satisfaction of his judgment on the note together with interest to date and all court costs. Harkins, several months thereafter, moved to dismiss Della Ratta\u2019s appeal contending the satisfaction of the judgment had mooted it. In November, after we had heard argument we dismissed the motion. Della Ratta, it seems, wants only to go to trial on his counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">He argues that the February agreement does not on its face purport to be a \u201ccomplete, final and integrated memorial of the parties\u2019 business relations.\u201d He points to the following recital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">\u201cWhereas, various other obligations and liabilities (written and oral) have been incurred in connection with said Housing Authority Project; . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">He contends also that \u201cfar from being inconsistent, the oral agreement was perfectly consistent, and even a necessary complement to the written [February] agreement.\u201d Our reading of the record suggests to us that probably he has put it about right, but, of course, upon remand he may have to shore up his contention with more detailed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">We think it reasonable to suppose, and the evidence to be offered upon remand very well may provide solid support therefor, that one might not expect the alleged oral agreement between Della Ratta and Harkins, in respect of the stock, to be embodied in the main contract (February agreement) ; and we think it would be natural for them to make a separate agreement in this regard. In the first place it would not have been of any interest to Hirschman and, indeed, quite likely it was none of his business. Another reason, sufficient in itself perhaps, was the prohibition against transfer in the Housing Authority contract and the expressed necessity for obtaining its approval which, it will be recalled, Della Ratta did obtain some time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>There are a number of opaque spots in this record, a condition which we expect will be dissipated, upon remand, by clarifying testimony. Therefore, we shall fore-go any speculative comment in this regard. However, when we recall the earnest and forceful presentation of Harkins\u2019s counsel at the hearing on the motion to dismiss we cannot but think it odd that there was neither brief nor appearance for him when the case was argued on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The judgment in favor of Harkins against Della Ratta and his wife for costs in the matter of their counterclaim will be reversed and the case will be remanded for a new trial thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\n<em>Costs to abide the result below.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
