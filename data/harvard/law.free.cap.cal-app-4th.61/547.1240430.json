McManis money to purchase an automobile. At the same time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Credit Union sold Lourdes a disability credit insurance policy issued by Life Investors Insurance Company (Life Investors). After making her loan and insurance payments for three years, McManis became disabled and was unable to continue making the payments on her loan. McManis filed a disability claim with Life Investors and, while the claim was pending, Credit Union repossessed her vehicle. As a result of the repossession, McManis allegedly suffered emotional distress and property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">McManis sued Credit Union and Life Investors. Thereafter, Life Investors paid McManis\u2019s disability claim in full and Credit Union returned her vehicle. McManis later amended her complaint to add the company that repossessed the vehicle, San Diego Auto Recovery, Inc. (Auto Recovery), as a Doe defendant. Defendants moved for summary judgment. McManis opposed the summary judgment and moved to amend the complaint. After permitting McManis to file supplemental papers, the court granted summary judgment and denied the motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">McManis appeals. In the published portion of this opinion, we hold the summary judgment was improper as to Credit Union because the parties\u2019 loan agreement permitted the credit union to repossess only if \u201cpermitted by law\u201d and the credit union did not show it complied with applicable law governing credit disability insurance. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1812.400 et seq.) In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we determine the court properly granted summary judgment as to Life Investors and Auto Recovery, and conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in denying McManis\u2019s motion to amend. Since Credit Union is no longer a prevailing party, we need not reach Credit Union\u2019s cross-appeal that the court erred in denying its request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Viewing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to McManis, the evidence before the trial court established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">In July 1990, McManis, a postal employee, applied for a $9,665 loan from Credit Union to buy a used vehicle. McManis agreed to make bimonthly payments for four years until July 1994. In connection with the loan application, Credit Union asked McManis whether she wanted to buy credit insurance issued by Life Investors that would protect her if she became disabled and was unable to make her loan payments. McManis agreed to purchase the disability insurance policy and checked the appropriate box on the loan agreement form. After Credit Union approved the loan, McManis granted Credit Union a security interest in the vehicle. During the next three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>years, McManis\u2019s payments on the loan and on the disability insurance policy were automatically deducted from her payroll account.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">At the end of 1992, McManis became pregnant. On June 24, 1993, a doctor diagnosed McManis with preterm labor and said she should not return to work. On that date, McManis called Credit Union and said she was going to be disabled for at least two months and that she needed to file an application for disability benefits for the car loan. The Credit Union employee told McManis she would have to wait until she was \u201coff work\u201d for 30 days. The employee said \u201c \u2018[o]nce you have 30 days completed, call us back, and then we\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 \u201d McManis responded \u201c \u2018Can I call them so they can send me the form so I can get started on this?\u2019 \u201d The employee answered \u201c \u2018No, you have to wait 30 days, and then we\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 \u201d When McManis expressed concern, the Credit Union employee said, \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it. If you get behind in your payments and your name comes up in the computer, it will show that you have a claim, and you won\u2019t have a problem. There will be no problems.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Thirty days later, on July 24, McManis called the Credit Union to request disability benefits. In response, Credit Union faxed Life Investors a notice that McManis had reported a total disability. The notice stated that McManis\u2019s reported disability began on June 24, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">About one week later, McManis received a claim form from Life Investors. The claim form contained three parts: the employee\u2019s statement, the employer\u2019s statement, and the doctor\u2019s statement. On August 3, McManis completed the employee\u2019s portion and sent the claim form to her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">On August 13, McManis made the last payment on her loan. On August 20, McManis delivered her baby. Approximately 10 days later, on August 30, McManis\u2019s Credit Union loan went into default.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Within one or two weeks, Credit Union\u2019s collection officer, Joel Blouin, began making phone calls to McManis, notifying her the loan was delinquent. McManis told Blouin she had a claim pending with the disability insurer. Blouin responded \u201c \u2018We don\u2019t care. You have to pay us.\u2019 \u201d In an effort to avoid the repossession, McManis retained a bankruptcy attorney and, on September 17, filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">For reasons not entirely clear in the record, McManis\u2019s disability claim form remained with McManis\u2019s employer (the United States Postal Service). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Although McManis had sent the claim form to the postal service\u2019s personnel manager in early August, the manager did not act upon it for several months because she was apparently waiting to know when McManis was returning to work. On October 7, the manager finally completed the claim form and returned it to McManis. One or two weeks later, McManis forwarded the claim form to her doctor at Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care, Dr. Richard Block. On October 28, Dr. Block completed the doctor\u2019s statement portion and sent the form to the Life Investors claims office.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">On November 4, the Life Investors claims office (located in Atlanta, Georgia) received the claim form. In the claim form, Dr. Block confirmed McManis was \u201ccontinuously\u201d and \u201ctotally\u201d disabled from June 24, 1993, through \u201csix weeks post partum.\u201d Dr. Block said he began treating McManis on July 16, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Eleven days later, on November 15, McManis called Life Investors and spoke with the person handling her claim, Joseph Clark. McManis asked Clark about the status of her claim. Clark said he was \u201cworking on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The next day, on November 16, Clark wrote a letter to McManis stating that before he could process the claim he needed written verification that McManis had been under a physician\u2019s care for three weeks before she saw Dr. Block (from June 24, 1993, through July 16, 1993). Clark, however, did not question the information showing McManis was totally disabled from July 16 through \u201csix weeks post-partum.\u201d Clark enclosed a form to be completed by McManis\u2019s doctor. The letter concluded \u201cAfter we have received this information, we will be pleased to give your claim our prompt attention.\u201d On that same date, Clark informed Credit Union that McManis had returned her claim form and Life Investors had requested the additional medical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">On about November 20, McManis received Clark\u2019s letter. McManis telephoned Clark and told him it was important that her claim be paid because Credit Union was threatening to take her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">On December 7, the Kaiser physician who had treated McManis before July 16 (Dr. Albert Ray) completed a claim form stating he began seeing McManis on November 15, 1992. Dr. Ray said McManis was disabled from June 24, 1993, through January 2, 1994. Dr. Ray sent the form to Life Investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Also on December 7, Credit Union obtained an order on its uncontested November 5 motion giving it relief from the bankruptcy stay, permitting it to enforce its lien upon McManis\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Three days later, on December 10, Life Investors paid benefits for the period July 16 through August 20. For reasons not clear on the record, Credit Union did not receive this payment until after December 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">On December 15, five days after Life Investors made the partial payment, Credit Union authorized Auto Recovery to repossess McManis\u2019s car. Later that day, two men from Auto Recovery arrived unannounced at McManis\u2019s home. While the men were in the process of taking the vehicle, McManis telephoned Blouin and told him the \u201cinsurance [had] already begun to pay.\u201d Blouin refused to lift the repossession order or call Life Investors to confirm the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">On that same date, McManis received another claim form from Life Investors pertaining to any further disability claims. McManis completed the claimant\u2019s portion of the form, stating that her doctor had extended her disability leave to January 3, 1994. That day (December 15), McManis sent the form to her doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">On December 16, Life Investors paid benefits for the period June 24 through July 16. Credit Union received that payment on December 21, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">After her car was repossessed, McManis told Credit Union \u201chow badly [she] needed [her] car\u201d and that it was her only method of transportation. Credit Union personnel refused to discuss the matter with McManis.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">On December 30, Life Investors paid benefits for the period August 20 to December 15. However, on January 3, 1994, Life Investors informed Credit Union that this payment had been made in error and requested Credit Union to return the money because the payment had been made before its investigation had been completed. Credit Union returned the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">On January 4, Life Investors wrote a letter to McManis stating it had received McManis\u2019s second claim form, and it was obtaining additional information from Dr. Ray regarding McManis\u2019s postpregnancy disability. The letter stated that once that information was received, it would \u201creview McManis\u2019s [second disability] claim for possible benefits.\u201d Ten days later, on January 14, McManis\u2019s doctor, Dr. Ray, faxed Life Investors information confirming that McManis had a continuing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">During the next week, McManis called Life Investors and spoke with Clark several times. Clark acknowledged receiving Dr. Ray\u2019s fax, but said that he needed further information and questioned whether the information he had received was authentic. Clark said he was requesting better copies of</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the medical records. After he received further information, Clark said the claim would be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">One or two days later, McManis spoke with Linda Bailey, a Life Investors manager. Bailey said the remaining claim benefits were going to be sent on January 24. McManis then called Credit Union and asked whether it would return her car. Credit Union refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">On January 26, Credit Union sent McManis a letter stating she owed $2,793.90 plus accrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">On February 7, McManis called Life Investors to ask why it had not paid the claim. Bailey responded that \u201cClark and the Credit Union are trying to credit the money where it belongs.\u201d Bailey said the Credit Union had said it was refusing to return the car because McManis had previously been delinquent in her payments. There was no evidence McManis had ever before been delinquent in her payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">On that same date, McManis filed a complaint, in propria persona, against Credit Union and Life Investors, in an attempt to compel Credit Union to return her car. As against Credit Union, McManis alleged (1) declaratory relief (seeking return of her vehicle); (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress. As against Life Investors, McManis alleged breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Three weeks later, on approximately February 28, 1994, Credit Union returned the car to McManis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> McManis nonetheless continued her lawsuit against Credit Union and Life Investors to recover for damages caused by the repossession. The trial was scheduled for February 10, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">One month before the trial, in January 1995, McManis retained an attorney. The parties stipulated to a three-month continuance to permit McManis\u2019s attorney to conduct discovery and prepare for trial. The new trial date was scheduled for June 16, 1995. After discovery commenced, McManis served Auto Recovery as a Doe defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">In April and May 1995, defendants filed summary judgment motions. McManis opposed the motions and moved to amend the complaint. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>court ultimately granted summary judgment as to all parties and denied McManis\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">I. <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">A summary judgment motion \u201cshall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)  A moving defendant must \u201cprove an affirmative defense, disprove at least one essential element of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action [citations] or show that an element of the cause of action cannot be established [citations].\u201d <em>(Sanchez </em>v. <em>Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co. </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1461, 1465 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 415].) \u201cThe defendant \u2018must show that under no possible hypothesis within the reasonable purview of the allegations of the complaint is there a material question of fact which requires examination by trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">If the defendant makes such showing, the court must look at the plaintiff\u2019s papers to determine whether they \u201cdemonstrate] the existence of a triable, material factual issue. . . .\u201d <em>(AARTS Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1065 [225 Cal.Rptr. 203].) \u201cCounter-affidavits and declarations need not prove the opposition\u2019s case; they suffice if they disclose the existence of a triable issue.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Applying these principles, we review the record de novo to determine whether each defendant met its burden to show it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and if so, whether McManis produced facts demonstrating the existence of a triable material factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">A. <em>McManis\u2019s Claims Against Credit Union</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWr\">1. <em>Breach of Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">In her complaint, McManis alleged Credit Union breached its contract by wrongfully repossessing, and then refusing to return, her vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Credit Union moved for summary judgment arguing the undisputed facts showed (1) on the date of repossession (December 15) McManis\u2019s loan was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>in default; and (2) the loan agreement between Credit Union and McManis (the Agreement) allowed Credit Union to repossess the vehicle on default.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">On our review of the record, we conclude Credit Union failed to establish it was entitled to repossess McManis\u2019s vehicle under the Agreement and therefore Credit Union failed to meet its burden on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The Agreement provides a loan is in \u201cDefault\u201d if the borrower fails \u201cto make any payment or perform any obligation\u201d or if the borrower is \u201cinvolved in any bankruptcy . . . proceeding . . . .\u201d The Agreement then sets forth the circumstances under which Credit Union may repossess the security: \u201cUpon any occurrence of Default, <em>and to the extent permitted by law, </em>the entire balance of Your loan shall be immediately due and payable .... If the entire balance is not paid immediately upon Default, <em>and if permitted by law, </em>the Collateral shall be voluntarily surrendered .... If this is not done, <em>to the extent permitted by law, </em>the Credit Union may enter the premises where the Collateral is located and take possession of it . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, under the Agreement\u2019s express terms, Credit Union was entitled to repossess the vehicle if (1) the loan was in default, and (2) the repossession was \u201cpermitted by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Credit Union established the loan was in default on December 15, since it had not received the full amount due by that date. Credit Union, however, did not proffer any factual basis for finding the repossession was \u201cpermitted by law,\u201d specifically by the particular statutes governing a lender\u2019s right to repossess a security while a disability claim is pending \u2014 Civil Code section 1812.400 et seq. (the Act).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The Act prohibits a lender that has participated in supplying disability insurance to a borrower from pursuing certain collection actions and requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the lender to make specific disclosures. (\u00a7 1812.402.) Certain provisions are of particular relevance here. First, if the debtor files a disability claim, the creditor may not invoke any creditor\u2019s remedy (defined to include \u201crepossession\u201d and \u201cthe commencement of any action or special proceeding\u201d) against the debtor for three months after the loan goes into default. (\u00a7 1812.402, subd. (a).) Second, during the three months after default, if the disability insurer rejects or partially accepts the claim, the lender must provide the borrower thirty-five additional days to pay the balance before repossession. (\u00a7 1812.402, subd. (e).) Third, the lender must disclose \u201cin writing in at least 10-point type\u201d detailed information pertaining to the borrower\u2019s rights under the Act. (\u00a7 1812.402, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In enacting this statutory scheme, the Legislature intended to protect borrowers from a lender\u2019s collection efforts during a reasonable time the borrower\u2019s disability claim is being processed: \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that it is unfair for a creditor who has directly participated in, arranged, or received a commission or other compensation for the sale of credit disability insurance to the debtor ... to invoke a creditor\u2019s remedy because of a debtor\u2019s nonpayment of any sum which has become due during a period of disability until a reasonable time has passed for the disability insurance claim to be filed, verified and processed.\u201d (\u00a7 1812.400.) The Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>provides \u201c[t]he debtor may bring an action for damages, equitable relief, or other relief for any violation of this title.\u201d (\u00a7 1812.402, subd. (i).) The Act\u2019s \u201crights and remedies\u201d are \u201ccumulative ... to all other rights and remedies which the debtors may have under other laws.\u201d (\u00a7 1812.402, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Credit Union does not dispute that it was a creditor within the meaning of the Act and that the Act \u201cmight have provided a basis for a separate cause of action against [Credit Union] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Credit Union argues, however, that McManis never pled a separate cause of action under section 1812.400 or sought to amend the complaint based on the Act and therefore she cannot now assert the Act as an independent basis for reversing the summary judgment. (See <em>Bostrom </em>v. <em>County of San Bernardino </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1654, 1663 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Credit Union\u2019s focus is too narrow. The Act is not relevant here to permit McManis to add a new cause of action on appeal. Rather, the Act is relevant because it shows Credit Union failed to satisfy its burden to negate McManis\u2019s breach of contract theory. Credit Union produced evidence showing it repossessed McManis\u2019s vehicle on December 15, over three months after McManis\u2019s loan first went into default (August 30). But Credit Union did not present any evidence showing it satisfied several of the Act\u2019s other provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">First, it is undisputed Credit Union moved for relief from the bankruptcy stay on November 5, violating the statutory prohibition on \u201ccommenc[ing] . . . any action or special proceeding\u201d within three months of the default. (\u00a7\u00a7 1812.401, subd. (d), 1812.402, subd. (a).) Second, Credit Union proffered no evidence it made the required disclosures to McManis. (\u00a7 1812.402, subd. (f).) Third, Credit Union produced no evidence showing it permitted McManis 35 days to satisfy the outstanding debt once Life Investors agreed to partially accept the claim. (\u00a7 1812.402, subd. (e).) Since Credit Union made no showing it complied with directly applicable statutory mandates, Credit Union failed to show the repossession was authorized \u201cby law\u201d and thus that repossession was permissible under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Credit Union argues that because McManis failed to cite the Act in opposition to the summary judgment motion, this court is precluded from relying on the statutory scheme. This argument reflects a misunderstanding of Credit Union\u2019s burden on a summary judgment motion. \u201c[F]or purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>of section 437c, a moving defendant is statutorily treated as a \u2018plaintiff,\u2019 and hence must present sufficient facts to make out a prima facie case of nonliability.\u201d <em>(Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 544, 552 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 674].)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Credit Union sought to establish McManis could not recover on her breach of contract claim because it had a complete defense under the Agreement \u2014 it was entitled to repossess the vehicle because McManis was in default. However, under the Agreement, Credit Union could establish a complete defense only by satisfying two contractual conditions: (1) the existence of a default on December 15, <em>and </em>(2) the repossession was authorized by law. Credit Union did not prove the second contractual prerequisite to repossession \u2014 that repossession was permitted by applicable law (the Act). Thus, Credit Union was not entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Credit Union alternatively argues McManis waived her right to rely on the Act by failing to raise the issue in her appellate briefs. However, the rule that a Court of Appeal will not consider points not raised in an appellate brief is \u201clargely for the convenience of the reviewing court. [Citation.] A reviewing court is empowered to decide a case on any proper points or theories, whether urged by counsel or not. . . and will exercise that authority under fair procedure in an appropriate case . . . .\u201d <em>(Tan </em>v. <em>California Fed. Saw. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 800, 811 [189 Cal.Rptr. 775]; see also <em>Banco Do Brasil, S.A. w. Lat\u00edan, Inc. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 973, 999 [285 Cal.Rptr. 870].)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Before oral argument, we gave the parties an opportunity to file supplemental briefs on the applicability of the Act. Each party filed a brief, including Credit Union, which submitted a seven-page letter brief. The parties were further given the opportunity to express their views on the applicability of the Act at oral argument. Because Credit Union had full opportunity to address the applicability of the Act and the Act reflects a clearly stated public policy, it is fair to apply the statute under the circumstances here. Moreover, since Credit Union is in the business of offering disability policies, it is not an unfair assumption that Credit Union was aware or reasonably should have been aware of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">We conclude Credit Union failed to meet its burden on summary judgment to negate McManis\u2019s contract claim because it did not establish it complied with the Act before it repossessed McManis\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>2., 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">B., C <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">II., III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Judgment reversed as to Credit Union.

If the entire balance is not paid immediately upon Default, and if permitted by law, the Collateral shall be voluntarily surrendered to the Credit Union at a time and place acceptable to it. If this is not done, to the extent permitted by law, the Credit Union may enter the premises where the Collateral is located and take possession of it and the Credit Union may assert the defense of a superior right of possession as the holder of a security interest to any offense of alleged wrongful taking and conversion. The Credit Union may sell or dispose of the Collateral in any manner permitted by law, and any resulting deficiency on Your loan shall be immediately paid to the Credit Union. To the extent permitted by law, the Credit Union shall be reimbursed for all its costs and expense, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred in the course of collecting any amounts owed under this Agreement or in the recovery of any Collateral.
