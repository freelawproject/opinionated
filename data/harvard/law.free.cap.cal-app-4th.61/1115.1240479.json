She challenges the Mountains Recreation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>Conservation Authority\u2019s (Authority) purchase of 662 acres of land in Topanga Canyon, maintaining the Authority overpaid for the parcel, violated the California open meeting law, popularly known as the Ralph M. Brown Act or the Brown Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 54950 et seq.), and the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.), and exceeded its powers under its joint powers agreement. She also contends the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors improperly allocated funds under Proposition A for the purchase. We find no error and affirm the judgment. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that the Authority did not exceed its power under the joint powers agreement. The other issues are considered in the unpublished portion of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Appellant, Joan Cooper is a taxpayer residing in Topanga Canyon, the site of the property at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Respondents include: (1) the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy (Conservancy), an entity governed by a board composed of eight voting members and two ex officio members within the Resources Agency (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 33200 et seq.); (2) the Authority, a joint public entity created pursuant to a joint powers agreement between the Conservancy and the Conejo and Rancho Simi park districts (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6500 et seq.);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) the County of Los Angeles, a public entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">*</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">i-ra* <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">Appellant argues that under its joint powers agreement between the Conservancy and the park districts, the Authority is required to gain approval from the public works board to acquire property. Appellant bases her argument on the fact that the Conservancy is required to obtain approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>from the public works board prior to acquiring land. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 15850; Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 33203.) She does not dispute the fact that the park districts are not required to obtain approval prior to a purchase. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 5782.5, subd. (b).) She presents a question of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo. <em>(Golden Cheese Co. </em>v. <em>Voss </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 547, 556 [281 Cal.Rptr. 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">A joint powers agency \u201cis subject to the restrictions upon the manner of exercising the power of <em>one </em>of the contracting parties, which party shall be designated by the agreement.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6509, italics added.) Section 4.2 of the agreement between the Conservancy and park districts states, \u201c[pjowers are subject to the restrictions upon the manner of exercising the powers <em>as imposed upon the Conejo and Rancho Simi Districts, . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.) Under this agreement, the Authority is subject to the same restrictions as the park districts. Seeking approval from the public works board is not among those restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Vogel (C.
