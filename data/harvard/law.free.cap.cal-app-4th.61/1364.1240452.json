Cook appeals his conviction for first degree murder. He contends the trial court erroneously excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>evidence proffered to suggest that another person committed the crime. He also argues the court erroneously admitted the testimony of a person who accompanied defendant at the time of the killing, an error compounded by the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on third party culpability evidence. Defendant further asserts error in the court\u2019s failure to instruct on aiding and abetting, a claim we discuss in the published portion of this opinion. Additionally, he faults the court for not giving a pinpoint instruction and claims trial counsel inadequately represented him in not requesting certain instructions. Finally, he says the court did not apply the correct standard when it rejected his request to be sentenced to a term permitting the possibility of parole. All of these contentions fail. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">In the evening of August 21, 1994, defendant, then 16 years old, asked his friend Adolph if he was \u201cdown for a 187.\u201d Adolph apparently thought a \u201c187\u201d was a robbery. The boys went out to the railroad tracks that ran behind the house where defendant was living. A frequently traveled dirt path ran alongside the tracks. The boys saw Donald Thornton, whom they did not know, walking along the path carrying a shopping bag. Defendant said, \u201cWell you wanna get him?\u201d Adolph said, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d The boys approached Thornton. &lt; ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">Defendant confronted Thornton using the command \u201cbreak yourself\u2019 or \u201cbrake yourself.\u201d Adolph thought this meant \u201cgive up your stuff.\u201d Thornton began to retreat and then dropped his bag. Adolph picked up the bag, which contained three or four cans of beer. Adolph began to leave with the beer. Around seven feet away, Adolph turned and saw defendant\u2019s fist slamming into Thornton\u2019s side three or four times;.he saw nothing in defendant\u2019s hand. Adolph turned away again. Seconds later, defendant caught up with Adolph. Laughing, defendant said he had stabbed the man. Adolph saw defendant was holding a pocketknife. The boys went back to defendant\u2019s house and drank the beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">The next day, Adolph told his brother Marcus about the killing, saying \u201cwe did something stupid.\u201d Later that day, defendant told Marcus \u201che had stabbed some guy on the tracks late at night that night before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">Two days later, defendant told his girlfriend, Misty, about the killing. He said he and \u201chis homies\u201d stabbed the man for a six-pack of beer. The next day, defendant told Misty additional details. On August 26, 1994, Misty secretly called the police. Misty obtained further details from defendant. Defendant said he had stabbed the man and that only Adolph had been with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>him. He also said he had taken $200 from the man, that they had worn ski masks as a disguise, and that he previously had killed people in Los Angeles, none of which apparently was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Three weeks later, detectives picked up Adolph for questioning. Adolph first claimed he did not know what the detectives were talking about. After they told him they knew defendant had killed Thornton and that Adolph was equally as likely as defendant to be convicted of first degree murder unless he cooperated, Adolph confessed. He described defendant\u2019s role in the robbery and murder essentially as set forth above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">The detectives then questioned defendant, who stated he and Adolph had been home all evening. He persisted in this claim even when the detectives told him about Adolph\u2019s confession. \u201cYou have my story; I have my witnesses,\u201d defendant repeatedly proclaimed. The detectives arrested defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">After the juvenile court found defendant an unfit subject for juvenile proceedings pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, the district attorney filed an information in superior court charging defendant with murder. (Count 1; Pen. Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 187.) The information alleged as a special circumstance that defendant committed the murder during a robbery. (\u00a7 190.2, former subd. (a)(17)(i).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The information also alleged robbery as a separate count. (Count 2; \u00a7 212.5, former subd. (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) As to both counts, the information alleged defendant personally used a knife in the commission of the offense. (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b).) Defendant pleaded not guilty; he subsequently added a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">On April 5, 1995, a jury found defendant guilty as charged. The next day the jury found defendant was sane when he committed the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-9\">Defendant filed a motion for new trial. The court denied the motion and sent defendant to the Youth Authority for evaluation pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707.2. On September 1, 1995, after the arrest on a bench warrant of a subpoenaed defense witness who had failed to appear for trial, defendant renewed the new trial motion. The court again denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>At the sentencing hearing on September 19, 1995, the court found defendant was not amenable to treatment at the Youth Authority. The court declined to exercise its discretion to impose a lesser sentence pursuant to section 190.5, subdivision (b). It imposed a sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole. The court also imposed a one-year sentence on the weapon-use enhancement. The same day, defendant filed his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AmaP\">I., II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">III. <em>Aiding and Abetting Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">Defendant contends \u201c[t]he trial court failed to instruct. . . [on] the mens rea necessary to establish appellant\u2019s culpability as an aider and abettor in the robbery and robbery-murder. \u201d As the argument is further explained in defendant\u2019s reply brief: \u201cWhere the prosecution\u2019s theory of the robbery count was that a key element was performed by an accomplice, the jury must be instructed on aiding and abetting.\u201d In particular, he says, the only credible evidence concerning the robbery showed that Adolph actually took the beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that when a \u201ckey element\u201d of a crime is performed by another person, any accomplice is merely an aider and abettor. Although we have found no California case discussing this issue in any detail, we conclude defendant is wrong and that the evidence at trial clearly showed that defendant was guilty, if at all, as a direct perpetrator of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-8\">In some important ways, the law does not distinguish between perpetrators on the one hand and aiders and abettors on the other. The Penal Code provides: \u201cAll persons concerned in the commission of a crime . . . whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet in its commission ... are principals in any crime so committed.\u201d (\u00a731; see also \u00a7 971.) As such, aiders and abettors are subject to the same range of punishment as direct perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-9\">Despite their equal status as principals in the crime, in other instances the law does distinguish between direct perpetrators and aiders and abettors. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>part, this is because the actions of a purported aider and abettor are often more peripheral and ambiguous than those of the direct perpetrator. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beeman </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 547, 559 [199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318].) Indeed, actions causally facilitating the crime may be entirely innocent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 402, 413 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 525].) Therefore, in order to ensure that the purported aider and abettor has the mens rea consistent with criminal liability, case law has established that such a person must \u201cact with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator <em>and </em>with an intent or purpose either of committing, or of encouraging or facilitating commission of, the offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beeman, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 560, italics in original.) Thus, while the criminal liability of an aider and abettor is the same as that of a direct perpetrator, the required mental states differ between the two classes of principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">Despite the fact that trial courts must frequently determine whether a defendant is potentially an aider and abettor instead of a direct perpetrator, so as to determine whether to give the pattern aiding and abetting instruction (see CALJIC No. 3.01), we find only scant appellate discussion of the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Talamantez </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 443 [215 Cal.Rptr. 542], two men kidnapped another man and beat him to death. Talamantez contended he did not inflict the fatal blow and that the trial court had given an erroneous instruction concerning the intent necessary to find him guilty of the murder on an aiding and abetting theory. The appellate court concluded the instructional error was harmless. Among its reasons, stated without a discussion of the applicable law, was that, as a participant in the beating, Talamantez was a perpetrator of the torture that culminated in the victim\u2019s death. The court stated: \u201cThe fact (if it be a fact) that Talamantez did not strike the final torturous blow that broke Reggie\u2019s voice box and caused his death does not convert him factually- into an aider and abettor to torture murder. These bitter convicting facts show him violently beating, torturing Reggie up to the point of Rozzo\u2019s coup de mort.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 463.) Accordingly, Talamantez perpetrated the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">In the recent case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Rose </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 990 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 887], the issue was whether Rose was entitled to have his felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor pursuant to section 659.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rose and another person entered a store to steal a purse. The other person actually left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>the store with the purse. She was permitted to plead guilty to petty theft with a prior, as a misdemeanor. Rose, however, had prior serious felony convictions and was charged under the three strikes law. Convicted of second degree burglary, he was sentenced to 25 years to life. In the trial court and on appeal he contended he should be convicted only of a misdemeanor since the person he aided and abetted was only convicted of a misdemeanor. The appellate court rejected this claim for a number of reasons, among-them the following: \u201cFinally, defendant was not an aider and abettor of the burglary. He personally entered the store with the intent to aid Allen in the theft of the handbag.\u201d (56 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) Again, however, there was no discussion of the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Croy </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 1, 12 [221 Cal.Rptr. 592, 710 P.2d 392], footnote 5, the Supreme Court stated in dicta the following: \u201cLike the conspirator whose liability is predicated on acts <em>other than and short of those constituting the elements of the charged offense, </em>if the acts [of the aider and abettor] are undertaken with the intent that the actual perpetrator\u2019s purpose be facilitated thereby, he is a principal and liable for the commission of the offense.\u201d Impliedly, then, one whose acts do not fall short of acts \u201cconstituting the elements of the charged offense\u201d is not an aider and abettor, but is an \u201cactual perpetrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">Neither <em>Croy, Rose </em>nor <em>Talamantez </em>discusses the basis for its statement concerning the distinction between direct perpetrators and aiders and abettors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Yet all three decisions readily can be explained by reference to the common law as it existed before the adoption of section 971. At common law, principals in a crime were divided into two degrees. A principal in the first degree \u201cengages in <em>criminal conduct </em>by his own hand\u201d or commits the crime through his constructive presence. (1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law (15th ed. 1993) Parties, \u00a7 30, pp. 183-184, italics added.) By contrast, \u201ca principal in the second degree is a person who is present at the scene of a crime, but <em>does not engage in the criminal conduct, </em>he merely aids and abets the principal in the first degree in committing the crime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00a7 31, p. 186, italics added, fn. omitted.) An aider and abettor not present at the scene of the crime was known at common law as an accessory before the fact. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00a7 32, p. 193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">While section 971 abolished the pleading and punishment distinctions among first degree principals, those of the second degree, and accessories, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>nevertheless, the former common law categories make explicit what was implicit in <em>Croy, Rose, </em>and Talamantez: one who engages in conduct that is an element of the charged crime is a perpetrator, not an aider and abettor, of the completed crime. Thus, appellant\u2019s proposed formulation of the rale, if \u201ca key element was performed by an accomplice, the jury must be instructed on aiding and abetting,\u201d is essentially the reverse of the correct rale: If the defendant performed an element of the offense, the jury need not be instructed on aiding and abetting, even if an accomplice performed other acts that completed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">In this case, the uncontradicted evidence (apart from the identity issue) was that defendant provided the \u201cforce or fear\u201d necessary to accomplish the robbery. As such, he was one of the direct perpetrators of the offense of robbery, even if he did not physically deprive the victim of his property. No aiding and abetting instruction was necessary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In determining that defendant actually committed the robbery, the jury necessarily found he had the specific intent to deprive Thornton of the beer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There was no requirement that the jury also find that he had the specific intent or purpose to facilitate Adolph\u2019s commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">IV.-VII.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">Dibiaso, Acting P. J., and Buckley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 7, 1998, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 17, 1998.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1191-10\">Adolph was arrested for murder at the conclusion of the interview. Subsequently, Adolph was permitted to admit a juvenile petition alleging robbery and was committed to the California Youth Authority (hereafter Youth Authority) for up to five years. The plea was part of a bargain by which the murder charge was dismissed in return for Adolph\u2019s agreement to testify \u201ctruthfully\u201d in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1191-11\">All further code references are to the Penal Code except as otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">Now section 190.2, subdivision (a)(17)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1191-13\">Now section 212.5, subdivision (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1364.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">Section 659 provides: \u201cWhenever an act is declared a misdemeanor, and no punishment for counseling or aiding the commission of such act is expressly prescribed by law, every person who counsels or aids another in the commission of such act is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">In a related context, this court has held that a defendant was not liable as an aider and abettor because there was no evidence that a child who committed the lewd act in question had the intent necessary to convict that child as a perpetrator who could be aided and abetted. Nevertheless, the defendant, even though he did not personally commit the touching, could be criminally liable as an actual perpetrator on the theory of constructive touching or because he committed the crime through an \u201cinnocent agent.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pitts </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 606, 874-875 [273 Cal.Rptr. 757].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">Since defendant was a direct perpetrator of the robbery, <em>People </em>v. <em>Pulido </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 713, 726-728 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 625, 936 P.2d 1235], which defendant relied on at oral argument, is inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">We recognize that a portion of the robbery jury instruction is written in the passive voice. As such, it requires that the jury determine whether \u201c[t]he property was taken with the specific intent permanently to deprive such person of the property.\u201d (CALJIC No. 9.40.) Taken in isolation from the other instructions and in light of the theory that only Adolph had the intent to steal, there is an abstract possibility a juror could determine \u201ca robbery had been committed\u201d without determining beyond a reasonable doubt that every element was satisfied <em>as to defendant. </em>In the context of the other instructions and the arguments of counsel, there is no reasonable possibility of actual misunderstanding. Thus, the special circumstances instruction required that the murder was committed \u201cwhile <em>the defendant was engaged </em>in the commission of a robbery\u201d (CALJIC No. 8.81.17), not merely that the murder was committed \u201cduring a robbery.\u201d Similarly, the initial summary of the elements of robbery in the robbery instruction itself is written in the active voice: \u201cEvery person who takes personal property in the possession of another . . . with the specific intent permanently to deprive that person of the property, is guilty of the crime of robbery <em>. ... \u201d </em>(CALJIC No. 9.40) Finally, counsel reminded the jury that \u201cevery element of every crime, every element must be proved . . . beyond all doubt based on reason. And that means that the intent to rob must be proven beyond all doubt based on reason.\u201d Counsel\u2019s theory was that there probably was no beer to take because Thornton had already consumed it, and that whoever killed him did not intend to rob him because the killer left money in Thornton\u2019s pockets. Counsel did not argue that Adolph but not defendant had the intent to steal, although that theory of the case is implied in counsel\u2019s request for a pinpoint instruction on intent to steal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1364.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
