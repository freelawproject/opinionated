The California Supreme Court denied review. The petitioner seeks reversal of the judgment below on the ground that evidence introduced at his trial was seized in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>tion of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Since we agree with the petitioner that the evidence was taken in the course of an unconstitutional search of his home, the judgment of the California Court of Appeal must be reversed. <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Informed that the petitioner had been involved in a robbery, police officers went to his residence. The petitioner was not at home, but a 15-year-old girl who identified herself as the petitioner\u2019s wife allowed the officers to enter and search her belongings. When several rings taken by the robbers were found, the officers \u201cstaked out\u201d the house and awaited the petitioner\u2019s return. Upon his arrival late that night, he was immediately arrested as he alighted from his car. The officers searched the petitioner and the car, and then again entered and searched the house, where they discovered under a couch a jewelry case stolen in the robbery. The car was parked outside the house and 15 or 20 feet away from it, and the officers did not request permission to conduct the second search of the house. No warrant was ever obtained. The trial court nevertheless upheld the second search on the ground that it was incident to the petitioner\u2019s arrest, and the Court of Appeal agreed, holding that the area searched was \u201cunder the [petitioner\u2019s] effective control\u201d at the time of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Under our decision today in <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, ante, </em>p. 752, the search clearly exceeded Fourth Amendment limitations on searches incident to arrest. But even if <em>Chimel </em>were to have no retroactive application \u2014 a question which we reserve for a case which requires its resolution \u2014 there is no precedent of this Court that justifies the search in this case. The Court has consistently held that a search \u201ccan be incident to an arrest only if it is substantially contemporaneous with the arrest and is confined to the <em>immediate </em>vicinity of the arrest.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number><em>Stoner </em>v. <em>California, </em>376 U. S. 483, 486. (Emphasis supplied.) At the very most, police officers have been permitted to search a four-room apartment in which the arrest took place. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 U. S. 145. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56. But the Constitution has never been construed by this Court to allow the police, in the absence of an emergency, to arrest a person <em>outside </em>his home and then take him inside for the purpose of conducting a warrantless search. On the contrary, \u201cit has always been assumed that one\u2019s house cannot lawfully be searched without a search warrant, except as an incident to a lawful arrest <em>therein.\u201d Agnello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>269 U. S. 20, 32. (Emphasis supplied.) And in <em>James </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>382 U. S. 36, the Court held that the search of the petitioner\u2019s home after his arrest on the street two blocks away \u201ccannot be regarded as incident to his arrest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 37. Since the thorough search of the petitioner\u2019s home extended without reasonable justification beyond the place in which he was arrested, it cannot be upheld under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments as incident to his arrest.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b894-8\">Mr. Justice Black concurs in granting certiorari but dissents from the reversal and remand of the judgment without a hearing.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Because of our disposition of the case on this ground, we find it unnecessary to consider the contentions of the petitioner that his \u201cwife\u201d did not voluntarily consent to the first search, and that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest the petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Mr. Justice White,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq99\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">I found inexplicable the Court\u2019s acceptance of the warrantless arrest in <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, ante, </em>p. 752, while at the same time holding the contemporaneous search invalid without considering the exigencies created by the arrest itself. See <em>id., </em>p. 770 (dissenting opinion). Even more mystifying are the opinions and the orders issued in the instant case and six others which have been held pending the decision in <em>Chimel: </em>No. 837, <em>Von Cleef </em>v. <em>New Jersey, ante, </em>p. 814; No. 1097, Misc., <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Illinois, post, </em>p. 985; No. 1037, Misc., <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>LaVallee, post, </em>p. 985; No. 500, <em>Schmear </em>v. <em>Gagnon, post, </em>p. 978; No. 550, Misc., <em>Jamison </em>v. <em>United States, post, </em>p. 986; and No. 395, Misc., <em>Chrisman </em>v. <em>California, post, </em>p. 985. I fear that the summary dispositions in these cases, which strain so hard to avoid deciding the retroactivity of <em>Chimel, </em>will only magnify the confusion in this important area of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">It is particularly hard to square the Court\u2019s summary reversal of Shipley\u2019s conviction, which invalidates a war-rantless search of a house where the arrest was made in a detached garage, with the denials of certiorari in <em>Harris </em>and <em>Mahoney. </em>In <em>Harris, </em>the arrest occurred in the lobby of a four-story apartment building; the ensuing search without a warrant involved an apartment on an upper floor. The chronology was reversed in <em>Mahoney </em>where petitioner was arrested in his apartment, but the accompanying search uncovered a gun in the building basement. This case, <em>Shipley, </em>purports to rest on pre-<em>Chimel </em>law, but certiorari in <em>Harris </em>and <em>Mahoney </em>cannot be denied without assuming the nonretroactivity of <em>Chimel </em>and then determining that these cases do not deserve the same summary reversal given to <em>Shipley. </em>In <em>Schmear, Jamison, </em>and <em>Chrisman, </em>as in <em>Chimel, </em>the Court fails to find a substantial issue in the warrantless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>arrest and its bearing on the warrantless search. Finally, the <em>per curiam </em>in <em>Von Cleef </em>invokes <em>Kremen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U. S. 346 (1957), without noting that the seizures in <em>Von Cleef </em>were limited to evidence and in-strumentalities of the crimes being investigated and for which the arrests were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">I join the grant of certiorari in this case but dissent from the summary reversal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
