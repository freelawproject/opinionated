After the conversation had ended, Mr. Coleman saw defendant walking around another department and then saw him leaving the store with the Sony color television set valued at about $410. Mr. Coleman had seen defendant two or three times before and recognized him during their conversation. He was certain that defendant was the man who took the television set.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">\n<em>As to Counts II and III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">On July 13, 1975, at approximately 3:30 p.m., Vicki Govan was working at the jewelry counter in the Broadway-Crenshaw store. While she was showing a lady customer a ring, defendant Harris walked up to the case. She had seen him on several other occasions and knew him by the name \u201cPee Wee.\u201d He (Harris) pulled out a knife which looked tike a butcher knife with a wooden handle. Defendant started prying open the display case where the rubber was connected to the glass. He put the knife in the seam at one point and then moved it along the seam to another point and the glass came loose and he started to lift it up. Miss Govan told him to \u201cStop\u201d and put her hands on top of the glass, leaning on it as he was lifting it up with her hands still on top of the glass. Defendant exerted more pressure than she did and reached in and got three cases of diamonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Miss Govan picked the phone up as defendant had reached one end of the counter. He (defendant) came back and got some more rings. He took a total of four more trays of diamond rings valued at approximately $11,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">When defendant was almost to the door, Miss Govan yelled to the manager that he had her diamonds and was running out of the door. The manager started to run to the door, but defendant was already out of the door. Miss Govan could see him going across a divider in the street over a gate. She testified that she was not afraid of defendant when he did this as she did not think that defendant was serious. However, when she realized that defendant was going to take the diamonds she went to call security.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">Defendant Harris testified on his own behalf. He admitted being in the Broadway-Crenshaw Department Store on the two days in question, but denied taking either the television set or the diamond rings.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>By way of alibi as to the July 13, 1975, date, his mother, Lizzy Williams, and Frank Harris testified defendant was at home between 3 and 4:30 p.m. on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">On appeal defendant contends (1) that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the force or fear requisite to constitute the robbeiy (count II) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">We conclude the record does not support either of defendant\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The thrust of defendant\u2019s first contention advanced by appointed counsel on appeal is directed at a reversal of the conviction of both counts I and II in that the court erred in granting defendant\u2019s request to appear in propria persona at both the preliminary hearing and trial and defendant ineffectively represented himself requiring a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525], held that a defendant has an independent constitutional right to represent himself which is absolute if he requests it and knowingly and intelligently waives his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Here, three separate judges (at the preliminary hearing, arraignment, and trial) at defendant\u2019s request granted his request to appear in propria persona. The reporter\u2019s transcript of the preliminaiy hearing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>and the arraignment proceedings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reflects defendant, who said he knew how to read and count, was fully advised of his right to counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>questioned by the court and warned of pitfalls of self-representation and that he would be bound by the same rules that attorneys are bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>during the conduct of the proceedings. The trial judge conveyed to defendant in no uncertain terms the foolishness of anyone (even attorneys) representing himself in a criminal matter. Defendant after such admonitions chose to conduct his own defense and now, on appeal, seeks a second bite at the apple claiming the court erred in allowing him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>to proceed in propria persona. Defendant Harris\u2019 counsel on appeal asserts that if counsel had been appointed the matter should not have been tried and a plea bargain should have been negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">We hold the record reflects that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel and under <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>422 U.S. 806, the court had no authority to force counsel upon him and properly granted his motion to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Moreover, the California case law, <em>pre-Faretta, </em>was that a defendant is not entitled to have his case presented in court by himself and by cocounsel simultaneously. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sharp </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 448, 459 [103 Cal.Rptr. 233, 499 P.2d 489]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d <em>777, </em>787-789 [336 P.2d 937]; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 1054, 1060 [126 Cal.Rptr. 830]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 678, 692 [76 Cal.Rptr. 225, 452 P.2d 329]; see also <em>Ligda </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 811, 820 [85 Cal.Rptr. 744]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adame </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 587, 601 [337 P.2d 477].)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Neither <em>Faretta </em>nor subsequent California case law changes the above rule. In <em>Faretta </em>at page 835, footnote 46 [45 L.Ed.2d at page 581], the court said: \u201c[OJf course, a State may\u2014even over objection by the accused\u2014appoint a \u2018standby counsel\u2019 to aid the accused if and when the accused requests help, and to be available to represent the accused in the event that termination of the defendant\u2019s self-representation is necessary. ...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The word \u201cmay\u201d renders it merely within the discretion of the trial court and not mandated by law. In <em>People </em>v. <em>McDaniel </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 156, 162, 168, footnote 6 [127 Cal.Rptr. 467, 545 P.2d 843], the California Supreme Court noted that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swinton </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1975) 400 F.Supp. 805, 807, held that <em>Faretta </em>did not give a constitutional right to cocounsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Here, the record reflects defendant did not make a bona fide serious motion for cocounsel after the court indicated his choice to appear in propria persona was not a wise one saying, \u201cIf the court would like, I would like to ask for public defender co-counsel.\u201d We hold the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to appoint cocounsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Defendant\u2019s contention that he inadequately or ineffectively represented himself cannot be urged or sustained on appeal once he has elected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>\u201cshoot craps\u201d in the trial court and appear in propria persona. He was thoroughly warned of the pitfalls he would face as he represented himself.  However, assuming arguendo a defendant appearing in propria persona at trial could on appeal urge he ineffectively represented himself \u201cin order to justify relief on the ground of inadequate representation of counsel it must appear that counsel\u2019s lack of diligence reduced the trial to a \u2018farce or a sham.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Meals </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 215, 223 [121 Cal.Rptr. 742].) \u201cMoreover, defendant has the burden of establishing his allegation of inadequate representation \u2018 \u201cnot as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Id.; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 652, 661 [111 Cal.Rptr. 556, 517 P.2d 820].)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Here, the trial judge went to great length to explain various stages of the proceedings to defendant. Defendant has not shown as \u201ca demonstrable reality\u201d that the defense was a \u201cfarce or a sham\u201d and his contention that he did not adequately represent himself is not sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Defendant\u2019s final contention is that there was insufficient evidence to support the force or fear requisite to constitute his robbery conviction (count II).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In considering the sufficiency of the evidence the appellate court must view all of the evidence, direct and indirect, in the light most favorable to the respondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce therefrom; the evidence may not be reweighed on appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 211, 214 [95 Cal.Rptr. 530, 485 P.2d 1146]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 125, 138 [123 Cal.Rptr. 893]).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">The trial court instructed the jury on CALJIC No. 14.20 (grand and petty theft) and CALJIC No. 9.10 (robbery\u2014defined)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in respect to the July 13, 1975, occurrence involving the diamond rings as charged in counts II and III. The court also instructed on CALJIC No. 17.03 (two counts\u2014same occurrence\u2014only one crime).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition the court instructed on the lesser included offense of petty theft as to each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>We hold the testimony that defendant was armed with a butcher-type knife in plain view to open the display case and overcame the force exerted by Miss Govan to keep the glass on the case, coupled with the fact that Miss Govan had to call a security guard, constitutes substantial direct and indirect evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that defendant employed \u201cforce or fear\u201d in obtaining the diamonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Lillie, Acting P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 3, 1977.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-14\">The jury found defendant not guilty of count III (grand theft\u2014Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. 1) allegedly committed on July 13, 1975, the same date as the count II conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-12\">The reporter\u2019s transcript of the preliminary hearing conducted on August 28, 1975, contained in the clerk\u2019s transcript on appeal reflects the following colloquy between defendant and the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: The matter of Eddrick Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">\u201cThis is the time and place for the preliminary examination in your matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">\u201cI assume that at the arraignment you were informed of the charges against you and that you were handed a copy of the complaint which states those charges, also, that you were advised of your constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">\u201cI am going to readvise you as to some of your rights at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-17\">\u201cFirst of .all, you are entitled to a speedy and public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-18\">\u201cYou are also entitled to have an attorney of your own choosing through all of these proceedings; however, if at any time you do not have one or cannot afford one, the court will appoint one from the office of the public defender to represent you.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-19\">\u201cYou are also entitled to be confronted by the witnesses testifying against you and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>the processes of this court to issue subpoenas in your behalf for any witnesses which you may have during all of these proceedings at no cost to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">\u201cYou cannot be compelled to be a witness against yourself; therefore, you don\u2019t have to testify. However, if you choose to testify, you may then be cross-examined by the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">\u201cIf you are held to answer in this court and an information is then filed against you in the Superior Court, you are then entitled to a trial by a jury or a trial by the court sitting without a jury, if the People also consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">\u201cYou are also entitled to be released on reasonable bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">\u201cDo you understand your rights as I have explained them to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">\u201cMR.

I did not receive all transcripts of my trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A-C\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you have a copy of the preliminaiy transcript?</p>\n<p id=\"AC7\">\u201cTHE CLERK: Your Honor, there was only one copy provided with the case file.</p>\n<p id=\"A-h\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: The preliminary and arraignment trial, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"Az9c\">\u201cMR. KELLY: If Your Honor can give me your copy of the transcript, I can have it Xeroxed and give it to Mr. Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"AxG\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"A36\">\u201cMr. Kelly, the defendant has handed to the court a motion to be released without bail. I would like to have you examine that and respond.</p>\n<p id=\"Auk\">\u201cWhile you are doing so, you have been handed, I believe, Mr. Harris, a petition to proceed in propria persona. Have you completed that petition?</p>\n<p id=\"Aqcm\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No, sir, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"APU\">\u201cTHE COURT: That will be necessary that you do and file that with the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"AIW\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"AB5r\">\u201cTHE COURT: Comments on his petition for being released without bail, Mr. Kelly?</p>\n<p id=\"A9H\">\u201cMR. KELLY: The People oppose an O.R. release on him and suggest that the defendant go through the normal O.R. procedure in order to ascertain whether or not he is a suitable candidate for O.R.</p>\n<p id=\"Az1\">\u201cWith respect to the other statements the defendant has made, I believe that once he is given pro per status I think it entitles him to certain time in the jail law library.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AHC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Excuse me, Your Honor. The jail library is very inadequate to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"ArL\">\u201cTHE COURT: This is what you have chosen to do, to represent yourself; and you are going to get the same privileges any other pro per in that county jail has.</p>\n<p id=\"ACg6\">\u201cIf you feel it is inadequate, it is inadequate. I don\u2019t think it is. But, in any event, you are stuck with it unless you are out on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"AUZ\">\u201cYou may file an application for release for pro per, which will be set for hearing when the O.R. unit\u2014strike that..</p>\n<p id=\"Au_\">\u201cYou may file an application for release on your own recognizance, which will be set for hearing in this court when you have completed the application and they have completed the necessary investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"ABn\">\u201cI will not release anybody O.R. without an investigation by that unit.</p>\n<p id=\"AsY_\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir..</p>\n<p id=\"AgI\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"AaH\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Can I ask for a reduction of bail, Your Honor, at this time?</p>\n<p id=\"ABg\">\u201cTHE COURT: We will consider that at the time the hearing on the release comes through and the report of the O.R. unit.</p>\n<p id=\"A2D\">\u201cWhat date do you suggest we proceed on this, Mr. Kelly?</p>\n<p id=\"AtUb\">\u201cMR. KELLY: I think it is about three weeks, isn\u2019t it, to prepare an O.R. report?</p>\n<p id=\"AuH\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think so. Let\u2019s set the O.R. hearing\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AJb\">\u201cLet\u2019s set the hearing on the O.R. release, pretrial and trial setting for three weeks from today. That would make it October 2.</p>\n<p id=\"ALO\">\u201cI will reserve ruling upon your motion for release without bail pending receipt of the O.R. report.</p>\n<p id=\"Acy\">\u201cI want to state for the record I think you are making a big mistake, but it is your liberty, not mine.</p>\n<p id=\"Acd\">\u201cMR. KELLY: I believe there is a bench warrant outstanding from the Santa Monica court for Mr. Harris on a case that he has pending over there.</p>\n<p id=\"Ale\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: What kind of case is this? I am not aware of any other case other than these two cases I have.</p>\n<p id=\"AB2\">\u201cMR. KELLY: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what court it is in Santa Monica. There may be some way of notifying them over there.</p>\n<p id=\"AYZ\">\u201cTHE COURT: I do not see anything here, Mr. Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"A-c\">\u201cMR. KELLY: I was informed this morning there is a bench warrant outstanding for Mr. Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"AK8\">\u201cTHE COURT: He is not going to go anyplace for a while until we find out what happens to him on the O.R.</p>\n<p id=\"AiH\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, will I be allowed five days per week in the legal library and three phone calls a day?</p>\n<p id=\"ALs\">\u201cTHE COURT: You will be given the regular pro per privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"A8r\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Thank you, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"A2f\">\u201cMR. KELLY: Will the bailiff keep Mr. Harris down here until I get the transcript Xeroxed so we can transmit it to him?</p>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I need a legal runner, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"AiE\">\u201cTHE COURT: You will get the same privileges any other pro per gets in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"AgR\">\u201cWhat runners they get, you get. What runners they don\u2019t get, you don\u2019t get.</p>\n<p id=\"AK2a\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I will sign up for it.</p>\n<p id=\"AaP\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b872-9\">CALJIC No. 9.10 as given read: \u201cRobbery is the taking of personal property of any value in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear and with the specific intent permanently to deprive the owner of his property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b872-10\">CALJIC No. 17.03 as given read: \u201cThe defendant is charged in Count Two with the crime of robbery and in Count Three with the crime of grand theft.
