Procunier, its Chairman, appeal from an order which directs the issuance of a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>habeas corpus and has the effect of ordering the immediate release of respondent William Archie Fain on parole from state prison. The order was made upon the trial court\u2019s determination that \u201cfinal\u201d administrative action taken by the Adult Authority, granting Fain a parole and setting a date for his actual release, could not be rescinded by the authority prior to his release. We have concluded that the court erred in this determination; we reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Fain came within the parole-setting jurisdiction of the Adult Authority, pursuant to the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 1168, 3040 et seq.; <em>In re Stanley </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 1030, 1033 [126 Cal.Rptr. 524]), by reason of his commitment to the Department of Corrections under sentences imposed upon his convictions, in two successive prosecutions, of murder and an array of other felonies committed in Stanislaus County. The several crimes and prosecutions, which resulted in three previous appellate decisions <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fain </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 588 [75 Cal.Rptr. 633, 451 P.2d 65]; <em>Fain </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970). 2 Cal.3d 46 [84 Cal.Rptr. 135, 465 P.2d 23]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fain </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 137 [95 Cal.Rptr. 562]), are to be summarized in some detail because of their relevance to the Adult Authority\u2019s actions which are disputed on this appeal. The three previous decisions, and the record made in this proceeding, support the following recitals:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In Fain\u2019s first prosecution, which was conducted in the Stanislaus County Superior Court in 1967, he was charged with murder and seven other felonies committed in June of that year. These crimes are described, in varying detail, in the decisions cited. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fain, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 588 at pp. 592-595; <em>Fain </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 46 at p. 49; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fain, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 137 at p. 140.) After a jury trial in the 1967 prosecution, Fain was convicted on one count of first degree murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 189) for which the jury fixed the punishment at death, three counts of forcible rape (\u00a7 261), one count of forcible sex perversion (\u00a7 288a), two counts of kidnaping (\u00a7 207), and one count of attempted kidnaping. (\u00a7\u00a7 663, 207.) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fain, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 588 at p. 592.) On automatic appeal from the judgment of conviction, the Supreme Court affirmed as to guilt on all counts but reversed as to penalty. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 592, 603.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">After the remand to the Stanislaus County Superior Court which followed, Fain was returned to that county and confined in its jail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>pending the penalty retrial. In July 1969, while the retrial was still pending, he and five other jail prisoners plotted and effected an escape. He was promptly recaptured in Stanislaus County. He then moved the superior court for an order changing the venue of the penalty retrial to another county upon the ground that cumulative local publicity, attending both the 1967 crimes and the 1969 escape, had raised a reason\u00e1ble likelihood that he could not obtain a fair penalty trial in Stanislaus County. <em>(Fain </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 46 at pp. 49-51.) The superior court denied his motion and the Court of Appeal denied his petition for a writ of mandate <em>(id., </em>at p. 51), but the Supreme Court granted it and ordered the Stanislaus County Superior Court to transfer the cause to another county. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 51-55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s action eventually resulted in the removal of Fain\u2019s penalty retrial to the Sacramento County Superior Court. He was meanwhile prosecuted, again in Stanislaus County, for the 1969 escape and various crimes associated with it. This prosecution resulted in his conviction upon one count of escape (\u00a7 4532, subd. (b)), two counts of first degree armed robbery (\u00a7 211), one of auto theft (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851), and one of kidnaping (\u00a7 207), all as committed in 1969. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fain, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 137, at pp. 141, 144.) On his appeal from the judgment of conviction, the Court of Appeal reversed it as to the kidnaping count; affirmed it otherwise; upheld the separate-sentencing procedure followed by the Stanislaus County Superior Court; and referred various other sentencing matters to the Sacramento County Superior Court, where Fain\u2019s retrial on the penalty phase of his first prosecution was then still pending. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 144-145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The recitals which continue from this point are supported by the record made in the present proceeding only. At Fain\u2019s penalty retrial, which was eventually conducted in the Sacramento County Superior Court in 1971, a juiy fixed his punishment at life imprisonment on the 1967 murder count. In conjunction with a \u201ccombined commitment\u201d to the Department of Corrections by that court in December of 1971, the court sentenced Fain (1) to life imprisonment on the 1967 murder count, (2) to the terms prescribed by law on the three counts of forcible rape, the two counts of kidnaping, the single count of forcible sex perversion, and the single count of attempted kidnaping, all as committed in 1967; and (3) to the terms prescribed by law on the count of escape, the two counts of first degree armed robbeiy, and the count of auto theft, all as committed in 1969. All of the sentences described under (2) and (3) were ordered to run concurrently with the life sentence imposed for the 1967 murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The Adult Authority\u2019s process of reviewing Fain\u2019s status, specifically including his eligibility for parole and the timing thereof, commenced from the 1971 base just described.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The events of the process, next recited, occurred subject to pertinent sections of the Penal Code and rules of the Adult Authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">By early 1975, the sentences imposed upon Fain for three of his crimes (the 1967 attempted kidnaping, the 1969 escape, and the 1969 auto theft) had been deemed \u201cdischarged\u201d prospectively (as of Nov. 18, 1975). At that point (early 1975), he was still serving the life sentence imposed for the 1967 murder and the other sentences concurrently imposed for the two 1967 kidnapings, the three 1967 rapes, the 1967 sex perversion charge, and the two first degree armed robberies committed in 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">With respect to these ongoing sentences, Fain was given a hearing before a two-person \u201cpanel\u201d on April 22, 1975. The panel consisted of one Adult Authority \u201cmember\u201d and one \u201ccase-hearing representative.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>By written entry made in Fain\u2019s administrative record on that date (on a \u201cCDC 279\u201d form), the panel granted him parole to be effective on a \u201cparole date\u201d (or \u201crelease date\u201d) which the panel fixed at October 12, 1976. The two panelists signed the CDC 279, and it was countersigned by another Adult Authority member (who had not been on the panel and had not participated in the hearing), on the date it was made (Apr. 22, 1975). In the language of section 5076.1 and the pertinent authority rules, the countersignature meant that the action \u201cgranting . . . parole\u201d had thereupon \u201cbecome final\u201d as \u201capproved by a panel of [two] members of the Adult Authority.\u201d (See \u00a7 5076.1, PBR 2003(a) and PBR 2045(b), quoted in fn. 4, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Another panel interviewed Fain at a further hearing on November 18, 1975. By written entiy made in his record on that date (again on a \u201cCDC 279\u201d form), the panel applied a \u201cjail credit\u201d to the previously fixed release date and granted him an adjusted release date of June 18, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In the spring of 1976, Fain\u2019s imminent release on parole received extensive press publicity in and near Stanislaus County. They raised substantial public opposition to the prospect, much of which was communicated to the Adult Authority and to legislators representing the area. At least one of the legislators protested Fain\u2019s release to the aforementioned Raymond K. Procunier, the Chairman of the Adult Authority. On May 12, 1976, a month short of the scheduled release date, Procunier convened a three-man \u201cReview Committee\u201d pursuant to PBR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>2044.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The committee consisted of Procunier, another member of the Adult Authority, and a \u201crepresentative.\u201d After reviewing Fain\u2019s administrative record on May 12, its members signed a \u201cSummaiy Report\u201d which cited apparent cause, and called for a \u201crescission hearing\u201d directed to his previously granted parole. Although the report summarizes some of the events already recited above, it serves to frame some of the issues in this proceeding and on the appeal. We therefore quote its full text in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The rescission hearing was eventually scheduled to be conducted on June 7, 1976, 11 days short of Fain\u2019s still-scheduled release date. Notice of the time and place of the hearing, and a copy of the review committee\u2019s \u201cSummary Report\u201d of May 12, were mailed to Fain\u2019s attorney. In a letter written to Procunier in late May, and among other things, the attorney requested \u201ca more particular and specific statement of reasons, causes or charges which form the basis of this action of attempting to rescind parole at this time.\u201d In a reply letter written on June 1, the vice chairman of the Adult Authority responded to this request as follows: \u201cI feel that the action taken by the review committee on May 12, 1976 is a sufficiently specific statement. However, to further clarify the issues at the June 7, 1976 [rescission] hearing, we will examine <em>whether or not the original grant of parole was an abuse of discretion. </em>For example, did the panel fail to consider or give any effect to the facts and circumstances of <em>each </em>of the crimes for which Fain was committed to state prison, <em>as required by clear legal and administrative rules!\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Fain then commenced this proceeding on June 4, 1976, by filing in the superior court a \u201cPetition For Writ of Prohibition\u201d in which he alleged some of the above-recited matters and others. The petition named Procunier and the \u201cMembers of the California Adult Authority\u201d as respondents. In its prayer, Fain requested that \u201cthe Court order Respondents to desist or refrain from further proceedings rescinding Petitioner\u2019s parole\u201d or, in the alternative, that it order them \u201cto desist and refrain from further proceedings rescinding Petitioner\u2019s parole date until further order of the Court, and to show cause ... on or before June 18, 1976 [Fain\u2019s still-unrescinded parole date], why Respondents should not be absolutely restrained from further proceedings rescinding Petitioner\u2019s parole date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">On the day the petition was filed, and in response to the alternative prayer, the trial court made an order in which it (1) directed the issuance of an \u201cAlternative Writ\u201d; (2) ordered Procunier to appear on June 15, 1976, and show cause \u201cwhy any further proceedings in this matter shall not be absolutely restrained\u201d; and (3) ordered \u201cthat the parole rescission hearing scheduled for June 7, 1976, be suspended pending showing of good cause why it shall be held.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Procunier and the Adult Authority appeared to the order to show cause by filing, on June 11, a return and points and authorities in opposition to a writ of prohibition. The trial court heard oral argument on June 15, at which time Fain\u2019s counsel argued for a writ of mandate. This prompted a further memorandum by the respondents, in which they opposed mandate upon the ground that Fain had not exhausted his administrative remedy, and a responsive memorandum by Fain. In the course of this briefing, his release date of June 18 was reached and passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">On July 9, the trial court made a minute order in which it declared its determination, and the reasons (hereinafter quoted), that Fain was entitled to a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The minute order further directed that \u201c[a] writ of habeas corpus shall issue, and counsel for petitioner shall prepare a proper order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On July 19, the trial court signed and filed a formal order which provided in pertinent part: \u201c1. For the reasons stated in the . . . [July 9 minute order]. . . , the writ of habeas corpus shall issue. Petitioner shall be released on parole subject to all normal conditions applicable to a prisoner on parole; pending appeal from this order his release shall be without bail, but subject to the conditions appropriate to his parole. [1] 2. In order to complete arrangements for his release on parole, this order shall take effect 10 days from the date of this order. [|] 3. Further Stay Of Execution Denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The Adult Authority and Procunier filed successive notices of appeal in which they purported to appeal from both orders, and applied to this court for a stay of execution pending appeal. We treated the formal order of July 19 as the only one which was appealable, and stayed its execution as requested.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>In the minute order entered on July 9, the trial court stated the reasons for its formal order as follows (numbered paragraphing added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">\u201c[1] The Adult Authority is without the power to review a decision by one of its member panels, which has become final under applicable rules, granting petitioner [Fain] parole. The review of an administrative agency decision which has become final is a role of the courts, not of the agency itself. Asserted abuse of discretion may be tested by an appropriate Writ of Administrative Mandamus proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201c[2] Although Penal Code section 3060 gives the Authority full powers to grant or revoke a parole, those powers are circumscribed by Penal Code section 3063 which declares that no parole shall be revoked without just cause. The Authority\u2019s rules set out three grounds upon which a parole rescission may be based: (1) Disciplinary conduct by the inmate; (2) Psychiatric deterioration of the inmate; and (3) Any new information which indicates that parole should not occur. None is applicable here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">We interpret this language as expressing two distinct but overlapping determinations, with both of which we disagree as next separately discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\n<em>The Administrative \u201cFinality \u201d of the Parole-Granting Decision as a Bar to Its \u201cReconsideration\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">In the first paragraph just enumerated and quoted, which addressed the Adult Authority\u2019s broad power to \u201creview\u201d a parole-granting decision by one of its panels, the trial court concluded that the power was wholly lacking, and that the decision was subject to \u201creview\u201d by the courts alone, once it had \u201cbecome final under applicable rules\u201d of the authority. The term \u201creview,\u201d when used with respect to administrative action, commonly connotes\u2014and the trial court expressly connoted\u2014the concept of \u201creview\u201d of the action in terms of its examination by a superior body which is empowered to set it aside for error. The action taken by the Adult Authority through its review committee, subjecting Fain\u2019s unexecuted parole to a rescission hearing, invoked the distinguishable concept of \u201creview,\u201d by and within the authority itself, as a process in which it would <em>reconsider </em>the 1975 decision whereby the first panel granted him parole.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s first determination thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>abridged the authority\u2019s power of <em>reconsideration </em>upon the basis of administrative finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The actions of the Adult Authority, including those granting a parole and fixing a release date, are purely administrative in nature. <em>(In re Lee </em>(1918) 177 Cal. 690, 693 [171 P. 958]; <em>In re Schoengarth </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 295, 304 [57 Cal.Rptr. 600, 425 P.2d 200]; <em>Fleischer </em>v. <em>Adult Authority </em>(1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 44, 47-48 [20 Cal.Rptr. 603].) They are thus not \u201cjudicial functions\u201d which may be restrained by a writ of prohibition. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1102; <em>Fleischer </em>v. <em>Adult Authority, supra.) </em>They are performed within a range of administrative discretion which has been described as \u201cgreat\u201d (Falk, <em>The Supreme Court of California 1971-1972 </em>(1973) 61 Cal.L.Rev. 273, 427-428), \u201cabsolute,\u201d and \u201calmost unlimited.\u201d (Note, <em>The California Adult Authority </em>(1972) 5 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 360, 368, 376-377.) The exercise of this discretion involves the deliberate assessment of a wide array of individualized factors on a case-by-case basis, and the striking of a balance between the interests of the inmate and of the public. <em>(In re Schoengarth, supra, </em>at p. 300; <em>In re Minnis </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 639, 644-645 [102 Cal.Rptr. 749, 498 P.2d 997].) The authority, acting through one of its panels to grant a parole, is thus a <em>deliberative </em>body by necessary definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Any deliberative body\u2014administrative, judicial or legislative \u2014has the inherent power to reconsider an action taken by it unless the action is such that it may not be set aside or unless reconsideration is precluded by law. (See, e.g., Davis, Administrative Law Text (3d ed. 1972) \u00a7 18.09, pp. 369-371 [administrative body]; 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>Pleading, \u00a7 836, p. 2443 [trial court]; rule 27(a), Cal. Rules of Court, and 6 Witkin, <em>op. cit., </em>Appeal, \u00a7 596, p. 4525 [appellate court]; Mason, Manual of Legislative Procedure (1962 ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 450-451, pp. 302-303 [legislative body].) The power of <em>administrative </em>reconsideration is consistent with the principle that \u201c \u2018notions of administrative autonomy require that the agency be given a chance to discover and correct its own errors.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Muszalski </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 500, 506 [125 Cal.Rptr. 286] [quoting <em>McKart </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 185, 195 (23 L.Ed.2d 194, 204, 89 S.Ct. 1657)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The 1975 decision, granting Fain a parole with a 1976 release date, is not immune from reconsideration as an administrative action which may not be set aside. A prison inmate has no vested right in his prospective liberty upon a parole once granted him. (See <em>In re McLain </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 78, 87 [9 Cal.Rptr. 824, 357 P.2d 1080].)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Whether reconsideration of an administrative action is precluded by law depends upon \u201cwhen the authoritative law intends it to be final,\u201d which is to be determined in every case \u201cupon the scheme of law by which [administrative] power is conferred.\u201d <em>(Lindell Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Permit Appeals </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 303, 323 [144 P.2d 4]; <em>McDonald\u2019s Systems of </em>California, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Permit Appeals </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 525, 544 [119 Cal.Rptr. 26].) Terminal finality of an administrative action is commonly prescribed by enabling law in terms of a post-action period after which the administrative body may not reconsider for lack of <em>jurisdiction. </em>(See, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7 11521, subd. (a) [agency\u2019s \u201cpower to order a reconsideration\u201d expires in 30 days under the Administrative Procedure Act]; <em>McDonald\u2019s Systems of California, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Permit Appeals, supra, </em>at pp. 544-545 [fn. 15 and authorities there collected]. As to judicial bodies, see rules 24(a) and 27(a), Cal. Rules of Court; <em>Scoville </em>v. <em>Keglor </em>(1938) 29 Cal.App.2d 66, 67 [84 P.2d 212]; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7511 [p. 4461], 513-514 [pp. 4462-4463].) Such finality, and the consequence of lapsed jurisdiction, are not readily to be inferred if the enabling law does not expressly provide for them. (See <em>McDonald\u2019s Systems of California, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Permit Appeals, supra </em>[fn. 15].)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The principal provisions of the enabling law which underlies the Adult Authority\u2019s parole-granting powers appear in sections 3040, 3041, and 5076.1. Section 3040 is a plenary grant of the parole power as such, and section 3041 prescribes when it may first be exercised, but neither statute speaks to the administrative finality of a grant of parole.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 5076.1 refers to a point at which a case-hearing representative\u2019s recommendation of parole \u201cshall become final,\u201d but the reference appears in a context whose manifest purpose is to limit the representatives\u2019 parole-granting powers; the context operates to withhold \u201cfinality\u201d from their recommendations <em>until, </em>rather than to impart it <em>when, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>approval of \u201ca panel of members of the Adult Authority\u201d has been obtained. (See \u00a7 5076.1 as quoted in fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>A member-approved recommendation of parole becomes \u201cfinal,\u201d of course, and subject to \u201crevocation\u201d as procedurally distinguished from \u201crescission\u201d if cause appears, when the inmate is actually released on parole. Pending his release, his parole date has been expressly described as no more than \u201ctentative.\u201d <em>(In re Clutchette </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 561, 565 [114 Cal.Rptr. 509].)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">It thus appears that the enabling law (\u00a7\u00a7 3040, 3041 and 5076.1) does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the decision granting Fain a parole became so terminally \u201cfinal,\u201d once it had been recommended and approved on April 22, 1975, that the Adult Authority subsequently lost its inherent power to reconsider the action in the sense that its jurisdiction had lapsed. This being so, such finality was not imposed by the \u201capplicable rules\u201d of the authority to which the court referred in its first determination. Because the language of the two rules which are \u201capplicable\u201d (PBR 2003(a) and 2045(b)) calculatedly adopts the pertinent context of section 5076.1 (see fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>they similarly operate to withhold finality from a representative\u2019s parole recommendation until, but not to impart it when, the requisite \u201cpanel of members\u201d has approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Neither rule may be otherwise interpreted because the authority may not adopt an administrative rule which diminishes its inherent power to reconsider its actions where the Legislature has not done this in the enabling law. <em>(In re Stanley, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 1030 at p. 1036.) The plain language of its rules, as adopted, must be interpreted to comport with the enabling law rather than to conflict with it. <em>(Cozad </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners </em>(1957) 153 Cal.App.2d 249, 258 [314 P.2d 500]; <em>Mission Pak Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 120, 125 [100 Cal.Rptr. 69].) The trial court misconstrued the \u201capplicable rules\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>The Adult Authority\u2019s Power to \u201cRescind\u201d an Unexecuted Parole</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The power of the Adult Authority to rescind a decision granting parole, by action taken before the affected inmate has actually been released from prison, is expressly spelled out in the Parole Board Rules. (See chapter 6 thereof [\u201cParole Revocation and Rescission\u201d], article 6 [\u201cParole Rescission\u201d], commencing with PBR 2660.) Subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>inmate\u2019s right to procedural dtie process in its exercise <em>(In re Prewitt </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 470, 474 [105 Cal.Rptr. 318, 503 P.2d 1326]; <em>In re Clutchette, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 561 at p. 565), it has been recognized by the courts as an adjunct of the authority\u2019s plenary power to \u201csuspend, cancel or revoke any parole,\u201d pursuant to section 3060, if \u201ccause\u201d for such action exists as required by section 3063.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>(In re McLain, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 78 at pp. 84-87; <em>In re Clutchette, supra, </em>at pp. 561, 563, 564-565.) The power to rescind is thus a variant of the agency\u2019s power to reconsider, but its focus is cast upon <em>cause </em>to exercise it as distinguished from <em>jurisdiction </em>to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The trial court correctly expressed this much as a preface to the second determination made in its minute order of July 9, 1976 (quoted <em>ante). </em>It also correctly stated that \u201c[t]he Authority\u2019s rules set out three grounds upon which a parole rescission may be based: (1) Disciplinary conduct by the inmate; (2) Psychiatric deterioration of the inmate; and (3) Any new information which indicates that parole should not occur.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\n                   In effect, however, the court further concluded that Fain was entitled to be released on parole, as scheduled, for the stated reason that none of the specified elements was \u201capplicable here.\u201d These conclusions were incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We first find error in the determination last quoted. There was no evidence of \u201cdisciplinary conduct\u201d or \u201cpsychiatric deterioration\u201d on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Fain\u2019s part, within the meanings of PBR 2661(a) or (b), but by May of 1976 the Adult Authority had newly become aware of public outrage, impressive in its vehemence and the number of people expressing it, at the prospect of his release from prison as then scheduled.  This awareness did not in itself command rescission of his parole but, within the meaning of the omnibus language of PBR 2661(c), it was \u201cnew information which indicates that parole should not occur\u201d and which required the authority\u2019s consideration of that possibility in compliance with its rules.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (PBR 2661(c), 2662. See fn. 13, <em>ante.) </em>To the extent that it defines <em>a </em>ground for parole rescission, PBR 2661(c) was \u201capplicable here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Even if it were not, we find further error in the trial court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the three elements \u201cset out\u201d in the Adult Authority\u2019s rules are <em>the </em>grounds for parole rescission. The rules do not define them as \u201cgrounds\u201d for rescission at all; PBR 2661 refers to them only as matters which \u201cmust be reported\u201d to the authority in specified instances. (See fn. 13, <em>ante.) </em>In the strictly procedural rules which follow (see <em>ibid.), </em>they are made out to be grounds upon which a parole rescission \u201cmay\u201d be based (as the trial court put it), but not the <em>exclusive </em>grounds for that action. The trial court, interpreting them as exclusive, decided in effect that the authority\u2019s procedural rules operate (1) to preclude it from rescinding a parole for any \u201ccause\u201d not expressly defined in them; and thereby (2) to stultify the exercise of its substantive discretion, in parole matters, which the Legislature has not limited in the enabling law. As we have previously seen with respect to the agency\u2019s inherent power to reconsider its actions while it retains unlapsed jurisdiction to do so, its rules may not be given this interpretation. <em>(In re Stanley, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 1030 at p. 1036; <em>Cozad </em>v. <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Chiropractic Examiners, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 249 at p. 258; <em>Mission Pak Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 120 at p. 125. See also <em>In re Muszalski, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 500 at p. 506.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\n<em>The Issue of \u201cCause\u201d for Rescission of Fain\u2019s Parole</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We have seen that the Adult Authority is empowered to rescind Fain\u2019s parole for cause, and that the trial court erroneously found cause lacking because it misinterpreted the authority\u2019s rules.  The determination was accordingly erroneous for the additional\u2014and final\u2014reason that it was prematurely reached. Whether there is cause for rescission remains to be decided by the authority at the rescission hearing which has yet to be conducted because the trial court \u201csuspended\u201d it when this proceeding was commenced. (See the text at fn. 7, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Since the authority\u2019s discretion in parole matters is \u201cgreat,\u201d \u201cabsolute,\u201d and \u201calmost unlimited,\u201d as previously described, it is sufficiently broad to include the apprehension and correction of a mistake made by the agency in granting a parole. (See <em>In re Muszalski, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 500 at p. 506.) This means that \u201ccause\u201d for the rescission of Fain\u2019s parole may exist if the authority reasonably determines, in its discretion, that the parole was \u201cimprovidently granted\u201d <em>(In re Prewitt, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 470 at p. 474) under the circumstances which appeared in 1975 and which may have appeared since. We do not prejudge that question, and the trial court should not have undertaken to decide it. It will be resolved by the authority, whose answer to it may be subject to judicial review when it is finally reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Short of that event, even the possibility that Fain will be deprived of his prospective liberty on parole may not be based upon \u201cmere whim, caprice, or rumor.\u201d <em>(In re McLain, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 78 at p. 87.) There must accordingly have been some \u201ccause\u201d for the possibility having materialized, and Fain\u2019s attendant right to procedural due process entitled him to know what it was. <em>(In re Prewitt, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 470 at p. 474; <em>In re Clutchette, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 561 at p. 565.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The review committee obviously found cause for the <em>possibility </em>in May 1976, when it reviewed Fain\u2019s record and the 1975 action which produced his parole. (See the \u201cSummary Report\u201d of the committee as quoted in fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>Since cause for the <em>reality </em>remains to be seen, we refrain from analyzing the committee\u2019s preliminary determination; given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Fain\u2019s criminal background and the apparent reasoning of the 1975 panel which granted him parole and a 1976 release date, it will suffice to say that the record before the review committee supported the action it took, and its reasons for acting, as stated in its \u201cSummary Report.\u201d The delay in its action was most regrettable from Fain\u2019s standpoint, but society\u2019s stake in the situation required late reconsideration of his parole in preference to none at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">A wide-ranged array of miscellaneous arguments advanced by the parties need not be reached, but a few final points should be briefly stated.  There was no irregularity in the review committee\u2019s intervention, nor in Procunier\u2019s initiative in causing it. Under the cumulative circumstances shown to have occurred by early 1976, Fain\u2019s case presented \u201cunusual difficulties\u201d which warranted review committee action. (See PER 2044 as quoted in fn. 5, <em>ante. </em>The parties, in fact, treat the case as a matter of first impression.) Procunier properly initiated the action in the performance of his statutory obligation, as Chairman of the Adult Authority, to \u201cexercise all duties and functions necessary to insure that the responsibilities of the authority are successfully discharged.\u201d (\u00a7 5075. See also PER 2002(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Fain did not exhaust his administrative remedy by pursuing an appeal, as such, from the review committee\u2019s decision which set the rescission proceedings in motion. (See PER 2060-2065.) Because those proceedings would have resolved any and all questions he might have raised by appealing the decision, an administrative appeal would have been redundant and wholly ineffective. In the latter circumstance, the conventional exhaustion doctrine has no application. (2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit., </em>supra, Actions, \u00a7 182, pp. 1046-1047.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Other points raised by Fain involve the composition and functions of the panel which would have conducted the rescission hearing. These are also matters now to be remitted to future proceedings, which will be conducted in accordance with his continuing right to procedural due process. <em>(In re Prewitt, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 470 at p. 474; <em>In re Clutchette, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 561 at p. 565.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">As previously noted, the parties have treated Fain\u2019s petition as seeking habeas corpus <em>or </em>prohibition <em>or </em>mandate. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.) </em>For the reasons we have stated with respect to the trial court\u2019s errors in granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>it, habeas corpus relief is not available to him. As we have also stated, prohibition does not lie to restrain the Adult Authority\u2019s administrative actions. <em>(Fleischer </em>v. <em>Adult Authority, supra, </em>202 Cal.App.2d 44 at pp. 47-48.) Mandate does not lie in any direction which favors Fain, and we perceive no basis for it. If he is to have a remedy, it will lie at the conclusion of the rescission proceeding which must be completed upon the remand hereinafter ordered. If the authority does not pursue and conclude the proceeding as a matter of urgency, he may consider further resort to the courts to compel those results.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The purported appeal from the minute order dated July 9, 1976, is dismissed. The order dated July 19, 1976, is reversed. The trial court is directed to remand the cause to the Adult Authority for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Caldecott, P. J., and Emerson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 26, 1977, and petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 17, 1977. Tobriner, J., was of the opinion that the application should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Except where otherwise expressly indicated, all statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">This was because the \u201ccombined commitment\u201d was made in 1971. Except for intermittent periods he had spent in county jails pending and during his trials in 1969 and 1971, Fain has actually been in state prison since he was first committed to the Department of Corrections after his convictions in 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">We hereinafter cite these sources as appropriate, but quote only some of them because of their number and length.

This recommendation was reviewed and approved by Member R. Garcia. Subsequent to this parole granting action, the inmate was seen on 11-18-75 by Representatives R. Coyle and A.

The formal order, which materialized and was signed on July 19, is appealable pursuant to section 1506. (2) As the July 9 order is not appealable as such, the appeal purportedly taken from it must be dismissed. (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 31, p. 4046.)

(See PBR 2042.) \u201cThe central office calendar will either note the incident or information and take no action, or will order the matter scheduled for rescission proceedings\u201d (PBR 2662(b) [\u201cDecision\u201d]) and is required to \u201cdocument its decision\u201d in either event. (PBR 2662(c) [\u201cDocumentation\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Fain has contended, in the trial court and on the appeal, that,the Adult Authority considered rescinding his parole because Chairman Procunier has improperly yielded to public and political pressure. The contention is to be rejected, as a matter of law, because the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers precludes judicial inquiry into the \u201cmotivation or mental processes\u201d which may underlie action by a nonjudicial agency of government. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court [Burroughs] </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 721, 723, 727, fn. 5 [119 Cal.Rptr. 631, 532 P.2d 495]; <em>Mandel </em>v. <em>Hodges </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 596, 609 [127 Cal.Rptr. 244].) It is also untenable in point of fact. The authority\u2019s developing awareness of the public hostility to Fain\u2019s release was \u201cnew information which indicates\u201d\u2014or not, depending upon the result to be reached in the rescission proceedings which the trial court foreclosed\u2014that his \u201cparole should not occur\u201d because it reaches such pertinent questions as whether he may be assimilated into society, and indeed whether he will be personally safe, outside of prison. In light of the multiplicity and nature of his crimes, his documented notoriety, and the sheer dimensions of the public\u2019s hostility to his release, the unfavorable portents may not be localized to Stanislaus County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Retired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
