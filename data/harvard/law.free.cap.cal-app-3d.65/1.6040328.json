J.</author>\n<p id=\"An\">Defendant Pacific Gas and Electric Company (hereinafter appellant or P G and E) appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment awarding respondent damages in the sum of $46,508 plus interest for breach of contract. The relevant facts may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">By a written agreement executed September 28, 1966, appellant undertook to provide natural gas for respondent corporation, a commercial consumer, which maintained and operated a hardboard plant in Ukiah, California. Although respondent utilized gas for the diyer and space heaters, 99 percent of all gas supplied by P G and E was used for the three main boilers generating steam for the production of fiber and hardboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">The computation of bills which lies at the core of the present controversy involved a relatively complex procedure consisting of several steps. First the raw cubic feet of gas (the so-called volume) had to be measured. This took place by a P G and E gas meter located on respondent\u2019s premises. The volume was recorded by an index which was attached to, and driven by, the meter. The index, in turn, drove a pen which recorded the volume \u201cwaves\u201d on a circular flow chart. Second, the additional element figuring in the computation was the recording of the temperature and pressure of gas which was done by recorders also mounted on the meter. The third step was the addition of the gravity factor to the data above described by which the corrected volume of gas delivered to Masonite was calculated. The corrected volume was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>multiplied by the therm factor (the heating value of gas). The final figure appearing on the bill was the result of multiplying the therms (BTUs) by the applicable gas rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Although the instruments mentioned above were all supplied by P G and E, respondent, too, had meters of its own on each of the three main boilers. One of the meters measured the raw cubic feet of gas consumed, and the other set of meters measured the pounds of steam produced by respondent. Records of the gas and steam readings from Masonite\u2019s meters were kept on a regular basis, and Masonite\u2019s meters were inspected and calibrated by the manufacturer on November 11, 1971. Masonite also kept records of the board-foot production of the plant on a daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The gas bills of P G and E were excessively high for the months of November and December 1971. Based upon the readings of its own meters and the unchanged volume of production, respondent claimed that it had been overcharged for gas for the above noted months. After efforts to settle the dispute had failed, respondent initiated a lawsuit against P G and E in order to recover damages for the alleged overcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">At the ensuing jury trial, respondent presented evidence showing, inter alia, that its production records indicated no significant increase or decrease in the board-foot production for November and December 1971; that the readings of their own meters showed no appreciable change in pounds of steam produced or in the volume of gas used by the boilers in the months in controversy; that prior to the P G and E\u2019s testing of the meters the parties inspected the Masonite gas system for leaks and found none; and that in the disputed period the kilowatt-hour records indicated no significant changes in electricity usage by the plant. Finally, and most significantly, respondent introduced evidence to the effect that when about 1:30 p.m. on December 28, 1971, the original index was removed from the P G and E meter and replaced with a new index, the volume waves which previously had shown 10.6 per 12-hour period, immediately dropped to 6.4 for the same period and continued at that rate thereafter. In rebuttal, appellant furnished evidence that the tests carried out according to its own rules and regulations failed to show any inaccuracy in its metering, pressure recordation or billing process, and that there was no possible way for the meter or index to register inaccurately.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>After receiving evidence and being instructed, the jury rendered a general verdict in favor of respondent, assessing damages in the sum of $46,508 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Appellant does not dispute that the foregoing record amply supports the verdict of the jury. Appellant\u2019s principal contention on appeal, rather, is that the jury verdict should fail because a considerable portion of the evidence was inadmissible on the basis of irrelevancy. More precisely, appellant argues that respondent\u2019s theory of recovery was founded on breach of contract for failing to keep and maintain the gas meters and other facilities in good operating condition. Since the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) provided a comprehensive regulatory scheme for gas metering, testing and adjustment of bills for meter errors which preempted the field (cf. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Pacific Telephone Co. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 1 [114 Cal.Rptr. 753, 523 P.2d 1161]; Pub. Util. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 701, 702, 489, 1759), continues appellant, the <em>sole </em>permissible means of proving the meter accuracy or overcharge was in accordance with the pertinent regulatory provisions (Gas Rule, No. 17 (Rule 17) and General Order No. 58-A (Order 58-A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and any other evidence showing meter inaccuracy, malfunction and/or overcharge was irrelevant and inadmissible as a matter of law. Appellant\u2019s position is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">In the first place, the first amended complaint reveals without ambiguity that, contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, respondent\u2019s claim of breach of contract was predicated on <em>dual </em>grounds: one, appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>alleged failure to keep accurate meters and related devices; two, a separate and distinct allegation that the overcharge occurred because appellant billed and collected money for gas actually not delivered to respondent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">In the second place, appellant\u2019s basic contention, that by regulating the mode of meter testing and by providing for refund in case of overcharge the PUC preempted the field and that therefore no other additional evidence could be presented or received to prove damages, is unsupported by law or reason, and must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">We are, of course, well aware that the PUC as an expert administrative body has wide regulatory power with respect to public utilities which the courts generally may not abrogate (\u00a7 1759;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>E. B. Ackerman Importing Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 595 [39 Cal.Rptr. 726, 394 P.2d 566]). However, the commission does not have <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction over any and all matters having any reference to the regulation and supervision of public utilities <em>(Product Research Associates </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 651, 655 [94 Cal.Rptr. 216]; <em>Vila </em>v. <em>Tahoe Southside Water Utility </em>(1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 469, 477 [43 Cal.Rptr. 654]). On the contrary, section 2106 expressly empowers the state courts to award both compensatoiy and (in a proper case) exemplary damages against the public utility for <em>all </em>damages, loss or injury resulting from any unlawful act or omission<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(California Adj. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>v. <em>Atchison etc. Ry. Co. </em>(1918) 179 Cal. 140, 145 [175 P. 682, 13 A.L.R. 274]; <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Town of Lakeport </em>(1936) 5 Cal.2d 377, 383 [54 P.2d 1110, 55 P.2d 485, 108 A.L.R. 1168]; <em>Vila </em>v. <em>Tahoe Southside Water Utility, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In analyzing the issue at hand in the context of the foregoing premises, we initially underline that while the reasonable rates, rules and regulations of the commission do become a part of every contract between a public utility and its patrons <em>(Hischemoeller </em>v. <em>Nat. Ice etc. Storage Co. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 318, 325 [294 P.2d 433]; <em>Sherwood </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 354, 359 [21 Cal.Rptr. 810]), the rights and duties of the contracting parties are determined by, and derived from, the underlying contract as a Whole <em>(Gardner </em>v. <em>Basich Bros. Construction Co. </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 191, 194 [281 P.2d 521]). As a consequence, iii resolving the rights and liabilities of the parties here, we may not took solely to the rules and regulations referred to by appellant, but rather must take into account and construe the <em>entire </em>contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The principles relating to interpretation of contracts are, of course, well established.  Preponderant among these rules are the following: all applicable law enters into and becomes a part of a contract by inference <em>(Traders etc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pac. Emp. Ins. Co. </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 158, 164 [278 P.2d 493]; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 416, 418 [246 P.2d 686]; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Rich Mfg. Co. </em>(1945) 68 Cal.App.2d 725 [158 P.2d 23]); the whole of the contract must be taken together and effect be given to every part if reasonably practicable (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1641; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Klure </em>(1962) 205 Cal.App.2d 574, 578 [23 Cal.Rptr. 313]); ambiguities in the contract, especially in exculpatory provisions, must be construed most strongly against the one who caused the ambiguity to exist, i.e., the drafter (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1654; <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Hudson Sales Corp. </em>(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 418, 427-428 [313 P.2d 936]; <em>Basin Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Baash-Ross Tool Co. </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 578, 596 [271 P.2d 122]; see also <em>Transmix Corp. </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1960) 187 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Cal.App.2d 257, 267-268 [9 Cal.Rptr. 714]); the contract must receive such interpretation as will make it reasonable (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1643; <em>Kurland </em>v. <em>United Pac. Ins. Co. </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 112, 118 [59 Cal.Rptr. 258]); and lastly, there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract that neither party will do anything which deprives the other of the benefit of the agreement <em>(Redke </em>v. <em>Silvertrust </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 94, 100 [98 Cal.Rptr. 293, 490 P.2d 805]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 559, 564-565 [212 P.2d 878]; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 527, 530 [29 Cal.Rptr. 269]; <em>Bergum </em>v. <em>Weber </em>(1955) 136 Cal.App.2d 389, 392 [288 P.2d 623]).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">When interpreted in light of the foregoing precepts, the agreement at bench must be held to include not only Rule 17 and Order 58-A, as appellant contends, but the pertinent provisions of the Evidence Code and the Public Utilities Code as well. The import of the incorporation of these codes in the agreement is quite obvious. On the one hand, the provisions of the Public Utilities Code make it explicit that no public utility may charge or receive a different compensation for any commodity furnished or service rendered than prescribed by the applicable rates or schedules in effect (\u00a7\u00a7 494, 532),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and also that the party aggrieved is entitled to recover <em>all </em>damages or loss caused by the unlawful act of the public utility (\u00a7 2106, <em>supra, </em>fn. 5). On the other hand, it is axiomatic that under the Evidence Code and the case authorities thereunder, both direct and indirect, or circumstantial, evidence may be relied upon to prove any disputed fact, including contractual or other damages <em>(Baruh </em>v. <em>Kuhl </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 266, 273 [28 Cal.Rptr. 573]; <em>Ignagni </em>v. <em>A. J. Peters &amp; Son, Inc. </em>(1957) 147 Cal.App.2d 661, 663 [305 P.2d 953]; 31 Cal.Jur.3d, \u00a7 692, pp. 977-978).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Since under the rules of contract interpretation the Public Utilities Code, the Evidence Code, Rule 17 and Order 58-A simultaneously became implied terms of the same agreement, and since the respective provisions of the codes and the rules of the commission are in an apparent conflict, the narrow issue presented for determination is whether the rules of the commission take precedence over the wider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>provisions of the codes. We believe the answer to this question must be in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">First, it is evident that the rules relied upon by appellant purport to limit P G and E\u2019s liability for damages in a rather ambiguous way. While the rules of the commission prescribe that the tests to determine the meter accuracy shall be made with a meter prover, they fail to specify whether other recognized methods of proving damages are also available or permissible and, even more significantly, they fail to spell out in clear and unmistakable terms that the general rules of evidence ought to be precluded in substantiating the meter inaccuracy and/or the overcharge of the customer, however occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, in the case at bench we are confronted with an exculpatory clause which is couched in ambiguous terms. Consequently, under established rules, we are bound to resolve the uncertainty or doubt against appellant, the drafter of the instrument, and hold that in the absence of a clearcut limitation appellant was liable for all damages caused to respondent (\u00a7 2106), and that the damages stemming from the overcharge could properly be proven by any evidence admissible under the Evidence Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Second, the additional guidelines relating to the interpretation of contracts (i.e., the contract must be interpreted so as to make it reasonable; interpretation which would render a contract harsh, unjust or absurd must be avoided; the party may not be deprived of the benefit of his bargain under the guise of interpretation) supply added force to the conclusion reached above. It is plain from the statutory, regulatory and contractual provisions that the parties to the agreement at bench intended payment only for gas actually delivered. To construe the agreement otherwise and hold that by way of a vague limitation of proof P G and E obtained an inherent right to charge and retain money for a product or commodity in fact not delivered, would fly directly in the face of the equitable principles set forth above and would result in unjust enrichment on the part of P G and E. It is blackletter law that in this type of situation the aggrieved party, who has been deprived of the benefit of his bargain, gains an equitable right to recover under a quasi-contract iheoiy. As the cases explain, the quasi-contract, or contract \u201cimplied in law,\u201d is an obligation created by the law without regard to the intention of the parties and designed to restore the aggrieved party to his former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>position by the return of the thing delivered or the money expended <em>(Kossian </em>v. <em>American Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 647, 651 [62 Cal.Rptr. 225]; <em>Branche </em>v. <em>Hetzel </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 801, 807 [51 Cal.Rptr. 188]; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (1973 ed.) \u00a7 28, p. 45).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">We observe in passing that <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Pacific Telephone Co., supra, </em>upon which appellant so heavily relies, is clearly distinguishable from the case at bench. In <em>Waters, </em>the limitation upon the telephone company\u2019s liability was upheld because, unlike the case at bench, the limitation there was expressed in clear and unequivocal terms, and because the commission relied upon the validity of the limitation in exercising its rate-making functions (pp. 5, 10). Nothing similar has been shown in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">In light of our conclusion, appellant\u2019s remaining contentions do not require extended discussion. Thus, appellant\u2019s charge that the jury was improperly instructed and material instructions were improperly refused is based on the erroneous premise that the contractual rights and duties of the parties were determined solely by the specific provisions of Rule 17 and Order 58-A. Since we have resolved this issue contrariwise, appellant\u2019s claim must automatically fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Appellant\u2019s last argument, that due to the technical complexity of the matter the special interrogatories propounded by appellant should have been submitted to the juiy and that the trial court\u2019s failure to do so constituted an abuse of discretion, similarly requires only a brief reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">First of all, the purpose of a special finding of fact is to test the validity of a general verdict by determining whether all facts essential to its support were established to the satisfaction of the jury <em>(Plyer </em>v. <em>Pacific etc. Cement Co. </em>(1907) 152 Cal. 125, 130 [92 P. 56]; <em>Cembrook </em>v. <em>Sterling Drug Inc. </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 52, 63-64 [41 Cal.Rptr. 492]; <em>Bernson </em>v. <em>Bowman </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 697, 702 [6 Cal.Rptr. 455]). Our examination of the evidence along with the applicable legal principles convinces us that all facts necessary to support the general verdict here were adequately present; and, as a result, a favorable answer or answers to the special interrogatories would not have yielded a different or inconsistent general verdict. It is well recognized that in such a situation no cause for reversal is presented <em>(Pigeon </em>v. <em>Fuller </em>(1909) 156 Cal. 691, 697 [105 P. 976]; <em>Plyer </em>v. <em>Pacific, etc. Cement Co., supra </em>at p. 134).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Secondly, the giving of special interrogatories to the jury is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and his determination is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>subject to review in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 625;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Mayfield </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1936) 16 Cal.App.2d 611, 629 [61 P.2d 83]; <em>Cembrook </em>v. <em>Sterling Drug Inc., supra). </em>Appellant has failed to show such an abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Rouse, J., and Scott, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 19, 1977.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Unless otherwise indicated, all references will be made to the Public Utilities Code of California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Order 58-A, section 23, states that \u201c(a) <em>All tests to determine the accuracy of registration of any gas service meter shall be made with a suitable meter prover.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u201c(b) Every gas service meter, when installed for the use of any customer, shall be in good order and shall have been adjusted to register within one (1) per cent over or two (2) per cent under the prover registration when passing gas at a rate which will caus\u00e9 a pressure drop in the meter of not to exceed one-half <em>('A) </em>inch of water column.
