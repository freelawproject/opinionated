Pitchess, appeal from minute orders granting preliminary injunctions in favor of plaintiffs who operate nine commercial establishments providing nude or partially nude entertainment or food or beverage service of the type covered by Penal Code sections 318.5 and 318.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appeals lie. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Plaintiffs are Startrack, Inc., Sail\u2019er Inn, Inc., Alhar Enterprises, Inc., Ed Butker, Jack E. Taylor, First King, Inc., Robert R. Scott, T. R. &amp; R. Corporation, and Jack Fero. Their separate actions have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Generally these plaintiffs operate establishments which meet the specific physical requirements for a theater under the three ordinances herein challenged, namely, Los Angeles County Ordinances Nos. 9884, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>9885, 11199,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and are \u201cprimarily devoted to theatrical performances,\u201d but they have only county entertainment licenses instead of county theater licenses. Thus, prior to the enactment of Ordinance No. 11199 in 1975 their establishments apparently were considered exempt from the 1969 ordinances by reason of the second paragraph of each of the enabling statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The two 1969 ordinances as amended by the 1975 ordinance, however, were construed by defendant sheriff to require that plaintiffs hold county theater licenses in order to continue providing lawfully the nude or partially nude entertainment or food or beverage service that they had been furnishing their patrons. This threat of imminent enforcement of these ordinances, as so interpreted, gave rise to this preventive litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The injunctions that have been ordered restrain temporarily the enforcement of the three ordinances against plaintiffs. The primary reason why the trial court ordered these injunctions was its conclusion that both of the earlier ordinances, particularly as amended by the later ordinance, unconstitutionally intrude upon an area of regulation preempted by the state. (See <em>In re Lane, </em>58 Cal.2d 99, 102 [22 Cal.Rptr. 857, 372 P.2d 897]; <em>In re Moss, </em>58 Cal.2d 117, 118-119 [23 Cal.Rptr. 361, 373 P.2d 425].) Under this view these ordinances by specifically defining terms left undefined in the enabling statutes\u2014namely theater, concert hall, similar establishment\u2014have unconstitutionally broadened \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>narrow exceptions\u201d (see <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>6 Cal.3d 805, 808 [100 Cal.Rptr. 609, 494 P.2d 681]) for local regulation permitted by these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Defendants rejoin that our Supreme Court in <em>Crownover </em>v. <em>Musick, 9 </em>Cal.3d 405 [107 Cal.Rptr. 681, 509 P.2d 497], decided that substantially similar and identical ordinances of respectively, the County and the City of Sacramento <em>(id </em>at pp. 412-413, fns. 6, 7; pp. 414-416, fn. 9), were constitutional in this respect. The high court said, \u201c. . . the various ordinances .. . follow closely the essential wording of the statutes and by their language conform in scope to the designated regulatory area over which the state has yielded its preemptive claims. Thus the ordinances directly regulate conduct within the delineated statutory limits.\u201d <em>(Id </em>at p. 418.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">If the quoted language constitutes a holding by our Supreme Court that ordinances of the same or substantially the same wording as those before it in <em>Crownover </em>do not violate article XI, section 7, of the California Constitution, then the trial court erred jurisdictionally in not following this holding. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The Supreme Court gave no rationale, however, for the conclusions which we have just quoted regarding the constitutionality in this respect of such ordinances. An examination of the ordinances themselves, though, suggest a reason. In each of the basic challenged ordinances as amended, the words \u201ctheater, concert hall, similar establishment\u201d have two separate and distinct meanings. Under section 1 of each such ordinance these words have the same broad, ordinary, specifically undefined meanings that they have in the enabling statutes. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 7, subd. 16; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lovelace, </em>97 Cal.App. 228, 230 [275 P. 489]; <em>Gayer </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>59 Cal.App.2d 255, 262 [138 P.2d 763].) In section 2 of each such ordinance they are given a common, specific and comparatively narrow meaning. But section 2 of each such ordinance further provides that its definition \u201cdoes not supersede the provisions of section 1 of this ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Thus, to come within the exemption from local regulation provided by the two statutes, an establishment must come within <em>either </em>the provisions of section 1 or of section 2 of the two basic challenged ordinances as amended by the third ordinance. <em>It does not have to come </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>within both. </em>In other words, by reason of the last sentence in section 2 \u00f3f both basic ordinances as amended, neither basic ordinance intrudes upon the area of preempted state control and therefore both basic ordinances as amended by the third ordinance are constitutional so far as preemption is concerned.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">This means, of course, that defendant sheriff was mistaken in his interpretation and attempted enforcement of the basic ordinances as requiring that establishments coming within their scope qualify for exemption therefrom exclusively under section 2 thereof. So long as plaintiffs\u2019 establishments come within section 1 thereof, they are exempt therefrom without compliance with the provisions of section 2 thereof. In other words, among other things, plaintiffs\u2019 establishments presumably do not need a theater license to be so exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Defendants contend that since we have just held the challenged ordinances to be constitutional, we must reverse the orders under appeal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526, 2d subdivision 4, and Civil Code section 3423, subdivision 4.  We do not agree. As we have just indicated, defendant sheriff\u2019s threatened enforcement of the challenged ordinances was both mistaken and illegal. Defendant sheriff attempted to apply these ordinances to plaintiffs\u2019 establishments though they were presumably exempt therefrom under section 1 of the basic ordinances. Injunctive relief may be granted against illegal enforcement of valid ordinances. (See <em>MacLeod </em>v. <em>City of Los Altos, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 364, 369-370 [6 Cal.Rptr. 326]; <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Klimm, </em>217 Cal. 362, 371-373 [18 P.2d 678].)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The orders granting the preliminary injunctions are modified so that they restrain only the enforcement of the requirements of section 2 of Los Angeles County Ordinances Nos. 9884 and 9885 as amended by Los Angeles County Ordinance No. 11199 against plaintiffs so long as their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>establishments remain exempt from such basic ordinances pursuant to section 1 thereof. As so modified, they are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Allport, Acting P.
