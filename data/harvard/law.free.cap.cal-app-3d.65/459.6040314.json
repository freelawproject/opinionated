Langmuir, personal representative of Kenneth M. Langmuir, deceased (hereafter for convenience Husband).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">This is an action on a rejected contingent claim in probate in the amount of $157,800, payable $800 per month. The claim rests upon the provisions of a written property settlement and support agreement between Husband and Wife, which was approved by the interlocutory judgment of dissolution of their marriage. The judgment also directed the parties to cany out the executory provisions of the agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The basic issue on appeal is whether the agreement qualifies under Civil Code section 4801, subdivision (b), as one providing, by reasonable implication, that Husband\u2019s support of Wife shall <em>not </em>terminate upon his death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The agreement at issue provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">\u201cV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">Alimony</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">\u201cHusband agrees to pay to Wife as and for alimony, the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) forthwith, and the sum of Eight Hundred Dollars ($800.00) per month payable on the first day of each and every month commencing on the first day of January, 1971 and to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>until the death, remarriage, or expiration of twenty (20) years from and after the said first day of January, 1971, whichever event shall first occur. In the event Wife enters into a meretricious relationship with a man, then the commencement of such relationship shall be deemed to be the equivalent of remarriage. The provisions of this paragraph providing for payments by Husband to Wife, shall not be subject to modification or revocation by Court Order, or otherwise, and are to be deemed non-modifiable, regardless of any change of circumstances, except for the contingencies contained herein.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">\u201cXI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">Binding Effect</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cThis agreement, and each provision hereof, is expressly made binding upon the heirs, assigns, executors, administrators, representatives and successors in interest of each party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">I. <em>The Admissibility of the Letter of Husband\u2019s Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Apparently during the negotiations between counsel for the parties leading up to the agreement at issue, Husband\u2019s then counsel wrote Wife\u2019s counsel a letter containing the following two opening paragraphs. \u201cMr. Langmuir has instructed me to inform you that he is willing to enter into a Property Settlement Agreement with Mrs. Langmuir providing for a lump-sum payment to her in the sum of $5,000.00, plus monthly payments of $800.00 each, to continue until either her death or remarriage, but in no event beyond twenty years. If she enters into a meretricious relationship with a man, then the commencement of such relationship shall be deemed to be the equivalent of remarriage. [\u00b6] The foregoing support provision is to be non-modifiable, regardless of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>change of circumstances, except for the contingencies mentioned above.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Wife\u2019s counsel offered this letter in evidence as extrinsic evidence to resolve the ambiguity in the agreement arising from its failure to identify whose death or remarriage would terminate Husband\u2019s continuing obligation of support of Wife imposed by the agreement. The trial court ultimately rejected this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In so ruling, it prejudicially erred. The words in the alimony provision of the agreement \u201cthe death\u201d refer necessarily to the death of one or the other of the parties thereto. These words create a patent ambiguity as to whose death was meant. The letter in question should have been received as relevant extrinsic evidence tending to resolve this ambiguity by identifying the death meant as that of Wife. (See <em>McCollum </em>v. <em>Steitz, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 76, 78 [67 Cal.Rptr. 703]; <em>Estate of Dean, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 86, 92, 97 [155 P.2d 901].)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In any event, the context in which the word \u201cdeath\u201d appears in the alimony provision of the agreement suggests this meaning. The remarriage referred to in the same phrase probably is that of Wife as it is unlikely that remarriage of Husband was intended to terminate Wife\u2019s support. Therefore, the court might well have found from the extrinsic evidence that the \u201cdeath\u201d referred to was Wife\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">2. <em>The Agreed Support Obligation Could Survive Husband\u2019s Death If Such Was Intended</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Prior to 1951 by decisional law an award of permanent alimony terminated upon the death of either spouse. A 1951 amendment to former Civil Code section 139 codified this rule subject to the following exception: \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>rule and its exception are now set forth in the already quoted subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 4801. (See 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Husband and Wife, \u00a7\u00a7 181, 204, pp. 5050, 5074-5075.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The 1951 amendment was first construed in 1957 in <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>McNitt, </em>49 Cal.2d 79, 80, 82-83 [315 P.2d 1], where a bare majority of our Supreme Court held that a provision in a property settlement agreement specifying that monthly support payments from the husband to the wife should continue for three years did not constitute a written agreement between them that such payments were impliedly thereby to continue in the event of the husband\u2019s death during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The only decision since <em>Hilton </em>construing a property settlement agreement on the point before us\u2014the effect of the death of the former husband\u2014is the 1975 case of <em>Emanuel </em>v. <em>Emanuel, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 56 [123 Cal.Rptr. 249]. There the former wife sought $69,000 ($400 a month for 14.5 years) from her former husband\u2019s estate. The agreement there construed provided that this monthly support payment should continue until the death or remarriage of the former wife. There was no express provision negating modification or cancellation as in the agreement at bench. The agreement, however, also contained the general standard binding on successors-in-interest provision. <em>(Id., </em>at 57-58.) A division of this court held, in <em>effect, </em>that the existence of this boiler plate general provision did not constitute sufficient reason for not following <em>Hilton. (Id., </em>at 58-60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">On the other hand, the remarriage cases under the subdivision have gone the other way. In <em>Rheuban </em>v. <em>Rheuban, </em>238 Cal.App.2d 552, 554-557 [47 Cal.Rptr. 884], decided some eight years after <em>Hilton, </em>another division of this court held that a trial court was without power to terminate the former husband\u2019s monthly support payments to the former wife upon her remarriage within the 128 month period specified for such payments where the property settlement agreement expressly made the provision for the payments \u201cfixed\u201d and not \u201csubject to further change or modification\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the agreement also contained a provision making it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>generally binding on the heirs and personal representatives of the parties (as in <em>Emanuel).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><em>Rheuban </em>was followed in 1974 in the case of <em>In re Marriage of Nicolaides, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 192, 196-197 [114 Cal.Rptr. 56], where the former wife remarried during the five-year period for permanent alimony payments. The court relied upon the similarity between the agreements in the provisions limiting modification and in the existence in each of the agreements of the aforementioned standard provision making the agreement binding upon successors-in-interest. It said at page 202: <em>\u201cRheuban </em>is a logical and sound extension of the holding in <em>Hilton. </em>It explains that where there is evidence in addition to the promise to pay for a specified period from which it reasonably may be concluded that the parties intended the payments to continue after remarriage of the wife, <em>Hilton </em>does not require that the payments terminate simply because the parties <em>literally </em>do not provide otherwise.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In view of the fact that the language <em>of the </em>subdivision is the same as respects both remarriage and death, we see no reason why the remarriage cases are not sound precedents for a death, case such as ours. The question is the same in both situations\u2014does the agreement express the intent of the parties that Wife\u2019s remarriage or Husband\u2019s death shall not terminate Wife\u2019s support?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In determining this question in respect of the agreement before us, pursuant to Civil Code section 1636, we note first that the agreement carefully lists four specific events, any one of which operates to terminate Husband\u2019s continuing support obligation. Assuming that \u201cdeath\u201d and \u201cremarriage\u201d are, on the basis of the aforementioned extrinsic evidence, construed to mean Wife\u2019s death or remarriage, these are: (I) Wife\u2019s death; (2) Wife\u2019s remarriage; (3) its specified equivalent\u2014the commencement of a meretricious relationship;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (4) the expiration of the 20-year period. The death of the Husband is not included among these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">We note secondly that, much like <em>Rheuban, </em>the agreement here expressly provides that Husband\u2019s support <em>obligation is to be </em>both nonmodifiable and nonrevocable and, more specifically, it is to be nonmodifiable \u201cregardless of any change of circumstances, <em>except for the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>contingencies contained herein.'\u2019'' </em>(Italics added.) As just stated these contingencies do not include Husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Accordingly, reasonably construed (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 3542), the parties \u201cotherwise agreed\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code section 4801, subdivision (b). In other words, under <em>Rheuban, </em>the parties did not have to provide specifically that Husband\u2019s support obligation survived his death (cf. <em>In re Marriage of Forgy, </em>63 Cal.App.3d 767, 771 [134 Cal.Rptr. 75]), although such explicit draftsmanship would have undoubtedly obviated this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Consequently, if, based upon the aforementioned extrinsic evidence, the \u201cdeath\u201d referred to is found to be that of Wife, the agreement adequately excludes the Husband\u2019s death as a contingency terminating the support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The judgment is reversed for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Allport, Acting P. J., and Potter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 25, 1977, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 23, 1977.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-12\"> The parties married in 1967 and separated on August 27, 1970.

Do not require my signature on the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">\u201cI have advised Mr. Langmuir not to make such an agreement with his wife for the reason that I have no doubt that it greatly exceeds any obligation that might be imposed upon him by a Court if the case were contested.
