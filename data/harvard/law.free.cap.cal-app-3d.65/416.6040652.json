In January 1975 respondent was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which he suffered bodily injury. An accident report was made and revealed that respondent did not possess automobile liability insurance; he did not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then or since. Upon receiving information of these facts the Department of Motor Vehicles ordered respondent to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>and/or show proof of financial responsibility. Upon his failure to do so, respondent received notice of suspension of his driving privilege. At respondent\u2019s request an administrative hearing was held, and suspension was stayed pending the outcome of the hearing. The referee found that respondent had been in a motor vehicle accident which did not result in property damage in an amount greater than $250 but in which respondent had suffered bodily injury; and that respondent had not established proof of financial responsibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s driving privilege was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Respondent thereupon petitioned for writ of mandate herein, contending, inter alia, that the equal protection provisions of the state and federal Constitutions prohibit the suspension of an uninsured motorist\u2019s license without a prior showing of fault on his part. The trial court concluded that this contention would be correct if the Financial Responsibility Law (Veh. Code, \u00a7 16000 et seq.) applied to respondent in the circumstances, but construed the law to require proof of financial responsibility \u201cwhen a driver involved in an accident causes bodily injuiy or death or the requisite amount of property damage to another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Appellant considers the issue to be whether the Financial Responsibility Law requires proof of financial responsibility when a driver involved in an accident causes injury to himself. Respondent focuses on whether the law constitutionally can require proof of financial responsibility of a driver involved in an accident without some showing of fault on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The former California financial responsibility laws created a fault-based scheme. <em>(Orr </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>71 Cal.2d 220, 226 [77 Cal.Rptr. 816, 454 P.2d 712]; <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>35 Cal.2d 870, 878 [222 P.2d l].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court in <em>Bell v. Burson </em>(1971). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>402 U.S. 535 [29 L.Ed.2d 90, 91 S.Ct. 1586] held that where suspension of a driver\u2019s license depends on fault, due process requires a presuspension hearing which includes consideration of this issue. Our Supreme Court in <em>Rios </em>v. <em>Cozens </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 454 [107 Cal.Rptr. 784, 509 P.2d 696] (originally 7 Cal.3d 792, 797-799 [103 Cal.Rptr. 299, 499 P.2d 979], vacated and remanded [410 U.S. 425 (35 L.Ed.2d 398, 93 S.Ct. 1019)]; on remand [9 Cal.3d 454], the prior opinion was reiterated and reinstated) followed <em>Bell </em>in declaring the California fault-oriented scheme to be constitutionally invalid in the absence of provision for meaningful presuspension hearings. \u201cFollowing <em>Rios, </em>over 20,000 persons have requested such hearings, and the Department of Motor Vehicles, unable to conduct adequate hearings due to a lack of funds and manpower, stayed all proceedings on revocation [mc] until the Legislature either changed the law or provided the funds.\u201d <em>(Review of Selected 1974 California Legislation </em>(1975) 6 Pacific L.J. 335, 340.) In 1972 the Legislature enacted as an interim measure section 16080.5, Vehicle Code, subdivision (a), of which provided that upon receipt by the Department of Motor Vehicles of a request for a hearing regarding prejudgment suspension for failure to prove financial responsibility, provisions of the law relating to suspension would be stayed. (Stats. 1972, ch. 1179, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In 1974, the Legislature repealed the old Vehicle Code division 7, chapter 1, and enacted the present sections 16000 to 16075. (Stats. 1974, ch. 1409, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8.) The Legislature left no doubt that fault was no longer to be at issue when the question of the financial responsibility of a driver involved in a motor vehicle accident arose: \u201cThe Legislature finds that as a result of the difficulty of ascertaining a likelihood of fault in connection with vehicle operation, the number of financially irresponsible motor vehicle owners and operators has increased dramatically. The Legislature further finds that such fault determinations, and the costs associated therewith, do not further the purpose of the financial responsibility laws. Therefore, the Legislature declares that it is the policy of this state that those owning or operating motor vehicles on the streets or highways of this state shall be financially capable of providing monetary protection to those suffering injury to their person or property by reason of the ownership or use of such vehicles <em>without regard to the negligence, liability, carelessness, or culpability of the owners or operators thereof, </em>and further, that such capability shall be deemed a concurrent responsibility of such motor vehicle ownership or operation. The Legislature further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>declares that it is the public policy of this state that those owning or operating motor vehicles on the streets or highways thereof shall evidence such financial capability by the methods specified in this act.\u201d (Stats. 1974, ch. 1409, \u00a7 1.) (Italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Respondent would have us hold that the Legislature impermissibly excluded fault as an issue at the presuspension hearing. Essentially his argument is that by requiring proof of financial responsibility from those drivers involved in accidents but not from those not so involved creates a classificatory scheme which bears no rational relationship to the purpose of the legislation. But respondent\u2019s position is premised on too narrow an appreciation of the Financial Responsibility Law.  The law does not require that only negligent drivers be financially responsible; rather, it requires that \u201cEvery driver of, and owner of, a motor vehicle shall, at all times, maintain in force one of the forms of financial responsibility specified in Section 16021.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 16020.) It is true that only those drivers involved in accidents of the kind described in section 16000 must <em>prove </em>financial responsibility, but involvement in the accident does not create the obligation to be financially responsible, it merely provides the occasion for demonstrating that a preexisting obligation has been satisfied. Thus respondent misstates the purpose of the law as being to assure that \u201cnegligent drivers, i.e., those likely to cause future accidents are financially responsible.\u201d Instead the assurance is that all drivers, negligent or not, are financially responsible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>While one\u2019s driving privilege is an \u201cimportant interest\u201d <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 539 [29 L.Ed.2d 90, 94, 91 S.Ct. 1586]), we do not conceive it to be a \u201cfundamental right\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the kind which demands heightened judicial scrutiny in the face of an equal protection claim..  Nor do we perceive the classification based on involvement in an accident to be in any way \u201csuspect.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   Accordingly, if equal protection analysis is to be employed, we must apply \u201c \u2018The ... basic and conventional standard for reviewing economic and social welfare legislation . . . [which] manifests restraint by the judiciary in relation to the discretionary act of a co-equal branch of government; in so doing it invests legislation involving such differentiated treatment with a presumption of constitutionality and \u201crequires] merely that distinctions drawn by a challenged statute bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose.\u201d <em>(Westbrook </em>v. <em>Mihaly </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 765, 784 . . .)\u2019 <em>(D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 16 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10].)\u201d <em>(Schwalbe </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>16 Cal.3d 514, 517-518 [128 Cal.Rptr. 321, 546 P.2d 1033].)  Respondent must bear the burden of demonstrating the alleged invalidity of the scheme. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 518.) He has failed to do so. The Legislature could have required proof of financial responsibility as a condition precedent to the issuance of a driver\u2019s license <em>(Ex Parte Poresky </em>(1933) 290 U.S. 30, 32 [78 L.Ed. 152, 153, 54 S.Ct. 3]); instead it has required that proof upon involvement in an accident. Effectively, then, the Legislature has opted for a random spot-check on the financial responsibility of California drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In some sense a person may rightly complain that it is unfair for him to have to establish proof of financial responsibility while others, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>involved in an accident, do not. In the same sense it might be unfair to audit the tax return of one person and not of another (Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 7602; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1964) 379 U.S. 48, 57-58 [13 L.Ed.2d 112, 119-120, 85 S.Ct. 248] or to conduct a passenger vehicle equipment inspection on one automobile but not on a second one. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2414.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But \u201cunfair\u201d is not \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d While one might propose other, perhaps better ways to assure that owners and operators of motor vehicles are financially responsible this is not to say that the method adopted by the Legislature is irrational.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   Weighing of the benefits and burdens of alternative plans is a peculiarly legislative task.  As was observed by the court in <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Ott, </em>10 Ore.App. 210 [498 P.2d 815, 822], app. dism. 411 U.S. 912 [36 L.Ed.2d 304, 93 S.Ct. 1554], in which a conclusion similar to our own was reached: \u201cOur role is not to pass on the wisdom of a statutory scheme but only to determine whether there is the constitutionally-required minimum rationality to the classification it creates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Turning to the issue framed by appellant, we initially note that there does not appear to be any reason why the Legislature could not have required proof of financial responsibility where the requisite amount of property damage or bodily injuiy was sustained by the very individual whose driving privilege is at issue. Some states have expressly provided for such a result. The further question, however, is whether the financial responsibility law does so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The section refers to a motor vehicle accident resulting in \u201cdamage to the property of <em>any </em>one person ... or in bodily injury or in the death of any person.\u201d (Italics added.) (\u00a7 16070, subd. (a), Veh. Code.)  Obviously the Department of Motor Vehicles construes this language literally to include bodily injury to any person involved in the accident, rather than to any person other than the driver whose driving privilege is at issue. Even were this construction not entitled to great weight <em>(Holloway </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>35 Cal.2d 220, 226 [217 P.2d 665], cert, den., 340 U.S. 883 [95 L.Ed. 641, 71 S.Ct. 196]), we would reach the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>conclusion.  Inasmuch as we have viewed the occurrence of an accident of certain gravity as the occasion for examining the compliance of the involved drivers with their preexisting statutory obligation to be financially responsible, it is clear that the law is more fully served when proof of financial responsibility is required without respect to who has suffered the injury. Admittedly, the Legislature could have narrowed its sampling of drivers in a number of ways, including one which would exclude respondent and others similarly situated from the category which must prove financial responsibility. It can still do so. But until that time even the person who suffers bodily injury in a motor vehicle accident may be obliged to demonstrate his financial responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Wood, P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 21, 1977, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 23, 1977.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Vehicle Code section 16070, subdivision (a) states: \u201cWhenever a driver involved in an accident described in Section 16000 has failed to establish proof of financial responsibility pursuant to Section 16022, the department shall, if the accident has resulted in damage to the property of any one person in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or in bodily injury or in the death of any person, suspend the privilege of the driver or owner to drive a motor vehicle, including the driving privilege of a nonresident in this state. The suspension shall become effective not earlier than the 76th day after receipt of the first accident report described in Section 16000 by the department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Vehicle Code section 16000 provides: \u201cThe driver of every motor vehicle which is in any manner involved in an accident originating from the operation of a motor vehicle on any street or highway which accident has resulted in damage to the property of any one person in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or in bodily injury or in the death of any person shall within 15 days after the accident, report the accident on a form approved by the department to the office of the department at Sacramento, subject to the provisions of this chapter. A report shall not be required in the event that the motor vehicle involved in the accident was owned or leased by or under the direction of the United States, this state, or any political subdivision of this state or municipality thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Vehicle Code section 16022 in relevant part states: \u201cEvery driver and owner of a motor vehicle involved in an accident described in Section 16000 who fails to prove the existence of financial responsibility as required by <em>Section </em>16020 at the time of such accident, shall within 60 days after such accident, file with the department, and thereafter maintain for a period of three years, proof of such financial responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Respondent concedes that the phrase \u201cany person\u201d as used in section 16000, Vehicle Code to refer to one injured in an automobile accident, encompasses a licensee who is the only person injured. The concession is supported by statutory history. At one time Vehicle Code section 16052 provided that exemption from demonstration of financial responsibility \u201cmay be established by filing evidence with the department indicating: (a) That no injury or damage was caused in the accident to the person or property of any one other than the driver or owner of the vehicle, (b) That at the time of the accident the vehicle was parked, unless the vehicle was parked at a place where the parking was at the time of the accident prohibited under some applicable law or ordinance.\u201d Section 16052, as it then read was repealed in 1974. No corresponding exemption is now included in the financial responsibility law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Proof of financial responsibility may be established as provided in section 16050 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Vehicle Code section 16075, subdivision (b) states: \u201cThe department shall conduct the hearing upon demand of the driver or owner, within 60 days of such demand, to determine the applicability of this chapter to such driver or owner, including a determination of whether: (1) The accident has resulted in property damage of less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250), or bodily injury, or death.

(Eg., <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Tynan </em>(D.Conn. 1969) 307 F.Supp. 1235, 1240; <em>Agee </em>v. <em>Kansas Highway Com\u2019n.

And <em>Bell </em>itself does not resolve the issue. Although the Georgia statute there in question did not by its terms require a showing of fault, the Supreme Court, looking to its substance and not its form, described the Georgia Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act as a \u201cfault-oriented scheme.\u201d (402 U.S. at pp. 540-541 [29 L.Ed.2d at pp. 95-96].)
