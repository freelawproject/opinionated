J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">Defendant Steven Charles Frohner was convicted by a jury of selling or furnishing LSD (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11379, subd. (a); count 3) and acquitted of another count of selling or furnishing LSD (count 1) and one count of selling or furnishing cocaine (count 2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The skeletal facts in this case are not disputed. They involve David Crawley, a Los Angeles County deputy sheriff; Guy. Covert, an informer and heroin dealer, and defendant, a quadriplegic and allegedly a wholesale narcotics dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">On October 2, 1974, Deputy Crawley and Guy Covert went to defendant\u2019s residence to buy LSD. Covert asked defendant whether he had the \u201cAC\u201d\u2014that is, LSD\u2014that defendant was \u201cholding for\u201d Covert. Defendant nodded. Another man, Scott\u2014apparently defendant\u2019s atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>dant\u2014<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> removed an envelope from a dresser and handed the envelope to Deputy Crawley. The envelope contained about 100 tablets of LSD. Crawley handed $65 to Scott, who placed the money in a wallet, and the wallet in a nightstand drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Deputy Crawley then asked defendant whether it would be possible to purchase \u201c10,000 hits of acid\u201d at a later date, and what they would cost. Defendant said that the acid would cost about 35 cents each.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On October 16, deputy Crawley and Guy Covert again went to defendant\u2019s residence. This time a woman, Debra Puma\u2014another attendant\u2014<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was present. Covert asked defendant if he had the gram of cocaine that Covert \u201chad discussed earlier with him.\u201d Defendant said he did and told Covert to get a box from the bedroom closet and to weigh out a gram of white powder on a triple-beam scale in the bedroom. Defendant then told Puma to get a plastic bag for the powder. Deputy Crawley placed $80 on defendant\u2019s chest; Puma took the money, counted it and, on defendant\u2019s instructions, gave Crawley $5 in change which she obtained from a billfold in a nightstand next to defendant\u2019s bed. Covert handed the plastic bag to deputy Crawley.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Crawley discussed with defendant the purchase of liquid LSD in larger quantities. He asked defendant the price for two grams of LSD and was told that it would be $2,400, and that the sale could take place on October 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On October 21, Deputy Crawley returned to defendant\u2019s residence, accompanied by a federal drug enforcement administration agent. Guy Covert did not accompany them. The deputy showed defendant $3,600 in money, but defendant said that he did not then have the liquid acid. Defendant and Crawley then arranged to meet on October 24th.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">On October 24, Crawley, after confirming by telephone that defendant had the acid, went to defendant\u2019s residence. The deputy was wired for sound; fellow narcotics officers surrounded defendant\u2019s house. Guy Covert again did not accompany Crawley. Defendant,, who was in the living room in a motorized wheelchair, directed Crawley to a bedroom closet in which Crawley found a large sack containing a large brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>bottle containing liquid LSD and eyedroppers. On Crawley\u2019s signal, the other deputy sheriffs entered and defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">These facts were not disputed; the defense was entrapment. Defendant testified. The narcotics belonged to Covert, who \u201ccame and went as he pleased\u201d in defendant\u2019s house. Covert had been furnishing defendant with heroin which relieved his pain, and defendant pretended to make sales for Covert because Covert \u201csaid that he would cut me off and put it around that I was to get nothing anywhere, and that he would also physically harm me or make sure that I was being harmed.\u201d Covert told defendant he owed the people with whom he was dealing a favor and could charge a higher price if it appeared that it was defendant who was selling the stuff to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Guy Covert, as noted, was present on October 2 and October 16 (counts 1 and 2). He was not present on October 24, 1974 (count 3). Trial was not held until September 1975. Guy Covert did not testify. He allegedly could not be located. What happened was this:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In October 1972, Covert was convicted of possession of dangerous drugs and was placed on probation. In April 1974, he was arrested for possession of heroin for sale. In September 1974, Covert was arrested by deputy sheriff Kotler\u2014the prosecutor\u2019s investigator in defendant\u2019s case\u2014 and charged with possession .of heroin for sale. Deputy Kotler introduced him to Deputy Crawley. By October 1974, when the events in this case occurred, Covert had three cases pending\u2014the heroin charges and the probation violation. In November 1974, Covert was again arrested for possession of heroin for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Covert, subpoenaed by the district attorney at defendant\u2019s request, testified on January 16, 1975, at the preliminary hearing. He gave his address\u201410825 Burren in Lennox\u2014and a telephone number. He claimed the privilege against self-incrimination on many questions, specifically, on grounds that he had \u201cthree matters presently pending,\u201d and that any questions concerning his \u201cactivities in narcotics sales\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>would seriously incriminate him, and also that answering questions concerning defendant\u2019s case \u201ccould lead to his arrest for this case....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Later, it developed that the address to which Covert testified at the preliminary hearing may have been false even then; only nine days earlier, on Januaiy 6, he had given a different address and phone number to his probation officer, which in turn turned out to be a false address and a disconnected phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In May 1975, Deputy Kotler appeared in court at the request of Covert\u2019s attorney, and told the judge what Covert had done \u201cto aid law enforcement; . . . .\u201d On May 21, three of Covert\u2019s four pending cases were disposed of and he was placed on probation. The fourth case was, apparently, being handled separately. <em>(Supra, </em>fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On September 3, defense counsel informed the court that he had attempted to subpoena Guy Covert at the address which Covert had given when he testified at the preliminary hearing. However, according to the probation department Covert was not at that address. Defense counsel said that the probation department \u201cwould not provide me with any other address.\u201d The phone number Covert had given was disconnected.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Defense counsel said he wanted \u201ca present location for Mr. Covert, because he\u2019s an absolutely, essential witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The prosecutor stated: \u201cI have no idea where he is.\u201d He \u201cwould assume\u201d that he \u201cwould have to go through the same procedure that [defense counsel] would have to go through\u201d and suggested that defense counsel \u201cbe required to do it himself.\u201d The prosecutor admitted that he knew that defense counsel \u201cwas interested in the location of Mr. Covert.\u201d Another prosecutor who had handled defendant\u2019s case also did not know where Covert was. The prosecutor said that Covert \u201cwas present and did testify at the time of the preliminary hearing. We have no information beyond that which is presently available to [defense counsel].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Defense counsel reiterated his statement that Covert was an important witness. The prosecutor asserted that since Covert had appeared at the preliminary hearing, the prosecution had no further duty to attempt to locate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The jury was chosen on September 4. On that date, the prosecutor furnished defense counsel with an address for Covert which Deputy Kotler had obtained from Covert\u2019s attorney. The court stated that it would contact Covert\u2019s probation officer. Defense counsel made clear that neither Covert\u2019s attorney nor Covert\u2019s probation officer would give him any information.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Trial began on September 5. The court said that it had \u201cpersonally called\u201d Covert\u2019s attorney and that Covert\u2019s attorney \u201cindicated that he will make an effort over the weekend to secure Mr. Covert\u2019s appearance here in court.\u201d The court also spoke to Covert\u2019s probation officer, who believed that Covert was in violation of his probation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and asked the probation officer to prepare a report for the consideration of the sentencing judge in Covert\u2019s case, suggesting that the probation officer might \u201crequest that a bench warrant issue for Mr. Covert\u2019s arrest and declare that he was in violation of probation and by that method attempt to secure Mr. Covert\u2019s presence here in court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">On September 8, the court reported that Covert\u2019s attorney had phoned to say that he had been unable to contact Covert. The court also learned that the probation officer had presented to the court in Covert\u2019s case a document that would indicate Covert to be a deserter, and that a bench warrant was issued that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">By September 10, the court, defense counsel and the prosecutor considered using Covert\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing. However, after the court edited out all references to Covert\u2019s claims of self-incrimination, defense counsel concluded that the testimony\u2014shorn of answers to questions concerning Covert\u2019s involvement in narcotics\u2014would be useless and confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">As noted, Covert did not testify at the trial. However, on September 16, two court days after the jury had begun deliberations, defense counsel, having learned\u2014apparently through the court\u2014that Covert was in custody, moved to reopen the trial. Covert had been found because, according to the court\u2019s information, \u201cthe officer, Deputy Kotler, went by there and picked him up, and Mr. Covert had been living in Venice, not where his attorney thought he was.\u201d Covert had been arrested September 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The court denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">A short time later, the jury returned with its not guilty verdict on count 1, resumed deliberations, requested the next morning that the instruction on entrapment be re-read, and then, about an hour later, returned with its verdicts of not guilty on count 2 and guilty on count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The facts will be fleshed out in the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Defendant\u2019s chief contention is that the failure of the prosecutor to maintain contact with Guy Covert, a material defense witness, deprived him of a fair trial. In connection with this core contention, he also contends, that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct during closing argument; and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to reopen the trial when Covert was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\n<em>Duty to Locate Informer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The rules are clear.  \u201cWhen an informer is a material witness on the issue of guilt, the People must disclose his identity or incur a dismissal. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Cal.3d 847, 851 [83 Cal.Rptr. 586, 464 P.2d 42].) \u201cIdentity\u201d is not limited to the informer\u2019s name, but includes \u201call pertinent information which might assist the defense to locate him.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Although the state is not required to produce the informer \u201cthe police and the district attorney\u201d must \u201cundertake reasonable efforts in good faith to locate the informer so that either party or the court itself.. . could, if it so desired, subpena him as a witness.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 853 [Italics omitted].)  Finally, the defendant is not required to show that he cannot readily obtain the information through his own efforts. \u201cIf investigation [to locate the informer] is necessary at a later date it is still better undertaken by the prosecution both because of its greater investigatory .resources and its superior knowledge of, and contacts with, the informer.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 854.) This duty applies whether the informer is an amateur or a professional. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Goliday, </em>8 Cal.3d 771, 779-781 [106 Cal.Rptr. 113, 505 P.2d 537].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The duty applies only where the informer is potentially a material witness on the issue of guilt. There must be a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the informer\u2019s testimony could exculpate the defendant. (E.g., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>38 Cal.App.3d 412, 418-421 [112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 485] and cases discussed.) \u201cThe police bear no duty to obtain information about a person who is not a material witness, who \u2018simply points the finger of suspicion toward a person who has violated the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Goliday, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 771, 782.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Attorney General recognizes the rule but contends that as to <em>count </em>3\u2014the only count <em>of </em>which defendant was convicted\u2014Guy Covert was not a material witness because he was not present at the time of the count 3 sale, and, therefore, there was no reasonable possibility that Covert\u2019s testimony could exonerate defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">On this record, the Attorney General\u2019s contention is erroneous. Defendant was, of course, separately charged for the transactions on October 2, October 16 and October 24. However, the People\u2019s theory from start to finish\u2014and we set forth in the footnote some of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument\u2014was that defendant was a major dealer and that the three transactions were part of defendant\u2019s routine business.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Similarly defendant\u2019s theoiy from start to finish was that Covert\u2014who was concededly acting on behalf of the police\u2014was actually the owner of the narcotics involved in all three transactions. In this dual capacity\u2014owner and police informer\u2014Covert had forced<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>engage in a series of sales by threatening him with physical harm, as well as withdrawal of his source of heroin. The facts relevant to this defense which, if believed, clearly amount to entrapment, are not the occurrences on October 24, but the dealings between defendant and Covert prior to any of the three sales in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The Attorney General next contends that even if Covert was a material witness, since he asserted the privilege against self-incrimination at the preliminary hearing it was \u201csheer speculation\u201d that if produced as a witness at trial he would testify that he owned the contraband and was forcing defendant to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We disagree. Granted that had Covert been a witness at the trial, Fifth Amendment problems were waiting in the wings, there are several reasons why this did not excuse the People\u2019s apparent indifference to Covert\u2019s availability.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">First: In view of the general rule that a party who acts in good faith is entitled to have a witness claim his privilege against self-incrimination on a question by question basis <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shipe, </em>49 Cal.App.3d 343, 349 [122 Cal.Rptr. 701]), defendant was entitled to have Covert in court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We certainly cannot conclusively presume that Covert would have claimed the privilege at the trial or that he would have claimed it with respect to all the questions which triggered the claims at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Second: Even if Covert had asserted the privilege at the trial, it is apparent that several of the bases for his claims at the preliminary hearing were no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">By the time of trial the three pending cases to which he referred at the preliminary hearing were resolved. <em>(Rebstock </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>146 Cal. 308, 313-314 [80 P. 65]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>117 Cal.App.2d 649, 651 [256 P.2d 577]; compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Shipe, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.3d 343, 349; <em>People </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>14 Cal.App.3d 739, 743 [93 Cal.Rptr. 260].) The fourth case (see <em>supra, </em>fn. 4) was, apparently,- not included in Covert\u2019s self-incrimination claim and may or may not have provided a basis for such a claim with respect to evidence relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Third: At the preliminary hearing Covert may have waived his privilege with respect to his involvement with defendant, or at least have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>come perilously close to doing so. He testified freely that he twice accompanied Crawley on a narcotics investigation. He obviously knew that defendant was in possession of and selling narcotics.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is at least a substantial question whether he could draw a Fifth Amendment curtain across an explanation of the basis of his knowledge. The privilege may be used \u201cto suppress the truth, but that does not mean that it is a privilege to garble it; . . . .\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>St. Pierre </em>(2d Cir. 1942) 132 F.2d 837, 840 [147 A.L.R. 240]; see also <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1951) 340 U.S. 367, 372-373 [95 L.Ed. 344, 348-349, 71 S.Ct. 348, 19 A.L.R.2d 378]; <em>Zonver </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 613, 621-622 [76 Cal.Rptr. 10].) Certainly we cannot accept as an axiom that no waiver would have taken place, had Covert testified in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Besides, on the People\u2019s theory of the case\u2014that Covert had nothing to do with the narcotics sold by defendant\u2014Covert was clearly entitled to statutory immunity under section 11367 of the Health and Safety Code. Although this immunity would not apply if Covert, in addition to being a police agent, was actually the undisclosed principal of defendant <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sipress, </em>51 Cal.App.3d 98, 101-102 [123 Cal.Rptr. 884]), it hardly lies in the People\u2019s mouth to suggest that Covert was not entitled to the statutory immunity because their theory of the case was factually incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Fourth: Regardless of whether defendant had a right that Covert be given statutory immunity by the People (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1324; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Beyea, </em>38 Cal.App.3d 176, 203-204 [113 Cal.Rptr. 254]), the prosecution might have been hard put to deny a defense request for immunity, since on the People\u2019s theory of the case Covert had committed no crime in connection with defendant\u2019s sales to Crawley.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In sum, it is extremely questionable whether, had Covert been available, a Fifth Amendment claim with respect to the defense of entrapment would have been valid. Certainly, the mere possibility that it might have been, did not excuse the People from complying with their obligations under <em>People </em>v. <em>Goliday, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 771, 778-782, and <em>Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 847, 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The Attorney General contends that, even assuming that Covert was a material witness, the prosecution made \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to locate him. That assertion defies a record which shows that the prosecution did next to nothing to assure that Covert would be available for defendant\u2019s trial. The prosecution had ample notice: it knew, as early as Januaiy 1975, that defendant wanted Covert as a witness. Nor did it lack the opportunity to keep track of Covert: On this record, until May 21, 1975, Covert was subject to the prosecutor\u2019s good will. We know from Covert\u2019s superior court files that, in fact, he then appeared in court on the fourth case\u2014a matter of which the prosecutor should have been aware\u2014on May 30, July 9, July 24 and August 11, 1975. <em>{Supra, </em>fn. 4.) On September 4, the prosecutor did furnish defendant\u2019s attorney with an address for Covert, but this was the last prosecution effort to locate Covert for defendant, who could not be found at that address. All further efforts to locate Covert were made by the court and these were unsuccessful. It was only after a bench warrant had been issued in another proceeding that deputy Kotler went out to an address in Venice and picked Covert up.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">In <em>Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 847, 853 and footnote 10, the court noted that what is reasonable will depend on the facts in each case: \u201cIf the informer has a regular abode and place of employment, simply obtaining his address and telephone number may suffice; if he is transient, or conceals his address, the law enforcement agency probably should make some arrangement for maintaining close communication with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Covert was an individual likely to conceal his whereabouts. He was a known narcotics dealer whose addresses changed rapidly. His probation officer could not keep track of him. He had betrayed defendant and defendant\u2019s friends. If Covert could not be located at the time of trial, that was due at least in part to the prosecution\u2019s failure to \u201cmake some arrangement for maintaining close communication with him.\u201d <em>(Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 847, 853, fn. 10.) If, however, Covert could be located on September 3 through 12, at the location where Deputy Kotler found him on September 15, the prosecution\u2019s failure to make Covert available in a timely fashion would suggest \u201ca deliberate evasion of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>(Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 853.) Either way, the prosecution failed in its duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The reason for the rule that requires the prosecutor to make reasonable efforts to locate an informer is clear in this case. First, the prosecution was in a position to keep track of Covert through his court appearances in the other pending case or cases, of which the prosecutor should have been aware. Second, defense counsel could obtain no information from Covert\u2019s probation officer and his attorney while the prosecutor had no difficulty in obtaining information from those sources. The best source, to whom defendant had no access, was apparently deputy Kotler, the prosecutor\u2019s investigator in defendant\u2019s case. (Compare <em>Bellizzi </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>12 Cal.3d 33, 36-37 [115 Cal.Rptr. 52, 524 P.2d 148].)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">However, the real issue in this case is whether the prosecution\u2019s failure to undertake reasonable efforts in good faith to locate Covert substantially prejudiced defendant. We note first that defendant\u2019s theory was not entirely implausible. The prosecution\u2019s case was that Covert, a known drug dealer, was working with the police and introduced Deputy Crawley to defendant, a major dealer. Defendant\u2019s defense was that Covert set him up\u2014entrapped him\u2014and used defendant\u2019s need for heroin and immobility as the threat. If defendant was running a narcotics business, he placed an unusual amount of trust in his customers. On October 16, Covert\u2014in theory only a customer\u2014was permitted to weigh out the cocaine himself, and on October 24, deputy Crawley was instructed by defendant to help himself to the LSD. On the prosecutor\u2019s theory, defendant was running a business in which wholesale prices ran $75 a gram\u2014that is, l/28th of an ounce\u2014on the honor system. On defendant\u2019s theory, however, the operation becomes more plausible: he did not care whether he was cheated; the merchandise was not his.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Second, the prejudice to defendant must be considered in light of other errors asserted by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">During the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the following occurred. The prosecutor was speculating concerning Covert\u2019s motives: \u201cA man in [Covert\u2019s] position probably has to figure . . . the sooner I can . . . convince them that I\u2019m cooperating, and giving them somebody bigger than I, the quicker I\u2019m going to get off this thing.\u201d The reason why\u2014 . .. [1\u00cd] \u201c[Defense Counsel]: I object to the total line of argument as conjecture, speculation as to what Guy Covert\u2019s intentions were. Guy Covert should have been here. [1] \u201cThe Court: . . . Overruled. [If] \u201c[Prosecutor] : <em>Counsel has subpoenas. If he wanted him here so you could look at him, he could have had him here. </em>Okay. [1] \u201c[Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Counsel]: Your Honor, I take objection. [|] \u201cThe Court: Overruled. You brought it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Defense counsel\u2019s objection should have been sustained. The prosecutor\u2019s comment was inexcusable. He knew that subpoenas could not be served on Covert. The only apparent reason for the comment was an improper one: to suggest to the jury that defendant had purposely failed to call Covert as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We would be inclined to think that the prosecution\u2019s failure to make reasonable efforts to locate Covert, coupled with the grossly improper comment by the prosecutor in closing argument, substantially prejudiced defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">However, under the circumstances, the trial court\u2019s refusal to reopen the case when Covert was finally located was, independently, serious error. Relevant to an assessment of the trial court\u2019s ruling is the course of the juiy\u2019s deliberations. After selecting a foreman on September 12, the jury was excused until the next court day, September 15. After further instructions the jury began deliberations at about 10 a.m., and returned at about 3:30 p.m., to request that some instructions be reread. At that time, after twelve ballots, the vote was divided seven to five. The foreman said, \u201cWe are a hung juiy, I guess, at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The next day, September 16, at the jury\u2019s request a considerable number of instructions were reread: CALJIC No. 12.02\u2014furnishing or giving away a controlled substance; CALJIC No. 12.32\u2014amount sufficient to constitute a crime; CALJIC No. 12.33\u2014proof of strength unnecessary; CALJIC No. 17.02\u2014each count charges a separate and distinct offense. The jury deliberated for about three and one half hours and that afternoon returned with a not guilty verdict on count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">On Wednesday, September 17, the jurors wanted \u201cthe law regarding entrapment read to them; . . . .\u201d Then, after deliberating for about an hour and a half, they returned with the verdicts of not guilty on count 2, and guilty on count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">It was just before the jury had brought in the not guilty verdict on count 1, that defense counsel learned that Covert had been arrested and was in custody. As noted, he moved unsuccessfully to reopen the trial to permit Covert to be called as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>We, of course, recognize the rule relied on by the Attorney General that the decision to permit a party to reopen its case is \u201calmost wholly within the discretion of the trial judge . . . [whose] ruling must stand in the absence of a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>258 Cal.App.2d 368, 377 [65 Cal.Rptr. 867].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>8 Cal.App.3d 359, 383, 384 [87 Cal.Rptr. 394], in which the court held that the trial court had abused its discretion in not permitting the defendant to reopen his case after jury deliberations had begun, the court noted the factors to be considered in reviewing the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion: the stage the proceedings have reached when the motion is made; the diligence shown by the moving parly in discovering the new evidence; the prospect that the jury would accord it undue emphasis; and the significance of the evidence. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 383.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">We can understand the trial court\u2019s reluctance to reopen the case after the juiy had begun deliberations. Nevertheless, defendant had wanted Covert all along, and the jury\u2019s difficulty in reaching a verdict suggested that it felt that something was missing. Had Covert testified, his testimony may well have been decisive one way or another. Thus, it would have been difficult for the jury to accord his testimony \u201cundue\u201d emphasis. Covert was, after all, not some last-minute alibi witness dredged up by the defendant. He was a lurking presence throughout this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The Attorney General makes much of defense counsel\u2019s asserted lack of diligence. He relies on the court\u2019s statement that it had \u201cthought all along that you [defense counsel] could have made much more of a substantial effort yourself, ... to get him here, which you didn\u2019t do.\u201d It seems that the trial court, which properly took credit for furnishing defense counsel with the information that Covert was in custody, had overlooked that even its own efforts were to no avail in procuring Covert\u2019s presence or in obtaining information that would lead to his presence, and that it was Deputy Kotler who, when properly instructed to do so, located Covert and brought him in.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">We recognize also that the trial court may have suspected that all defense counsel wanted was reversible error. If so, granting leave to reopen would have called his bluff. All concerned would have known veiy quickly whether defendant\u2019s professed desire to have Covert as a witness was based on a hunch that Covert would never appear or on the hope that Covert would tell the truth, and that the truth would benefit defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>In all, we must conclude that the prosecution\u2019s failure to make reasonable efforts to locate Covert and the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow Covert to be called as a witness severely prejudiced defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Stephens, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence was granted with respect to counts 4 through 6, and these counts were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">William Randolf Scott, charged with defendant on count 1, pleaded guilty and was placed on probation with jail time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Defendant Debra Ann Puma was jointly charged and tried with defendant on count 2.

In case A-187460, involving a November 1974 arrest, Covert\u2019s preliminary hearing was held the same day as defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing. It is not clear whether Covert included that case in indicating those pending against him; or when defendant or the trial court in defendant\u2019s case learned of the case. Covert pleaded guilty in A-187460 on September 16, 1975, shortly after defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The probation violation in cases A. 012254, A. 186331, A. 187195\u2014disposed of May 21, 1975\u2014was Covert\u2019s failure to report to his probation officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">After informing the jury that the .trial court would tell them \u201cthat yo\u00fa have to consider each one of these counts individually,\u201d the prosecutor then reviewed the facts of the case. \u201c[Wjith respect to October 2nd,-. . . Covert, along with Deputy Crawley, came into [defendant\u2019s] bedroom for the purpose of purchasing LSD, 100 tabs of LSD.... [H] At that point in time [after the deal was consummated] there\u2019s some discussion. Crawley says to [defendant] something to the effect that, \u2018I\u2019d like to get 10,000 hits of acid.\u2019 . . . \u2018What\u2019s the price going to be?\u2019... [defendant] says, \u201835 cents. If I buy in volume, you get a discount.\u2019 ... [1] At that point they discuss some kind of a future transaction. . . . [Crawley] comes back later on the 16th of October. The informant is there again. . . . There\u2019s a conversation at that particular point in time as to again a future purchase of LSD. And Crawley at that point is asking not for individual hits of acid, individual doses, .... He\u2019s talking now about liquid grams. . . . [1] And there\u2019s some more conversation, which [defendant] tells Crawley, \u2018Look, you come over on Monday, October 21, 1974, and I\u2019ll have the stuff. You bring the money. We\u2019ll do it.\u2019 [H] On October 21st Crawley comes over, pursuant to this prior arrangement,.... [Defendant says] \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have the stuff,... get back to me on October 24th.\u2019...[!]... What happens on the 24th? [H] [Crawley] goes over to [defendant\u2019s] house. He walks in.

And clearly that\u2019s the case here when he had those things in various places in his room, was directing, first of all, Scott on the 2nd as to where the stuff was, was directing Covert on the 16th as to. where it was, was directing Crawley on the 24th as to where the stuff was.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">We recognize that Covert\u2019s threats alone would not have amounted to legal duress or coercion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lo Cicero, </em>71 Cal.2d 1186, 1190-1191 [80 Cal.Rptr. 913, 459 P.2d 241].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b127-10\">This is not to say that defendant had the right that Covert claim the privilege in front of the jury; he did not. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 749, 758-759 [114 Cal.Rptr. 545]; but cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 798, 803-804 [95 Cal.Rptr. 146].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Covert admitted that he reluctantly agreed to cooperate with the police after his attorney had talked to Officer Kotler and was told that by cooperating Covert would avoid going to state prison.
