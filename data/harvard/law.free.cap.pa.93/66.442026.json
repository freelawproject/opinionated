Houston, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>an attachment execution was issued and served upon Gowen and others, trading as The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, as garnishees. The answers of tho garnishees to the interrogatories filed admitted that Houston, the defendant in the judgment, owned a seat in the stock exchange, against which there were no claims by the members of that body at the time the attachment was issued, but they alleged that claims had since been presented, and that Houston held his seat subject to the following conditions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">\u201c No election of new members shall take place until two weeks at least have elapsed after- the application or nomination shall have been laid before the stock exchange, and the applicant shall then, upon a favorable report of the standing committee, or where, if unfavorable, the committee\u2019s report has been reversed by the stock exchange, as provided in sect. 8, be balloted for and admitted to membership, provided that not more than fifteen black-balls be cast against him, a.nd that not less than fifty balls arc cast.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-7\">\u201c Any member shall have the right to sell Ms membership subject to the following conditions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">\u201c When a member wishes to sell his membership, tho name of the proposed purchaser shall be submitted to the standing committee, and on the approval of two-thirds of said committee, and after the usual two weeks\u2019 notice to the exchange, the applicant shall be balloted for, and if elected, the transfer shall be made, provided the member selling has no unsettled contracts with or claims against him by any member of the stock exchange, for transactions arising in or relating to the business of banking or a stock or exchange broker.

Houston, the seat belonging to him not being property, except between members of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-12\">Two rules were taken, one by the plaintiff, against the garnishees for judgment on the answers, and the other by the garnishees on the plaintiff to show cause why the attachment should not be dissolved. After argument of both rules, the court discharged the first, and made the last absolute, \u201c so far as the seat or membership of the defendant in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange is concerned.\u201d Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a written admission that the garnishee was not in possession of any property of the defendant, liable to attachment sur judgment, other than the defendant\u2019s seat or membership in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Whereupon, on motion of counsel for garnishees, the court, Allison, P. J., made absolute the rule to dissolve the attachment, in an opinion, saying : \u201c The words of the constitution of the stock exchange show that the seat, or right of membership, is property, since it is held as security for payment of debts due members of the board. But it is the property of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange until all questions of claims against its owner by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>members of the board are settled. Until we have some means of knowing that all such claims have been fully settled, or that none exist, we do not think an attachment could be lawfully issued against the board, or the privilege sold.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-4\">The plaintiff took this writ, alleging that the court erred in making absolute the rule dissolving the attachment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-5\"><em>P. F. Rothermel, Jr., </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN\">The seat of a member of the' Philadelphia Stock Exchange is property and not a mere personal right. By the terms of the constitution of the stock exchange, which forms the contract between that institution and the owners of seats therein, it is provided that \u201c any member shall - have the right to sell his membership subject to the following conditions.\u201d This provision of itself determines that it is property; the fact that the seat is the subject of purchase and sale, that it may be transferred from one person to another, conclusively establishes that it is not a mere personal right. In fact the point has been recently decided in the United States Supreme Court, in Hyde <em>v. </em>Woods, 4 Otto 523, where the learned judge, who delivered the opinion of the court, speaks of a seat in the San Eran cisco Stock and Exchange Board, subject to conditions similar\u2018to those attached to the one in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-6\">If the seat is personal property it would seem to follow as a necessary consequence, that it is liable to execution. The policy of the law is certainly opposed to exempting the property of a debtor from execution. The only question therefore remaining to be considered is, whether the conditions annexed to ownership are such as to defeat this natural implication. The effect of these provisions is simply to render the seat a pledge in the hands of the stock exchange, as security for liability of the owner to that body and the other members of it; and it is by reason of this effect that under the Act of Assembly the seat is the subject of attachment-execution: Act of June 16th 1836, Purd. Dig. 630, pl. 32,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-7\">N. <em>Dubois Miller, A. Sydney Biddle </em>and <em>George W. Biddle, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUa\">It cannot be contended that the purely personal privilege of belonging to a certain club or association of individuals for any purpose, whether of a- social or business character, is in any sense property which is liable to be taken in execution. The constitution does not say that a member shall be entitled to the proceeds of a seat. It distinctly says that \u201c the proceeds of the seat, if sold, shall belong to its owner\u2019s creditors who are members of the stock exchange;\u201d and the only property that the member can have at all is the balance of the proceeds, if any such exists. There may never be any balance; then there will never be any money due the retiring member, and no debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>which can possibly be attached. The seat has not been sold. Clearly, then, there is no balance of money due, no debt owing to the debtor. Have the members of the stock exchange any of his property, any goods or chattels pawned or pledged with them ? The record discloses none. Has he any right of action under any contract ? No ; the only contract that exists is one by which they mutually agree that for each other\u2019s benefit they will trade in certain ways and with certain people, and the contract has not yet been broken; there is not, therefore, even a right to damages for breach of contract. The decision of the lower court is in keeping with the line of decisions: Evans et al. <em>v. </em>Wister, 1 W. N. C. 181; Singerly <em>v. </em>Johnson, 3 Id. 341; Leech <em>v. </em>Leech, Id. 542. This case is ruled by Thompson <em>v. </em>Adams, <em>ante, </em>p. 255.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The judgment of the Supremo Court was entered, Februarv 24th 1879,</p>\n<author id=\"b71-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A7b\">\u2014 0A seat in the board of brokers is not property subject to execution in any form. It is a mere personal privilege, perhaps more accurately, a license- to buy and sell at the meetings of the board. It certainly could not be levied on and sold under a fi. fa. The sheriff\u2019s vendee would acquire no title which he could enforce, nor is it within either the words or the spirit of the Act of June 16th 1836, sect. 35, Pamph. L. 767, providing for attachment on judgment. Whether the proceeds of the sale of the seat in the hands of the treasurer of the board, and payable to the defendant, according to the regulations and by-laws of the board, could be thus reached is an entirely different question. This, and no more, is what we understand to have been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, in Hyde <em>v. </em>Wood, 4 Otto 525, where Mr. Justice Miller says, \u201cIf there had been left in the hands of the defendants any balance after paying the debts due to the members of the board, that balance might have been recovered by the assignee\u201d in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Order dissolving the attachment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
