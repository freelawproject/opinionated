Accordingly, the arrest and search incident thereto was illegal, and the contraband found as a result of that seizure must be suppressed. Therefore, it is unnecessary for us to render a decision on the remaining issues. Nonetheless, we have reviewed the arguments and conclude they are without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The issue presented by this appeal concerns the validity of the police officer\u2019s investigatory stop of defendant under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 20 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 889 (1968). Defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of his arrest and search incident to that arrest is made under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 <em>U.S. </em>471, 487-88, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>407, 417, 9 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 441, 455 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The facts developed at the suppression hearing were presented through the State\u2019s sole witness, Morristown Police Officer Joseph Leeper. At about 1:30 a.m. on April 15, 1997, Morristown Lieutenant James Wilcox contacted Officer Leeper, stating that he had received an anonymous telephone call at police headquarters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The caller said \u201cthat three black males\u201d were involved in \u201cnarcotics transactions.\u201d The caller also stated that \u201ctwo ... were standing in front of 15 [Martin Luther King Avenue],\u201d and \u201ca third male ... was on the pay phone at Number 60 Abbett Avenue,\u201d the site of Dean Tire Company (Dean Tire). The anonymous caller also said that one of the men was \u201csupposedly car[ry]ing a .22 caliber handgun.\u201d No descriptions of the men other than their race were given, and no information concerning the identity or the past reliability of the informant, if he or she was known, was conveyed by Lieutenant Wilcox to Officer Leeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Dean Tire is a tire center with ancillary gas pump facilities on the premises. It is located in a residential, low income neighborhood, populated primarily by black and Hispanic residents. No evidence was presented that the area was a high-crime or high-drug area. A public pay phone is located in the rear of its parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Acting on the dispatch from Lieutenant Wilcox, Officer Leeper immediately met with the other patrol officers on duty in the area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>during the 5:30 p.m. to 4:15 a.m. shift, and after a brief meeting, he directed several of them to respond to 15 Martin Luther King Avenue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Then, he and Officer Joseph Lodato proceeded to Dean Tire. According to Officer Leeper, \u201c[they] didn\u2019t get handgun calls every single day,\u201d and he was concerned because \u201cthere was a mention of a handgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The officers arrived at Dean Tire about 1:45 a.m. The tire center was closed. The lot was \u201cdark\u201d except for a \u201cdull, yellowish\u201d street light illuminating the pay phone. Both the lot and the street were empty. As Officer Leeper pulled into the parking lot, he observed \u201ca black male\u201d using the pay phone and decided to make a \u201cfield inquiry.\u201d According to Officer Leeper, based on his ten years of experience as a Morristown police officer, he thought it was \u201codd\u201d for someone to be using the telephone at that late hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Officer Leeper stopped his car fifteen to twenty feet from the phone. Officer Lodato parked \u201cdirectly alongside.\u201d Both officers then \u201cwalked over to the gentleman on the phone [later identified as defendant Michael Richards, and] observed that he was ... actively involved in a conversation.\u201d Officer Leeper could see both of defendant\u2019s hands, neither of which revealed a gun. There was no indication that either of the officers recognized defendant or knew him from other street encounters. Officer Leeper then \u201casked [defendant] if he didn\u2019t mind, could he hang up the phone. I\u2019d like to talk to [you].\u201d Defendant, who had his back turned to the officers, glanced back at them and continued to talk for a moment before hanging up the telephone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Officer Leeper then told defendant that they had received an \u201canonymous phone call[] that there was a black male on the pay phone at Dean Tire, in addition to two other black males in front of 15 Martin Luther King Avenue[,] and that the three men were allegedly involved in narcotics transactions, and that one of them was supposedly armed with a handgun.\u201d Defendant did not react, and there is no evidence that he made any \u201cfurtive gestures\u201d or that he appeared nervous. Officer Leeper asked defendant for identification, a request which the officer described as \u201croutine.\u201d Once again, defendant did not respond. He just \u201cstared at [the officer],\u201d without saying or doing anything. Officer Leeper thought it was \u201codd\u201d that he would not \u201cat least give [him] some explanation\u201d and \u201cstrange that he didn\u2019t answer the question at all, and [he] got a little alarmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">As a result, Officer Leeper asked defendant \u201cif he [would] mind stepping over to my [patrol] car and put his hands on the hood ... [because he] wanted to conduct a pat-down search of his outer clothing.\u201d At that point, defendant moved his left hand toward his pants pocket, but Officer Lodato stopped him by \u201cgently\u201d placing his hand on defendant\u2019s forearm. Officer Lodato then asked defendant to \u201ckeep [his] hands in plain sight where we [could] see them please, and place them on the hood of the car.\u201d Officer Leeper explained to defendant that he was concerned for his safety and wanted to conduct a pat-down. Officer Lodato then released defendant\u2019s forearm, but defendant did not comply. Instead, he moved his hand toward his pants pocket again, causing Officer Leeper to become concerned that he was reaching for a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">At that point, defendant broke his silence, stating \u201c[W]hat for, why are you bothering me.\u201d As he spoke, he began to get excited and to raise his voice, shouting \u201c[W]hat for, why, why do I have to do this, why do I have to put my hands on the hood of the car.\u201d Officer Leeper asked him to lower his voice because they were in a residential neighborhood, and warned that if he did not, he would arrest him for disorderly conduct. Defendant continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u201cshout and yell.\u201d Officer Leeper again warned him to keep his voice down, but defendant \u201crefused to calm down.\u201d As a result, Officer Leeper advised defendant he was under arrest. Upon hearing this, defendant again reached for his pants pocket and the officers grabbed his arms and handcuffed him. The entire encounter took three to five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">After his arrest, the officers searched him. <em>Cf. State v. Dangerfield, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>446, 795 A.2d 250 (2002). No gun was found in defendant\u2019s possession but the police discovered sixty-three small bags of cocaine and four small bags of marijuana inside defendant\u2019s pants pocket. Laboratory analysis later showed that these bags contained 18.36 grams of cocaine and 9.54 grams of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Defendant did not testify at the suppression hearing. The judge summarized his findings of fact based upon the testimony of Officer Leeper which was \u201cessentially uncontradicted.\u201d Relying on <em>State v. Sharpless, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 715 A.2d 333 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>547, 725 A.2d 12 (1999), and <em>State in the Interest of C.B., </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 719 A.2d 206 (App.Div.1998),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the judge found that even though the telephone tip from the unknown informant was not corroborated, there was sufficient reasonable suspicion for a <em>Terry </em>stop and even a \u201cfrisk\u201d of defendant, had defendant\u2019s unruly conduct not intervened making the \u201cfrisk\u201d unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The judge determined that, in light of the totality of the circumstances, there was a reasonable basis for the stop. As factors supporting his decision, the judge pointed out defendant\u2019s silence in response to the officer\u2019s advice that he had received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>report that a black male in the phone booth supposedly had a gun and defendant\u2019s non-response to the officer\u2019s request for identification. As an additional suspicious circumstance, the judge indicated defendant\u2019s attempt to place his hand in his pocket after the officer told him that he wanted to conduct a pat-down.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that \u201cthe investigatory initial stop of the defendant was not based on any reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and, as such, was unconstitutional.\u201d He, therefore, maintains that any evidence found as a result of the stop should have been excluded as the fruit of an unlawful search. Specifically, defendant asserts that there was no suspicious activity occurring; defendant\u2019s hands were visible and there was no sign of a weapon; defendant did not appear nervous; no drug0 transaction was observed; police did not recognize defendant from any previous encounters; defendant did not try to flee the scene; and there was no indication this was a high-crime area. He further indicates that because this was a low income, black and Hispanic neighborhood, a black man on a pay phone late at night was not out of the ordinary. In addition, defendant also implicitly argues that he was not required to respond to the officer\u2019s questions; indeed he had a constitutional right to refuse to respond, and that his silence could not be used as a ground for concluding he was armed and dangerous to justify a frisk for a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The State counters that the totality of the circumstances as recited by the motion judge satisfies the threshold requirements for an investigatory stop in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">As always, the starting point of our analysis is the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution. These provisions protect citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures by requiring a warrant issued upon probable cause unless the search or seizure qualifies under one of the exceptions of the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Maryland, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>471, 482, 771 A.2d 1220 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>(2001) (citing <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>218, 219, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2041, 2043, 36 L.Ed.2d 854, 858 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The present case involves the \u201cprotective stop\u201d exception to the warrant requirement under <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 1, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1868, 20 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 889. <em>See State v. Roach, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>19, 23, 796 A.2d 214 (2002).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To justify invoking this exception, the State must demonstrate that the police had an objective articulable and reasonable basis to believe he was armed and dangerous to justify the \u201cstop.\u201d <em>Roach, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 23, 796 A.2d 214 see <em>also State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 499-500, 517 A.2d 859 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In <em>Terry, </em>the Court held that \u201ca police officer may in appropriate circumstances ... approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest,\u201d and that the officer may conduct a reasonable search for weapons if he is \u201cjustified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others.\u201d <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 22, 24, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1880, 1881, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906, 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u201c[T]he level of reasonable suspicion necessary to justify an investigatory stop is \u2018something less than the probable cause standard needed to support an arrest.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Arthur, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8, 691 A.2d 808 (1997) (citing <em>State v. Thomas, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>673, 678, 542 A.2d 912 (1988)). \u201cThere must be \u2018some objective manifestation that the suspect was or is involved in criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). In evaluating the facts giving rise to the officer\u2019s suspicion of criminal activity, courts are to give weight to \u201cthe officer\u2019s knowledge and experience\u201d as well as \u201crational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>inferences that could be drawn from the facts objectively and reasonably viewed in light of the officer\u2019s expertise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 691 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The determination whether the police have the reasonable suspicion required to justify an investigatory stop depends on the totality of the circumstances known at the time. <em>State v. Stovall, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>346, 361, 788 A.2d 746 (2002). In evaluating the circumstances surrounding the police-citizen encounter, the reviewing court \u201cmust balance the State\u2019s interest in effective law enforcement against the individual\u2019s right to be free from unwarranted and/or overbearing police intrusions.\u201d <em>State v. Caldwell, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>452, 459, 730 A.2d 352 (1999) (quoting <em>Davis, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 517 A.2d 859).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In making this evaluation, the court should consider an anonymous tip as a factor in evaluating the circumstances because \u201ca descriptive tip by an informant may contribute to a reasonable objective and particularized suspicion to serve as the basis for an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Stovall, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 361, 788 A.2d 746; <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 467, 730 A.2d 352 (Handler, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">However, an unverified and uncorroborated informant\u2019s tip does not by itself justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>See Caldwell, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 460-61, 730 A.2d 352; <em>see also Alabama v. White, </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>325, 329, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2412, 2416, 110 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>301, 308 (1990); <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>143, 147, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1921, 1923, 32 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>612, 617-18 (1972). And that is so even if the tip is of a gun in the possession of a suspect. <em>See Florida v. J.L., </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>266, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In <em>J.L., </em>the United States Supreme Court declined to adopt a \u201cman with a gun exception\u201d to the rule of individualized reasonable suspicion to \u201cstop and frisk\u201d and ordered the evidence suppressed. <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 272, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1379, 146 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 261. We rely on the holding of <em>J.L. </em>in discussing the issues in this case because the federal and state standards for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>assessing the reasonableness of investigatory stops and pat-down searches for weapons incident to such stops are identical. <em>See State v. Goree, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. 227, </em>236, 742 A.2d 1039 (2000) (citing <em>State v. Valentine, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>536, 543, 636 A.2d 505 (1994)); <em>see also Thomas, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 685, 542 A.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In <em>J.L., </em>the police received an anonymous telephone call reporting that \u201ca young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun.\u201d <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 268, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1377, 146 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 259. When the police arrived at the bus stop six minutes later, they saw three black males, one of whom, J.L., was wearing a plaid shirt. <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 268, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1377, 146 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 259. J.L. made no threatening or unusual movements, and the officers could not see a firearm. <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 268, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1377, 146 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 259. Nevertheless, on the basis of the anonymous tip alone, one of the officers searched J.L. and found a gun in his pocket. <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 268, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1377, 146 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 259. The Supreme Court held that this search was an invalid <em>Terry </em>stop because the anonymous tip alone did not contain the indicia of reliability required to provide the officer with reasonable suspicion that J.L. was carrying a gun. <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 272-274, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1379-1380, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The Supreme Court reasoned that the basis of the officers\u2019 suspicion that J.L. was carrying a weapon arose not from any observations of their own but \u201csolely from a call made from an unknown location by an unknown caller.\u201d <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 270, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1378, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 260. Because the tip standing alone lacked indicia of reliability, the Supreme Court concluded it could not justify the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d for the suspected firearm. <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 270, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1378, 146 L.Ed.2d at 260.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">Unlike a tip from a known informant whose reputation can be assessed and who can be held responsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated, ... \u201can anonymous tip alone seldom demonstrates the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge or veracity.... As we have recognized, however, there are situations in which an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>anonymous tip, suitably corroborated, exhibits \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\"><em>[J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S, </em>at 270, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1378, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 260 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Because the anonymous call in <em>J.L. </em>\u201cprovided no predictive information,\u201d it \u201cleft the police without means to test the informant\u2019s knowledge or credibility.\u201d <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 271, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1379, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 260. Accordingly, the Court determined the police lacked a reasonable basis for suspecting J.L. of engaging in unlawful conduct. <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 271, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1379, 146 L.Ed.2d at 260. And that was so even though the report of a gun proved correct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">The reasonableness of official suspicion must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their search. All the police had to go on in this case was the bare report of an unknown, unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about the gun nor supplied any basis for believing he had inside information about J.L.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\"><em>[J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 271, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1379, <em>146 </em>L.Ed.2d at 260].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aov\">Accordingly, the Court concluded that standing alone the anonymous tip did not justify the investigatory stop and ensuing frisk. <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 272, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1379, 146 L.Ed.2d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Relying on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>J.L., </em>we reached the same conclusion in <em>State v. Goree, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 235, 742 A.2d 1039 (2000). <em>See J.L. v. State of Florida, </em>727 So.2d 204 (Fla.1998). There, a police officer received a dispatch to investigate a report of a black male with a gun in a green and purple multi-purpose vehicle in the area of Tioga and Van Hook streets in Camden. <em>Goree, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 230, 742 A.2d 1039. The informant gave no description of the man. When the police arrived, they found a vehicle of that description parked a block away from the intersection. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant was then located sitting in a bar. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 742 A.2d 1039. When the police officer approached and talked to the defendant they had no description to confirm that he was actually the \u201cblack man with a gun in the vehicle.\u201d However, one of the officers recognized the defendant from having seen him drive the vehicle. Accordingly, he asked the defendant if the green and purple vehicle was his. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The defendant responded \u201c[n]o, but I have the keys,\u201d whereupon the officer asked him if he would step outside. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant left the bar with the officer. When the officer indicated he wanted to pat the defendant down, the defendant became belligerent and resisted. Writing for this court, Judge King reasoned: \u201cthere was no attempt on the part of the defendant to flee the scene or any other suspicious behavior before the attempted pat-down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 742 A.2d 1039. The defendant was simply a man sitting in a bar who had not displayed any criminally suspicious conduct prior to the attempted pat-down. Hence, we concluded there was no articulable and reasonable basis for the stop and frisk. Thereafter, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the stop. <em>J.L., supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 269, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1378, 146 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In contrast, in <em>Sharpless, supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 450, 715 A.2d 333, and <em>C.B., supra, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 575, 719 A.2d 206, relied on by the motion judge and decided before <em>Goree </em>and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>J.L., </em>we observed that because of the imminent danger posed by firearms, an anonymous tip that a person is armed should be treated differently than a tip concerning other forms of criminal activity. Therefore, we concluded that such a tip may provide the basis for a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d even though the informant does not make any prediction of future behavior which implicitly is verified by police observations. <em>Sharpless, supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 452, 715 A.2d 333. Because this view was rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>J.L., </em>to the extent <em>Sharpless </em>and <em>C.B. </em>can be read to hold otherwise, we decline to follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Applying <em>J.L. </em>to the facts here, we view defendant in the instant case in the same light as the juvenile in <em>J.L. </em>and Mr. Goree: Defendant was simply a man talking on a public telephone late at night who was approached by a police officer on an anonymous tip containing no descriptive content given by a person with no track record as an informant. Because that type of anonymous tip standing alone cannot justify a <em>Terry </em>stop, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>examine the anonymous tip together with the other circumstances relied on by the motion judge to determine whether in their totality they would establish an articulable and reasonable basis for the stop. We turn first to defendant\u2019s non-responsiveness to the police questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Recently, our Supreme Court iterated a citizen\u2019s rights upon being approached by a police officer in a public place to make a \u201cfield inquiry.\u201d <em>See Maryland, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, 771 A.2d 1220 (quoting <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>491, 497-98, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1319, 1324, 75 L.Ed.2d 229, 236 (1983)) (emphasis added). In <em>Maryland, </em>the Court stated that such a person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axm\">need not answer any question put to him; indeed, he may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way. He may not be detained even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds for doing so; and <em>his refusal to listen or answer does not, without more, furnish those grounds.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\"><em>[Maryland, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, 771 A.2d 1220 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">This right not to respond to police questioning was first recognized in <em>Terry, supra, </em>where, in a concurring opinion, Mr. Justice White stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">There is nothing in the Constitution which prevents a policeman from addressing questions to anyone on the <em>streets____Of course, the person stopped is not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest, although it may alert the officer to the need for continued observation:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\"><em>[Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 34, 88 <em>S.Ct </em>at 1886, 20 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 913 (White, J., concurring) (emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Sheffield, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>441, 446, 303 A.2d 68 (1973).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">Notably, on cross-examination, during a colloquy between the defense attorney and Officer Leeper, the officer expressly acknowledged defendant\u2019s rights not to answer the officer\u2019s questions and not to identify himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">Q. My question was at the time that you pulled up, he was another member of the public doing something completely legal. Am I correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-15\">Q. And, in fact, he didn\u2019t have to give you any identification now, did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-16\">A. No, he didn\u2019t have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-17\">Q. Okay. I mean he wasn\u2019t a suspect, correct. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>A. Correct, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">Q. Okay. He wasn\u2019t under arrest when you pulled up, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">A. No, he was not under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">Q. So he had the unfettered right to ignore any of your requests at that point in time. Am I correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">Q. And, in fact, when he asked \u2014 when you asked him for identification, that\u2019s exactly what he did, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">A. He didn\u2019t respond to the question at all. He didn\u2019t refuse to give me identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">Q. He didn\u2019t have to, did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-14\">Q. And when he refused to cooperate with you, that\u2019s when you asked him to go over to the car to be patted down. Am I correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">A. It aroused my suspicions, yes. I asked him then to step over to the car, that I wanted to do a pat-down search of his outer clothing for a possible weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWyl\">Q. Okay. It aroused your suspicion. What was he doing that was illegal that aroused your suspicion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-16\">A. People don\u2019t normally refuse to give me identification. During my 10 years on the road, most people give me an explanation as to why they don\u2019t have ID, or they give me ID. That I found very odd, it alarmed me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">Q. It alarmed you that someone was exercising his rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-18\">A. In the context of this call it alarmed me, yes. I was concerned for my safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">It is clear that the right to ignore police questioning has become a part of our constitutional fabric and would become unraveled if its exercise were used to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>See Caldwell, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 469, 730 A.2d 352 (Handler, J., concurring). <em>See also State v. L.F., </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 178-79, 719 A.2d 1272 (App.Div.1998). Hence, we believe defendant\u2019s silence gave rise to only a subjective \u201chunch\u201d by Officer Leeper that defendant may be armed and dangerous. <em>See Arthur, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 8, 691 A.2d 808. Consequently, it was insufficient to establish an objective articulable and reasonable basis to justify the investigatory stop. <em>Compare Roach, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. at </em>24, 796 A.2d 214 (listing \u201cfrenetic circumstances\u201d where it was reasonable for officers to fear for their safety: a nervous and intoxicated driver legally stopped for a motor vehicle violation who rebuffed lawful police orders, exhibited blood on his shirt, had a protruding bulge in the waist of his pants and reached for the bulge).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Moreover, even when defendant\u2019s non-responsiveness is considered together with the anonymous tip, the <em>Terry </em>stop cannot be justified. Although the officer was responding to an anonymous tip of a man who might have been dangerous, that possibility cannot obliterate defendant\u2019s right to refuse to answer the officer\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">That said, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge that \u201cthese anonymous-tip gun and drug cases, especially gun cases, are close and difficult, waffling about in a \u2018no-man\u2019s land\u2019 of nuances.\u201d <em>Goree, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 244, 742 A.2d 1039. And, of course, we are mindful that \u201c[ojftentimes ... law-enforcement officers must make instantaneous decisions about whether a frisk for weapons is justifiable. The task is an unenviable one often fraught with life-and-death consequences.\u201d <em>Roach, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 796 A.2d 214 (citations omitted). Nonetheless, without more, the <em>Terry </em>stop in this case cannot be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Therefore, we must consider whether the following additional circumstances would provide sufficient support for the \u201cstop.\u201d We think not. The neighborhood was not a high-crime or high-drug area; it was a low income neighborhood. Indeed, as Officer Leeper stated, handgun reports were not an everyday occurrence, and there was no reason to believe this anonymous tip would prove correct. Defendant had made no furtive gestures nor did he appear nervous. All he did was stand quiet in the face of police presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Moreover, forty-five minutes had passed since Lieutenant Wilcox received the anonymous tip. Any number of people could have used the phone in that time period. In addition, talking on a public pay phone at 1:45 a.m. is not the type of \u201chighly suspicious activity\u201d that should give rise to a fear that the person using the phone may be involved in criminal activity. Indeed, even Officer Leeper did not find it to be suspicious; all he observed was that it was \u201codd.\u201d But not everyone in a low income neighborhood has a telephone, and, not everyone goes to sleep after the 11:00 o\u2019clock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>news. Hence, we deem this activity benign in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Further, it is noteworthy that the initial anonymous report had been of a narcotics transaction involving three black males, two on Martin Luther King Avenue, and one on Abbett Street. Yet, no evidence whatsoever was adduced at the suppression hearing concerning the other two suspects, and certainly no connection between them and defendant was made. Accordingly, no suspicion can reasonably be attached to defendant based on the general, unverified, anonymous report of narcotics transactions occurring at some distant location.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In sum, what this record does not show is more persuasive than what it does reveal. <em>See State v. Tucker, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>158, 169, 642 A.2d 401 (1994). The officer did not see a handgun in defendant\u2019s hands as he approached him, nor any bulges or suspicious conduct that suggested defendant was hostile or dangerous. The officers did not know defendant from prior criminal encounters. The neighborhood was not a high-crime area and guns were not a frequent concern in the area. The informant was not reported to be someone who had proved to have been reliable in the past, and he gave no specific description of the person on the telephone other than his race. Defendant cooperated by hanging up the phone after being asked to do so. Granted, he did not respond to the officer or give him identification,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but he had a right not to respond, and indeed could have walked away. Once defendant declined to answer, the officers should have returned to their patrol vehicles and continued to make further observations if they believed it was necessary. <em>See Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 34, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1886, 20 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 913 (quoted in <em>Sheffield, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 446, 303 A.2d 68).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Lastly, we note that to the extent that Officer Leeper\u2019s advice to defendant of his intent to pat him down precipitated defendant\u2019s reaching toward his pants pocket, we view that circumstance as a police-created circumstance which may not be relied upon after the fact to justify the <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>See Goree, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 242, 742 A.2d 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We conclude that the totality of the circumstances presented by the State in support of the motion to suppress did not establish a reasonable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous justifying the <em>Terry </em>stop. Because the contraband found in defendant\u2019s possession was a fruit of that illegal seizure, it must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The order denying the motion to suppress is reversed, the convictions are reversed, and the matter remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-14\"> It appears that the judge did not find defendant guilty of violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2a(1) (improper behavior).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\"> The trial record reflects that Lieutenant Wilcox received the call at about 1:00 a.m., although there is some ambiguity surrounding that fact. The motion record does not mention the time Lieutenant Wilcox received the anonymous call.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> The record is silent concerning the results of the police investigation of the Martin Luther King Avenue location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> Officer Leeper did not recall having to ask defendant to hang up more than once before he complied but apparently Officer Lodato's police report reflected otherwise, <em>i.e., </em>that Officer Leeper had to ask two or three times. The report was not marked for identification or admitted in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\"> <em>Sharpless, supra, </em>and <em>C.B., supra, </em>essentially recognize the right of a police officer to \"stop and frisk\u201d a person on an anonymous tip that the person is armed with a gun despite lack of corroborating evidence or evidence of the informant's reliability. The correctness of these decisions has been placed in serious doubt by a decision of the United States Supreme Court, <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>266, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1375, 146 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 254 (2000), which we discuss at length later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\"> Although the police investigation here began as a \u201cfield inquiry/' it quickly escalated into a full <em>Terry </em>stop after defendant did not respond to the officer's questioning and was asked to place his hands on the patrol car. At that point, he was no longer free to leave. <em>See State v. Rodriguez, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>117, 796 A.2d 857 (2002). The State does not argue otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> We note the irony of the situation: Had defendant complied with the request for identification by reaching toward his pants pocket, it is likely he would have been immediately restrained and frisked.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
