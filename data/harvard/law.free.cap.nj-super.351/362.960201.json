New Jersey\u2019s cranberries are exclusively harvested in the Pinelands.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The Pinelands are classified as Freshwater Wetlands under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-3 and Federal Wetlands under the Clean Water Act (CWA). 33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1344.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the CWA, as head of the Army Corp of Engineers, the Secretary of the Army (Secretary), in conjunction with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), administers the program as it pertains to wetlands. Federal permits may be issued by the Secretary \u201cafter notice and opportunity for public hearings for the discharge of dredged or fill material\u201d into and around wetlands. <em>Ibid. </em>New Jersey has adopted its own wetlands protection act and permit program known as the Freshwater Protection Act (FWPA) and the DEP has the responsibility for the administration of these permits, in lieu of the federal agencies. <em>See </em>33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1342(b). However, the State\u2019s decision to issue permits is subject to EPA approval, and the State standards for granting these permits may not be less stringent than the federal standards. 33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-9(a) requires that an entity, other than those under the jurisdiction of the Pinelands Commission <em>(see N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-6(b)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking to conduct any regulated activity in freshwater wetlands must possess a FWPA permit. \u201cRegulated activity\u201d is broadly defined in the statute as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>(1) The removal, excavation, disturbance or dredging of soil, sand, gravel, or aggregate material of any kind;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">(2) The drainage or disturbance of the water level or water table;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">(3) The dumping, discharging or filling with any materials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">(4) The driving of pilings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">(5) The placing of obstructions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(6) The destruction of plant life which would alter the character of a freshwater wetland, including the cutting of trees[.] N.J.S.A 13:9B-3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">The federal regulations require permits for \u201cthe construction of any canal, ditch, dike or other waterway or structure which drains or otherwise significantly modifies a stream, lake, swamp, bog or any other wetland or aquatic area____\u201d 33 <em>C.F.R. </em>323.4(a)(1)(iii)(c)(2). But certain cranberry farming activities are exempt from these requirements. 33 <em>C.F.R. </em>323.4. Permits are not required for discharges of dredged or fill material \u201cfor the purpose of installing ditching or other such water control facilities incidental to planting, cultivating, protecting, or harvesting of ... cranberries\u201d in wetlands which have already been established for \u201csuch agricultural and silvicultural wetland crop production.\u201d 33 <em>C.F.R. </em>323.4(a)(l)(iii)(C)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">Under 33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1344(e), the federal government has authorized general permits,i **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rather than the usual individual ones, where it considers the environmental effect of the wetland activity <em>de minimus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">In New Jersey, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23 allows the DEP to issue general permits, and states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-15\">(c) The department shall issue additional general permits on a Statewide or regional basis for the following categories of activities, if the department determines, after conducting an environmental analysis and providing public notice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>opportunity for a public hearing, that the activities will cause only minimal adverse environmental impacts when performed separately, will have only minimal cumulative adverse impacts on the environment, will cause only minor impacts on freshwater wetlands, will be in conformance with the purposes of <em>P.L. </em>1987, c. 156 (C. 13:913-1 <em>et seq.), </em>and will not violate any provision of the federal act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">* * H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">(5) Activities, as determined by the department, which will have no significant adverse environmental impact on freshwater wetlands, provided that <em>the </em>issuance of a general permit for any such activities is consistent with the provisions of the Federal Act and has been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency!.! <em>(N.J.SA </em>13:9B-23(c)(5)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">General permits issued by the State are valid for five years, may be subject to conditions, and may be modified or revoked at any time. <em>N.J.S.A, </em>13:9B-23(d),(e). Such permits allow the regulated entity to engage in any of its enumerated activities without first having to apply for an individual permit for each activity. <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:9B-23(g). Instead, the entity is to provide thirty days advance written notice to the DEP, and is supposed to receive an answer therefrom within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Prior to the availability of the State\u2019s general permit, the Secretary issued Nationwide Permit #34 (NWP34), for those activities listed in 56 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>59110, 59144, to allow its holders to engage in \u201c[discharges of dredged or fill material for dikes, berms, pumps, water control structures or leveling of cranberry beds associated with expansion, enhancement, or modification activities at existing cranberry production operations____\u201d The permit holder is not to exceed ten acres of \u201cdisturbance per cranberry production operation\u201d measured over the life of the permit, and the activity cannot result in a \u201cnet loss of wetland acreage.\u201d Ibid. The permit also includes notification requirements and procedures which must be followed by the permittee. However, NWP34 is subject to mitigation requirements and does \u201cnot authorize any discharge of dredged or fill material related to other cranberry production activities such as warehouses, processing facilities, or parking areas.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>A July 21, 1992 \u201cMemorandum to the Field\u201d (RGL 92-02) published in 57 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>32523, 32524 and issued by federal authorities recognized that cranberry production is a \u201cwater dependent activity\u201d because it requires either \u201cwetlands or areas altered to create a wetland environment.\u201d Activities classified as \u201cwater dependent\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> relieve permit applicants of the need to rebut the presumptions that: (1) \u201cpracticable alternatives that do not involve special aquatic sites are presumed to be available\u201d and (2) \u201call practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge which do not involve a discharge into a special aquatic site are presumed to have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.\u201d 40 <em>C.F.R. </em>230.10(a)(3).

In order to qualify for a GP23, the applicant must be a \u201cdiscrete legal entity\u201d that prior to the date of enactment was already in active cranberry production in the Pinelands and \u201c[w]as reported as a cranberry growing operation to the United States Department of Agriculture Cranberry Marketing Committee.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-5.23 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">A GP23 permit can be valid for up to five years. <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:9B-23(e). However, the regulation gives the Commissioner the discretion \u201cto modify, suspend, or revoke\u201d GP23 permit authorizations at any time. <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-5.23(r). The permit authorizes, but is not limited to, \u201cthe construction or expansion of a bog, reservoir, canal, ditch, dike, tail water recovery system, water quality improvement system, or other similar support type facility.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-o.23(b). The construction or expansion of sheds and housing, as well as the establishment of new sites for storing or stockpiling materials, is not authorized. <em>Id. </em>Each cranberry growing operation is limited to one authorization under GP23 per year. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">General Permit 23 authorizes an existing cranberry grower to expand up to ten acres per operation per year, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEVt\">1.

The amount of acreage impacted<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> under the State permit over its five year term is limited to a maximum of 300 acres. <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-5.23(i). Within that five year cap, GP23 also places a limit of sixty acres per year, with a provision \u201cthat if the Department authorizes fewer than.60 acres of loss and/or disturbance in any year, up to 30 acres of unused loss or disturbance may be carried forward to a subsequent year, but in no case shall more than 90 acres of freshwater wetlands and/or State open waters be lost or disturbed in one year[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, of the 300 acres allowed, only a maximum of eighty acres are allowed to be forested wetlands, and of that area of allowable environmental impacts, no more than twenty-five acres can be Atlantic white-cedar wetlands. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\"><em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-5.23(d) ranks the various wetlands which are found in the Pinelands region in the order to be considered for use in the expansion of cranberry growing operations, with \u201cState open waters\u201d being the most preferred, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">1.

'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-18\">To obtain authorization under GP23, the cranberry growers must conduct their activities in the area with the lowest number ranking on the list, so that any project related impacts occur in the wetland types of the lowest value. <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-5.23(c). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>authorization is not supposed to issue if the proposed activities \u201cwill cause a net loss [defined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-1.4] of freshwater wetlands at a single cranberry growing operation.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The Atlantic white-cedar wetlands (AWC) have been deemed by the EPA to be the \u201cmost valuable in the Pinelands,\u201d and as such are considered to be \u201chigh value or unique wetlands.\u201d Thus, expansion into these areas is highly discouraged under GP23. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(d). Moreover, for proposed expansions into AWC wetlands, applicants must \u201cdemonstrate that there is no suitable upland area available, which is owned by the applicant\u201d that could be used \u201cin order to eliminate or minimize impacts to Atlantic white-cedar wetlands.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(j). Any such proposed expansion into AWC wetlands of over five acres requires \u201ca written statement from the Natural Resources Conservation Service that the activities will minimize, to the extent feasible, the impacts to the remaining Atlantic white-cedar wetlands.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Any impact to higher value wetlands, that is wetlands other than \u201cabandoned blueberry, cranberry, or agricultural fields, or State open waters,\u201d requires the cranberry grower to compensate the DEP through the transfer of Pinelands Development Credits (PDCs)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> depending upon the type of wetland impacted. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23 <em>(l).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">PDCs transferred to the DEP by GP23 applicants are placed in the Pinelands Development Credit Bank and are sold to other private entities seeking to increase their allowable development densities in the wetlands. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(m), (n). The pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>eeeds of these sales are intended \u201cto establish and/or restore Atlantic white-cedar wetlands in the Pinelands\u201d through the Atlantic white-cedar restoration program. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">GP23 in its current form was proposed by the DEP on June 21, 1999. 31 <em>N.J.R. </em>2964(a). The DEP had previously proposed a similar freshwater wetlands general permit for cranberry growers in the Pinelands. <em>Id. </em>However, this proposal had been rejected by the EPA and expired on September 16,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">This general permit was again proposed on October 19, 1998, with changes included to address the EPA\u2019s rejection of the DEP\u2019s original proposal. However, the EPA again withheld approval of the State\u2019s general permit program based upon its continuing concerns that the proposed general permit could result in more than minimal adverse effects to the environment, particularly due to potential impacts in the \u201chigh value or unique\u201d wetlands, especially wetland areas dominated by Atlantic white-cedar.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The EPA provided a list of conditions which had to be met in order for it to approve the proposed general permit. In an April 16, 1999 letter, the EPA delineated the appropriate modifications which had to be taken in order to gain its approval. After the DEP modified the general permit in accordance with those recommendations, the EPA withdrew its objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">GP23 was approved by the Pinelands Commission on July 20, 1999 and adopted by the DEP on September 13, 1999.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On November 8, 1999, the EPA gave its support to the regulation containing GP23 in a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Appellants filed an appeal on November 18,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">On August 7, 2000, the DEP readopted GP23 and recodified it as <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23. 32 <em>N.J.R. </em>1253(a). On June 29, 2001, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Acting Governor extended the expiration date of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A to August 7, 2001. <em>See </em>33 <em>N.J.R. </em>2640(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The first issue on appeal involves the applicability to GP23 of the mitigation requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-13(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">The department shall require as a condition of a freshwater wetlands permit that all appropriate measures have been carried out to mitigate adverse environmental impacts, restore vegetation, habitats, and land and water features, prevent sedimentation and erosion, minimize the area of freshwater wetland disturbance and insure compliance with the Federal Act and implementing regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">That provision, if applicable, would arguably require more stringent mitigation requirements than do the federal regulations. The appellants argue that because the DEP issued the permit, the quoted provision automatically applies, and that once the permit is issued the conditions therein apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-6(b) exempts the Pinelands from the State\u2019s requirements for a freshwater wetlands permit. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">Activities in areas under the jurisdiction of the Pinelands Commission pursuant to <em>P.L. </em>1979, <em>c. </em>111 (C. 13:18A-1 <em>et seq.) shall not require a freshwater wetlands permit, or be subject to transition area requirements established in this act, except that the discharge of dredged or fill material shall require a permit issued under the provisions of the Federal Act, or under an individual and general permit program administered by the State under the provisions of the Federal Act and applicable State laws, </em>provided that the Pinelands Commission may provide for more stringent regulation of activities in and around freshwater wetland areas within its jurisdiction, [emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">The enactment of this statute preceded New Jersey\u2019s assumption of the federal permitting process under 33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1344;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and anticipated the State\u2019s assumption of the Federal permitting program. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-6. The CWA provides that states that have assumed control of the federal permitting process may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>regulations that are more stringent, but not less stringent, than the federal regulations. 33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The statute exempts activities in the Pinelands from any state permitting requirements under the FWPA by stating that such activities: \u201cshall not require a freshwater wetlands permit, or be subject to transition area requirements established in this act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-6(b). While this statute exempts activities in the Pinelands from freshwater wetlands permit requirements, it still requires all permittees to meet the federal CWA requirements by requiring \u201ca permit issued under the provisions of the Federal Act\u201d or \u201cunder the Federal Act and applicable State laws____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, such permits are issued only to the extent required by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The State is responsible for administering both the federal CWA and State FWPA permits. The FWPA permits are more stringent than their federal counterparts. Because the DEP is precluded from issuing state FWPA permits to these entities, these permits were administered under provisions of the Federal act, namely 33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1344(e), which allows the usage of general permits. Thus, the federal standards govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Appellants\u2019 suggested construction of this statute would negate some of its language. In their view, any permits issued pursuant to the federal program in the Pinelands would require the State to meet the requirements of the FWPA simply because the State issued a federally required permit. However, this would nullify the statutory exemption to the effect that state permits are only required to the extent that they are required under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The exemptions are to be given full effect in construing the statute. Thus, the State mitigation requirements in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-13(a) do not apply to GP23. In addition, the EPA has found that the program\u2019s mitigation requirements are sufficient to meet federal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Next, the appellants allege that GP23 is invalid because it is impermissibly less stringent than the federal program. They claim that GP23 impermissibly allows a far greater amount of acreage to be impacted than does its federal counterpart, NWP34.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Under NWP34, the permitee may not exceed a cumulative total of ten acres of disturbances over the duration of the permit, whereas GP23 authorizes an existing cranberry grower to expand up to ten acres <em>per year </em>over the entire five year life of the permit (a maximum possible expansion of up to fifty acres per grower). 56 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>59110, 59144; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(h). Appellant argues that \u201c[t]his fact alone renders SGP 23 less stringent than the federal program as embodied in NWP 34, by a factor of five.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">However, in its November 8, 1999 letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the EPA stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">EPA believes that the revised GP23 is consistent with and as stringent as the standards of the Federal wetlands program.... On the issue of different acreage restrictions between GP 23 and NWP 34, though there is a different acreage impact allowed under GP 23 (10 acres/grower/year), NWP 34 does not have any overall cap, such as the 300 acre statewide cap contained in the GP. Therefore, theoretically, under NWP 34 there could be more total acreage impact in New Jersey if every grower decided to request authorization for a 10 acre expansion. Based on a review of all these factors, EPA believes that GP 23 is at least as protective of wetlands and other aquatic areas as NWP 34.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Currently, there are forty-seven listed cranberry producers in New Jersey. 31 <em>N.J.R. </em>1571. Under the federal NWP, each producer would be entitled to expand up to ten acres over the five years of the permit. 56 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>59110, 59144. What this means is that the maximum acreage that could permissibly be affected under the federal permit would be 470 acres. In contrast, GP23 places a statewide cap of 300 acres of possible expansion over the life of the permit. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(h). Moreover, unlike the federal permit plan, GP23 requires its permittees to conduct their activities in wetlands of the lowest possible value, and places limits on impacts in higher value wetlands such as forested freshwater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>wetlands and Atlantic white-cedar wetlands. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(c); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(h), (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Our review of the record in light of the arguments presented satisfies us that the State\u2019s general permit program comports with the requirements of the CWA, and is not less protective than NWP34. Furthermore, deference is accorded to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the permit. <em>See In the Matter of the Distribution of Liquid Assets Upon Dissolution of the Union County Regional High School District No. 1, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10-11, 773 A.2d 6 (2001); <em>Housley v. Wave Energy Systems, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>574, 582, 779 A.2d 453 (App.Div.2001) (deference is given to an agency\u2019s construction of a statute it is assigned to administer). The record supports the finding of the EPA that GP23 does not permit more acreage to be impacted than does NWP34.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The appellants also assert that GP23 is less stringent than NWP34 on the ground that the federal program contains mitigation requirements not found in its New Jersey counterpart. They assert that GP23 does not comport with the mitigation standards in General Condition 19 established after the promulgation of GP23. 65 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>12818,12896.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApB\">19. Mitigation. The project must be designed and constructed to avoid and minimize adverse effects to water\u2019s of the United States to the maximum extent practicable at the project site (ie., on site). <em>Mitigation will be required when necessary to ensure that the adverse affects to the aquatic environment are minimal </em>The District Engineer will consider the factors discussed below when determining the acceptability of appropriate and practicable mitigation necessary to offset adverse effects on the aquatic environment that are more than minimal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">(a) <em>Compensatory mitigation at </em>o <em>minimum 1:1 ratio mil be required for all wetland impacts requiring a PCN. </em>Consistent with National policy, the District Engineer will establish a preference for restoration of wetlands to meet the minimum compensatory mitigation ratio, with preservation used only in exceptional circumstances. (65 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>12818,12896 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Because the Pinelands are National Resource waters, activities under NWP34 require preconstruction notification (PCN) pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ant to General Condition 25. 65 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>12818, 12897. Thus, appellants argue that the requirement of \u201c[(Compensatory mitigation at a minimum 1:1 ratio\u201d for all wetland impacts must be met by GP23 in order for it to be as stringent as NWP34. GP23 does not possess such a rigorous requirement, as it only requires 1:1 mitigation (see subsection 19(a)) for impacts to Atlantic white-cedar wetlands and losses to other types of wetlands. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(g),(n)(2). As noted, \u201cimpacts\u201d are considered either \u201closses\u201d or \u201cdisturbances.\u201d Under GP23, the 1:1 mitigation requirement does not apply to any disturbances occurring in wetlands other than Atlantic white-cedar wetlands. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(n)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">General Condition 19 requires mitigation only <em>\u201cwhen necessary </em>to ensure that the adverse effects to the aquatic environment are minimal.\u201d 65 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>12818, 12896 (emphasis added). It states that the \u201cDistrict Engineer will consider the factors discussed below\u201d (which includes subsection 19a) in instances where it has been determined that mitigation is necessary to \u201coffset adverse effects on the aquatic environment that are more than minimal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Thus, the cited subsection is one in a list of mitigation techniques to be considered by the District Engineer after it has been determined that the effects to the environment are more than minimal. It does not apply automatically to the activities in the Pinelands challenged by appellants. Moreover, in granting its approval to GP23, the EPA specifically stated: \u201cwe have determined that GP23 will have no more than minimal adverse environmental effects on the aquatic environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">This interpretation of General Condition 19 is consistent with the agency\u2019s interpretation. In light of the foregoing, it cannot be said that NWP34 contains more stringent mitigation requirements than GP23. Furthermore, the EPA\u2019s finding that GP23\u2019s environmental impacts are minimal renders subsection 19(a) inapplicable because those mitigation requirements would not apply. We give appropriate weight to the EPA\u2019s findings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>this regard. <em>Housley, supra </em>(343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 582, 779 A.2d 453).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The appellants also claim that the protections for endangered species in GP23 fall short of those in NWP34. NWP34\u2019s protections for endangered species are found in General Condition 11, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">11. Endangered Species, (a) No activity is authorized under any NWP which is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a threatened or endangered species or a species proposed for such designation, as identified under the Federal Endangered Species Act, or which will destroy or adversely modify the critical habitat of such species. Non-federal permittees shall notify the District Engineer if any listed species or designated critical habitat might be affected or is in the vicinity of the project, or is located in the designated critical habitat and shall not begin work on the activity until notified by the District Engineer that the requirements of the Endangered Species Act have been satisfied and that the activity is authorized.... As a result of formal or informal consultation with the FWS or NMFS, the District Engineer may add species-specific regional endangered species conditions to the NWPs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">[65 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>12818, 12893].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The current version of General Condition 11 is substantially similar to the version in effect when GP23 was approved by the EPA. <em>See </em>56 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>59110, 59145.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">EPA approval of GP23 was conditioned upon the inclusion of various provisions protective of endangered species. The State permit program requires applicants to \u201c[d]esign and carry out the activities to avoid <em>irreversible adverse impacts on the survival </em>of any local populations of threatened or endangered <em>plants </em>of the Pinelands, consistent with the Pinelands Comprehensive Management Plan at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:50-6.27.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(o)(5) (emphasis added). In addition, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-5.23(v) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">In order to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1531 <em>et seq., </em>general permit 23 will be added to the list of general permits subject to coordination procedures with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the Department\u2019s Memorandum of Agreement regarding the Endangered Species Act and New Jersey\u2019s assumption of the Federal 404 program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The appellants\u2019 contentions that GP23 does not afford the same degree of protection to endangered species as NWP34 are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.23(v), GP23 applicants are bound by the standards contained in a Memorandum of Agreement entered into between the DEP and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS Agreement), the terms of which bring GP23 in line with the requirements of General Condition 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The FWS Agreement protects both endangered plants and animals. Under the FWS Agreement, protection is afforded to threatened and endangered species as well as \u201cspecies proposed for federal listing.\u201d Thus, the range of species protected under the FWS Agreement (and therefore GP23) does not differ from those protected under NWP34 through General Condition 11. Furthermore, as is the case with General Condition 11, an analysis is required to determine potential effects on the protected species and their critical habitats.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Finally, whereas federal applicants are to avoid \u201cirreversible adverse impacts on the survival\u201d of these species, the State applicants must prove that, \u201cthe proposed activity is not likely to adversely affect federally-listed species or designated critical habitat.\u201d Arguably, this may be an even higher standard. Where this standard has not been met, a permit will either be denied or be made subject to project modifications and/or permit conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">We conclude that the FWS Agreement is as stringent as General Condition 11 and that GP23\u2019s protections of endangered species are just as stringent as those mandated under NWP34.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Appellants also claim that GP23 is not as stringent as NWP34 because it does not comport with the requirements of RGL 92-02, which requires \u201cconsideration of upland alternatives\u201d before the issuance of a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Under RGL 92-02, as published in the Federal Register, before a permit may issue, the applicant must satisfy the requirements of 40 <em>C.F.R. </em>230.10(a), which requires that the proposed discharge must be the \u201cleast environmentally damaging practicable alternative, after considering aquatic and non-aquatic alternatives as appropriate.\u201d 57 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>32523, 32524. However, 40 <em>C.F.R. </em>230.10(a)(2) further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">An alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes. If it is otherwise a practicable alternative, an area not presently owned by the applicant which could reasonably be obtained, utilized, expanded or managed in order to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed activity may be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In a November 8, 1999 letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the EPA stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">[T]he Guidelines at 40 CFR 230.7(b)(1) state that \u201cconsideration of alternatives in section 230.10(a) are not directly applicable to <em>General permits </em>\u201d (emphasis added.) Therefore, water dependent activities authorized under a general permit (such as GP 23) do <em>not </em>have to meet the same rigorous alternatives analysis as a non-water dependent activity evaluated under an individual permit. While it may be possible that under certain conditions bogs may be able to be constructed in uplands, that possibility does not change the alternatives threshold given to water dependent activities under the Guidelines, particularly those authorized under a general permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">As we have previously noted, the federal government has thus far declined to mandate the usage of uplands as an alternative to the expansion of bogs in wetlands as a condition for obtaining a NWP34 permit. Comments at 61 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>65904. Because NWP34 does not mandate the consideration of upland alternatives, it cannot be said that GP32 is less stringent than the federal permit plan. Unlike NWP34, GP23 specifically requires the applicant to \u201cdemonstrate that there is no suitable upland area available\u201d when expanding into Atlantic white-cedar wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Appellants assert that GP23 is invalid because it was issued in violation of the non-degradation requirements of the State\u2019s Surface Water Quality Standards (SWQS) in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7.-9B-1.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The Pinelands have been designated National Resource waters and the SWQS\u2019s antidegradation policies require that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">No changes shall be allowed in waters which constitute an outstanding National or Slate resource or in waters that may affect these outstanding resource waters. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B-1.5(d)(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Moreover, in regard to the Pinelands, the SWQS specifically state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">For Pinelands waters, the Department shall not approve any activity which alone or in combination with any other activities, might cause changes, other than toward natural water quality, in the existing surface water quality characteristics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-13\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B \u2014 1.5(d)(6)(ii)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">This rule also states: \u201cThis policy is not intended to interfere with water control in the operation of cranberry bogs____\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B-1.5(d)(6)(ii)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">Appellants argue that while the cranberry growers\u2019 water control activities are exempted from SWQS standards, the discharge of pesticides by the growers is not covered under this exemption, and therefore violates this regulation. Thus, they maintain that GP23 is in violation of the SWQS because it permits such discharges to take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">The appellants are mistaken. The above SWQS exemption for the water control activities also applies to the pesticide content of the water. This conclusion is based upon the specific language of the exemption: \u201cThis policy is not intended to <em>interfere </em>with water control ----\u201d (emphasis added). The usage of the term \u201cinterfere\u201d indicates that the regulatory agencies will not undertake an examination of the chemical content of the water. If the SWQS were to require a prohibition of water control activities based upon their chemical content, then there would be an \u201cinterference\u201d with such activities. This is specifically prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-21\">Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with the fact that under the NJPDES<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> permit system, this activity would be exempted from regulation. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:14A-2.1(d). That provision requires permits for all discharges of pollutants into surface and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ground waters of the State. However, it exempts \u201cpollutants from nonpoint source agricultural and silvicultural activities, including runoff from orchards, cultivated crops, pastures, range lands, and forest lands\u201d as well as \u201creturn flows from irrigated agriculture.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:14A-2.5(a)(4),(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">This provision broadly exempts all \u201cpollutants\u201d contained in runoffs and discharges and is not limited solely to water. Thus, reading the above provisions together, it is clear that the State\u2019s environmental agencies have intended to provide a broad exemption for these water discharges, inclusive of the water\u2019s content.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Finally, the appellants claim that the DEP violated the Administrative Procedure Act by a \u201ccritical misrepresentation.\u201d They assert that the DEP\u2019s decision to promulgate GP23 was affected by alleged misrepresentations on behalf of the cranberry industry regarding their acreage needs. They rely upon a newspaper article which claims that various cranberry growers have illegally expanded their operations by as much as 400 acres. <em>See </em>Ronald Smothers, <em>Groups Say Cranberry Growers Mislead on Acreage Needs, N.Y. Times, </em>September 13,1999, at B6.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Aside from the hearsay nature of this article, the appellants\u2019 claim cannot be sustained. The record reveals that the acreage needs of the cranberry growers was not a consideration in the DEP and the EPA\u2019s decision to promulgate GP23. Specifically, in adopting the regulation the DEP stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\"><em>The Department\u2019s function is not to evaluate cranberry growers\u2019 projections as to their need for new bogs in the future. </em>Rather, the Department evaluates the impact of the activities and bases its decision on whether the statutory standard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>adoption of a general permit, set forth in the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-2Sc, has been met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">[31 <em>N.J.R. </em>2967 (emphasis added).!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Moreover, the EPA has stated that while it is \u201cconcerned about potential violations by the cranberry industry in the Pinelands\u201d these allegations cannot enter into its decision making process lor the GP. It also stated that, \u201c[p]roject need is not a requirement under the CWA Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (hereinafter \u2018the Guidelines\u2019) for evaluating nationwide permits (NWP) or general permits.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The fact that \u201cproject need\u201d was not a consideration in the decision to promulgate GP23 is further underscored by the DEP\u2019s acknowledgment that, at the time of its decision, there was a surplus of cranberries. 31 <em>N.J.R. </em>2967. If \u201cproject need\u201d was not considered by either the DEP or the EPA in deciding to implement GP23, any alleged misrepresentations made by the cranberry industry regarding their acreage needs would appear irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-13\"> \"Appellants\u201d are: American Littoral Society, Environmental Defense Fund, National Wildlife Federation, New Jersey Audubon Society, New Jersey Environmental Federation, New Jersey Environmental Lobby, New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Citizen Lobby, Inc., Sierra Club, New Jersey Chapter, New Jersey Conservation Foundation and Pinelands Preservation Alliance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-14\">Although the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic furnished legal representation for these parties, it failed to list the parties that it was representing on the face of the briefs and appendix submitted to this court as required by <em>R. </em>2:6-6(a)(4).
