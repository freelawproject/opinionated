Because Williamson, the driver, had changed lanes without signaling, plaintiffs demanded identification of the testers. When Campbell, the back-seat passenger, said that he did not have any identification, the officers ordered the three men out of the car, frisked them, searched the car\u2019s interior, found no contraband, and released them. Defendant Diane Armstrong, William Armstrong\u2019s mother, owned the Mercedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Defendants Joan Martelli and Anna Sims Phillips, producers of <em>PrimeTime Live, </em>a television program broadcast by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>American Broadcasting Companies (ABC), had arranged for the testers to cruise in an expensive ear to find out if the police would stop them. The incident was surreptitiously recorded with cameras concealed in the Mercedes and also in a van which followed the Mercedes. Defendants Richard Wald, an ABC vice president, and John Zucker, ABC\u2019s attorney, approved the use of the hidden cameras.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">With the assistance of defendant Robert Lange, the senior producer, Martelli drafted a script for a <em>PrimeTime Live </em>broadcast entitled \u201cDWB\u201d (Driving While Black). Defendant Phyllis McGrady, executive producer; approved the script which was broadcast on national television in November 1996. Defendant John Quinones, an ABC correspondent, appeared on the program and defendant Diane Sawyer was a co-anchor.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Plaintiffs alleged that (1) the broadcast was defamatory and portrayed them in a false light; (2) a portion of the recording of a conversation between two of the plaintiffs while they were conducting the search violated, the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A, </em>2A:156A-1 to -34; and (3) defendants fraudulently procured the tape of the episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal by summary judgment, contending that the judge erred in ruling that (1) on the defamation claim, plaintiffs had neither consent nor probable cause to search the car, and the ABC defendants did not produce and publish the broadcast with actual malice; (2) on the electronic surveillance claim, plaintiffs had no expectation of privacy while they were searching the car; and (3) plaintiffs did not prove an actionable fraud claim. We agree with the judge\u2019s disposition and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\"><em>The \u201cDWB\u201d Broadcast </em>\u2014 November <em>27, 1996</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">We first summarize the factual record before the Law Division judge when he ruled on the motions for summary judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>After a three-minute introduction, which included other topics on the <em>PrimeTime Live </em>program that night, the \u201cDWB\u201d segment ran for about twelve minutes. The broadcast began with Sawyer\u2019s account of recent rioting in Florida when police killed an African-American teenager during.a routine traffic stop. Sawyer said that police target African-Americans when they are driving \u201csimply because they\u2019re black,\u201d and three delegates at the Black Caucus convention in Washington, two of the testers in this case, and Professor Charles Ogletree of Harvard Law School concurred. The broadcast first showed a white officer in South Carolina who had stopped a black woman for speeding, pulled her out of her car, yelled at her to get down, and pushed her face to the ground. Then there was a scene of a funeral of a young black man who, according to Quinones, \u201cwas suffocated while being held down by police near Pittsburgh during a traffic stop. He\u2019d been driving a Jaguar.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Quinones said that these were \u201cextreme cases\u201d and showed videotapes depicting more common examples: officers in Volusia County, Florida, stopping black motorists for minor traffic offenses; several times they asked for permission to search the cars, without any apparent cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Quinones then announced that \u201cPrimeTime decided to try a little experiment\u201d in \u201cthe all-American small town of Jamesburg, [central] New Jersey.\u201d (Described in Appendix A). He explained the hidden cameras, identified the testers, noted the time about 9:30 p.m., and said that the testers were \u201cdriving carefully through town on our second night in Jamesburg. This time, within minutes, they\u2019re pulled over.\u201d The broadcast showed the testers cruising in the Mercedes, and, after the car had stopped, Officer Hornberger approaching Williamson, the driver, and explaining that he had changed lanes without signaling. The broadcast did not identify the plaintiffs-offieers by name. The narrative refers to them as \u201cNew Jersey Patrolmen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The broadcast showed Hornberger asking the passengers for identification. The film showed that when Campbell, the rear-seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>passenger, said that he did not have any, Hornberger asked him to \u201cget out of the vehicle, please.\u201d While the film showed the officers searching the car, Quinones\u2019 narration stated that \u201cthey were stopped for a minor traffic violation\u201d and \u201cseparated, questioned, even frisked____And their car is searched, although police never asked permission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Professor Ogletree intervened in the narration, stating that a traffic violation was \u201cnot a basis\u201d to conduct the \u201ccomplete search, going into packages,\u201d which was occurring. Quinones explained that Ogletree was maintaining that the officers were \u201cconducting an illegal search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The film showed Hornberger attempting to open a cosmetic case in the back seat of the car, remarking that it was locked, and Officer Tonkery saying, \u201cprobably dope.\u201d Ogletree commented: \u201cWhy would he say that? Hunch? Evidence? Because they\u2019re black men, probably, in a late-model car at night and that\u2019s all he heeds. The rest he can fill in the blanks. It\u2019s sad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Jamesburg Police Chief Knowles then said: \u201cIt\u2019s called profiling.\u201d In response to Quinones\u2019s questions, Chief Knowles explained that profiling was \u201ca law enforcement term\u201d; it \u201cgoes on every day, every night in every town, everywhere in the United States.\u201d Knowles said he did not \u201cagree\u201d with profiling and saw no reason to suspect \u201cthree young black men in a Mercedes.\u201d Nevertheless, he approved the search, which was \u201cincidental to the individual officer\u2019s protection\u201d and thus \u201cconstitutionally okay.\u201d When asked whether the officers should have requested permission to search, Knowles conceded, \u201cit\u2019s a good point. I think it could be borderline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Quinones questioned the reason for the initial stop, stating: \u201cOn another night we watched this same intersection for three hours____We counted 260 cars at that intersection and of those, 223 also failed to turn on their blinkers, including four police squad cars____And they weren\u2019t ... pulled over.\u201d Knowles said: \u201cI don\u2019t have an answer____[Tjhere\u2019s a possibility that this fit the criteria of profiling.\u201d Knowles admitted that Tonkery\u2019s assump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tion that the testers were carrying \u201cdope\u201d was \u201cdefinitely inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Quinones, continuing the narrative, observed that \u201cwhere lawsuits have been filed,\u201d there was evidence that 62% of drivers stopped in Volusia County, Florida were black; 42% of drivers stopped in southern New Jersey were black; and 72% of drivers stopped in northern Maryland were black. \u201cRemember, only about 12 percent of the population is black.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Quinones suggested that stopping a few innocent people might be \u201ca small price to pay ... to get drugs off the streets.\u201d Ogletree disagreed because \u201cit\u2019s not going to get drugs off the street.... And it\u2019s not a small price to pay for my dignity and my respect and my self-esteem.\u201d Finally, Quinones related that the testers were released after twenty minutes, without a traffic violation summons. When Quinones inquired about an apology, Knowles said: \u201cPolice officers don\u2019t apologize for doing their job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Sawyer closed the broadcast by saying that courts were \u201cincreasingly ... giving police the benefit of the doubt when it comes to traffic stops.\u201d She reported that the Volusia County, Florida case had been dismissed and an appeal by the drivers was pending. She stated that African Americans were developing \u201ccounter-strategies,\u201d such as driving \u201cconservative cars\u201d or placing a \u201cbaby seat in the back as a prop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Martelli certified that she conducted substantial research on racial profiling before she produced \u201cDWB.\u201d She read many articles and judicial opinions and interviewed law enforcement officials, attorneys and victims. The material she read included <em>State v. Soto, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 734 A.2d 350 (Law Div.1996), in which the court relied on statistics of a disproportionate number of traffic stops of African-Americans on a southern section of the New Jersey Turnpike. Martelli and the others responsible for the production \u201cfelt that this was an important social issue\u201d which met ABC\u2019s criteria for using concealed cameras. Phillips had contacted the three testers; she knew their families socially, and Diane Armstrong was her cousin. The testers had been cruising around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>for about twenty hours on four other evenings in various towns in central New Jersey before they were stopped in Jamesburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\n<em>The Reason for the Stop</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">According to Hornberger, the stop occurred on June 28,1996 at the intersection of County Route 522 and Forsgate Drive. Both the police car and the testers\u2019 vehicle were on Route 522 and had stopped at the traffic light at Forsgate Drive. At that intersection, traveling in that direction, the right lane was for turning right and the left lane was for going straight. Soon after, at a second traffic light, the right lane was for going straight and the left lane was for turning left. In order to continue straight ahead, a vehicle had to move quickly from the left lane to the right lane after the first traffic light.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Tonkery explained that the Mercedes went straight while traveling in the left-turn-only lane at the second light, \u201cdrove over a double-yellow line and a painted median,\u201d and \u201cproceeded in front of me,\u201d causing Tonkery to brake hard in order to avoid an accident. According to Tonkery, the driver failed to use a signal for the lane change, failed to keep right, and disregarded a marked lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Tonkery admitted that investigation for possible wrongdoing was \u201cone element of the stop,\u201d and he was \u201clooking for a reason to stop the car.\u201d He explained that he had seen the same car with the same occupants two days before and knew that another officer thought that the car was \u201csuspicious.\u201d The other officer, Sergeant Paul Karkoska, told Hornberger that the Mercedes had been seen driving around an area known for drug sales, and to \u201ckeep an eye on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Karkoska confirmed that, while on an investigation in an unmarked, stationary vehicle, he had seen the Mercedes in a residential area known for drugs. After seeing the Mercedes pass him several times, he became suspicious because he was not familiar with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>\n<em>The Stop, Removal from the Car, and Frisks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Hornberger first said that when the officers initially stopped the Mercedes, and before talking to the driver, to insure his safety or \u201cacquire a safe passage to speak to the operator of the vehicle,\u201d as he put it, he asked the rear-seat passenger, Campbell, to place his hands in plain sight. Campbell did not comply; he asked, \u201cIs that necessary?\u201d in an allegedly arrogant manner. Hornberger repeated his request and Campbell again refused to show his hands. After a third request, Campbell grunted in disgust and showed Hornberger his hands. Hornberger described Campbell as looking mean and angry. After reviewing the tapes Hornberger concluded that this exchange with Campbell occurred after he had asked the testers for their identification and after Armstrong, the front seat passenger, left the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Hornberger claimed that the tape revealed this incident, but his voice was \u201cfaint.\u201d Hornberger admitted that, apparently when viewing the tape from the sunroof camera, he could not hear his request that Campbell show his hands. However, Hornberger could hear Campbell say, \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">This exchange did not show up at any time on the film recorded by the rear view mirror or sunroof cameras. The film showed Hornberger approach the driver, Williamson, who asked if there was a problem; Hornberger responded, as he recalled in his deposition, that Williamson \u201cfailed to signal a lane change.\u201d Hornberger then asked Williamson for his license, registration and insurance card; Williamson produced them, and Hornberger pointed out that the insurance card had expired thirteen days earlier. Williamson looked for a valid insurance card. He could not find one. Hornberger testified he did not consider the insurance card \u201ca major problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">After this exchange, Tonkery asked Hornberger to get identification from the occupants of the Mercedes, which Hornberger did. This was the first time Hornberger addressed Campbell. Armstrong produced his identification, but, after a second request, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Campbell, in the back seat, touched his pocket and responded: \u201cI left mine at home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Hornberger then ordered Armstrong out of the car; Hornberger explained that he did so because Campbell did not produce identification and he wanted to ask Armstrong for Campbell\u2019s name. Armstrong recalled being \u201cpatted down.\u201d Hornberger explained that a frisk or a \u201cquick patdown\u201d was standard police procedure when a person is asked to leave a car, because of the officer\u2019s safety concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Campbell and Williamson remained in the car while the officers were frisking Armstrong. Campbell, watching them from the rear window of the car, twice said to Williamson, \u201cthat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d Williamson also observed that one of the officers had produced a club. No officer was present during this conversation between Campbell and Williamson; Hornberger admitted he was \u201ca little ways back\u201d behind the car when Campbell said this. Clearly, Campbell was not responding to Hornberger, who also admitted that Campbell\u2019s left arm was on the window, in plain view, at this time. Hornberger conceded in testimony it was possible that Campbell did not hear his request to place his hands in view, or that he did not make that request three times. We could not hear the request on the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">After a short time, Officer Mennuti, also a plaintiff, ordered Campbell out of the car. Campbell recalled responding \u201c[t]his ain\u2019t necessary.\u201d Campbell admitted that he was \u201c[sjhowing off for the camera.\u201d Mennuti recalled that when Campbell left the ear he said: \u201cI don\u2019t like cops.\u201d Campbell denied making this statement but Williamson did hear Campbell say that all cops were racists. The tapes did not record either of these statements. Mennuti explained that Campbell\u2019s \u201cdemeanor\u201d justified asking him to get out of the car. Campbell denied that he was obnoxious or surly, or that he was trying to antagonize the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Mennuti asked, \u201cWhat are you guys doing down here?\u201d The answer was inaudible but Mennuti recalled that Campbell answered, \u201cjust cruising.\u201d Hornberger then returned to Williamson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>who remained in the driver\u2019s seat, and asked him the name of the rear seat passenger (Raymond). Williamson answered \u201cRaymond,\u201d and Hornberger said that Armstrong said that it was \u201cJohn.\u201d Armstrong admitted that he made a mistake about Campbell\u2019s name. The two had only recently met. Soon after this, Hornberger ordered Williamson out of the car and frisked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>The Search of the Car</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The videotapes show Hornberger first, and Tonkery joining him later, thoroughly searching the car. The search was extensive, into every crevice and area of the passenger compartment. One of the officers asked \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag, forties,\u201d referring to beer and indicating a paper bag in the back seat. The answer is inaudible, but one of the testers, apparently Campbell, said, \u201cfind out.\u201d Campbell apparently also said that it was water, but this was not audible either. The officer responded, \u201cwater. All you had to do is answer me.\u201d The officers later looked into the bag, which contained a water bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Tonkery explained it was unnecessary to issue a summons because this was \u201can informative stop\u201d for the driver. Chief Knowles explained that the county had recently modified the intersection where the testers were stopped and the police were issuing warnings but not summonses. No tickets issued for careless driving, unsignaled lane change, or the absence of an insurance card.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">\n<em>The Views of Ogletree and Knowles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Martelli arranged for Quinones to interview, on camera, Harvard Law School Professor Ogletree on September 4, 1996 and Chief Knowles on September 20, 1996, after showing them an edited version of the films of the stop and search which she had prepared. Martelli believed that the excerpts she prepared \u201cshowed the most significant events.\u201d Martelli stated that she edited the tape, in part, because of its length and her program\u2019s time demands. Much of the original tape contained periods when nothing occurred or \u201cdead space,\u201d as Quinones put it. Ogletree and Knowles both realized that the tape had been edited.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>In his deposition, after he saw \u201cthe entire tape of the stop\u201d Ogletree maintained his initial position that the search was illegal and appeared to be racial profiling. He did not think that the editing of the tape misled or deceived him. He commented upon the absence of any evidence of consent to search the car. Ogle-tree did not think the answer, \u201ccheck it out,\u201d to the officer\u2019s question whether the paper bag contained \u201cforties,\u201d was permission to search the car or even the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Nor did Ogletree \u201cconsider the circumstances to be such ... that the officers were endangered.\u201d Ogletree concluded that the officers had no right to search the vehicle even when confronted with: (1) a tip from another officer that the same car was \u201cdriving around\u201d and \u201csuspicious\u201d; (2) no valid insurance card; (3) Campbell\u2019s lie that he had no identification and confusion about his name; and (4) Campbell\u2019s acting \u201cin a totally surly manner to the police officers.\u201d Ogletree commented that \u201call of us look surly when we\u2019re stopped by the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">When another factor was added, that the testers had no destination, Ogletree responded: \u201c[T]hat is the most innocent of statements possible in America.\u201d Ogletree said that he cruised around with no destination when he was a student, and his children cruise around on Friday and Saturday nights. When confronted with Campbell\u2019s statements that \u201call cops are racists\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t like cops,\u201d Ogletree conceded that, at that point, \u201cthe officers could reasonably have concern for their safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">This is the procedural context in which the case comes to us. Plaintiffs, the police officers, filed a Law Division complaint in March 1998 and an amended complaint in August 1999. They alleged that <em>PrimeTime Live </em>was a \u201ctabloid television show\u201d which \u201cpander[ed] to voyeuristic desires and other base emotions,\u201d demeaned and degraded others, invaded their privacy, and was a notorious user of \u201c[h]idden cameras, ambush interviews, trespass, spying, false impersonation, and stalking.\u201d Plaintiffs accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>defendants of interfering with police business while \u201cmanufacturing\u201d a story and a controversy about racial profiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Count One of the amended complaint alleged that the November 1996 broadcast of <em>PrimeTime Live </em>\u201cDWB\u201d falsely stated the car was searched illegally and without consent. It contained incorrect statements by Professor Ogletree that the search was illegal and racially motivated because the version of the film shown to Ogle-tree had material facts deleted. Martelli had shown Ogletree and Chief Knowles only an edited version of the film of the incident, recorded their opinions, and used excerpts of these recordings in the broadcast. The program allegedly contained an inaccurate statement of Knowles, \u201cit\u2019s called profiling,\u201d taken \u201cout of context to attribute it to the actions of plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Plaintiffs complained that the broadcast compared them to \u201cerrant police officers beating up others and generally running amuck [amok].\u201d They said that the broadcast falsely \u201caccuses and implies that [plaintiffs] are racists and profilers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The amended complaint alleged that the ABC executive defendants (all of the ABC defendants except Haft, Kleinman, Norfloss, White and the Wagonbergs, who were ABC\u2019s camera technicians) prepared the broadcast with knowledge of or reckless disregard of its falsity. They \u201cset up\u201d the story with hidden cameras, which \u201cper se accuse a person of wrongdoing,\u201d and they did not afford plaintiffs an opportunity to respond. Plaintiffs asserted that the ABC executive defendants maliciously injured their reputations, damaged their employment prospects, and subjected them to nationwide humiliation and ridicule, resulting in emotional distress. In Count Two of the amended complaint, plaintiffs accused the testers and the ABC executive defendants of placing them in a false light. Count Three of the amended complaint alleged that the defendants violated the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-1 to -34, by intercepting plaintiffs\u2019 oral communications during the search of the interior of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Count Four of the amended complaint accused the testers and the ABC executive defendants of fraud by failing to disclose the purpose of the stop and the hidden cameras. Plaintiffs also claimed Campbell, the rear-seat passenger, of fraudulently stating that he did not have identification. Plaintiffs demanded damages, costs, an apology, an opportunity to respond on ABC, destruction of the tapes, and forfeiture of defendants\u2019 surveillance devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">All defendants moved for summary judgment. Plaintiffs opposed both motions and cross-moved for summary judgment on their electronic surveillance claim. Judge Gamito heard oral argument on August 4 and issued a written opinion on August 25, 2000. He granted summary judgment to all defendants on all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. As noted, plaintiffs claim that the judge: (1) improperly dismissed the defamation and false light claims, (2) erred in dismissing the electronic surveillance claim, and (3) erred in dismissing the fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Plaintiffs contend that the judge erred in dismissing their defamation and false light claims because there were genuine issues of material fact. Plaintiffs assert that, contrary to the judge\u2019s findings, the statement in the broadcast that there was no consent to search the car was untrue. Plaintiffs contend that this statement in the broadcast, together with (1) Ogletree\u2019s opinion that the search was invalid, which was based on incorrect facts, (2) the omission of exculpatory factors, and (3) the implication that the stop and search represented racial profiling and plaintiffs were racists, constituted defamation and cast them in a false light. Plaintiffs assert that they produced substantial evidence of defendants\u2019 actual malice \u2014 that defendants\u2019 knew that their representations were false or they recklessly disregarded their falsehood.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The judge found that plaintiffs did not obtain consent to search the vehicle. Th\u00e9 judge found, despite Tonkery\u2019s claim that he obtained consent, that \u201cHornberger already [had] initiated the search\u201d without asking for permission. The judge determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>that the initial stop was warranted but the subsequent search of the testers and the Mercedes was \u201csorely lacking of justification\u201d and without probable cause. The judge found no evidence to support plaintiffs\u2019 allegations they reasonably feared for their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Regarding Ogletree\u2019s opinion that the search was improper, the judge recognized plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the \u201cheavily edited videotapes\u201d of the stop shown to Ogletree gave defendants \u201cample reason to doubt the accuracy of Ogletree\u2019s analysis.\u201d The judge did not discuss this argument further but commented there was no evidence that the tapes \u201cwere altered in any manner.\u201d Plaintiffs also contend that the judge erred in finding no evidence that the tape was edited. However, the judge did not find that the tape was unedited.

This standard protects the freedom of expression on public questions guaranteed by the First Amendment. Actual malice is knowledge that the statement was false or reckless disregard for its truth. <em>Ibid.; Lynch, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 165, 735 A.2d 1129. Summary judgment is favored in defamation cases to encourage comment on matters of public concern. <em>Lynch, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 169, 735 A.2d 1129. Plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof for each of the elements of defamation is by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Rocci v.

A false-light tort consists of publication of a falsity which significantly misrepresents the plaintiffs \u201ccharacter, history, activities or beliefs.\u201d <em>Romaine v. Kallinger, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>282, 295, 537 A.2d 284 (1988). The publication must be \u201chighly offensive to a reasonable person\u201d and must be made with knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity. <em>Kallinger, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 294, 537 A.2d 284 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 652E (1976)). As plaintiffs concede and the judge found, the actual malice standard applies to the false light claim to avoid violation of the First Amendment\u2019s protection of freedom of expression. <em>Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>46, 56, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>876, 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 41, 53 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We conclude the judge was correct. Plaintiffs failed to create a fact issue regarding the truth of the statement that the search was without consent. Whether the search was constitutionally reasonable is essentially a legal question, not, as plaintiffs assert, a statement of fact. Nevertheless, we think it appropriate to treat this issue as a fact question for the purpose of this defamation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>claim. As we discuss below, we agree with the judge that the search of the car was improper and Ogletree\u2019s opinion that it was illegal was correct. Because the statements in the broadcast that the search was without consent and illegal were true, we do not find it necessary to consider the issue of defendants\u2019 actual malice. We also find that other facts and circumstances which plaintiffs claim were improperly excised from the broadcast were not legally significant, as plaintiffs contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">\n<em>A. Consent to Search the Car</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We conclude the evidence that there was no consent to search was \u201cso one-sided\u201d that defendants \u201cmust prevail as a matter of law\u201d; a \u201cfair-minded jury\u201d could not reasonably find that there was consent to search the car on the basis of the evidence, especially in view of plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Liberty </em>Lobby, 477 <em>U.S. </em>at 252, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">All three testers denied that plaintiffs asked for permission to search. Hornberger admitted that he did not ask the driver for consent to search the car and the driver did not give him consent. Tonkery claimed that he asked Williamson whether there was any contraband in the vehicle; when Williamson responded \u201cno,\u201d Tonkery asked, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t mind if I looked, then, would you? And I believe he said no.\u201d This exchange is not on the tapes. Tonkery admitted that Hornberger initiated the search and could not recall whether his conversation about contraband with Williamson preceded the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Hornberger, who initiated the search, admitted that he did not have consent. Tonkery \u201cbelieved\u201d that Williamson gave him consent to search but was uncertain that this conversation occurred before Tonkery commenced his participation in the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The right to refuse is an essential element of a voluntary consent to search. <em>State v. Suazo, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>315, 319-20, 627 A.2d 1074 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Many persons, perhaps most, would view the request of a police officer to make a search as having the force of law. Unless it is shown by the State that the person involved knew that he had the right to refuse to accede to such a request, his assenting to the search is not meaningful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\"><em>[State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 354, 346 A.2d 66 (1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The police need not necessarily advise the person of the right to refuse, as long as the State can prove the person was aware of this right. <em>Ibid. </em>Once a search has begun, there is no effective right to refuse. Therefore, consent given after the search has begun is neither voluntary nor meaningful. <em>Cf. State v. Gredder, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>420, 424, 725 A.2d 713 (App.Div.1999) (\u201ccapitulation to the requests of the police does not amount to a voluntary delivery\u201d of a controlled dangerous substance for the purpose of acquiring immunity from prosecution for possession). Consent given after a search has begun does not validate the search from its inception. In <em>State v. Weaver, </em>319 <em>Or. </em>212, 874 P.2d 1322, 1327-28 (1994), Oregon\u2019s highest court held that consent to search given after the police had already searched and seized several items was not retroactive because there was no evidence defendant intended that his consent \u201crelated back\u201d to the beginning of the search. <em>See </em>K. Winbush, Annotation, <em>Effect of Retroactive Consent on Legality of Otherwise Unlawful Search and Seizure, </em>76 <em>A.L.R. </em>5th 563 (2000). Indeed, Tonkery effectively conceded that he did not obtain permission to search. When Martelli was in Jamesburg on the day of Knowles\u2019s interview, she asked Tonkery and Hornberger why they did not ask for consent. They responded that they did not need to ask. No written consent to search was requested or even considered by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Knowles testified the officers told him \u201cthat they had permission to search the vehicle.\u201d Carole Butewicz, the Jamesburg court administrator, testified she was present during Knowles\u2019s interview. She recalled that during a break when the cameras were still, Knowles asked Quinones whether the officers requested permission to search the car. Quinones then asked a person whom Butewicz believed was the producer, who answered, \u201cI believe they did, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>This did not create a genuine fact issue. Butewicz did not explain why she believed that person was the producer. Martelli, the producer, probably would not have addressed Quinones, her subordinate (or anyone else), as \u201csir.\u201d Chief Knowles, who, according to Butewicz, initially addressed the question to Quinones, said that this did not occur. Quinones also denied that this occurred. There was no corroboration of this statement, although others were present. Finally, if the officers had obtained consent to search, as Chief Knowles said they \u201cindicated\u201d to him, Knowles likely would have come forward and relayed this to Martelli when given another opportunity to respond shortly before the broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Campbell\u2019s alleged consent to search the bag containing the water bottle occurred after the search of the car had started, and was limited to the bag. <em>See State v. Leslie, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>269, 273-75, 768 A.2d 818 (App.Div.2001) (consent to search the passenger compartment of a car for identification did not authorize a search of the trunk); <em>State v. Younger, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 256, 702 A.2d 477 (App.Div.1997) (\u201cwhen police rely on a consent to search, the search that may be conducted thereto is limited by the scope, whether express or implied, of the consent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">A reasonable jury could not find that the officers obtained permission to search the car. Because the statement in the broadcast that there was no permission to search the car was factually true, it is unnecessary to consider whether defendants published it with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">\n<em>B. Ogletree\u2019s Opinion that the Search of the Car was Improper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Plaintiffs contend that Ogletree\u2019s broadcast opinion that the search of the car appeared illegal, was based on incorrect and incomplete facts, making it both false and defamatory. In <em>Lynch, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 167, 735 A.2d 1129, the Court explained: \u201cStatements of opinion, like unverifiable statements of fact, generally cannot be proved true or false. Opinion statements reflect a state of mind____[They] do not trigger liability unless they imply false underlying objective facts.\u201d <em>See also Turf Lawnmower </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>Repair v. Bergen Record Corp., </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>392, 418, 655 A.2d 417 (1995) (on discretion and judgment in the editorial process).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We agree with Ogletree, the judge and defendants that the search of the car was improper. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, Ogletree\u2019s opinion was not based on false or incomplete facts simply because the ABC defendants showed him the edited version of the tape: he maintained his position that the search was improper after he saw the full tapes and was apprised of allegedly inculpatory circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Ogletree admitted that the plaintiffs could have had a reasonable concern for their safety when confronted with Campbell\u2019s belligerent remarks upon leaving the car \u2014 that he did not like cops and all cops were racists \u2014 but Ogletree did not state that the search was therefore valid. Campbell\u2019s remarks followed and resulted from the plaintiffs\u2019 improper removal of the passengers from the car and the frisking of the testers. Campbell\u2019s remarks did not justify the prior removal from the car or the subsequent search of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution protect citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures and provide for warrants, issued upon probable cause, describing the place to be searched and the thing to be seized. The Court established an exception to this probable-cause requirement in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 27, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 909 (1968), allowing a police officer to \u201cstop and frisk\u201d a person whom the officer reasonably believes is armed and dangerous, when the officer does not have probable cause to make an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The Court expanded this exception to allow a protective search of the passenger compartment of an automobile, to locate weapons, if the officer reasonably believes \u201cthat the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>1032, 1049, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>3469, 3481, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201, 1220 (1983) (footnote omitted). The Court explained that the officer\u2019s reasonable belief must be based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u201cspecific and articulable facts ... taken together with the rational inferences from those facts.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 21, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1880, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 906). The New Jersey Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe <em>Michigan v. Long </em>rule is sound and compelling precedent and should be followed to protect New Jersey\u2019s police community.\u201d <em>State v. Lund, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>35, 48, 573 A.2d 1376 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Here, if the inquiry were limited to the circumstances immediately preceding the search of the car, we might agree with plaintiffs that their belief they were in danger could possibly be considered reasonable. The specific facts supporting such a belief were Campbell\u2019s antagonistic remarks, made when leaving the car. Viewing the evidence favorably to plaintiffs, as required on this motion for summary judgment, <em>Brill, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146, it appears, as Ogletree conceded, that these expressions of hostility might have caused reasonable police officers legitimate concern that their safety was endangered.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In addition, our Court in <em>Lund </em>mentioned \u201clying to the police\u201d and \u201cthe absence of identification\u201d as factors that, together with \u201c \u2018furtive\u2019 movements or gestures by a motorist,\u201d might \u201cripen into a reasonable suspicion that the person may be armed and dangerous.\u201d 119 <em>N.J. </em>at 48, 573 A.2d 1376. Here, the officers\u2019 concern for their safety might have been buttressed by Campbell\u2019s rejection of their demand to produce his identification, which the officers later discovered when they frisked him, and Armstrong\u2019s incorrect statement about Campbell\u2019s first name.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">However, Campbell\u2019s remarks, Armstrong\u2019s incorrect statement of Campbell\u2019s name, and the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery of Campbell\u2019s identification, followed upon and were caused by the officers\u2019 improper removal of the passengers from the car and improper frisking of all three testers. Campbell\u2019s hostile remarks, when considered in the context of his spontaneous response to improper police action directed against him, are not nearly as threatening as they would be in circumstances in which the officers were less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>aggressive in pursuing a criminal investigation consequent upon a routine traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">If the initial stop is unjustified, then the subsequent search is invalid and any contraband obtained from it is inadmissible as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>State v. Maryland, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>471, 489, 771 A.2d 1220 (2001). For example, in <em>State v. Carty, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>200, 208, 753 A.2d 149 (App.Div.), <em>affirmed, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>632, 790 A.2d 903 (2002), we held that a pat-down of a passenger was invalid when its only justification was an improper consent to search the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The United States Supreme Court applied similar reasoning in <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>106, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977). There, an officer stopped defendant for driving with an expired license plate, ordered him out of the car, noticed a large bulge in his jacket, frisked him, and discovered a loaded revolver in his waistband. 434 <em>U.S. </em>at 107, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 331, 54 L.Ed.2d at 334. The Court deferred considering the legality of the frisk, first addressing \u201cthe incremental intrusion resulting from the request to get out of the car.\u201d 434 <em>U.S. </em>at 109, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 332, 54 L.Ed.2d at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The Court realized the absence of any reason to suspect that the driver presented a danger, but determined that the additional intrusion of the order to get out of the car, when the initial stop was justified, was \u201cde minimus\u201d or \u201ca mere inconvenience,\u201d that \u201ccannot prevail when balanced against legitimate concerns for the officer\u2019s safety.\u201d 434 <em>U.S. </em>at 111, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 333, 54 L.Ed.2d at 337 (footnote omitted). The Court then determined that the frisk was justified under <em>Terry, </em>when the officer saw the bulge in defendants\u2019 jacket. 434 <em>U.S. </em>at 111-12, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 334, 54 L.Ed.2d at 337-38. Presumably, the Court would have invalidated the frisk if it had determined that the initial removal of the defendant from the car was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Here, as the Law Division judge found, the initial stop was justified; the driver, Williamson, admitted that he probably did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>not use his signal when changing lanes. Nevertheless, the officers\u2019 improper \u201cincremental intrusion,\u201d <em>Mimms, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>at 109, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 332, 54 L.Ed.2d at 336, rendered the ultimate search of the ear constitutionally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">This incremental intrusion was the removal of the two passengers from the car and the frisking of all three testers. The removal of the driver from the car was permissible under <em>Mimms. </em>In <em>State v. Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>599, 616-17, 637 A.2d 158 (1994), our Court declined to extend <em>Mimms </em>to passengers and to enable police officers to routinely order passengers from their vehicle during a traffic stop. Our Court reasoned that the \u201cintrusion on the passenger\u2019s privacy ... is greater than it is on the driver\u2019s privacy,\u201d because the passenger \u201chas not engaged in the culpable conduct that resulted in the vehicle\u2019s stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615, 637 A.2d 158. Admitting that being asked to leave the vehicle was not \u201ca major intrusion,\u201d the Court found that it \u201cnevertheless amounts to an intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 637 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">For ordering occupants out of a vehicle during a routine stop for a traffic violation, in order to adequately protect police officers, the Court announced a standard of \u201cheightened caution,\u201d more stringent than the <em>\u201cMimms per se </em>rule,\u201d but less stringent than the <em>Terry </em>rule. <em>Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 637 A.2d 158.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APl\">[T]he officer need not point to specific facts that the occupants are \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d Bather, the officer need point only to some fact or facts in the totality of the circumstances that would create in a police officer a heightened awareness of danger that would warrant an objectively reasonable officer in securing the scene in a more effective manner by ordering the passenger to alight from the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The Court elaborated that \u201cthe officer must be able to articulate specific reasons why the person\u2019s gestures or other circumstances caused the officer to expect more danger from this traffic stop than from other routine traffic stops.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 637 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">In <em>Smith, </em>the Court concluded that the circumstances were sufficient to warrant the order that the passengers leave the vehicle: the occupants had made suspicious movements in the car; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>it was 2:29 a.m.; and the Turnpike, where the stop occurred, was deserted. <em>Id. </em>at 619-20, 637 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Here, in contrast, to justify the removal of the passengers from the car, plaintiffs can point to nothing other than Campbell\u2019s failure to produce identification. Although Campbell displayed displeasure in his demeanor and attitude at being asked for identification, he was not threatening and there were no gestures or other circumstances which indicated that Campbell or the other testers might pose a danger. A passenger\u2019s lack of identification alone does not create a heightened awareness of danger in a reasonable police officer or warrant securing the scene. <em>See State v. Lark, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>618, 624, 726 A.2d 294 (App.Div.1999), <em>aff'd. o.b., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>294, 748 A.2d 1103 (2000) (a driver\u2019s inability to produce his license, and lying to the officer about his identity did not constitute cause for the officer\u2019s concern about his safety). <em>Cf. State v. Carty, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 204-07, 753 A.2d 149 (at a traffic stop for speeding, the driver\u2019s inability to produce credentials did not justify asking consent to search the car), <em>affirmed, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>632, 790 A.2d 903 (2002). Our Supreme Court spelled this out clearly when affirming Judge Pressler\u2019s <em>Carty </em>decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">We agree with the Appellate Division that consent searches following a lawful stop of a motor vehicle should not be deemed valid under <em>[State v.] Johnson, </em>[68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 346 A.2d 66 (1975) ] unless there is reasonable and articulable suspicion to believe that an errant motorist or passenger has engaged in, or is about to engage in, criminal activity. In other words, we are expanding the <em>Johnson </em>two-part constitutional standard and holding that unless there is a reasonable and articulable basis beyond the initial valid motor vehicle stop to continue the detention after completion of the valid traffic stop, any further detention to effectuate a consent search is unconstitutional. A suspicionless consent search shall be deemed unconstitutional whether it preceded or followed completion of the lawful traffic stop. The requirement of reasonable and articulable suspicion is derived from our State Constitution and serves to validate the continued detention associated with the search. <em>It also serves the prophylactic purpose of preventing the police from turning a routine traffic stop into a fishing expedition for criminal activity unrelated to the stop. Indeed, our holding is consistent with both the State Police Standard Operating Procedures and the Consent Decree that was entered into by the State Police on December 29, 1999. Carty, supra, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 206, 753 A.2d 149.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 647, 790 A.2d 903; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>We are controlled by the decision of our Supreme Court in <em>Carty. </em>The Court has ordered that its judgment in <em>Carty </em>\u201cshall apply to all cases pending in the trial court and on direct appeal as of June 23, 2000.\u201d - <em>N.J. </em>-, 2002 <em>WL </em>788754*1. This complaint was filed in 1999 and Judge Garruto\u2019s decision was issued in August 2000. This case was thus pending in the trial court on June 23, 2000. <em>See also, State v. Yanovsky, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 10-11, 773 A.2d 711 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">None of the officers testified in depositions that they removed the passengers from the car because of possible danger or a desire to secure the scene. To the contrary, Hornberger explained that he ordered Armstrong out of the car simply to ask him what Campbell\u2019s name was. In <em>State v. Carty, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 209, 753 A.2d 149, this court considered other alternatives available to the trooper to protect his safety, less intrusive than a pat-down. The Court in <em>Smith </em>explained that, once an occupant is removed from the vehicle, in order to justify a \u201cpat-down\u201d the officer must state \u201cspecific, articulable facts\u201d to show that a \u201creasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\u201d 134 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 637 A.2d 158 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 27, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 909). The Court in <em>Mimms </em>concurred that the standard set forth in <em>Terry </em>also applied to determine whether a frisk of the driver was proper, once the police ordered the driver out of the vehicle during a routine traffic stop. 434 <em>U.S. </em>at 111-12, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 334, 54 L.Ed.2d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Here again, there were no facts which would cause a reasonably prudent officer to believe that his safety was in danger. Campbell\u2019s hostile comments cannot justify the frisks or pat-downs of the testers because the officers had already decided to frisk them, and had already removed Armstrong from the car and frisked him, before Campbell stepped from the car and made his remarks. Hornberger explained that a frisk or \u201cquick patdown\u201d was standard police procedure when a person was asked to leave a vehicle. Plaintiffs made no attempt to justify the pat-downs on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>specific facts to show that they believed they were in danger, as required by <em>Smith </em>and <em>Mimms. </em>Thus, the frisks of all three testers were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In <em>State v. Carty, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 208, 753 A.2d 149, we rejected a rationale similar to that of the officers here, that the pat-down of defendant-passenger was necessary because the trooper was concerned about turning his back on the occupants of the car while searching it. Defendant-passenger in <em>Carty, </em>like Campbell here, failed to produce identification. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 753 A.2d 149. Even with the additional factor, not present here, that the defendant in <em>Carty </em>\u201cappeared to be nervous,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>this court held that the trooper did not have \u201cany reasonable belief in a threat to his safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 753 A.2d 149. Here also, Campbell\u2019s failure to produce identification was not a basis for a reasonable belief that he was dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Our Supreme Court recently took a similar approach in <em>State v. Dangerfield, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>446, 795 A.2d 250 (2002). There, defendant was improperly arrested for trespassing at a public housing complex. 171 <em>N.J. </em>at 457, 795 A.2d 250. The officer searched his person and found cocaine in his pocket. <em>Id. </em>451, 795 A.2d 250. The Court held that the search was improper because there were no \u201carticulable facts of potential danger\u201d to justify a protective search for weapons, as required by <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>at 1049, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3481, 77 L.Ed.2d at 1220, and <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 21, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1880, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 906. 171 <em>N.J. </em>at 463-64, 795 A.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In contrast, in <em>State v. Roach, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>19, 796 A.2d 214 (2002), a search of defendant\u2019s person, after he was stopped for motor vehicle violations, was justified. The officers reasonably feared for their safety because defendant was intoxicated and nervous, failed to produce a driver\u2019s license, tried to leave the scene, reached for a prominent bulge at his waist, disobeyed one of the officer\u2019s orders, and had to be restrained. 172 <em>N.J. </em>at 28-29, 796 A.2d 214. Here, as in <em>Dangerfield </em>but unlike <em>Roach, </em>there was no reason for plaintiffs to believe that any of the testers were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>dangerous before they were removed from the car and the criminal investigation pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Plaintiffs cite several circumstances which, they argue, gave them cause to believe that the testers posed a threat. However, none justified plaintiffs\u2019 removing the passengers from the car, then frisking all three testers, and searching the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">1. The car was cruising in a \u201chigh drug\u201d area on another occasion. Sergeant Karkoska had previously seen the Mercedes in a high drug area and was suspicious simply because he was not familiar with the car. Unfamiliarity does not indicate danger and the car was not in a high drug area when stopped. No officer had run a license check on the Mercedes. Officers Karkoska and Morton, of the narcotics detail, both testified they had \u201cnoticed\u201d the Mercedes earlier but never suspected its occupants of buying or selling drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">2. Plaintiffs assert that Williamson was driving erratically and nearly collided with the police car. However, Hornberger advised Williamson only that he had \u201cfailed to signal a lane change.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to issue a summons, to mention this offense to Williamson at the time, or before the plaintiffs were deposed, undermine the importance of this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">3. The insurance card had expired. An expired insurance card does not indicate that the occupants of a car are dangerous. <em>Cf. State v. Carty, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 204, 753 A.2d 149 (a driver\u2019s failure to produce credentials does not justify a search of the vehicle), and <em>State v. Lark, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 626, 726 A.2d 294 (a driver\u2019s failing to produce a license and lying about his identity does not justify a search of the vehicle). Hornberger admitted that he did not consider the expired insurance card \u201ca major problem,\u201d and no tickets were issued for careless driving, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-97; or illegal lane change without proper signal, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-85, -88, or failure to have a proper identification insurance card, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>4. It was \u201clate at night,\u201d approximately 9:30 p.m., when the incident occurred. This hour is not late compared to the 2:29 a.m. on the Turnpike considered late in <em>Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 604, 637 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">5. Campbell told Officer Mennuti, when asked, that the testers had no destination. This must have occurred after Campbell was removed from the car, because it does not appear on the interior car tapes. It thus could not justify the removal of the testers from the car or their frisks, because the plaintiffs had already made the decision to remove the occupants from the car and frisk them before this exchange occurred. In addition, as Ogletree pointed out, driving without a destination does not suggest danger or criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">6. There were suspicious items, the cosmetic case and the bottle in the paper bag, in the ear. When asked in his deposition why the water bottle was in a bag instead of in plain view, Campbell said: \u201cI assume to give a suspicion that we were drinking.\u201d Williamson said that the water bottle was in a paper bag because it came from the store that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, Martelli did not state that she or anyone else placed the cosmetic ease in the car to arouse suspicion. In <em>State v. Maryland, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 488, 771 A.2d 1220, the Court declined to consider a paper bag, which the defendant put into the waist of his pants, as suspicious-in the absence of any circumstances that might lead the officers to believe it contained contraband. Also here, regardless of the testers\u2019 motives for carrying the cosmetic case and paper bag in the ear, plaintiffs point to no circumstances which could have led them to believe these parcels contained contraband. Motorists are not required to remove their personal possessions from the passenger compartments of their cars in order to avoid police suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Moreover, none of the plaintiffs mentioned any of these factors in explaining why they believed that they were in danger. To the contrary, both Hornberger and Tonkery testified only that Camp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>bell\u2019s actions and attitude led them to believe that they might be in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The remaining circumstances on which plaintiffs rely pertain to Campbell\u2019s behavior. His refusal to comply with Hornberger\u2019s request that he show his hands does not appear on the tapes. His hostile comments, the discovery that he was lying about not having identification, and his response to one of the officers to look in the bag did not occur until after plaintiffs had ordered the occupants from the car, so these factors cannot justify that action. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, Campbell\u2019s actions did not appear to be evasive, or suggest that he was hiding something.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Finally, it is extremely dubious whether plaintiffs were justified in demanding identification from the passengers at the outset of the encounter. Plaintiffs cite <em>State v. Wilcox, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 435 A.2d 569 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>491, 443 A.2d 706 (1981), in support of their argument that the request for identification was proper, but there the police reasonably suspected defendant, a pedestrian, of the commission of other crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 454-57, 435 A.2d 569. In addition, this court in <em>State v. Lark, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 629, 726 A.2d 294, declined to follow <em>Wilcox </em>to the extent that <em>Wilcox </em>\u201cappears to recognize an exception to the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment to search for identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Alexander, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 575, 468 A.2d 713 (App.Div.1983), <em>certif. denied, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>267, 475 A.2d 570 (1984), also cited by plaintiffs, the officers demanded that defendant, a pedestrian, produce identification after they saw him passing money to another person in a high drug area. We determined this constituted a slight but reasonable basis to suspect that defendant was engaged in a drug transaction and justified the request for identification. <em>Id. </em>at 577, 468 A.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Here, unlike in <em>Wilcox </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>plaintiffs did not reasonably suspect the passengers of any crime when they demanded their identification. The passengers had done nothing more suspi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>cious than riding in a car whose driver failed to signal a lane change.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We have recently addressed the propriety of a police officer\u2019s request for identification from a driver of a car. In <em>State v. Sirianni, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 390, 790 A.2d 206 (App.Div.2002), we declined to adopt a per se rule that, before requesting identification from a person who is lawfully in a public place, police are constitutionally required to have a reasonable suspicion that this person has committed a crime. We emphasized that \u201cmere inquiries\u201d require no constitutional justification, <em>id. </em>at 387, 790 A.2d 206, and do not constitute detention \u201cin the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 790 A.2d 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We \u201ccontinue to adhere to the general standard of reasonableness, measured against the totality of the circumstances including, in the mix, the seriousness of the criminal activity and the degree of police intrusion involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 790 A.2d 206. In <em>Sirianni, </em>the request for identification was justified because the police were staking out a residence while looking for a homicide suspect. Defendant drove to the home under surveillance at 2:20 a.m., stayed in his car, and appeared to observe the police. <em>Id. </em>at 385, 790 A.2d 206. We commented that \u201cthe officers would have been derelict in their duties if they had failed to investigate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 790 A.2d 206. In addition, the police conduct in <em>Sirianni </em>was not overbearing or harassing; they did not restrain defendant, issue orders, or accuse him of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In contrast, in the case before us, the officers were not investigating a crime, and there was no cause to suspect that the testers were armed, dangerous, or involved in any criminal activity. Although this alone does not render a request for identification unreasonable, under <em>Sirianni, </em>it is one of the circumstances for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Weighing the degree of police intrusion, the court in <em>Sirianni </em>noted that \u201cnothing in the encounter conveyed to defendant that he was not free to refuse the officers\u2019 request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392, 790 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>A.2d 206. In the case before us, Campbell was not free to refuse the request: when he failed to produce his identification, the officers ordered all of the occupants out of the car and frisked them. The degree of the police intrusion was substantial, escalating from a simple request for identification to a frisking of all three testers, and then a search of the car. Considering the totality of these circumstances, in accordance with the principles expressed in <em>Sirianni, </em>the initial request for the passengers\u2019 identification was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">There are no New Jersey cases which address whether an officer may demand a passenger\u2019s identification after stopping a vehicle for a routine traffic violation and the out-of-state authority is split. In <em>State v. Larson, </em>93 Wash.2d 638, 611 P.2d 771, 773-74 (1980); <em>People v. Gonzalez, </em>324 Ill.App.3d 15, 257 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>583, 753 N.E.2d 1209, 1214-15 (Ill.App.Ct.), <em>appeal allowed, </em>197 <em>Ill.2d </em>571, 261 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>525, 763 <em>N.E.2d 774 </em>(2001); and <em>Commonwealth v. Alvarez, </em>44 <em>Mass.App.Ct. </em>531, 692 <em>N.E.2d </em>106, 107-09 (1998), the courts held that asking a passenger in a car for identification, without any reasonable grounds to suspect criminal activity, violated either the Fourth Amendment or the state constitution. In <em>Alvarez, </em>692 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 109, the court commented that \u201ca random request for identification papers constitutes ... the sort of request uncomfortably associated with authoritarian societies and most commonly made of persons belonging to a racial or ethnic minority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On the other hand, in <em>People v. Jackson, </em>13 P.3d 838, 840-43 (Colo.Ct.App.2000), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>39 P.3d 1174 (Colo.2002); <em>People v. O\u2019Neal, </em>32 P.3d 533, 537-38 (Colo.Ct.App. 2001); <em>State v. Jones, </em>270 <em>Kan. </em>526, 17 P.3d 359, 360 (2001); <em>State v. Landry, </em>588 So.2d 345, 345-47 (La.1991); and <em>Johnson v. State, </em>537 So.2d 117, 120 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989), the courts held that officers may ask passengers in cars stopped for motor vehicle violations for identification, without any reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>We favor the view that the request for the passengers\u2019 identification here was improper. This view is the most consistent with our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carty </em>and the prophylactic purpose of discouraging the police from turning a routine traffic stop into a \u201cfishing expedition for criminal activity unrelated to the stop.\u201d <em>State v. Carty, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 632, 790 A.2d 903. There were no facts or circumstances to justify either removing the passengers from the car or frisking the three testers. The search of the car which followed was also improper, because it was consequent upon these prior, unjustified actions. We thus find it unnecessary to consider plaintiffs\u2019 argument that defendants broadcast Ogle-tree\u2019s opinion that the search of the car was illegal with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">\n<em>C. Other Factors Omitted from the Broadcast</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Plaintiffs contend that defendants\u2019 omission of a host of events from the broadcast resulted in a defamatory portrayal and constituted evident actual malice. Plaintiffs are incorrect that one of these events, Campbell\u2019s failure to produce identification, was omitted from \u201cDWB.\u201d Campbell\u2019s statement that he did not have identification was included in the broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Plaintiffs are also incorrect that the testers were \u201c \u2018driving and driving\u2019 around Jamesburg to \u2018heighten suspicions\u2019 of the police.\u201d Campbell said that, on the night they were stopped, they had been circling in Jamesburg for a couple of minutes. The testers had been cruising for approximately twenty hours before they were stopped, but this occurred on four different nights, over six weeks, and in other towns as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Many of the omitted events were the circumstances that plaintiffs allege justified the search of the car careless driving, cruising in a high-crime area, the placement of the cosmetic case and water bottle in the back seat, an invalid insurance card, confusion about Campbell\u2019s name, having no stated destination, and Campbell\u2019s hostile comments. Because the search of the car was unreasonable notwithstanding these circumstances, their inclusion would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>not have significantly softened the impact, as portrayed in \u201cDWB,\u201d and are not as important as plaintiffs contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The search was improper because plaintiffs had no reason to suspect that they were in danger when they removed the passengers from the car and frisked the three testers. This improper police action, not the omission of extraneous or minimally ameliorating circumstances, was the conduct which potentially lowered plaintiffs\u2019 reputation in the community. <em>See Lynch, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 166-68, 735 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Plaintiffs object to the omission during the search of Campbell\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d to look in the paper bag in the back seat which contained the water bottle, while showing Ogletree\u2019s disapproval of the officer\u2019s opening the bag. Again, Campbell\u2019s consent was not as significant as plaintiffs contend. Tonkery or Hornberger asked \u201cwhat\u2019s in the bag, forties?\u201d and Campbell responded, \u201c[w]hy don\u2019t you find out?\u201d This was a casual and flippant response to the inquiry, rather than a formal consent to search. In addition, it occurred after the search of the car had started. Very likely, the officers would have looked in the bag regardless of Campbell\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Plaintiffs contest the part of the broadcast in which Quinones related that ABC, through Martelli, returned to the intersection where the plaintiffs stopped the testers and observed that many cars changed lanes without signaling but none were stopped. Plaintiffs contend that Martelli counted cars at the wrong intersection. There is no evidence that Martelli returned to the wrong intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Plaintiffs also protest the part of the broadcast in which Chief Knowles said, \u201cit\u2019s called profiling.\u201d Plaintiffs are correct that when Chief Knowles said this in his interview he was referring to the practice of profiling in general, not this particular incident. On \u201cDWB,\u201d Knowles\u2019s statement was inserted after Ogletree\u2019s comment that Tonkery suspected the testers of having \u201cdope\u201d because the testers were African-American men in a late-model car at night. Chief Knowles continued to explain profiling and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>stated that he did not agree with it. Knowles\u2019s comment, \u201cit\u2019s called profiling,\u201d thus appears reasonably to refer to the general practice, not to this specific incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Even if Knowles\u2019s comment is interpreted to refer to the \u201cDWB\u201d incident, when viewed as a whole, in accordance with the Court\u2019s direction in <em>Romaine v. Kallinger, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 537 A.2d 284, it accurately represented Knowles\u2019s position. It included Knowles\u2019s statements that there was probable cause to stop the Mercedes because of the traffic violation, the search was \u201cgood,\u201d it was borderline whether plaintiffs should have asked permission to search, and no apology was necessary because the plaintiffs were \u201cdoing their job.\u201d The inclusion of these statements gave the impression that Knowles did not believe that plaintiffs were guilty of profiling, although the broadcast later included his admissions that the incident might be profiling and Tonkery was wrong to assume' that there was \u201cdope\u201d in the cosmetic ease. Knowles also testified that ABC was \u201cfair minded\u201d with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Several other factors cited by plaintiffs did not justify the search, soften its impact, or rehabilitate plaintiffs\u2019 reputation. Those factors are:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">1. The testers were^ cruising for twenty hours on four nights before they were stopped. As Martelli pointed out, although twenty hours seems like a long time, most people are not stopped by the police \u201cevery 20 hours they are on the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">2. The testers failed to follow the advice of an attorney to have their credentials and identification in order, to cooperate with the police, and to use signals. The testers\u2019 disregard of the attorney\u2019s advice did not justify the search or mitigate plaintiffs\u2019 improper conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">3. Phillips, the co-producer, was the cousin of Diane Armstrong, the owner of the Mercedes. Plaintiffs were not aware of this when they stopped and searched the car, and it has no relevance to plaintiffs\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>4. The testers\u2019 comments indicated that they wanted to harm plaintiffs. On May 18, six weeks earlier, when the testers were cruising but were not stopped, Armstrong said, \u201cSon of a b.... We had them pussies.\u201d When the testers drove away after the videotaped incident, Williamson said, \u201cpow\u201d and Campbell said \u201cfired.\u201d At his deposition, Campbell said that it was \u201can exciting experience.\u201d Anna Sims Phillips testified that the testers \u201cwanted to go out that evening for a party and they were hoping to be finished soon.\u201d Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, this discussion occurred when the producers and the testers met in a restaurant after the taped incident. The testers hoped to finish that meeting quickly, not finish the test quickly. Plaintiffs allege that Campbell commented to Williamson, while the plaintiffs were frisking Armstrong, that if he had produced identification, the police would not have removed Armstrong from the car. Campbell\u2019s comment was inaudible to us, but plaintiffs\u2019 claim is plausible because Williamson told Campbell that he should have produced his identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">None of these comments proves that the testers desired to injure the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are correct that they were fooled because the testers were driving around in the Mercedes for the purpose of inducing police officers to stop them. Nevertheless, plaintiffs had no cause to suspect that the testers were dangerous when plaintiffs removed them from the car and frisked them. The comments which plaintiffs cite do not justify or explain plaintiffs\u2019 conduct or reflect favorably upon plaintiffs\u2019 reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We conclude that the judge correctly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 defamation and false light claims. The broadcast\u2019s statements that the search of the ear was improper and without consent were true. Moreover, they constituted expressions of legal opinion, and Ogle-tree\u2019s opinion that the search was invalid was plausible. Exculpatory factors, which plaintiffs claim were omitted from the broadcast, were not significant. Because of this, we find it unnecessary to reach the question of actual malice, i.e., whether defendants broadcast false material with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard of its falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Plaintiffs next claim that the judge erred in rejecting their claim that defendants violated the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-1 to -34 (the Act). Plaintiffs\u2019 claims go only to the portion of the tape which recorded Hornberger and Tonkery searching the car in the absence of the testers. During this search Tonkery said that there was \u201cprobably dope\u201d in the locked cosmetic case. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are premised on lack of consent to this conversational recording, a portion of which was disclosed in the broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Tonkery and Hornberger submitted unsigned, unsworn declarations that, while they were searching the Mercedes, they directed all of their statements solely to each other and believed that no one else could hear them. They explained that the testers were standing outside of the vehicle at that time and were not listening or speaking to Tonkery and Hornberger. Tonkery and Hornberger obviously did not consent to the taping.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">\u201cOral communication\u201d is defined as \u201cany oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The Act provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">any person who: a. Purposely intercepts ... any ... oral communication ... or b. Purposely discloses ... to any other person the contents of any ... oral communication ... knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a[n] ... oral communication ... shall be guilty of a crime in the third degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">The Act creates a civil cause of action for damages by any aggrieved person against the person who intercepted or disclosed their oral communication. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">In <em>State v. Diaz, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 513-16, 706 A.2d 264 (App.Div.1998), we held that a videotape was admissible in a prosecution of a \u201cnanny\u201d for assaulting and endangering the welfare of a child, because the baby vicariously consented through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>her parents. We observed that the New Jersey Act was modeled after Title III of the Federal Omnibus Crime Control Act and Safe Streets Act, 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2510 to 2520. Our interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2 and -3 followed the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2510 and 2511, which are \u201csubstantially similar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509-10, 706 A.2d 264. The definition of \u201coral communication\u201d is identical in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2(b) and 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2510(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Although neither party nor the judge raised this issue, the court in <em>Diaz </em>\u201cfollow[ed] the federal lead\u201d and concluded that the New Jersey Act did not apply to the video portion of the videotape. <em>Id. </em>at 512, 706 A.2d 264. Here also, we conclude that the Act does not apply to the video portion of the film. Our inquiry is limited to the audio part of the recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Plaintiffs incorrectly claim that the Act does not require that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy for their conversation to be covered. They cite <em>Diaz </em>in support of this contention, but there we declined to consider the issue because we held that the audio portion of the recording was admissible based upon vicarious consent. <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>State v. Tirelli, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>628, 637, 506 A.2d 797 (App.Div.1986), we acknowledged that the definition of \u201coral communication\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2(b) encompassed an expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In <em>PBA Local No. 38 v. Woodbridge Police Dep\u2019t, </em>832 <em>F.Supp. </em>808, 819 (D.N.J.1993), concluding that telephone conversations were wire communications, not oral communications, under both the federal and New Jersey Acts, the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">Courts interpreting [the definition of \u201coral communication\u201d in the federal and New Jersey Acts] have opined that the \u201cexpectation of privacy\u201d language in the statute was intended to parallel the language and standard of <em>Katz [v. U.S., </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>347, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)], making the \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d highly relevant to claimed interceptions of oral conversations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">In <em>Katz, </em>the Court held that the Government\u2019s recording of the petitioner\u2019s end of conversations in a telephone booth \u201cviolated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and thus constituted a \u2018search and seizure\u2019 within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 389 <em>U.S. </em>at 353, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 512, 19 L.Ed.2d at 583. As defendants point out, most federal courts have used this standard in applying Title III of the Federal Omnibus Crime Control Act and Safe Streets Act. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v. Peoples, </em>250 F.3d 630, 637 (8th Cir.2001) (recordings of conversations between a prisoner and his visitor at a correctional facility were admissible under the federal wiretap law because the individuals had no reasonable expectation of privacy in that conversation); <em>Kee v. City of Rowlett, </em>247 F.3d 206, 211 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>210, 151 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>149 (2001) (placement of an electronic surveillance microphone at an outdoor grave site during a funeral was not a violation of the federal Act because of no reasonable expectation of privacy); <em>U.S. v. McKinnon, </em>985 F.2d 525, 527 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>843, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>130, 126 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>94 (1993) (a recording of defendant\u2019s conversation in the back seat of a police car did not violate the federal Act); <em>U.S. v. Duncan, </em>598 F.2d 839, 849-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>871, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>148, 62 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>96 (1979) (recording IRS auditors in an office that was assigned to them in the bank they were auditing violated the federal Act), and <em>U.S. v. McIntyre, </em>582 F.2d 1221, 1223 (9th Cir.1978) (recording the assistant chief of police in his office violated the federal Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">However, as plaintiffs point out, a few courts have distinguished between a reasonable expectation of privacy and a reasonable expectation that one\u2019s conversation will not be recorded. <em>Boddie v. ABC, </em>731 F.2d 333, 339 (6th Cir.1984) (defendant-journalist filmed a participant in a scandal, without her consent); <em>Walker v. Darby, </em>911 F.2d 1573, 1579 (11th Cir.1990) (a post-office supervisor intercepted oral communications of a letter carrier); <em>Angel v. Williams, 12 </em>F.3d 786, 790 (8th Cir.1993) (plaintiffs-police officers accused of using excessive force on a prisoner alleged that an audio recording of the incident violated the federal Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The standard set forth in these latter three cases seems unduly restrictive. Few conversations occur in which the participants expect that their speech will be intercepted. (Intercept is defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>as \u201cthe aural or other acquisition of the contents of any ... oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2(c).) Under the more restrictive standard, almost every oral communication, including shouting in a crowded public place, would be protected against interception, disclosure of its contents, and use of its contents. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:156A-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The majority of courts which have considered this issue, as well as the most recent decisions, have adopted the reasonable-expectation-of-privacy standard. Though the Eighth and Eleventh circuits applied the expectation-of-non-interception test in <em>Angel v. William,s </em>and <em>Walker v. Darby, </em>more recent decisions in both circuits have used the expectation-of-privacy test, without acknowledging or discussing the expectation-of-non-interception standard or any difference between the two. <em>See U.S. v. Peoples, </em>250 F.3d 630 (8th Cir.2001), and <em>U.S. v. McKinnon, </em>985 F.2d 525, 527 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In <em>State v. Tirelli, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 637, 506 A.2d 797, we held testimony that the witness expected the conversation to be private satisfied the statutory requirement of an expectation it not be intercepted. In <em>State v. Diaz, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 512, 706 A.2d 264, we declined to address the issue, but framed it in terms of a reasonable expectation of privacy. We have adopted the majority expectation-of-privacy standard, which we follow here.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy which is protected under the Fourth Amendment \u201cposits a two-part inquiry: first, has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search? Second, is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable?\u201d <em>California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>207, 211, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1809, 1811, 90 L.Ed.2d 210, 215 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The New Jersey Supreme Court, interpreting our constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, <em>N.J. Const. </em>Art. 1, \u00a7 7, has abandoned the first prong of this test and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>has held that the only requirement is \u201cthat an expectation of privacy be reasonable.\u201d <em>State v. Hempele, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>182, 200, 576 A.2d 793 (1990). Our Court explained that it would be arbitrary to apply objective facts to one prong of the test rather than the other. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 576 A.2d 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">However, as our Court predicted, <em>id. </em>at 200, 576 A.2d 793, the distinction makes no difference here. Plaintiffs declared that they directed their remarks to each other and believed that no one could hear them; this satisfies the requirement that they manifested a subjective expectation of privacy. .</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The first prong of the test, whether plaintiffs had a subjective expectation of privacy, is a question of fact, but the second prong of the test, whether their expectation was reasonable, is a question of law. <em>U.S. v. Clark, </em>22 F.3d 799, 801 (8th Cir.1994) (defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy while sitting in the back seat of a police car); <em>People v. Lesslie, </em>939 P.2d 443, 446 (Colo.Ct.App.1997) (defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in a bar restroom). <em>See Angel v. Williams, </em>12 F.3d at 790 (whether it was objectively reasonable to expect that conversations would not be recorded was a matter of law). <em>But see Boddie v. ABC, </em>731 F.2d at 338-39 (whether plaintiffs expectation that she was not being recorded and whether that expectation was reasonable were fact issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Courts which have considered the issue have generally determined that conversations which take place in enclosed, indoor rooms are protected. <em>People v. Lesslie, </em>939 P.2d at 447-48 (defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a bar restroom despite \u201cthe potential for a bystander to overhear\u201d); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>598 F.2d at 849-53 (IRS agents auditing a bank had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their assigned office in the bank, despite the consent of the bank\u2019s owner to recording the IRS\u2019s agents conversations, the hostility between the parties, and the fact that others could overhear the auditors from outside the office).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>On the other hand, when the location of the conversation was a cemetery during a grave site service, the father and grandmother of the deceased children, whose mother was convicted of murdering them, failed to establish that they had a subjective expectation of privacy. <em>Kee v. City of Rowlett, </em>247 <em>F.</em>3d at 215-18. The court commented that the open and publicly accessible place where the conversations occurred \u201cmay be a significant factor countenancing against finding a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217 n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Here, the location of the conversation between Hornberger and Tonkery was more akin to an open, accessible place than an enclosed, indoor room. The search of the car occurred on the shoulder of a busy public highway. Automobiles and other means of transportation are afforded a lower expectation of privacy than homes, offices and other structures. <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>42, 48, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1975, 1979, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>419, 426-27 (1970); <em>State v. Lund, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 38, 573 A.2d 1376. The four doors of the Mercedes were wide open while Hornberger and Tonkery were conducting their search, rendering the vehicle even more exposed. These officers were public servants performing their police function in public view. As recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>420, 438, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3138, 3149, 82 L.Ed.2d 317, 334 (1984), \u201c[p]erhaps most importantly, the typical traffic stop is public, at least to some degree. Passersby, on foot or in other cars, witness the interaction of officer and motorist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In <em>Katz, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>at 351, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 511, 19 L.Ed.2d at 582, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The court in <em>Kee </em>elaborated on this standard, listing six \u201cnonexclusive factors to evaluate the subjective expectation of privacy in oral communications in publicly accessible places.\u201d 247 F.3d at 215. These six factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>(1) the volume of the communication or conversation; (2) the proximity or potential of other individuals to overhear the conversation; (3) the potential for communications to be reported; (4) the affirmative actions taken by the speakers to shield their privacy; (5) the need for technological enhancements to hear the communications; and (6) the place or location of the oral communications as it relates to the subjective expectations of the individuals who are communicating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 213-14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">These factors seem as relevant to the question whether the expectation of privacy was reasonable as they are to the question whether there was a subjective expectation of privacy. As the Court pointed out in <em>State v. Hempele, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 576 A.2d 793, the same elements are applicable to both aspects of the standard. The most relevant factor is the location of the communication, including the circumstances in which it transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Here, Tonkery\u2019s recorded comment, that it was \u201cprobably dope\u201d in the locked case, was audible, and no technological enhancements were required. Tonkery and Hornberger took no action to shield their privacy. Although other individuals might have been able to overhear the officers, if any were in the area, because the car was on a public street with its doors open, Hornberger and Tonkery explained that the testers were standing outside of the vehicle and were not listening to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">In <em>State v. Smith, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 261-62, 677 A.2d 250 (App.Div.1996), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>83, 713 A.2d 1033, <em>cert. denied, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>1033, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>576, 142 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>480 (1998), this court upheld a search of an apartment to which the defendant had obtained access by forcibly taking the keys from the tenant\u2019s sister. We commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">To hold that defendant may assert a constitutionally protected privacy interest in the very apartment to which he has unlawfully and forcibly gained entry would constitute a raw injustice. No \u201cgeneral social norm\u201d would countenance such an expectation on the part of an intruder, and we cannot conceive of how such a claim could possibly be construed as \u201creasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 261 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">Here, unlike in <em>Smith, </em>plaintiffs\u2019 entry into the vehicle was not a crime. Nevertheless, because we concluded that plaintiffs failed to honor the testers\u2019 right to freedom from unreasonable searches, as in <em>Smith, </em>we are reluctant to recognize their own claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>privacy as reasonable. In addition, as the judge noted, plaintiffs\u2019 expectation of privacy is restricted because of their status as police officers. <em>Rawlings v. Police Dep\u2019t of Jersey City, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>182, 189, 627 A.2d 602 (1993) (\u201cAs a police officer, plaintiff had a diminished expectation of privacy\u201d); <em>Hart v. City of Jersey City, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 493, 706 A.2d 256 (App.Div.1998) (\u201cpolice officers, because they occupy positions of public trust and exercise special powers, have a diminished expectation of privacy.\u201d). <em>See also State v. Flora, </em>68 <em>Wash.App. </em>802, 845 P.2d 1355, 1357 (1992) (recording police officers\u2019 statements made while effectuating an arrest was not a violation of the Washington statute that prohibited interception of private conversations, because the officers did not \u201cpossess a personal privacy interest\u201d in their statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Courts have held that police officers do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when they are interacting with suspects. <em>Angel v. Williams, </em>12 <em>F.</em>3d at 790 (officers were recorded while subduing an inmate in a jail), and <em>State v. Flora, </em>845 P.2d at 1357 (officers were recorded while effectuating an arrest). Here also, plaintiffs, as police officers on duty, searching a vehicle on a public street, cannot expect the same level of privacy as a private citizen in a private place.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Plaintiffs rely on <em>State v. Lane, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 217-20, 652 A.2d 724 (App.Div.), <em>cert. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>94, 660 A.2d 1193 (1995), in which we held that telephone conversations in defendant\u2019s house on his telephone line between his ex-wife and her mother, taped by defendant, were inadmissible because the taping violated the Act. We followed the mandate of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-4(d), which specifically covers that situation. It provides: \u201cThe fact that such person [who intercepts the communication] is the subscriber to a particular telephone line does not constitute consent effective to authorize interception of communications among persons not including that person on that telephone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 652 A.2d 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Plaintiffs argue that here also, defendants\u2019 ownership of the car and the recording equipment did not constitute consent to record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>conversations between others. Plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning is flawed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-4(d) stated that subscription to a telephone line was not consent to record a conversation of others on that line. This statutory requirement is not relevant here because no telephone line was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In addition, defendants do not contend that plaintiffs consented to the recording. Defendants assert that plaintiffs\u2019 conversation was not covered by the Act because it did not qualify as a protected \u201coral communication\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2(b). Defendants are correct because plaintiffs did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when they engaged in the recorded conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Plaintiffs also rely on <em>Commonwealth v. Hyde, </em>434 <em>Mass. </em>594, 750 N.E.2d 963 (2001), where the court held that the defendant, a motorist, unlawfully recorded the remarks of police officers who stopped defendant for a traffic offense, in violation of the Massachusetts electronic surveillance statute. <em>Id. </em>at 964. The court noted that <em>Mass. Gen. Laws </em>ch. 272, \u00a7 99B2 (1968) defined \u201coral communication\u201d as speech, except for speech transmitted over public air waves. <em>Id. </em>at 965. Thus, unlike the federal Act and the statutes of most states, including New Jersey, the Massachusetts statute \u201cdid not require an expectation of privacy by the speaker in order to make the statute applicable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Massachusetts court refused to inject a requirement of an expectation of privacy into the statute. Such an expectation was contrary to the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">That court further said that the Massachusetts statute prohibited. the recording of conversations made with one-party consent, again unlike the federal Act and the statutes of most states, including New Jersey. <em>Id. </em>at 967. The court concluded that the Massachusetts Legislature \u201cintended G.L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, strictly to prohibit all secret recordings by members of the public, including recordings of police officers or other public officials interacting with members of the public, when made without their permission or knowledge.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Plaintiffs are incorrect that <em>Hyde </em>is \u201cdirectly on point with the issues herein.\u201d Although the facts are similar, the New Jersey Act, like the federal Act and those of most other states, is far less stringent than the Massachusetts Act applicable in <em>Hyde. </em>Unlike the Massachusetts Act, the New Jersey Act does not \u201cstrictly prohibit all secret recordings by members of the public.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The New Jersey Act allows members of the public to secretly record conversations when the speakers have no reasonable expectation of privacy, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-2(b), or when one party to the conversation consents. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:156A-4(d). <em>See State in the Interest of J.D.H., IV, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>475, 480, 795 A.2d 851 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">We conclude the judge properly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 claim that defendants violated the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act when they recorded the conversation between Tonkery and Hornberger during their search inside the vehicle. Although the officers did not consent to the recording, they did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy while in the targeted vehicle under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Plaintiffs next contend that the judge erred in following <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 505 (4th Cir.1999), and dismissing their claim for fraud. The court in <em>Food Lion </em>held that a plaintiff could not avoid the First Amendment standards of a defamation claim by demanding \u201cdefamation-type damages under non-reputational tort claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522. Plaintiffs argue that <em>Food Lion </em>does not apply because (1) their fraud claim is based on pre-broadcast speech; (2) <em>Food Lion </em>was a Fourth Circuit decision which interpreted North Carolina law; and (3) New Jersey and other jurisdictions have rejected <em>Food Lion. </em>The judge agreed with the reasoning of <em>Food, Lion. </em>He rejected plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that their fraud claim was based on pre-broadcast speech, because \u201call of their damages flow from defendants\u2019 alleged libelous publication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>In <em>Food Lion, </em>two ABC reporters used false identifications, addresses, resumes and references to obtain employment at plaintiffs supermarkets and secretly videotaped improper food handling. 194 <em>F.3d </em>at 610-11. Portions of the videotapes were used in a national <em>PrimeTime Live </em>broadcast. Plaintiff did not sue for defamation, but for the manner in which ABC gathered its information, including trespass and breach of the reporters\u2019 duty of loyalty to plaintiff during their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">A jury found the reporters liable for these torts. <em>Id. </em>at 511. However, the court disallowed damages which resulted from the broadcast, such as lost profits, lost sales and diminished stock value. <em>Id. </em>at 522-24. The Fourth Circuit explained that a settled</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">First Amendment principle precludes the award of publication damages in this case____ Food Lion attempted to avoid the First Amendment limitations on defamation claims by seeking publication damages under non-reputational tort claims, while holding to the normal state law proof standards for these torts. This is precluded by <em>Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>46, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">[194 <em>F.3d </em>at 522.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The court stated that plaintiff admitted it did not sue for defamation because that claim required proof that the <em>PrimeTime Live </em>broadcast contained a false statement of fact made with actual malice, and plaintiff \u201cwas not prepared to offer proof meeting [this] standard under any claim that it might assert.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff thus improperly sought \u201cto recover defamation-type damages under non-reputational tort claims, without satisfying the stricter (First Amendment) standards of a defamation claim.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court disapproved this \u201cend-run around First Amendment strictures.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">Plaintiffs here argue that <em>Hustler Magazine </em>and <em>Food Lion </em>do not apply. Plaintiffs reason that, unlike the claims in <em>Hustler Magazine </em>and <em>Food Lion, </em>their fraud claim is based on defendants\u2019 pre-broadcast misrepresentations. However, in <em>Food Lion, </em>the breach-of-loyalty and trespass claims also involved pre-broadcast conduct. 194 F.3d at 510-11. The question is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>damages resulted from the broadcast and were the same damages available for defamation. <em>Id. </em>at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">When the damages are non-reputational and do not compensate for injury to plaintiffs state of mind, First Amendment proscriptions do not preclude recovery on a pre-publication tort, also involving a media-defendant\u2019s publication. <em>Cohen v. Cowles Media Co., </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>663, 671, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2513, 2519, 115 L.Ed.2d 586, 598 (1991). There, the Court allowed economic damages resulting from plaintiffs loss of his job when defendants published his name, in breach of a promise of confidentiality, because his particular damages were distinct from defamation damages. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In <em>Veilleux v. NBC, </em>206 F.3d 92, 126-29 (1st Cir.2000), the court allowed damages limited to pecuniary loss resulting from a broadcast on a claim for pre-broadcast misrepresentation. There, defendants-broadcasters procured the cooperation of plaintiff, the owner of a trucking company, in a <em>DateLine </em>production by misrepresenting that the show would not include a group critical of the trucking industry. <em>Id. </em>at 102. Following <em>Cohen, </em>the court limited plaintiffs damages to \u201chis pecuniary loss (primarily the loss of trucking customers) flowing from the misrepresentations, not reputational or emotional distress damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128. The court in <em>Veilleux </em>failed to reconcile its allowance of damages for loss of business with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s <em>Food Lion\u2019s </em>disallowance of damages for lost sales and profits. 194 F.3d at 522-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Here, plaintiffs allege in their complaint that defendants\u2019 fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">injurfedl ... the reputations of the plaintiffs, damaged their chances for promotion, made it difficult for them to obtain employment elsewhere, subjected them to ridicule and humiliation nationwide, and among their Mends, family, loved ones, their neighbors and others in law enforcement.... As a result of the foregoing, plaintiffs suffered loss of sleep, anxiety attacks, fear of further invasions and defamations, powerlessness, chagrin, anger, frustration, embarrassment, humiliation, mental distress, general depression, and fear of being invaded by ABC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">These damages are almost entirely for injury to reputation and emotional distress. Plaintiffs allege damage to their chances for promotion and difficulty in obtaining other employment, but do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>specify any promotion or other employment opportunity for which they were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Under <em>Hustler, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>at 56, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 882, 99 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 52-53, and <em>Food Lion, </em>194 F.3d at 522, plaintiffs are not entitled to these reputational and emotional distress damages, resulting from a publication, without showing that the publication contained a false statement of fact that was made with actual malice. As discussed in Part III of this opinion, plaintiffs have failed to establish that \u201cDWB\u201d contained a false statement of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that <em>Food Lion </em>was based on North Carolina law. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s analysis on whether the defendants committed the underlying torts was based on state law. 194 F.3d at 512-22. However, the court interpreted federal constitutional law when it held that plaintiff could not obtain publication or \u201cdefamation-type\u201d damages without satisfying First Amendment standards. <em>Id. </em>at 522-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Plaintiffs are also incorrect that New Jersey and other jurisdictions have rejected <em>Food Lion. </em>Plaintiffs rely on <em>State v. Cantor, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 221, 534 A.2d 83 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>291, 540 A.2d 1274 (1988), in which defendant, a newspaper reporter, was convicted of impersonating a public official in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-8, thereby obtaining access to personal information from the mother of a homicide victim. This court emphasized that the defendant\u2019s status as a newsperson was not a defense: \u201cThe First Amendment has never been construed to provide immunity from either tortious or criminal conduct committed in the course of newsgathering; it provides no license to trespass, steal or surreptitiously intrude into another\u2019s home or office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 534 A.2d 83. The court declined to \u201cengraft* upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-8 the additional requirement that the defendant be motivated by actual malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 534 A.2d 88. The court explained that in a criminal trial, the defendant had more protection than a civil libel defendant because of the greater burden: proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>In the case before us, in contrast, there is no criminal prosecution. Defendants do not have the protection of a heavier burden of proof and they are not seeking to engraft the actual malice standard upon any criminal offense. Nor were they intruding into someone\u2019s private affairs; they were \u201cspying\u201d on public officials in performance of their duties on a public street. Defendants do not claim immunity from their torts. The issue is whether plaintiffs are entitled to damages which resulted from defendants\u2019 broadcast. This court in <em>State v. Cantor </em>did not consider the question of tort damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In <em>Dietemann v. Time, Inc., </em>449 <em>F.2d 245, </em>248 (9th Cir.1971), on which plaintiff relies, the court elevated a plaintiffs privacy over defendant-newsperson\u2019s First Amendment rights for the purposes of tort damages. <em>Dietemann </em>pre-dates <em>Hustler </em>and <em>Food Lion; </em>these later cases control.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The other cases on which plaintiffs rely involved a balancing of citizen-plaintiffs\u2019 right to privacy against media-defendants\u2019 right to freedom of the press. The courts stressed that media-defendants do not enjoy absolute immunity from liability for improper news-gathering. However, they did not consider the issue here, whether a plaintiff may recover reputational and emotional distress damages resulting from publication of material covertly obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We hold that the <em>PrimeTime Live </em>video program DWB was not defamatory. The program portrayed with reasonable accuracy a routine traffic stop of young Mrican-American males, resolved ultimately by a warning and without traffic violation charges for several admitted violations, which was in reality a pretext to launch a criminal investigation wdthout articulable suspicion, probable cause, or legal consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Barbara Westergaard, \u201cA Guide to the State\u201d 153-54 (2nd ed. 1988 Rutgers University Press).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Jamesburg Middlesex (C522) 4,114 [6,000 in 2001]</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Jamesburg\u2019s first settlers, Scots fleeing religious persecution, arrived in the late 17th century, and its first mill dates to 1734, but the town\u2019s period of greatest prosperity began 100 years later when the railroad came through. Jamesburg eventually had two railroad lines and three depots and became the commercial and social center for the township and the surrounding agricultural area. This prosperity continued until after World War II.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Much of the town\u2019s growth can be attributed to James Buckelew, whose great-grandfather had arrived in the area around 1715. In 1832 Buckelew purchased Lakeview* (203 Buckelew Ave.; 201-521-0068), originally a small 17th-century farmhouse overlooking the millpond (now Lake Manalapan), and enlarged it into a 23 room mansion with a colonnaded porch overlooking the lake. Buckelew farmed some 4,000 acres (and was the first in the area to use marl on his land), supplied 700 mules for the Delaware and Raritan Canal, established the Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad, and helped establish the First National Bank. Because a black child was excluded from the existing school, Buckelew built another school, open to all, which, at the dedication ceremony, was referred to as the James B. School; James B. eventually became Jamesburg. When President-elect Lincoln was in Trenton on his way to his inauguration, he rode in Buckelew\u2019s coach from the Clinton St. station to the capitol. The house, also known as Buekelew\u2019s Mansion, is now open as a house museum, and Lincoln\u2019s coach is one of the items on display. Among those who helped restore the mansion were students from the New Jersey Training School for Boys. This school was built in 1867 as the New Jersey State Reform School on a large farm owned by Buckelew, which may have been the site of a mid 18th century French and Indian War stockade. The museum has some period furnishings, items relating to local history, and a high-school memento room. In the front yard are some track from the Camden and Amboy Railroad and several anchoring stones. Special events, including a Christmas program, are scheduled several times a year. Open Wednesday Sunday, 12-4. Guided tours by appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Although Jamesburg is Middlesex County\u2019s most densely populated community (over 4,000 people in less than one square mile), it abuts a county park that is almost as large as the borough. Thompson Park includes Lake Manalapan, where you can fish, boat, and skate; there are also athletic fields, hiking trails (including one accessible to the handicapped), picnic areas, tennis courts, playgrounds, and a small zoo. Part of the park has been designated a bird sanctuary. Several horse and dog shows, as well as two concerts, take place in the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Just west of Jamesburg (take Forsgate Dr.) is Rossmoor, a retirement community built around a golf course. The land was once an early 20th-century estate and dairy farm the clubhouse was formerly a residence and each hole on the east course is modeled on a famous hole from a British course.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
