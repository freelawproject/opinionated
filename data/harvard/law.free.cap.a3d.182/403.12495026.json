The issues arise out of two facets of the Law Division motion judge's March 17, 2017 decision. First, the judge held that the fictitious pleading process under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:26-4 did not justify plaintiff's addition of three defendant physicians to the lawsuit after the statute of limitations had run. Second, despite plaintiff's unsuccessful reliance upon the fictitious pleading rule to toll the limitations period, the court equitably estopped the three physicians from obtaining dismissal of the claims against them. The court found those defendants had unduly delayed in moving for such dispositive relief after about a year of costly discovery had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On leave granted, the three physicians appeal the trial court's equitable estoppel ruling, while plaintiff cross-appeals the court's fictitious pleading decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we reverse the court's fictitious pleading determination as to one of the three co-defendants. We do so because decedent's hospital records do not legibly reveal that particular doctor's name and involvement in decedent's care. It was unreasonable to expect plaintiff to have ascertained that doctor's identity and negligent conduct until her counsel received a post-suit affidavit from the defense clarifying which doctors had actually been involved in decedent's care. Upon receiving the clarifying affidavit, plaintiff promptly amended the complaint to name the previously unidentified doctor (and two other doctors) in place of \"John Doe\" defendants. Plaintiff's claims against that particular physician therefore may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We affirm, however, the trial court's fictitious pleading ruling as to the other two co-defendants who were added late. Plaintiff could have reasonably ascertained, before the statute of limitations expired, the respective identities and involvement in decedent's care of those two doctors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As an important caveat, we allow plaintiff's claims to proceed against one or both of those two late-added doctors insofar as they may have acted as the decedent's \"attending physician.\" We do so because the hospital records misleadingly and erroneously identified a different doctor, who was actually on vacation at the time, as decedent's attending physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lastly, we overturn the trial court's application of principles of equitable estoppel disallowing the dismissal of the two other doctors. In the absence of a case management order or court rule prescribing an earlier deadline for filing such a motion, or an express misrepresentation made to plaintiff, those defendants did not forfeit their rights to file a limitations-based dismissal motion near the very end of the discovery period. Accordingly, we reverse the denial of summary judgment with respect to those two defendants, subject to the \"attending physician\" caveat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since this case has not been tried, our discussion of the facts is necessarily tentative and incomplete. Our focus is largely\n   on the procedural chronology that bears upon the critical timeliness issues presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the evening of March 28, 2013, plaintiff's decedent Freddy A. Baez, who was then in his thirties, appeared at the emergency room at Clara Maass Medical Center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He complained of persisting left leg swelling, leg pain, fever, and other symptoms. Decedent was provided with fluids and medication. Blood work and other tests were performed. Decedent briefly was placed in a rapid diagnostic unit, where he was further evaluated and monitored. He then was admitted to a medical floor of the hospital early the next day, March 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A physician working at the hospital, Andrey Silkov, M.D.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   examined decedent on March 29. In Dr. Silkov's typewritten two-page \"History and Physical\" report, he described decedent's symptoms and complaints. The report noted the patient's \"morbid obesity.\" The report further noted the patient had a history of a previous \"left lower extremity DVT\" (an abbreviation for a deep vein thrombosis ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his written plan on admission, Dr. Silkov stated the patient would be administered intravenous antibiotics and two other medications. The plan included a request to have the patient evaluated by an infectious disease specialist. The report was electronically \"signed\" by Dr. Silkov. The doctor's full name is typewritten in three places at the bottom of the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Over the next several days, decedent was seen and treated at Clara Maass by several doctors and other health care providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The hospital's records for that time frame, to the extent they have been supplied to us in the appendices, contain a mixture of typewritten documents and handwritten progress notes. The handwritten notes are replete with illegible words, medical jargon, abbreviations, and indecipherable signatures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The earliest handwritten entry from decedent's hospital chart reproduced in the parties' appendices is dated March 29, 2013. As translated, the first narrative line of that entry states \"Admit to Medicine Dr. J. Paulo.\" The \"Dr. J. Paulo\" in that entry refers to Jimmy M. Paulo, M.D. Many of the other entries in decedent's chart refer to Dr. Paulo. In fact, plaintiff's counsel represents, without contradiction by defense counsel, that Dr. Paulo's name appears about seventy-five times within those records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Typewritten portions of the records additionally refer to Dr. Wayne J. Caputo, a consulting podiatrist who examined decedent at the hospital. Names of other doctors also appear. Some of them are handwritten and illegible, and others are either typed or in legible handwriting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Decedent was discharged from Clara Maass on April 3, 2013. His discharge summary is set forth on a typed one-page report. The report's heading identifies decedent's attending doctor as \"Jimmy Paulo, M.D.\" The report was electronically signed by Seong Choi, M.D., with copies to\n   Dr. Caputo, Dr. Choi, and another physician named Dr. Donald Beggs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The discharge summary relates that decedent had been admitted to the hospital for left lower extremity cellulitis with a left hallux lesion. It recounts that decedent had an x-ray of his toe,\n   which showed no evidence of acute osseous pathology, and that hospital personnel had performed a debridement on the toe. The discharge plan called for follow up with decedent's primary care physician within two weeks, and with the podiatrist, Dr. Caputo, within one week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 16, 2013, thirteen days after his discharge from Clara Maass, Mr. Baez died of a pulmonary embolism at his home. An autopsy was performed. Decedent's family thereafter retained counsel, who obtained and reviewed decedent's hospital records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Three days before the two-year statute of limitations expired, plaintiff Marian A. Baez, as administrator of her son Freddy's estate and individually, filed this medical malpractice action in the Law Division on April 13, 2015. The complaint asserted claims for both wrongful death and survivorship damages. The complaint named Dr. Paulo, Dr. Caputo, and five fictitious defendants denominated as \"John Does\" one through five. The complaint described the five John Does as \"physicians licensed to practice in the State of New Jersey\" who were involved in decedent's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff's claims of medical negligence focus on the diagnosis and treatment decedent received at Clara Maass during the five-day period after his admission and before his discharge. Plaintiff alleges decedent was at high risk for a DVT. Because of that risk, the medical standard of care allegedly required decedent to receive at the hospital \"pharmacologic\" venous thromboembolism (\"VTE\") prophylaxis medications, rather than \"mechanical\" prophylaxis such as stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Decedent did not receive VTE prophylaxis at the hospital. According to plaintiff, this omission allowed decedent to develop a blood clot in his leg. The clot traveled to his lungs, causing a fatal pulmonary embolism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After Dr. Paulo and Dr. Caputo each filed answers denying liability, defense counsel on October 16, 2015 sent plaintiff's counsel an affidavit from Dr. Paulo. The affidavit attests to Dr. Paulo's lack of involvement in decedent's care. According to his affidavit,\n   Dr. Paulo was away on vacation the week that decedent was in the hospital. The affidavit explains that Dr. Paulo's name appeared automatically on decedent's records for administrative reasons, because decedent had been admitted to a medical practice group headed by Dr. Paulo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The affidavit informed plaintiff's counsel that the Clara Maass hospitalists in Dr. Paulo's group who actually saw decedent during his stay were Dr. Silkov, Dr. Choi, and a third physician, Sacha Balmir, D.O. Unlike those other two doctors, Dr. Balmir's name is not typed or legibly written on any of the hospital records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel spoke with defense counsel a few days later. He agreed to enter into a stipulation of dismissal as to Dr. Paulo, but requested that defense counsel identify the authors of various illegible handwritten notes in decedent's hospital chart. Defense counsel agreed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In a subsequent letter dated November 3, 2015, defense counsel confirmed that Drs. Silkov, Balmir, and Choi had treated decedent at the hospital. She elaborated that Dr. Silkov had admitted the patient on March 29, 2015, that Dr. Balmir had seen him on March 30 and 31, and that Dr. Choi had discharged him on April 3. Defense counsel reiterated that Dr. Paulo's name had appeared on decedent's chart only \"as a matter of routine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Upon receiving this information, plaintiff executed a stipulation of dismissal as to Dr. Paulo. Concurrently, plaintiff moved for leave to amend the complaint to insert Drs. Silkov, Balmir, and Choi as defendants in place of the previously-designated \"John Doe\" defendants. On November 20, 2015, the trial court granted that motion, which was unopposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The newly-added defendant physicians filed a joint answer denying the allegations of malpractice. The answer listed various\n   affirmative defenses, including non-compliance with the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff procured the necessary affidavit of merit regarding the three added defendants. In addition, plaintiff relied upon an expert report from a professor at the Harvard Medical School.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The expert opined the physicians who treated decedent deviated from professional standards of care at the hospital, in failing to sufficiently guard against decedent sustaining a DVT. He contended this failure was a causal factor in the patient's post-discharge death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Discovery thereafter continued. In March 2016, defendants provided responses to plaintiff's interrogatories, which included the aforementioned transcriptions of the handwritten entries in decedent's chart. That same month, defendants deposed plaintiff, the only deposition they initiated. Plaintiff's counsel took five depositions: Dr. Caputo in April 2016; Dr. Balmir and Dr. Silkov in May 2016; and Dr. Paulo (as a fact witness) and Dr. Choi in October 2016. Plaintiff also supplied the defense in November 2016 with an updated version of her expert's report, which specifically names and discusses, among other things, the conduct of Drs. Silkov, Balmir, and Choi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After he was deposed, Dr. Caputo moved for summary judgment. Plaintiff did not oppose the motion, because she had received the opinion of an expert in podiatry concluding that Dr. Caputo had not deviated, in fact, from the standards of care. The three other defendants partially opposed the motion, seeking to preserve their cross-claims against Dr. Caputo for contribution and indemnification. The trial court accordingly granted summary judgment as to Dr. Caputo only as to plaintiffs' claims, thereby preserving the co-defendants' cross-claims against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In September 2016, defendants moved to set a date certain for the production of expert reports and to extend discovery for a\n   period of ninety days. Plaintiff partially agreed that additional discovery was warranted, but only requested two additional weeks to serve expert reports. Defendants thereafter requested another thirty days of discovery in order to complete four expert depositions. The court extended the discovery period to mid-February 2017, ordering plaintiff's additional expert reports to be served by December 1, 2016, defendants' expert reports to be\n   served by January 15, 2017, and expert depositions to be completed by February 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Before the extended discovery end date expired, Drs. Silkov, Balmir, and Choi moved in January 2017 for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the claims against them based upon the statute of limitations. Plaintiff countered that her claims against the three physicians were timely. She argued the amended complaint she had filed in December 2015-with leave of the court and without opposition-should \"relate back\" to her original April 2015 complaint naming \"John Doe\" defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After hearing two sessions of oral argument, the motion judge declined to dismiss the claims against the three co-defendants. In his oral opinion, the judge first addressed the timeliness issues posed by plaintiff's use of fictitious parties in her original complaint. The judge concluded in this regard that plaintiff had not acted with reasonable diligence to investigate the roles of the three doctors sooner, given the information appearing on the hospital records. The judge reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   I don't believe the [f]ictitious [pleading] [r]ule applies in this particular case because the identities of the individuals were known to the [p]laintiffs before the lawsuit was filed. Only one potential exception was Dr. Balm[ir], but I'm going to accept the defense position that there was a way, had the [p]laintiff been diligent, to identify Dr. Balm[ir]. So, I don't find that the [f]ictitious [p]leading [r]ule in this case applies because the identities were known.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Consequently, the judge ruled that plaintiff's claims against Drs. Silkov, Balmir, and Choi, which were filed more than two years after decedent's treatment at the hospital and death, did not \"relate back\" to her earlier April 2015 fictitious pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The judge then turned to a second question of whether defendants' own delay-in not moving to dismiss the amended complaint as time-barred until about a year of discovery had been conducted-precluded them from receiving the relief of dismissal. On this question, the judge ruled in favor of plaintiff and invoked principles of equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The judge observed the three physicians were clearly \"active participa[nts] in the defense\" of the case, without them voicing any objection. The judge further noted the apparent absence of \"any information\" bearing on the statute of limitations \"gleaned from the discovery that took place in the ensuing 13 months that would have not been available to [defendants] in November of 2015 ....\" As the judge stated in this ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   although I understand the defense in saying that they never would have moved to dismiss so early until discovery was over, in this particular case, discovery didn't add anything to what they already knew [i]n November of 2015, which was the three defendants were in the [hospital] record, identified as such doctors having some responsibility over the decedent and realizing that they were not originally in the complaint that was filed two days before the statute expired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The judge reasoned that, in instances where-as he found here-defendants actually know of the claims being asserted against them, no significant prejudice from their ongoing inclusion in a case redounds to their detriment. In such a context, the judge observed, the policy reasons for strictly applying a statute of limitations recede.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Citing principles of equitable estoppel set forth in the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    W.V. Pangborne &amp; Co. v. N.J.

Consequently, he ultimately declined to dismiss the claims against all three defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We granted leave to appeal to defendants as to the trial court's estoppel ruling, and to plaintiff as to the fictitious pleading ruling. We shall discuss those rulings in reverse sequence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In conducting our review, we consider the motion record and the legal issues de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Steinberg v.

We agree with the motion judge's finding that plaintiff was not sufficiently diligent, but solely with respect to Dr. Silkov, the admitting physician, and Dr. Choi, the discharging physician. The names of both of those doctors were clearly typed on their respective reports within decedent's chart. The reports set forth their observations of the patient, the treatments or tests he had received, and what further treatment and follow up\n   was planned. There was no need for a handwriting analysis or translation, at least as to those typed records. In fact, plaintiff moved for leave to add them to the complaint before even receiving the handwriting transcriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We recognize the translations the defense ultimately supplied in discovery reflect that Drs. Silkov and Choi authored or were also mentioned elsewhere in handwritten notations in decedent's chart. But that does not excuse plaintiff from omitting them from the lawsuit or from failing to make diligent inquiry about their roles before the statute of limitations ran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The fact that Dr. Paulo was misidentified in the chart as decedent's attending physician did not relieve plaintiff from investigating and pursuing theories of liability against Dr. Silkov and Dr. Choi in a timely and diligent manner to the extent they may have been involved as \"non-attending\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   doctors. Their identities and participation in decedent's care were known before the statute ran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We reject plaintiff's explanation that the alleged deviations from professional standards by Drs. Silkov and Choi were confined to events that took place only after decedent's admission but before his discharge. Indeed, among other things, plaintiff's expert's amended report criticizes Dr. Silkov for treatments that were not prospectively ordered at the time of the patient's admission, and Dr. Choi for treatments that were not completed or prescribed before decedent was sent home. We agree with the motion judge that plaintiff could have named these two doctors as defendants before the April 16, 2015 deadline, or at least sought more information about them, pre-suit, from the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   That said, we inject an important caveat. As we have noted, the hospital chart falsely stated that Dr. Paulo was decedent's \"attending physician.\" As defined in various sources, an attending physician is a doctor \"serving as a physician or surgeon on the staff of a hospital or similar health-care facility and\n   <em>\n    having primary responsibility over the treatment of a patient\n   </em>\n   and often\n   supervising treatment given by interns, residents, and fellows[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2018),\n   <em>\n    https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attending\n   </em>\n   (last visited Feb. 20, 2018) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with plaintiff that, before receiving Dr. Paulo's post-suit clarifying affidavit, she and her counsel would have had reason to presume the truth of the hospital records' explicit designation of Dr. Paulo as decedent's attending physician, and thus the doctor who had primary responsibility for his overall care. Plaintiff did not fail to exercise due diligence in maintaining that belief until she was served with Dr. Paulo's affidavit correcting the misimpression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Accordingly, to the extent her present theories of liability against Dr. Silkov or Dr. Choi may be specifically based on either of those doctors serving at any time as decedent's \"attending physician\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   who was charged with primary responsibility for the overall supervision of his care at the hospital, those claims may proceed, depending upon the particular duties involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tobia v. Cooper Hosp. Univ. Med. Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"712159\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/136/335/#p346\">\n    136 N.J. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"712159\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/136/335/#p346\">\n    643 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). Conversely, plaintiff's claims against Drs. Silkov and Choi that do not hinge upon the alleged status and specific duties of an\n   attending physician are time-barred. Any dispute in applying this caveat shall be addressed by the trial court on remand.\n   We now turn to the subject of prejudice. Although the implicit prejudice to Dr. Silkov and Dr. Choi caused by their late substitution into the case may not have been significant, they nonetheless had a justifiable expectation to not be sued after the two-year limitations period expired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fictitious pleading rule is not an appropriate device to avoid naming known parties in a timely fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   To be sure, we by no means endorse the \"scattershot\" naming in a malpractice complaint of every doctor whose name may appear in a patient's hospital chart. Such indiscriminate overinclusion would be contrary to public policy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-26 to -29 (requiring an affidavit of merit to support malpractice cases against doctors and other specified licensed professionals); N.J.S.A. 2A:15-59.1 (disallowing frivolous pleadings). Reasonable due diligence by a plaintiff should not be equated with overzealous litigiousness. We are satisfied that the motion judge correctly recognized and applied these concepts in finding that plaintiff should have been more diligent with respect to naming Drs. Silkov and Choi in the original complaint, subject to the caveat we have expressed regarding their potential status as attending physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We reach a different conclusion as to Dr. Balmir. As we have noted, his name is not typed in any of the records. His name\n   and signature only appear in illegible handwritten entries within the chart. This is not acceptable institutional practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.A.C. 8:43G-15.2(b) (requiring \"all entries\" in a patient's medical record to be \"written legibly\" or authenticated if a computerized medical records system is used). Until receiving Dr. Paulo's clarifying affidavit, plaintiff had no reason to be aware that Dr. Balmir had anything to do with her son's treatment. There was no lack of due diligence in omitting him from her original complaint. The motion judge erred in disallowing plaintiff to substitute Dr. Balmir in place of a John Doe defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reject the defense's argument that the John Doe description in the complaint was insufficiently detailed to allow that substitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Consequently, we reverse this aspect of the judge's decision. The case against Dr. Balmir shall proceed on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Our disposition of the fictitious pleading issues concerning Dr. Silkov and Dr. Choi makes it necessary for us to reach the judge's equitable estoppel ruling as to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   We are cognizant that statutes of limitations should not be mechanically applied, and that equitable considerations sometimes rightly play a role in tempering their application. \"It is now well settled in New Jersey that statutes of limitation will\n   not be applied when they would unnecessarily sacrifice individual justice under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Zaccardi v.

However, as illustrated by the Court's omission of a discussion of prejudice in its more recent opinion in\n    <em>\n     Matynska\n    </em>\n    , sometimes a plaintiff's lack of due diligence in omitting a defendant is sufficiently clear so as to render an analysis of actual prejudice unnecessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Indeed, as we have already noted, the motion judge initially wavered about finding the claims against Dr. Balmir to be untimely, but chose to adopt the defense's position on that point.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    We do not fault the motion judge for this, as he evidently did not start participating in the case until the discovery period was well underway and Dr. Caputo had been dismissed by another judge from the case. Nor are we prescribing that case management conferences be held in every medical malpractice case, a policy issue that implicates the optimal allocation of scarce judicial resources within each vicinage.
