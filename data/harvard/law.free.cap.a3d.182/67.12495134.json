The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendants claim that (1) there was insufficient evidence to prove the plaintiff's ownership of the subject property, and (2) the trial court abused its discretion by ordering injunctive relief that was overly broad and exceeded the scope of the relief sought by the plaintiff. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that the plaintiff owned the subject property and, thus, that the trial court properly found that the defendants had trespassed on the plaintiff's property. We further conclude that the scope of the trial court's injunctive relief is not overly broad. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in the trial court's memorandum of decision. \"The plaintiff is a public utility corporation with a principal office located in New Milford ... that operates hydroelectric power generation facilities in this state pursuant to licenses from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"One of the plaintiff's facilities is a pumped storage hydroelectric power facility ... known as the Rocky River development. [The lake], which covers an area of approximately 5650 acres in New Milford, Danbury,\n   New Fairfield, Sherman and Brookfield, serves as the reservoir for the Rocky River [development]....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The plaintiff's predecessor in interest, the Connecticut Light &amp; Power Company (CL &amp; P), began construction on [the lake] in 1920 and completed it in 1927. CL &amp; P acquired title to the lands forming the bed and shoreline of [the lake] through a series of conveyances during the 1920s and thereafter.... The natural elevation of the ... lake is approximately 200 feet above sea level. When the lake was created, CL &amp; P purchased all of the land constituting the shoreline of the lake sufficient to allow it to raise the water level in the lake by an additional 230 feet. The elevation of approximately 440 feet above sea level, i.e., the maximum height of the lake's surface when completely flooded, was memorialized as part of [a document known as the] '1927 Rocky River datum.' This elevation is ... commonly referred to as the '440 [foot] contour elevation line' or sometimes more simply as the '440 contour.' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"In ... 2000, CL &amp; P conveyed all of its right, title, and interest in and to the Rocky River [development] to the plaintiff, then known as Northeast Generation Company, by way of a quit claim deed....

The 1934 deed also delineates the [tract conveyed] by a complete\n   metes and bounds description with reference to permanent surveyors' marks. The 1934 deed also refers to '[a monument on the] 440 [foot] contour elevation line.' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The 1934 deed makes clear that the land conveyed to Oenoke Holding Corporation was, and is, immediately contiguous to the land retained by CL &amp; P along the 440 foot contour elevation line.

The defendants required the plaintiff's permission because a portion of the improvements were to be located partially or entirely on the plaintiff's land. The plaintiff granted the defendants permission to install certain improvements, including landscaping, that would be built on the plaintiff's land by way of a permit dated December 6, 2013.... The defendants signed the December 6, 2013 permit, thereby agreeing to the scope of the work allowed and all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of the permit....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Shortly thereafter, the defendants' representatives again approached the plaintiff seeking permission for additional improvements to be built partially or entirely on the plaintiff's land. The plaintiff granted a second permit to the defendants for the additional work, dated [May] 13, 2014....

At this meeting, Wood advised the defendants that they had to immediately cease all work on the property because they were constructing a significant portion of it on the plaintiff's land in violation of the permits. Wood advised the defendants that they had\n   to have their property surveyed and the lot lines staked or otherwise marked, and that they had to bring their construction into compliance with the permits. The defendants agreed to obtain [an updated] survey from ... Hiro ... and to cease all further work on the premises....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The defendants commissioned an updated survey from Hiro, [but did not provide] Wood or any other person representing the plaintiff with a copy of the updated survey....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Wood visited the site again on September 23, 2014, to review compliance with the permits. Once again, Wood found the defendants' contractors at work on the plaintiff's property. Wood also found on this occasion that extensive additional work had been done on the plaintiff's property in violation of the permits, including the installation of a water fountain.\" (Footnotes added and omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff subsequently commenced the present action, alleging, inter alia, trespass. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring the defendants to remove all structures from the plaintiff's property\n   that were not authorized by the permits issued to the defendants. At trial, the defendants claimed that the plaintiff could not establish its ownership or possessory interest in the property on which the defendants were building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After trial, the court concluded as follows: \"The court finds that the plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the ... line separating the plaintiff's property and the defendants' property is delineated by the 440 ... contour as originally established by the 1927 Rocky River datum and 1934 deed, and (2) the plaintiff, as successor in interest to [CL &amp; P], is the owner of all of the land immediately contiguous to the southerly boundary of the defendants' property.\" The trial court further found \"that the plaintiff has\n   sustained damages by virtue of the substantial permanent unauthorized improvements constructed by the defendants on the plaintiff's land.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court thereafter issued a permanent mandatory injunction as follows: \"1.

The plaintiff responds by asserting that the testimony of the experts and the documentary evidence were sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the plaintiff owned the land at issue. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review and the relevant principles of law governing the defendants' claim. \"[T]he scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has\n   made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous.

He also testified that he had worked as a surveyor for Northeast Utilities, a sister company of CL &amp; P, performing various surveying work until his departure to start his own surveying business in 2007. After he started his own business, he performed various surveying work for the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The trial court summarized Howard's testimony as follows: \"Howard testified that he reviewed the same primary sources, i.e., deeds, surveys and permanent monuments, as Hiro, and field verified the 440 foot contour elevation [line] as having the same metes and bounds described by Hiro. The court found Howard well qualified to express an opinion as to (1) the location of the original 440 foot [contour elevation line], and (2) title to the land on both sides of the 440 foot [contour elevation line]. The court accepts Howard's testimony that further verification of the 440 foot contour elevation [line] described in the 1934 deed is unnecessary in that it has been verified many times by other surveyors around [the] lake.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   A review of the testimony at trial demonstrates that the trial court reasonably relied on Howard's testimony. At trial, Howard testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: But you haven't gone back to certify where the property line is vis-\u00e0-vis the original deed ... even though it's easy to do?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"[The Witness]: No, it's not easy to do, it's a lot of work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: [M]aybe that's why people haven't done it, it's a lot of work, okay?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"[The Witness]: Some don't, but the good ones do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: Okay.... But it can be done?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"[The Witness]: Oh, yeah....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: [I]f somebody asked you to do it, you would do it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \"[The Witness]: I would do what I've been asked to do, based [on] my license ... I was asked to do a boundary stake out, I reviewed the records, everybody was consistent where that line was, I'm obligated to follow in the footsteps of a surveyor, [and] there's no reason to doubt where that line was....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: Even though [C. James Osborne, Jr.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   never referred to it as [the] 440 contour, on his original map? ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \"[The Witness]: At some point a contour is going to have a bearing and distance put on it, and he did. He just happened to be the first one that did it, whether he labeled it the 440 [contour] after that or not is not relevant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The trial court also relied on documentary evidence in reaching its conclusion. For instance, the trial court explained \"the legal description in the defendants' deed makes reference to map no. 2580 when describing the property conveyed to the defendants. Map no. 2580 expressly refers to the southerly boundary of the defendants' property as the '440 contour' and indicates that the land south of that border is land owned by [CL &amp; P].\" These maps and deeds identifying the boundaries of the defendants' property therefore provide further evidence to support the trial court's finding that the\n   plaintiff owned the property on which the defendants were building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The defendants assert, however, that the trial court incorrectly relied on deeds for the defendants' property to establish the boundaries of the plaintiff's property. We disagree. First, as we have explained previously in this opinion, the trial court's finding was based primarily on the testimony of the plaintiff's experts, whom the trial court found to be credible. Second, it is undisputed that CL &amp; P originally owned\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the land in this area and quitclaimed to the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the land it had not conveyed to others previously; therefore, demonstrating what land previously had been conveyed to others, including the defendants, may be useful in establishing the property currently owned by the plaintiff. Third, reliance on the deeds of one landowner to establish the boundaries of an adjoining landowner's property is not improper as a matter of law. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Barca\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mongillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1614851\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/133/374/#p376\">\n    133 Conn. 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 376,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.2d%20598\">\n    51 A.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1947) (relying, in part, on language in defendant's deed showing common boundary to establish plaintiff's ownership of abutting land in action for trespass); cf.\n   <em>\n    Velsmid\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"701528\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/175/221/#p227\">\n    175 Conn. 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227-28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=397%20A.2d%20113\">\n    397 A.2d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978) (relying on fixed monuments of adjoining property owner to establish boundary line). Thus, the trial court's reliance on deeds for the defendants' property was not incorrect, especially when those deeds incorporated documents referencing the plaintiff's ownership of the property immediately contiguous to the defendants' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the trial court's finding that the plaintiff owned the land on which the defendants had trespassed is supported by sufficient evidence in the record and is, therefore, not clearly erroneous. As previously mentioned in this opinion, the defendants do not challenge the trial court's findings as to any of the other elements\n   of trespass. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly found that the defendants were trespassing on the plaintiff's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The defendants also contend that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering injunctive relief that was overly broad and exceeded the scope of the relief sought by the plaintiff. Specifically, the defendants assert that two of the structures\n   that the trial court ordered the defendants to remove-namely, the lower patio and the adjacent retaining wall-were allowed under the permits previously issued by the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   For the reasons that follow, consistent with the parties' representations at oral argument before this court, we conclude that the trial court's order must be read so as to require the defendants to remove the lower patio and the adjacent retaining wall only to the extent that they are currently not in compliance with the original permits and then to allow the defendants to rebuild those structures in a manner that complies with those permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We begin by setting forth the appropriate standard of review. \"The issuance of an injunction and the scope and quantum of injunctive relief rests in the sound discretion of the trier.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cummings\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tripp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501596\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/67/#p90\">\n    204 Conn. 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=527%20A.2d%20230\">\n    527 A.2d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). \"[T]he court's ruling can be reviewed only for the purpose of determining whether the decision was based on an erroneous statement of law or an abuse of discretion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527616\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/155/#p165\">\n    223 Conn. 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=612%20A.2d%201153\">\n    612 A.2d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   At trial, the plaintiff introduced a permit dated May 13, 2014, memorializing an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants. In particular, this permit\n   allowed, inter alia, the defendants to construct a \"[l]evel [s]itting [a]rea\" that is 30 feet in length by 20 feet in width and made of gravel or peastone and a stone retaining wall around that area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As stated previously in this opinion, after finding that the defendants had trespassed, the trial court issued an injunction requiring, inter alia, the defendants to remove immediately several specifically enumerated structures \"that are located partially or entirely on the plaintiff's land shown as being outside the property boundary defined in bold as the '440 contour [elevation] line per ... map no. 1903' and 'property line per ... map no. 2580' [as] depicted on plaintiff's [exhibit seven]....\" These structures included \"the lower patio\" and \"the masonry retaining wall abutting the lower patio area....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   At oral argument before this court, the following colloquy occurred between the court and counsel for the plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \"The Court: So you read the order as the court telling the defendants to cut the retaining wall by ten feet, because it's ten feet too long, and take the patio and basically remove it, and you can have it as a gravel sitting area twenty [feet] by thirty [feet]....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: I think essentially that's right. I don't read it as granting the defendants any sort of affirmative relief about what they can do.... The court just said remove the patio that wasn't permitted and ... you should conform to the permit in the future, and any further trespasses are enjoined.... So I think the court was entirely consistent with what the permit allowed, [and] whether the defendants can [bring an action] for some sort of affirmative relief under the permit in the future [is] for another day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \"The Court: It sounds like, at least with respect to that issue, there wouldn't be a need to do that if ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   they agree with you about what the order requires them to do. That is, not take down the entire structure, but just to change it, put it back to what it was, or what's permitted under the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: Yah, I wouldn't say they violated the injunction by keeping a peastone or gravel sitting area there.... That would not be a violation of the injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"The Court: As long as it's thirty feet-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: Yah, as long as it's the proper size, correct. And the retaining wall, obviously, just needs to be reduced according to the judge's instructions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Likewise, at oral argument before this court, the following colloquy occurred between the court and counsel for the defendants:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \"The Court: [O]bviously, your view is that there is no trespass at all, at least with respect to the plaintiff. But if we disagree with you and ... we get to the second issue about the lower patio and [the abutting] retaining wall, in light of what [the plaintiff's counsel] said, is there really an issue anymore?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: Oh, I think there is, because, quite honestly, if you look at ... closing arguments, which are ... part of the record, [the plaintiff] keeps changing ... what [its] looking for....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \"The Court: Well, whatever they were looking for at trial, or before today, if you want to call it a concession, you heard [the plaintiff's counsel], based on what he said, if we were to include that in an opinion, what's left of that aspect of this controversy?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: Very little ... I'll agree with you, Your Honor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   After a review of the judgment of the trial court and the record before the trial court, including the May 13, 2014 permit authorizing the defendants to build the lower patio and abutting retaining wall, we agree with counsel for both parties that the injunctive relief must not be read to require complete removal of these structures. Rather, consistent with the representations of the parties at oral argument before this court, we conclude that the injunction requires the defendants (1) to remove the lower level patio, which had been constructed with pavers, and rebuild it, if they elect to do so, as a gravel or peastone sitting area, and (2) to remove the portions of the abutting retaining wall that exceed the size allowed by the permit. Accordingly, we conclude that the injunctive relief ordered by the trial court was proper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    This map is dated September 10, 2012, and was revised by Hiro to reflect certain changes on March 7, 2013, August 20, 2014, and September 9, 2014.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The defendants argue that the trial court incorrectly relied on Hiro's testimony because he did not verify the boundary by referring to the 1927 Rocky River datum, which was referred to in the 1934 deed. The trial court explained its reliance on Hiro's testimony as follows: \"Hiro ... testified that verifying the 1927 Rocky River datum by field locating it was unnecessary because it had been fixed by reference to permanent markers, which are still in existence, and identified by metes and bounds at the time it was established. Hiro also testified that in his experience the original permanently marked boundary line has been recognized as such ever since. Hiro then testified that it would not be possible for the actual field contour of 440 feet above sea level to serve as the property line because it would constantly be changing due to weather, construction along the waterfronts, and other causes.\" On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court reasonably relied on Hiro's testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    C.

On the basis of the representations made by the plaintiff's counsel at oral argument before this court, we consider these claims abandoned and understand the plaintiff to agree that the injunctive relief ordered by the trial court must be read so as to allow the defendants to maintain a lower level sitting area and retaining wall in accordance with the permit dated May 13, 2014.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
