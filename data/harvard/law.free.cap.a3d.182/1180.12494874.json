Hickey, voluntarily resigned from the bar of this state, he filed an application for reinstatement, and the plaintiffs, Disciplinary Counsel, and the Statewide Grievance Committee (committee), filed motions to dismiss the defendant's application for reinstatement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue that we must resolve in this appeal is whether the trial court properly granted the plaintiffs' motions to dismiss the defendant's application for reinstatement to the bar on the ground that the defendant had resigned from the bar and waived his right to apply for reinstatement. The defendant contends that the trial court incorrectly determined that the portion of Practice Book \u00a7 2-53 (b) providing that \"[n]o attorney who has resigned from the bar and waived the privilege of applying for readmission or reinstatement to the bar at any future time shall be eligible to apply for readmission or reinstatement to the bar,\" which became effective January 1, 2014, applied retroactively to his application for reinstatement filed in 2012. The defendant also claims that, under\n   Practice Book (2012) \u00a7 2-53 (a), which, according to him, is the rule of practice that the trial court should have applied to his application, the court had no authority to entertain the plaintiffs' motions to dismiss on the ground that he was ineligible to apply for reinstatement but, rather, was required to forward his application to a standing committee on recommendations for admission to the bar (standing committee) for a determination of that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the defendant was ineligible to apply for reinstatement to the bar as the result of his voluntary resignation and waiver of his right to apply for reinstatement, regardless of whether Practice Book \u00a7 2-53 (b) is retroactive. We further conclude that the trial court was not required to forward the defendant's application to a standing committee and properly granted the plaintiffs' motions to dismiss. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record reveals the following facts, which were either found by the trial court or are undisputed, and procedural history. After receiving a notice of overdraft relating to the defendant's IOLTA account,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in May, 2008, the committee initiated an investigation that ultimately led to an effort\n   by the committee to audit that account. In connection with the audit, the committee directed the defendant to produce certain documentation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 2-27 (c). Also during this time, the defendant's IOLTA account was selected for a random audit. In response, the defendant initiated a proceeding in the trial court pursuant to\n   Practice Book (2008) \u00a7 2-52, seeking permission to resign from the bar and to waive his right to apply for reinstatement. The defendant subsequently filed in the trial court a memorandum of law contending that the compelled production of the documentation sought by the committee would violate his right against self-incrimination guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. Because of the defendant's refusal to cooperate, the committee forwarded the defendant's overdraft grievance and random audit files to Disciplinary Counsel for presentment to the trial court. The plaintiffs initially objected to the defendant's resignation from the bar but, ultimately, withdrew their objections after the defendant agreed to provide certain documentation to the committee and Disciplinary Counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 12, 2008, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , conducted a hearing on the resignation proceeding. At the hearing, the committee submitted a report pursuant to Practice Book (2008) \u00a7 2-52 (b) in which it represented that, as the result of the defendant's resignation from the bar and waiver of his right to seek reinstatement, it would resolve all disciplinary matters involving the defendant. The court canvassed the defendant as to whether his resignation and waiver of his right to seek reinstatement were knowing and voluntary, and whether he had been advised by counsel of the ramifications of his actions. The defendant responded affirmatively to both inquiries. The court then accepted the defendant's resignation and waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, notwithstanding his voluntary resignation and prior waiver of his right to seek reinstatement to the bar, the defendant filed an application for reinstatement, contending that the \"waiver does not preclude a present determination of his present fitness to be admitted to practice law.\" Disciplinary Counsel filed a motion to dismiss the application, claiming that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain it as the result of\n   the defendant's waiver of his right to seek reinstatement. In response, the defendant contended that his waiver was not knowing or voluntary because he had never been advised of his right to appeal from the judgment of the trial court accepting his resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For reasons that are unclear from the record, no action was taken on Disciplinary Counsel's motion to dismiss for nearly four years. In January, 2016, the defendant filed a supplemental memorandum of law in opposition to the motion. He claimed that, during the years preceding his resignation, his wife had been struggling with a difficult and embarrassing family situation and that she was \" 'overwhelmed ... with fear' \" that the situation would become public if the committee's investigation against the defendant continued. Affidavits by the defendant and his wife setting forth the details of the family situation were attached to the defendant's opposition to the motion to dismiss. The defendant also contended that \"[f]our independent audits were conducted and [his] client trustee accounts were completely in compliance with the law ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, the committee also filed a motion to dismiss the defendant's application for reinstatement. In its memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss, the committee contended that its limited investigation of the defendant in 2008 had showed that there was \"a serious question that remains to this day as to whether the\n   [defendant] misappropriated funds from his IOLTA account.\" The committee also contended that the grievance complaint file, which stemmed from the IOLTA account overdraft, and the random audit file had been closed in exchange for the defendant's resignation and waiver, and that those files had since been destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After conducting a hearing on the plaintiffs' motions to dismiss, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Povodator\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , granted them\n   both.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court observed that, before reaching the merits of the defendant's claim that he was presently fit to serve as an attorney, the court was required to address the threshold question of whether the defendant's waiver precluded consideration of his application for reinstatement. The court concluded that, although there are no formal rules governing motion practice in reinstatement proceedings, the court had the inherent authority to entertain a motion to dismiss that raised this threshold question. The court also concluded that the portion of Practice Book \u00a7 2-53 (b) providing that an attorney who has resigned from the bar and waived the right to seek reinstatement is ineligible to apply for reinstatement, which was added to the rule and became effective in 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was retroactive because it \"restated existing procedures and practices, rather than creating a new prohibition.\" Addressing the defendant's claim that his waiver was invalid because it was not knowing and voluntary, the court stated that, \"accepting the factual contentions set forth in the affidavits ... relating to the concern about disclosure of family skeletons, the court cannot conclude that is a cognizable basis for finding a lack of knowing and voluntary waiver.\" The court further stated that, \"[w]hile the [defendant's] rationale may well be plausible and emotionally attractive, [his] own characterization of his decision as 'ill-considered' is not the equivalent of a negation of a knowing and voluntary decision. Nor, to the extent the term is invoked, do these facts constitute duress, an alternat[iv]e characterization given by the [defendant].\" The court concluded that no evidentiary hearing was necessary because the court assumed the truth of the facts averred in the affidavits that the defendant had\n   submitted in support of his application for reinstatement. Finally, the court concluded that the defendant's knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to seek reinstatement in exchange for the committee's assurance that there would be no further investigation of him precluded him from seeking reinstatement. Accordingly, the court granted the motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for articulation in which he requested that the trial court articulate, among other things, whether and on what ground it had determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his application for reinstatement. In its response, the court noted that the defendant had not previously raised the issue of whether the court's subject matter jurisdiction was implicated by the plaintiffs' claim that the defendant was ineligible to apply for reinstatement to the bar. The court then observed that \"[t]he sui generis nature of the proceeding undercuts the need for clear demarcation of [whether the issue was] jurisdictional [or] nonjurisdictional in a technical sense. The issue was whether there had been a threshold legal or factual presentation that would warrant further proceedings ....\" The court concluded that a motion to dismiss\n   was the proper vehicle for raising this issue, regardless of whether it fell within one of the traditional categories of claims implicating subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant claims that the trial court incorrectly determined that the current version of Practice Book \u00a7 2-53 (b), which provides in relevant part that \"[n]o attorney who has resigned from the bar and waived the privilege of applying for readmission or reinstatement to the bar at any future time shall\n   be eligible to apply for readmission or reinstatement to the bar under this rule,\" applies retroactively to his application. He also contends that the trial court incorrectly determined that it had the inherent authority to entertain the plaintiffs' motions to dismiss his application for reinstatement because (1) Practice Book (2012) \u00a7 2-53 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the defendant claims governs, requires the trial court to forward all applications for reinstatement to a standing committee for consideration, and (2) a waiver of the right to apply for reinstatement does not implicate the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over an application for reinstatement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the portion of Practice Book \u00a7 2-53 (b) providing that an attorney who has previously waived the right to seek reinstatement to the bar is ineligible to apply for reinstatement is not retroactive because that provision was neither procedural nor intended to be clarifying.

Indeed, although the defendant contends that the portion of Practice Book \u00a7 2-53 (b) providing that an attorney who previously has waived his or her right to apply for reinstatement to the bar is ineligible to apply for reinstatement is not retroactive because it is substantive, he does not contend on appeal that an attorney who has knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to apply for reinstatement to the bar should, nevertheless, be eligible to submit such an application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, he contends only that his waiver is not binding because it was not knowing or voluntary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we need not decide whether the amendment to Practice Book (2012) \u00a7 2-53 was retroactive because, even if it was not, the trial court in the present case correctly held that an attorney's knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to seek reinstatement to the bar after resignation renders that attorney permanently ineligible to seek reinstatement under the common law.

This is a question of law subject to plenary review. See\n   <em>\n    AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Plan &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"832000\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/232/#p239\">\n    260 Conn. 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=796%20A.2d%201164\">\n    796 A.2d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (\"[w]hether the trial court had the power to issue the order, as distinct from the question of whether the trial court properly exercised that power, is a question involving the scope of the trial court's inherent powers and, as such, is a question of law\" subject to plenary review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We conclude that the trial court properly determined that a motion to dismiss was the proper procedural vehicle to raise the claim that the defendant was ineligible to file his application for reinstatement to the bar. Although Practice Book (2012) \u00a7 2-53 (a) directs the trial court to refer any application for reinstatement after resignation to a standing committee, that rule also provides in relevant part that \"[n]o application for reinstatement or readmission shall be considered\n   <em>\n    by the court\n   </em>\n   unless the applicant, inter alia, states under oath in the application that he or she has successfully fulfilled all conditions imposed on him or her as part of the applicant's discipline.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) Thus, the rule expressly recognizes that there are cases in which the\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   cannot entertain an application for reinstatement in the first instance because the applicant is ineligible to apply for reinstatement, regardless of his or her present fitness to practice law. In other words, this rule of practice expressly recognizes that eligibility to apply for reinstatement and fitness for reinstatement are separate and distinct issues, and the\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   , rather than the standing committee, must determine eligibility as a threshold issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As we have explained, under the common law of this state, an attorney who has knowingly and voluntarily waived his or her right to seek reinstatement to the bar after resignation is\n   <em>\n    ineligible\n   </em>\n   to apply for reinstatement. See part I of this opinion. Although this rule was not expressly codified in Practice Book (2012) \u00a7 2-53, we can perceive no reason why an attorney who is ineligible to apply for reinstatement because he has waived the right to do so should be subject to a different procedure than an attorney who is ineligible to apply for the reasons set forth in this rule of practice. Indeed, even if Practice Book (2012) \u00a7 2-53 (a) did not expressly contemplate that the eligibility of an attorney to apply for reinstatement to the bar is a threshold issue to be decided by the trial\n   court, it would make little sense to require the court to forward an application for reinstatement by an attorney who was ineligible to apply to a standing committee for a full hearing on the merits. Such a proceeding would not benefit the attorney in any way, but would only cause delay and a waste of judicial resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition, it bears emphasizing that attorney disciplinary proceedings are sui generis, that it is the exclusive duty of the Judicial Branch to regulate attorneys, and that entities such as the committee and Disciplinary Counsel act as the agents of the court when carrying out their regulatory and disciplinary functions. See\n   <em>\n    Burton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mottolese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2629747\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/267/1/#p26\">\n    267 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20A.2d%20998\">\n    835 A.2d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (\"[T]he proceeding to disbar ... an attorney is neither a civil action nor a criminal proceeding, but is a proceeding sui generis, the object of which is not the punishment of the offender, but the protection of the court....

See\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Eberhart\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 269-70,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20A.2d%20749\">\n    841 A.2d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applications for reinstatement to bar following resignation and waiver of right to reapply referred to standing committees, both of which recommended that attorney applicant not be reinstated);\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Kliger\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 435 (matter was first referred to standing committee). We do not rely on these cases, however, for the proposition that the trial court has inherent authority to grant a motion to dismiss an application for reinstatement by an attorney who has waived his right to submit such an application, which is a question of procedure. Rather, we rely on these cases for the proposition that an attorney who has knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to apply for reinstatement is ineligible to submit an application for reinstatement. See part I of this opinion. Although the trial courts in\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Eberhart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Kliger\n   </em>\n   referred those respective applications to standing committees, nothing in those cases suggests that the trial court here was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to follow that procedure. Indeed, the procedural issue simply was not raised in those cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, the defendant contends that Practice Book \u00a7 1-8, which provides in relevant part that the rules of practice \"will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice,\" required the trial court to forward his application for reinstatement to a standing committee because \"[i]t would be an injustice\" to deny him a hearing on the question of \"whether the circumstances of his resignation and equity justify his readmission.\" The defendant contends that, contrary to the trial court's apparent belief, it was not \"inevitable\" that the outcome of such a hearing would be a recommendation that he was ineligible to apply for reinstatement because the standing committee could have found that the \"immense pressure\" created by his family circumstances at the time that he resigned\n   justified allowing him to apply for reinstatement. He further contends that \"the trial court had no discretion or fact-finding power on an application for readmission ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Again, we disagree. As we have indicated, the trial court accepted the truth of the affidavits submitted by the defendant concerning his family circumstances and concluded that, as a matter of\n   <em>\n    law\n   </em>\n   , those circumstances did not invalidate his waiver of his right to apply for reinstatement. The defendant does not claim that this conclusion was wrong on the basis of the evidence that was before the court; nor has he pointed to any additional evidence that he would have submitted if his application had been forwarded to a standing committee. The defendant also does not claim-for good reason-that, even if his waiver was knowing and voluntary, he is nevertheless eligible to apply for reinstatement because he is currently fit to practice law. Accordingly, we cannot perceive what would be gained by requiring a standing committee to make the threshold determination as to whether the defendant is eligible to apply for reinstatement, a legal determination that would, in any event, ultimately be subject to review by the trial court.

Cf.\n   <em>\n    Conboy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145932\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/642/#p652\">\n    292 Conn. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20669\">\n    974 A.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (\"where a jurisdictional determination is dependent on the resolution of a critical factual dispute, it cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss in the absence of an evidentiary hearing to establish jurisdictional facts\"). Thus, in a case-unlike the present one-in which the facts and circumstances surrounding an attorney's waiver of his right to apply for reinstatement to the bar could support a finding that the waiver was invalid for some reason, the trial court would have the authority to conduct an evidentiary hearing to explore that issue.
