Haji-Hassan appeals from a judgment of conviction entered by the trial court (Cumberland\n   County,\n   <em>\n    Warren, J.\n   </em>\n   ) after a jury found him guilty of intentional or knowing murder, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 201(1)(A) (2017). Haji-Hassan contends that the court abused its discretion and erred when it excluded evidence that the State of Maine's Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Mark Flomenbaum, had been removed from his former position as Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and erred when it instructed the jury on evidence of flight to avoid prosecution. Because the court did not abuse its discretion or err in either respect, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.

Haji-Hassan began waving a gun around while arguing with one of the men near the front door. Haji-Hassan fired two shots: the first was in a downward direction, and the second hit the victim in the leg. When the second shot was fired, one of the men left the apartment. Another man, the tenant of the apartment, went to the kitchen and heard a third shot followed by a \"thud.\" When the tenant returned to the first room, he saw the unresponsive victim lying on the floor with a wound to his head and called 911. Haji-Hassan and the remaining man had fled the apartment while the tenant was still in the kitchen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] On November 25, 2014, Haji-Hassan was charged by complaint with intentional or knowing murder, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 201(1)(A). At the time the complaint was filed, Haji-Hassan's location was unknown. On December 19, 2014, law enforcement officers went to a home in Minneapolis, Minnesota where Haji-Hassan was believed to be staying. The officers were admitted into the home and repeatedly announced their presence and called to Haji-Hassan. Haji-Hassan, who was hiding in the basement, came out only when a police dog barked at him, and when he did come out, he gave the officers a fake name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] On November 22, 2014, Dr. Flomenbaum performed an autopsy of the victim. On a later date, he examined photographs and x-rays that were taken in January 2015 of an injury to Haji-Hassan's leg. Dr. Flomenbaum opined that the leg injury was \"consistent with having been sustained by a bullet ... and could absolutely have occurred around the time frame of about eight weeks prior to when the photographs were taken\" and that it was \"consistent with healing of an entrance and exit of a bullet coming fairly straight downwards.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] In January 2015, Haji-Hassan was charged by indictment with murder\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 201(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Before trial, the State filed two motions\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of information and a motion in limine regarding Dr. Flomenbaum.

At the hearing on the motion in limine, a few hours before the jury was sworn and the trial began, Haji-Hassan presented evidence that Dr. Flomenbaum's removal was attributed to \"fundamental operational and administrative failures, including a substantial backlog of bodies, one case of a missing body, [his office's] failure to meet public health and occupational safety standards and [Dr. Flomenbaum's] lack of candor with the administration.\" The court concluded that Dr. Flomenbaum's removal was based on his failures as an administrator, not his performance as a pathologist, and excluded the evidence of his removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court reasoned that his role as an administrator was not an issue in Haji-Hassan's case, and therefore evidence of his removal was not \"relevant to ... his qualifications and actions as a pathologist,\" and admission would lead to \"a fruitless discussion of what the grounds [for removal] were and what the grounds weren't.\" Nonetheless, the court reminded the parties that Dr. Flomenbaum's testimony at trial could open the door to the admission of the excluded evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 9] The court held a six-day jury trial in December 2016. Dr. Flomenbaum testified about the autopsy that he performed on the victim and his assessment of Haji-Hassan's leg injury. Neither party questioned Dr. Flomenbaum about his removal from his position in Massachusetts or about the presiding judge's assessment of his credibility in the Connecticut trial, and the court made no further rulings on the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 10] After closing arguments, the court instructed the jury orally and in writing. With respect to Haji-Hassan's presence in Minnesota, the court gave the following instruction on flight to avoid prosecution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   There is also one other subject mentioned by both counsel, and there is an issue as to whether Mr. Haji-Hassan fled to Minnesota to avoid arrest or prosecution. There was evidence presented by both sides on that issue and it is up to you to determine the facts. I just need to tell you that, if proven, flight to avoid prosecution may be evidence of consciousness of guilt. You are not required to draw such an inference. It is up to you, as the jury, to decide what weight or effect, if any, should be\n   given to any evidence concerning Mr. Haji-Hassan's arrest in Minnesota.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Haji-Hassan did not object to the flight instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 11] The jury found Haji-Hassan guilty of murder, and the court sentenced him to imprisonment for a term of thirty-nine years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 12] Haji-Hassan timely appealed from the judgment of conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115 (2017) ; M.R.

Exclusion of Evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's Removal from Employment in Massachusetts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 13] We first consider Haji-Hassan's argument that the court should have admitted the evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's removal from his position as Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. \"We review a trial court's rulings on relevance for clear error, and rulings on admissibility for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Maine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316811\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/871/\">\n    2017 ME 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316811\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/871/\">\n    155 A.3d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration omitted) (citations omitted) (quotation marks omitted). However, if the challenge to the ruling was not properly preserved for appellate review, we review the ruling for obvious error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Fahnley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858420\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/727/\">\n    2015 ME 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858420\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/727/\">\n    119 A.3d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   M.R. Evid. 103(d) ; M.R.U. Crim. P. 52(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 14] In its pretrial ruling on the State's motion in limine to exclude evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's removal, the court determined that the evidence of his removal was not relevant to his actions as a pathologist in Haji-Hassan's case and would lead to a \"fruitless discussion\" of the grounds for his removal. The court reminded the parties that the door to admission could be opened at trial, but neither party made any further motions regarding the removal evidence or attempted to question Dr. Flomenbaum about it. \"Although the applicable standard of review is generally depend[e]nt upon whether the alleged error is preserved, we do not need to determine whether\" Haji-Hassan preserved his proffer of the removal evidence to impeach Dr. Flomenbaum's qualifications and capabilities as an expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Allen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986108\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/892/456/\">\n    2006 ME 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986108\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/892/456/\">\n    892 A.2d 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We assume, without deciding, that Haji-Hassan's arguments and the court's ruling at the hearing on the State's motion in limine served to preserve the objection, and we therefore apply the clear error and \"abuse of discretion standard[s] of review, which [are] more beneficial to [Haji-Hassan] than the obvious error standard.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986108\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/892/456/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even under that more beneficial standard of review, however, Haji-Hassan cannot prevail because the court did not err or abuse its discretion when it excluded evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 15] We must first determine whether the court committed clear error in determining that the evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's\n   removal, offered for purposes of impeaching his qualifications and capabilities as an expert, was not relevant to the case. The Maine Rules of Evidence generally authorize the admission of relevant evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Evid. 402. \"Evidence helpful in evaluating the credibility of a witness is 'of consequence' since it will aid in appraising the probative value of other evidence.\" Field &amp; Murray,\n   <em>\n    Maine Evidence\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 401.1 at 92 (6th ed. 2007);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   M.R. Evid. 401, 607. At the hearing on the motion in limine, Haji-Hassan argued that the evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's removal from his Massachusetts employment was relevant because (1) it was \"essential impeachment evidence when it [came to] his credibility and when it [came] to what he [was] saying\" because he would likely describe his qualifications, education, and past employment;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) Dr. Flomenbaum's opinion regarding Haji-Hassan's leg injury \"was not based on the sort of thing that experts in the field would base an opinion on ... [and] that sort of goes hand-in-hand with neglect of duty, incompetence, inefficiency and poor supervision.\" The trial court determined that Dr. Flomenbaum's removal was not attributed to his abilities, actions, and qualifications as a pathologist, but to his failures as an administrator. In Haji-Hassan's case, Dr. Flomenbaum acted exclusively as a pathologist-he performed the autopsy of the victim and offered an opinion of the nature of Haji-Hassan's leg wound after examining photographs and x-rays. This is in contrast to\n   <em>\n    State v. Coleman\n   </em>\n   , where Dr. Flomenbaum performed administrative functions by supervising the collection of sexual assault kit evidence and its chain of custody, and the State used his employment as the Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner to qualify him as an expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2041\">\n    2018 ME 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494719\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/689/\">\n    181 A.3d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the evidence and arguments in Haji-Hassan's case, the court did not err by determining that Dr. Flomenbaum's removal did not speak to his credibility as a pathologist and was not relevant to the testimony that he offered in Haji-Hassan's trial. In the circumstances of this case, the court did not err when it excluded the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Evid. 401, 402.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 16] Further, the court determined that admitting the evidence of the removal for administrative failures was not \"justif[ied]\" by his role in Haji-Hassan's case and would lead to \"a fruitless discussion of what the grounds [for Dr. Flomenbaum's removal] were and what the grounds weren't.\" This reasoning essentially reflects a determination that even if the evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's removal had some probative value, it was substantially outweighed by the risks of confusing the issues in the case and wasting time, both of which are grounds for excluding relevant evidence pursuant to Rule 403. The court's weighing of probative value against the risks of admission does not demonstrate an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b6 17] For the first time on appeal, Haji-Hassan makes two additional arguments in support of his contention that the court erred by excluding evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's removal from his employment in Massachusetts. First, he argues that because the jury could have reasonably\n   inferred that Dr. Flomenbaum testified favorably on behalf of the State to secure his Maine employment and avoid a second removal, evidence of his removal was relevant to show bias and was therefore admissible pursuant to Rule 607. And, second, he argues that because Dr. Flomenbaum's removal was partly based on findings that he lacked candor and failed to communicate fully and frankly, his removal was relevant evidence of a specific instance of untruthfulness, and was therefore admissible pursuant to Rule 608(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 18] These unpreserved challenges are reviewed for obvious error because they are raised for the first time on appeal. We \"may take notice of an obvious error affecting a substantial right, even if the claim of error was not properly preserved.\" M.R. Evid. 103(d) ; M.R.U. Crim.

The evidence is no more probative of bias than the fact, taken alone, that he is currently employed by the State. Further, its probative value with regard to his character for untruthfulness is also slight because \"lack of candor\" and \"failure to communicate fully and frankly\" are not specific instances of untruthful\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   , but are more akin to extrinsic opinions of a third party, and are not presented according to rules allowing evidence that is probative of a character for untruthfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 22] Having in mind the dangers listed in Rule 403, the court not only determined that the removal evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible, but also determined that it would lead to a \"fruitless discussion of what the grounds [for the removal] were and weren't.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Evid. 403. We have already concluded that the trial court did not clearly err when it determined that the evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's removal was not relevant in this case and that the court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the evidence would lead to the dangers listed in Rule 403. Accordingly, the exclusion of that evidence was a reasonable limitation on Haji-Hassan's cross-examination considering other possible options for impeachment available to Haji-Hassan-potential bias based on Dr. Flomenbaum's current employment with the State; sufficiency of the evidence supporting his opinion of Haji-Hassan's leg injury based solely on his review of the photographs and x-rays taken weeks after the injury allegedly occurred; and other challenges to his examination procedures and actions as a pathologist. Haji-Hassan's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b6 24] We recognize that the admissibility of evidence of Dr. Flomenbaum's removal has been raised in at least two other cases and may continue to be an issue in trial court proceedings where he appears as an expert witness.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

This is properly a case-by-case determination, and we announce no blanket rule on the admissibility of this evidence in other cases. The trial courts must exercise their discretion in the particularized context of each case to admit or exclude such evidence after evaluating the extent of any relevance it may have, and, if it is deemed relevant, weighing its probative value against the dangers listed in Rule 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B. Jury Instruction on Flight to Avoid Prosecution\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b6 25] Haji-Hassan also argues that the court committed obvious error when it\n   instructed the jury on how it could evaluate evidence of flight because there was insufficient evidence to support an inference that Haji-Hassan fled to avoid prosecution and the instruction favored the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b6 26] Because Haji-Hassan did not object to or otherwise raise the alleged error in the flight instruction at trial, we review his unpreserved challenge for obvious error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Haji-Hassan first argues that the evidence at trial did not generate a factual predicate to support the flight inference and instruction. The State, however, presented sufficient evidence to support an inferential finding of consciousness of guilt, including evidence that Haji-Hassan fled the Portland apartment immediately after the shooting, that he was in Minnesota shortly after the shooting, that he did not emerge from the basement of the home in Minnesota until he was confronted by a barking police dog, and that he initially gave a fake name to law enforcement when he was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 28] Contrary to Haji-Hassan's further contentions, the instructions given by the court, when reviewed as a whole, sufficiently explained that the State had the burden of proof on every element of the crime, that the jury must decide if the facts were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the jury was permitted to consider innocent explanations for his presence in Minnesota. In short, Haji-Hassan has failed to demonstrate any error, much less obvious error, in the court's instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lajoie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315531\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/132/\">\n    2017 ME 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315531\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/132/\">\n    154 A.3d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    One of these motions was captioned as an \"ex parte motion\" and the other was not.
