N.J.S.A. 2C:7-1 to -11, -19; N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g). That categorical lifetime bar cannot be lifted, even when the juvenile becomes an adult and poses no public safety risk, is fully rehabilitated, and is a fully productive member of society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant C.K. was adjudicated delinquent for sex offenses committed more than two decades ago and now challenges the constitutionality of N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g)'s permanent lifetime registration and notification requirements as applied to juveniles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsection (f) of N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2 subjects\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   sex offenders, including juveniles, to presumptive lifetime registration and notification\n   requirements. Unlike subsection (g), however, subsection (f) allows a registrant to seek relief from those requirements fifteen years after his juvenile adjudication, provided he has been offense-free and is \"not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.\" Subsection (g) imposes an irrebuttable presumption that juveniles, such as defendant, are irredeemable, even when they no longer pose a public safety risk and are fully rehabilitated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The record in this case reveals what is commonly known about juveniles-that their emotional, mental, and judgmental capacities are still developing and that their immaturity makes them more susceptible to act impulsively and rashly without consideration of the long-term consequences of their conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Zuber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306450\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/227/422/\">\n    227 N.J. 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306450\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/227/422/\">\n    152 A.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The record also supports the conclusion that juveniles adjudicated delinquent of committing sex offenses, such as C.K., who have been offense-free for many years and assessed not likely to reoffend, pose little risk to the public. Indeed, categorical lifetime notification and registration requirements may impede a juvenile's rehabilitative efforts and stunt his ability to become a healthy and integrated adult member of society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We conclude that subsection (g)'s lifetime registration and notification requirements as applied to juveniles violate the substantive due process guarantee of Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution. Permanently barring juveniles who have committed certain sex offenses from petitioning for relief from the Megan's Law requirements bears no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective. In the absence of subsection (g), N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f) provides the original safeguard incorporated into Megan's Law: no juvenile adjudicated delinquent will be released from his registration and notification requirements unless a Superior Court judge is persuaded that he has been offense-free and does not likely pose a societal risk after a fifteen-year look-back period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant may apply for termination from the Megan's Law requirements fifteen years from the date of his juvenile adjudication,\n   and be relieved of those requirements provided he meets the standards set forth in N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We begin with the juvenile offenses that triggered the registration and notification requirements in this case. When C.K. was approximately fifteen years old, he began sexually assaulting his younger adopted brother, A.K., who was then seven years old. After A.K. turned sixteen, he disclosed his older brother's abuse to his priest and then to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State charged C.K. with committing, while he was a juvenile, the offense of aggravated sexual assault against his adopted brother. At the time of the charge, C.K. was twenty-three years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The State moved to waive C.K. to the Criminal Part, Law Division, for trial as an adult. The State withdrew its waiver motion after C.K. agreed to plead guilty to the aggravated sexual assault charge in juvenile court. In his plea colloquy, C.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   admitted that when he was between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, he performed oral sex on his younger brother. In 2003, C.K. was sentenced to a three-year probationary term, conditioned on his attending sex-offender treatment and having no contact with his brother unless recommended by a therapist. The court also ordered C.K. to comply with the Megan's Law requirements and barred him from working with children without the court's permission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State classified C.K. as a Tier One offender-the lowest risk category for re-offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:7-8(c)(1). As a Tier One offender, C.K. is required to register annually with the law enforcement agency in the municipality where he resides.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2 ;\n   <em>\n    Attorney General Guidelines for Law Enforcement for the Implementation of Sex Offender Registration and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Community Notification Laws\n   </em>\n   9 (rev'd Feb. 2007) [hereinafter\n   <em>\n    Attorney General Guidelines\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the years after turning eighteen, C.K. received an undergraduate degree in psychology from Catholic University and a master's degree in counseling from Montclair State University. At the time of his arrest, C.K. was a teacher's assistant for children with autism. After his juvenile adjudication, C.K. stopped working with children. By age thirty-three, C.K. had worked for many years at a nonprofit agency that provides adults suffering from mental illness a range of services, such as securing psychiatric treatment and affordable housing. C.K. has turned down opportunities for professional advancement from fear that a background check might \"out\" his status as a Megan's Law registrant. It has now been more than twenty years since C.K. engaged in any unlawful conduct and more than fourteen years since his juvenile adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2008, five years after his juvenile adjudication, C.K. filed his first petition for post-conviction relief (PCR), seeking, among other things, a judicial declaration that the Megan's Law lifetime registration and notification requirements violated his constitutional rights. The PCR court denied the petition in its entirety. The Appellate Division affirmed the denial of C.K.'s petition, suggesting that an evidentiary record would be necessary to support his constitutional arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In November 2012, C.K. filed his second PCR petition, alleging that his earlier PCR counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to properly challenge the constitutionality of his Megan's Law requirements. The second PCR court held an evidentiary hearing. C.K. presented five expert witnesses who testified about the current body of research on juvenile sex offender recidivism. C.K. also offered psychological assessments about his mental, emotional, and career development during his adult life. The State\n   cross-examined C.K.'s witnesses but offered no rebuttal testimony or expert reports. The following summarizes the record before us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the evidentiary hearing, C.K. called Dr. Jackson Tay Bosley, Dr. Sean Hiscox, Dr. Robert Prentky, and Dr. James Reynolds, clinical psychologists with expertise in the treatment and rehabilitation of both juvenile and adult sex offenders. Dr. Hiscox was additionally qualified as an expert in the risk assessment of adult and juvenile offenders. Nicole Pittman, Esq., testified about the effects of placing juvenile offenders on registries based on her nationwide research on the subject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   All of the expert witnesses asserted that juvenile sex offenders are more amenable to rehabilitation and less likely to reoffend than adult sex offenders. They stressed that juvenile offenders, because of their lack of maturity and delayed social and emotional development, are fundamentally different from adult offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The experts pointed to multiple studies confirming that juveniles who commit sex offenses are more likely to act impulsively and be motivated by sexual curiosity, in contrast to adult sex offenders who are commonly aroused by deviant sexual behavior or engage in predatory or psychopathic conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elizabeth J. Letourneau &amp; Michael H. Miner,\n   <em>\n    Juvenile Sex Offenders: A Case Against the Legal and Clinical Status Quo\n   </em>\n   , 17\n   <em>\n    Sexual Abuse: J. Res. &amp; Treatment\n   </em>\n   293, 297-99 (2005); Human Rights Watch,\n   <em>\n    Raised on the Registry: The Irreparable Harm of Placing Children on Sex Offender Registries in the US\n   </em>\n   27-29 (2013) [hereinafter\n   Human Rights Watch,\n   <em>\n    Raised on the Registry\n   </em>\n   ]. Dr. Hiscox explained that \"adolescent sex offense recidivism rates are relatively low\" when compared \"with higher sex offense recidivism rates of individuals who commit sex offenses as adults.\" Dr. Bosley and other experts also noted that previous assumptions about high rates of juvenile sex offender recidivism as adults are inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   One recent study-cited by all five expert witnesses-analyzed sixty-three data sets with information about more than 11,200 juvenile sex offenders. The study averaged the data sets, some of which followed juvenile sex offenders for less than five years and others for more than five years, and concluded that the overall juvenile sex re-offense rate was seven percent. Michael F. Caldwell,\n   <em>\n    Study Characteristics and Recidivism Base Rates in Juvenile Sex Offender Recidivism\n   </em>\n   , 54\n   <em>\n    Int'l J. Offender Therapy &amp; Comp. Criminology\n   </em>\n   197, 201-03 (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to a report of psychologist Dr. Philip Witt, the recidivism rate for those falling into C.K.'s risk assessment category is 1.1% over a two-year period and 2.0% over a four-year period. In that report, he indicated that \"a sibling incest offender whose offense [was] in his early to mid-teens has little bearing on his risk\" many years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   None of the risk assessment statistics accounted for a juvenile sex offender who had been offense-free for a period of fifteen or more years since his adjudication. The experts, however, explained that juvenile sex offenders who commit subsequent sex offenses generally do so within the first few years following their last offense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , James R. Worling et al.,\n   <em>\n    20-\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Year Prospective Follow-Up Study of Specialized Treatment for Adolescents Who Offended Sexually\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Behav.%20Sci.%20%26%20L.%2054\">\n    28\n    <em>\n     Behav. Sci. &amp; L.\n    </em>\n    54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\"[M]ost sexual and nonsexual recidivism occurs in the first few years after adolescents are initially assessed.\"). According to Dr. Hiscox, the longer a juvenile turned adult remains offense-free in the community, the lower the risk that he will re-offend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The experts generally agreed that the best way to assess an offender's risk of\n   recidivism is with individualized assessments. As\n   Dr. Prentky explained, \"Risk is not fixed, and it certainly can't be adequately captured by one single event in the life of ... an adolescent who is constantly changing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ms. Pittman observed that categorical lifetime registration requirements based on an aggravated sex offense conviction disproportionately impact juveniles. That is so because juveniles commonly commit sex offenses against their peers or somewhat younger children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Human Rights Watch,\n   <em>\n    Raised on the Registry\n   </em>\n   at 25 (\"[R]ecent laws ... reserve the harshest punishments for those who target children without seeming to appreciate that child offenders, whose crimes almost always involve other kids, are particularly likely to be subjected to these harsher penalties.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Last, according to the experts, studies reveal that registration policies do not necessarily reduce recidivism among juvenile sex offenders.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Elizabeth J. Letourneau et al.,\n   <em>\n    The Influence of Sex Offender Registration on Juvenile Sexual Recidivism\n   </em>\n   , 20\n   <em>\n    Crim. Just. Pol'y Rev.\n   </em>\n   136, 138, 143 (2009) (finding no significant difference in recidivism rates between registered and nonregistered juvenile male sex offenders over a nine-year period). Correspondingly, Ms. Pittman expressed her concern that inflexible lifetime registration requirements imposed on juveniles impede their rehabilitation and their quest for normal and productive lives in welcoming communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The evidentiary hearing also focused on the experts' individualized risk assessments of C.K., now thirty-eight years old, and on\n   the negative impact the registration requirements continue to have on his ability to lead a normal life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   C.K. participated in several psychological assessments, including two with Dr. Witt. In his 2003 assessment, made shortly after C.K.'s arrest, Dr. Witt did not find any indication that \"[C.K.'s] sexual behavior with his brother was part of a broader pattern of illegal sexual behavior.\" He considered C.K. \"a low risk.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 2009, Dr. Witt reevaluated C.K., then twenty-nine years old, and observed that C.K. was \"an adult with a productive, appropriate lifestyle and healthy sexual adjustment\" who presented a low risk to reoffend. Dr. Witt noted that the \"risk assessment is really just a reflection of commonsense: When an individual's risk is relatively low to begin with and the individual has had a stable, offense-free lifestyle for many years, his current risk is minimal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Hiscox testified that C.K.'s 2013 psychological evaluation was \"completely consistent with Dr. Witt's two risk assessments.\" Dr. Hiscox further observed that C.K. had \"gone 16 to 20 years in the community without a new sexual or non-sexual offense\" and the research was clear: \"the longer an individual goes without committing a new sex offense while at liberty in the community, the lower his risk of reoffending.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That same year, in interviews with Ms. Pittman, C.K. expressed his feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression resulting from his Megan's Law status. He also disclosed his sense of hopelessness, and his fear that his registrant status will interfere\n   with his ability to one day be a normal parent who can attend his children's sports games and school conferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The PCR court found the \"evidence presented by [C.K.'s] psychologists [to be] credible and persuasive\" and noted that\n   \"[t]he State did not present any evidence to the contrary.\" The PCR court summarized some of the opinions reached by C.K.'s experts: (1) \"[y]outh sex offenders differ from adult sex offenders\" and \"are more amenable to sex offender specific treatment\"; (2) \"the adolescent brain is not fully mature\"; (3) an individualized risk-based assessment of a juvenile sex offender \"adequately protects the public from recidivist sex offenders\"; (4) a categorical offense-based bar unnecessarily precludes low-risk juvenile offenders who pose no threat to the community from relief from the Megan's Law registration requirements; and (5) the offense-based bar to relief is \"not rationally related to the State's interest to protect persons from recidivist sex offenders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The PCR court concluded, however, that any loosening of the strictures of Megan's Law must come from this Court in assessing the constitutionality of the registration scheme as applied to juveniles or from the Legislature, which has the paramount role in forging public policy. The PCR court expressed that it was constrained by the precedents of this Court and, on that basis, \"the adverse consequences of Megan's Law registration\" do not give rise to a constitutional issue. Finally, the PCR court held that C.K. did not satisfy the standard for proving ineffective assistance of prior counsel, under\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) and\n   <em>\n    State v.

We also granted the motions of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, Advocates for Children of New Jersey, and Northeast Juvenile Defender Center (collectively, ACLU-NJ), the Juvenile Law Center, the Office of the Public Defender, and the Attorney General of New Jersey to participate as amici curiae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Our grant of certification is limited to addressing the constitutionality of N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g) as applied to juveniles, which, unlike subsection (f), imposes categorical lifetime registration requirements for certain sex offenses. We therefore do not consider the parties' general arguments that all juvenile offense-based registration requirements are constitutionally infirm because they do not assess the actual risk posed by an individual juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   C.K. contends that the Megan's Law lifetime registration requirements in N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g), as applied to juveniles, violate his federal and state constitutional rights to substantive due process and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. C.K. claims that the registration scheme's irrebuttable presumption that juveniles who commit certain sex offenses are dangerous and irredeemable is at odds with the expert testimony presented at the PCR hearing, the neuroscience about the developing juvenile brain, and his own life story. He asserts that a lifetime registration scheme for juvenile sex offenders that makes no allowance for a juvenile's rehabilitation and low risk for re-offense is penal, not remedial, in nature and advances no legitimate governmental objective. He describes how the registration scheme erects barriers\n   to a juvenile's acceptance into society, career advancement, and personal happiness, despite, as in his case, an offense-free record and uniform expert testimony that he poses no safety risk. According to C.K., a risk-based assessment is sufficient to protect society's interest in public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The ACLU-NJ, the Juvenile Law Center, and the Public Defender, as amici curiae, echo the arguments advanced by C.K. and raise additional points, some collectively and others individually. Amici emphasize that juvenile sex offenders are distinguishable from their adult counterparts due to their immaturity and lack of cognitive development, their amenability to rehabilitation, and their lower recidivism rate. N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g) imposes an undifferentiated disability on juvenile registrants, without regard to their actual risk, and therefore bears no relationship to a legitimate state interest. According to amici, rehabilitated juvenile sex offenders, while on the registry, face increased difficulties securing education, employment, and housing and suffer a stigma that has harmful psychological consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The State submits that \"lifetime Megan's Law registration for juveniles adjudicated delinquent or convicted of certain offenses pass[es] constitutional muster\" under\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   The State maintains that C.K.'s concerns about imposing lifetime registration on adolescents \"are appropriately directed at the Legislature\" rather than this Court. It assails the studies relied on by C.K.'s experts, reporting low juvenile recidivism rates and high rehabilitative success, because they do not distinguish between the general class of juvenile sex offenders and the subclass of offenders affected by subsection (g)-those adjudicated of committing aggravated sexual assault, forcible sexual assault, or multiple sex offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The State, moreover, claims that C.K. has presented largely theoretical harms and unfounded fears, given his status as a Tier One registrant not subject to the broader Megan's Law notification\n   requirements, and is not a proper class representative of all Tier registrants to challenge the constitutionality of N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g). Additionally, the State explains that its failure to present witnesses at the PCR hearing flowed from its belief that \"the issue was settled\" and should not be read as a concession that it agreed with C.K.'s experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Attorney General, as amicus curiae, emphasizes many of the points made by the State. The Attorney General asserts the twofold purpose of the registration and notification scheme is to allow law enforcement to keep track of the whereabouts of sex offenders and to arm the public with\n   information concerning an offender's identity, location, and offense. This registration scheme, the Attorney General insists, is remedial, not punitive, and advances the goal of public safety. Finally, the Attorney General states that amending Megan's Law is the province of the Legislature, not this Court, and that C.K., and his amici, should bring the developing social science evidence to the attention of the branch of government responsible for public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We granted certification to address the constitutionality of imposing the Megan's Law lifetime registration and notification requirements on juveniles adjudicated of committing certain sex offenses, despite the peculiar procedural vehicle for doing so.

Our commonsense and historical understanding that children are different from adults is enshrined in our juvenile justice system and fortified by recent United States Supreme Court decisions and\n   <em>\n    Zuber\n   </em>\n   , which embraced those studies that found that juveniles do not possess immutable psychological or behavioral characteristics. That body of jurisprudence and the evidentiary record in this case tell us that adolescents are works in progress and that age tempers the impetuosity, immaturity, and shortsightedness of youth. They tell us that, generally, juvenile sex offenders are less likely to reoffend than adult sex offenders and that the likelihood of recidivism is particularly low for those who have not reoffended for a long period of time. They tell us that the permanent status of sex-offender registrant will impair a juvenile, as he grows into adulthood, from gaining employment opportunities, finding acceptance in his community, developing a healthy sense of self-worth, and forming personal relationships. In essence, the juvenile registrant will forever remain a social pariah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g) is grounded on the irrebuttable presumption that juveniles adjudicated delinquent for committing certain sex offenses will forever pose a danger to society. That irrebuttable presumption disregards any individual assessment of whether a particular registrant is likely to reoffend, long after the adjudication and long after the juvenile has become an adult. Those juveniles are, in effect, branded as irredeemable-at a point when their lives have barely begun and before their personalities are fully formed. They must carry this stigma even if they can prove that they pose no societal threat. But that irrebuttable lifetime presumption is not supported by scientific and sociological studies\n   or our jurisprudence and is not needed given the fifteen-year look back required by subsection (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Even a lifetime presumption with a twenty-five-year look-back period has been found violative of some states' constitutions. New Jersey's lifetime presumption of dangerousness that attaches to juvenile sex offenders pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g) is more extreme than the registration and notification schemes, as applied to juveniles, struck down by the Ohio and Pennsylvania Supreme Courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20N.E.2d%20729\">\n    967 N.E.2d at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 737 ;\n   <em>\n    J.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276409,6890827\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/1/\">\n    107 A.3d at 2, 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ohio and Pennsylvania schemes, which allowed juvenile sex offenders to seek the lifting of registration and notification requirements after the passage of twenty-five years, were deemed constitutionally offensive because the classifications were not based on ongoing individual risk assessments.\n   <em>\n    C.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20N.E.2d%20729\">\n    967 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   741-42 ;\n   <em>\n    J.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276409,6890827\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/1/\">\n    107 A.3d at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g) is even out of step with federal SORNA, which has no permanent lifetime registration provision for juveniles. A juvenile Tier III offender under the federal enactment is subject to a presumptive lifetime registration\n   but, after twenty-five years, is eligible to have his registration requirements terminated.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020915\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) to (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Subsection (g) of N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2, moreover, cannot be viewed in isolation from other provisions of the statute. Subsection (f) imposes presumptive lifetime registration and notification requirements for sex offenses covered by subsection (g) but allows for a juvenile sex offender to be relieved of those requirements fifteen years after his juvenile adjudication or release from a correctional facility, provided he has been offense-free and \"is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.\" Thus, under subsection (f), those juvenile sex offenders who have reoffended or pose a continuing threat after fifteen years will not be relieved of their registration and notification requirements. Subsection (g) has the perverse effect of keeping on the sex-offender registry those juveniles who have completed their rehabilitation, not reoffended, and who can prove after a fifteen-year look-back period that they are not likely to pose a societal threat. When, in the case of\n   juveniles, the remedial purpose of Megan's Law-rehabilitation of the offender and protection of the public-is satisfied, then the continued constraints on their lives and liberty pursuant to subjection (g), long after they have become adults, takes on a punitive aspect that cannot be justified by our Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   It is at that point that subsection (g), as applied to juveniles, no longer bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose and arbitrarily denies those individuals their right to liberty and enjoyment of happiness guaranteed by Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   It also bears emphasizing that holding that subsection (g) runs afoul of a fundamental right guaranteed under our State Constitution will not likely jeopardize any federal funding to this State. First, as mentioned earlier, subsection (g) is more severe and inflexible than the Tier III provisions of the federal SORNA. Second, a state is likely exempt from the federal SORNA's dictates when implementing one of its provisions is violative of a state's constitution, \"as determined by a ruling of the jurisdiction's highest court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020927\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   C.K.'s case in many ways exemplifies why subsection (g) does not bear a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state purpose when applied to juvenile offenders. Twenty years have passed since C.K. committed his offense as a juvenile, and his adjudication occurred more than fourteen years ago. C.K. is now thirty-eight years old and has not committed an offense in twenty years and none since his juvenile delinquency adjudication. Over the years, he has complied with his Megan's Law responsibilities. He has graduated from college and received a master's degree in counseling, remained gainfully employed working for a nonprofit agency that provides services for adults suffering from mental illness, and has been a contributing member of his community. Multiple psychological evaluations attest that he is an extremely low risk to reoffend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Nevertheless, C.K. remains a sex-offender registrant. That tainted status has permeated various spheres of his life-professional, personal, and social. He often feels isolated and depressed. He has turned down opportunities for professional advancement for fear that his juvenile sex-offender registrant status will be revealed. He despairs that the permanent designation of sex-offender registrant will impair his ability to fully participate in the lives of his children, if he one day has a family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Solely because of the nature of the offense he committed as a juvenile, C.K. is presumed under subsection (g) to be a\n   permanent, lifetime risk to the safety of the public. That irrebuttable presumption, however, is not supported by scientific or sociological studies, our jurisprudence, or the record in this case. Because it does not further a legitimate state interest when applied to juveniles, subsection (g) does not withstand scrutiny under Article I, Paragraph 1 of our State Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For the reasons expressed, we hold that N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(g) is unconstitutional as applied to juveniles adjudicated delinquent as sex offenders. Under subsection (f) of N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2, fifteen years from the date of his juvenile adjudication, C.K. will be eligible to seek the lifting of his sex-offender registration requirements. At that time, he must be given the opportunity to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he has not reoffended and no longer poses a threat to others and therefore has a right to be relieved of his Megan's Law obligations and his status as a sex-offender registrant.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Notification of the constitutional challenge was provided to the Attorney General's Office, which declined to participate in the PCR proceeding.
