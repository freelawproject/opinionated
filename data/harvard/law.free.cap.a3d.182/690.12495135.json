On appeal, the petitioner asserts that he was denied his rights to due process, assigned counsel, and notice and a hearing, when the\n   court, sua sponte, dismissed his petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, contends that the court was not required to hold a hearing because the petitioner was not in custody at the time he filed the petition. We agree with the respondent and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On June 24, 2016, the petitioner, representing himself, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In his petition, under the \"details of conviction and sentence now being served\" section, he listed the location of the court as \"Bridgeport low court.\" The petitioner further stated that he pleaded guilty on \"9/ 2013\" in \"CR-12-267383, robbery in the third degree,\" and listed the total effective sentence as \"unconditional discharge.\" In a handwritten attachment to his petition, he stated, \"[m]y plea bargain was not followed because my lawyer stated [specifically] that the robbery third charge would\n   not make me 85 [percent] due to the unconditional discharge and it being on a completely separate [docket].\" He also attached a letter that he received from the Board of Pardons and Paroles, which stated in relevant part: \"[Y]ou are ineligible for parole until you have served not less than 85 [percent] of your definite sentence imposed by the court.\" As relief, the petitioner requested that the court allow him to withdraw his guilty plea and \"vacate and/or dismiss [the] charge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 28, 2016, the court, sua sponte and without holding a hearing, dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   explaining that \"the petitioner was no\n   longer in custody for the conviction being challenged at the time the petition was filed.\" The petitioner filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied on August 18, 2016. The court subsequently granted the petition for certification to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner claims that he improperly was denied his constitutional and statutory rights to due process, to notice of a hearing, to assigned counsel, and to be heard on his petition, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (a) and Practice Book \u00a7 23-24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the petitioner claims that his pleadings could be construed to state a cognizable claim for relief, i.e., the court could infer, on the basis of the information in his petition, that he was incarcerated on a separate conviction for which his parole eligibility was affected by his plea of guilty to robbery in the third degree. The petitioner argues that once the \"habeas case [was] docketed,\" the court is required to provide him with assigned counsel and the opportunity to attend any dispositive hearing. Moreover, the petitioner argues that because he filed his petition without the assistance of counsel, the court should have inferred that it had subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of a broad and liberal interpretation of the pleadings. In response, the respondent contends that the court's sua sponte dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was proper\n   and that the court appropriately construed the petition as challenging an expired conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We first set forth our well established standard of review and relevant legal principles. \"Subject matter jurisdiction for adjudicating habeas petitions is conferred on the Superior Court by General Statutes \u00a7 52-466, which gives it the authority to hear those petitions that allege illegal confinement or deprivation of liberty.... We have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.... Moreover,\n   [i]t is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time.... Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it.... [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction .... The subject matter jurisdiction requirement may not be waived by any party, and also may be raised by a party, or by the court sua sponte, at any stage of the proceedings, including on appeal.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Anthony A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Conn.%20App.%20226\">\n    159 Conn.
