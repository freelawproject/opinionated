On appeal, the plaintiff claims (1) that the arbitration proceeding involved a restricted submission, warranting expanded judicial review of the arbitrator's award of alimony and property division. Alternatively, she argues that the trial court improperly confirmed the award because: (2) the award violates the public policy underlying General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82 and case law construing those statutes; (3) the award contravenes General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 given the arbitrator's evident partiality and manifest disregard of the law; (4) the trial court committed plain error by confirming the arbitrator's decision; and (5) the arbitrator improperly awarded attorney's fees. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant. The parties were married on August 22, 1987. In September, 2014, the plaintiff commenced the underlying dissolution action. After litigating the matter in the trial court for approximately sixteen months, the parties, on January 5, 2016, agreed to submit the matter to arbitration. On that same day, the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Stanley Novack\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, granted the plaintiff's\n   motion to approve the arbitration agreement. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66(c). Pursuant to their agreement, the parties consented to have a retired judge of the Superior Court serve as the arbitrator. A two day arbitration proceeding took place on February 1 and 2, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties agreed that Connecticut law would govern the substantive issues to be decided by the arbitrator. Additionally, paragraph 5 of the parties' agreement provided: \"Issues: The parties shall arbitrate the dissolution of marriage action, including, but not limited to issues of alimony, property division for both assets and liabilities, lump sum alimony, and attorney fees and costs. The parties will stipulate to the maximum Child Support Guidelines amount for one child. The arbitrator shall consider this amount in making the appropriate alimony determination.\" Paragraph 11 of the agreement provided in relevant part: \"Arbitration Award.... The legal conclusions and applicability of what is considered property or income for alimony shall be reserved and subject to appeal by either party within the appeal period commencing upon the approval of the arbitrator's decision by the Superior Court. The findings of fact made by the arbitrator shall not be reserved as an issue for appeal. The parties are separately acknowledging this in Schedule A appended hereto.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The arbitrator rendered her award on March 10, 2016. She awarded the plaintiff alimony, divided the parties' marital and premarital assets, and awarded the defendant attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 22, 2016,\n   the defendant\n   filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-417 and 52-420 ; see also General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66(c). The plaintiff filed her motion to vacate on March 24, 2016. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 and 52-420.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In her memorandum of law in support of the motion to vacate, the plaintiff argued the same claims she presses on appeal, including her contention that the agreement \"specifically provided for judicial review of all ... issues of law in the award, as well as the application of Connecticut law by the arbitrator.\" Thus, she argued that the submission to arbitration \"was clearly not unrestricted.\" The defendant opposed the plaintiff's motion to vacate and argued that the plaintiff misunderstood paragraph 11 of the parties' agreement. According to the defendant, paragraph 11 \"allow[ed] a party to appeal after confirmation of the arbitration award on the limited issue of what is considered property or income for alimony purposes. In other words, this provision\n   <em>\n    allows an appeal to the Appellate Court\n   </em>\n   , not the Superior Court, on the sole issue of the\n   <em>\n    classification\n   </em>\n   of something as property or income\n   <em>\n    for alimony\n   </em>\n   purposes.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the defendant took the position that judicial review of the award was limited because \"[t]he plaintiff ha[d] not claimed ... that there was a mischaracterization of any of the parties' holdings as property or income for alimony purposes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Colin, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate and granted the defendant's motion to confirm on May 16, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found that the plaintiff had failed to prove her claims, but did not specifically address whether the agreement involved a restricted\n   or an unrestricted submission. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment, in which the court granted the defendant's motion to confirm and dissolved the parties' marriage. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first address our standard of review. The plaintiff claims that the arbitration proceeding involved a restricted submission, warranting expanded judicial review of the arbitrator's award of alimony and property division. She asserts that her appeal \"challenges the\n   <em>\n    legal conclusions\n   </em>\n   of [the arbitrator] as to alimony and property division....\" (Emphasis added.) According to her, these issues were explicitly reserved for appellate review. Therefore, she argues, we should review her appeal under the abuse of discretion standard that is generally applicable to domestic relations matters.

Thus, her claim falls within the unrestricted portion of the agreement and should be reviewed as would any other arbitration award.\" In other words, he argues that we should apply standard rules governing review of arbitration awards because the plaintiff's appeal does not implicate the\n   arbitrator's legal conclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the defendant.\n   \"Our analysis of the [plaintiff's] claim is guided by the well established principles of law governing arbitration. Arbitration is a creature of contract and the parties themselves, by the terms of their submission, define the powers of the [arbitrator]....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution.... Under an unrestricted submission, [an arbitrator's] decision is considered final and binding; thus the courts will not review the evidence considered by the [arbitrator] nor will they review the award for errors of law or fact.... Such a limited scope of judicial review is warranted given the fact that the parties voluntarily bargained for the decision of the arbitrator and, as such, the parties are presumed to have assumed the risks of and waived objections to that decision.... It is clear that a party cannot object to an award which accomplishes precisely what the [arbitrator was] authorized to do merely because that party dislikes the results.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    LaFrance\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lodmell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486821\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/373/#p850\">\n    322 Conn. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850-51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486821\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/373/#p850\">\n    144 A.3d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The submission constitutes the charter of the entire arbitration proceedings and defines and limits the issues to be decided.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Schoonmaker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546815\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/252/416/#p454\">\n    252 Conn. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 454,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=747%20A.2d%201017\">\n    747 A.2d 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). \"When the submission to the arbitrator contains express language restricting the breadth of issues, reserving explicit rights, or conditioning the award on court review, the submission is deemed restricted and we engage in de novo review.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Office of Labor Relations\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    AFL-CIO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713165\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/223/#p229\">\n    288 Conn. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=951%20A.2d%201249\">\n    951 A.2d 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Garrity\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McCaskey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527663\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/1/#p5\">\n    223 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=612%20A.2d%20742\">\n    612 A.2d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). \"In the absence of any such qualifications, an agreement is unrestricted.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    LaFrance\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lodmell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486821\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/373/#p850\">\n    322 Conn. at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486821\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/373/#p850\">\n    144 A.3d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The significance, therefore, of a determination that an arbitration submission was unrestricted or restricted is not to determine what the [arbitrator is] obligated to do, but to determine the scope of judicial review of what [he or she has] done.

For the first time on appeal, the plaintiff also argues: the arbitrator knew that she suffered from Lyme disease and was ill during the proceedings, but \"made no meaningful inquiry, thus ... ignoring the whole issue of [the plaintiff's] competence to testify and generally proceed with the hearing\"; the arbitrator denied the plaintiff's request for a recess; and the arbitrator made certain \"editorial comments\" in her written decision that were \"arguably unnecessary, if not gratuitous.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the plaintiff's claim is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"A party seeking to vacate an arbitration award on the ground of evident\n   partiality has the burden of producing sufficient evidence in support of the claim.

In construing \u00a7 52-418(a)(2), [our Supreme Court] concluded that evident partiality will be found where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration.

The plaintiff, however, draws our attention to isolated instances in the record that are taken out of context. Throughout the proceedings, the plaintiff provided answers that were nonresponsive, began to respond to questions before counsel completed them, attempted to testify when no questions were pending, or was combative with counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record suggests that the arbitrator was simply attempting, appropriately, to control the proceedings and keep the testimony relevant and focused.

The arbitrator's admonishment of the plaintiff and warnings to her about the imposition of sanctions, therefore, fail to demonstrate evident partiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff fails to direct our attention to any authority supporting her argument that the \"editorial comments\" in the arbitrator's decision demonstrate evident partiality. Simply put, the plaintiff takes issue with how the arbitrator phrased some of her factual findings or how she characterized\n   the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff has failed to bring to our attention any words or phrases used by the arbitrator indicating that she tended to favor one party over the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff's argument that evident partiality exists based on the arbitrator's failure to inquire into the plaintiff's ability to proceed with the hearing is belied by the record. The arbitrator expressly found that the plaintiff \"has Lyme disease and ... that its symptoms interfere with many of her activities, causing fatigue and pain. There were times during the hearing that the plaintiff engaged in outbursts; she attributed that to the Lyme disease.\" The arbitrator even asked the plaintiff about her treatment for Lyme disease. On multiple occasions, the plaintiff also stated that \"I don't need a break\" after both her lawyer and the arbitrator sought a break on her behalf. The record, therefore, does not support the claim that the arbitrator was partial under the circumstances.

The court also stated that the plaintiff had \"failed to produce sufficient evidence to satisfy any of her claims.\" If the court treated the submission as restricted, it simply would have reviewed the arbitrator's award to determine whether the arbitrator abused her discretion in awarding alimony and dividing the parties' property without reference to the plaintiff's failure to produce \"evidence\" to prove her claims. Therefore, we construe the trial court's judgment as having treated the submission as unrestricted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    \"[W]hether the trial court engaged in the correct level of review of the arbitrator's decision presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.\"\n    <em>\n     HH East Parcel, LLC\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Handy &amp; Harman, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733428\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/189/\">\n     287 Conn. 189\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 196,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=947%20A.2d%20916\">\n     947 A.2d 916\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2008).
