This somewhat complex appeal requires an understanding of petitioner's past history of PCR petitions; the two PCR petitions on appeal in this case; our law concerning successive petitions and abuse of the writ, respectively; the potential implications of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2012 decision in\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Prior PCR Petitions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. The relevant history is as follows. In 1989, petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder. This Court's decision on petitioner's direct appeal of his conviction describes the circumstances of the underlying crime.\n   <em>\n    State v. Towne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4836961\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/607/\">\n    158 Vt. 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4836961\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/607/\">\n    615 A.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. While his direct appeal was pending, petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief (PCR) in the superior court alleging that he had been denied a speedy trial and that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue alibi witnesses, raise an insanity defense, or adequately impeach State's witnesses. The court held a series of hearings at which petitioner was represented by counsel. In an entry order dated August 1992, the court dismissed the petition, stating that \"[p]etitioner has failed to frame the issue in such a way that any likelihood of a different outcome would have been possible.\" Petitioner did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In September 1992, petitioner filed his second PCR petition alleging a speedy trial violation and arguing that his \"trial on information\" rather than grand jury indictment violated his rights. The court dismissed this petition on the merits, and petitioner did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Seven months later, petitioner filed his third PCR petition, once again alleging that his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to pursue potential alibi witnesses. The court dismissed the petition, noting that the same claim had already been addressed on the merits in the first PCR petition. Petitioner appealed to this Court, arguing that the dismissal of his first PCR petition had not been on the merits because there was no evidentiary hearing held on the record, and thus the original PCR court could not have determined whether his claim had merit.\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Towne\n   </em>\n   , No. 1994-105 (Vt. April 25, 1995) (unpub. mem.). In April 1995, this Court affirmed the dismissal on the ground that petitioner's claim was successive because\n   the original PCR court dismissed the petition on the merits after considering the trial record and the underlying facts concerning the alleged deficiencies by trial counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4836961\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/607/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4836961\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/607/\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   slip op. at 2. In addition, this Court concluded that the third petition suffered the same flaw as petitioner's first: petitioner did not establish that the alibi witnesses would have confirmed his story and changed the outcome of the trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4836961\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/607/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4836961\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/607/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. In September 1995, petitioner filed his fourth PCR petition. He alleged, among other things, that his appointed counsel during his first PCR petition was ineffective for failing to appeal its dismissal or to notify him of the dismissal so that he could appeal pro se. That PCR court granted the State summary judgment, ruling in relevant part that his original PCR counsel's failure to appeal could have been raised in prior petitions and were thus successive. On appeal to this Court, petitioner argued that his claim was not successive because a PCR claim is only successive if it renews issues that were determined on the merits in an earlier decision and the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits on a later petition. The Court disagreed with petitioner and held that the PCR court had the discretion to dismiss new claims that could have been raised in an earlier petition, absent petitioner demonstrating cause as to why he had not raised them previously.\n   <em>\n    In re Towne\n   </em>\n   , No. 1997-483, slip op. at 2 (Vt. Sept. 30, 1998) (unpub. mem.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. In a fifth PCR petition petitioner argued that he was denied effective assistance of PCR counsel in his first PCR proceeding because his counsel failed to present alibi witnesses, appeal the petition dismissal, or notify petitioner of the dismissal. This Court affirmed that PCR court's dismissal on the basis that all of these claims were raised in previous PCR petitions and were thus successive.\n   <em>\n    In re Towne\n   </em>\n   , No. 1999-216, slip op. at 1 (Vt. Jan. 6, 2000) (unpub. mem.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. While his fifth PCR petition was pending, petitioner filed a sixth, raising claims not relevant to this appeal. This Court affirmed that PCR court's dismissal.\n   <em>\n    In re Towne\n   </em>\n   , No. 2000-071, slip op. at 2 (Vt. Aug. 3, 2000) (unpub. mem.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. In October 2001, petitioner filed his seventh PCR petition arguing that the judge who presided over his first PCR petition had also participated in his underlying criminal proceeding, which violated 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7131. This Court expressed doubts about petitioner's argument on the merits but noted that, even assuming \u00a7 7131 could be extended to disqualify a PCR judge who only heard pretrial motions in the underlying case, petitioner's claim exceeded the scope of the PCR statute because it would not invalidate the conviction or sentence or otherwise make his criminal judgment vulnerable to collateral attack.\n   <em>\n    Towne v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2004-390,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%206151843\">\n    2005 WL 6151843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (Vt.

In October 2003, petitioner filed his eighth PCR petition alleging grounds not\n   relevant to this appeal. This Court affirmed the dismissal and explained that the petition was successive because essentially this same claim had already been addressed and decided on the merits in a prior PCR proceeding, and \"the ends of justice would [not] be served in reaching the merits\" of this petition.\n   <em>\n    Towne v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2004-521,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%206151845\">\n    2005 WL 6151845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Vt.

In October 2005, petitioner filed a petition that the PCR court construed as his ninth PCR,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenging the 1986 traffic stop that precipitated his arrest for murder and arguing that he had ineffective assistance of counsel during both his trial and direct appeal. That PCR court dismissed the motion as successive, and this Court affirmed, explaining that petitioner's claims \"[did] not clearly differ in substance from those already raised and ruled upon in petitioner's many prior petitions.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Towne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994963\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/614/\">\n    2007 VT 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994963\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/614/\">\n    182 Vt. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994963\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/614/\">\n    938 A.2d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. PCR Petitions on Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. This consolidated opinion addresses petitioner's tenth and eleventh PCR petitions. In April 2012, petitioner, pro se, filed a \"Petition for Appointment of Competent, Conflict-Free Counsel to File a 13 V.S.A. 7131 Petition for Ineffective Assistance of Court Appointed Trial, Appellate, and Post-Conviction Counsel in Light of the Recent U.S. Supreme Court Rulings in\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Petitioner argued that: (1) his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue alibi witnesses and for failing to disqualify himself due to a conflict of interest that arose from counsel's prior representation of a State's witness; (2) one of his lawyers on direct appeal, who had represented petitioner at trial, had a conflict of interest on appeal after petitioner filed his first PCR petition alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (3) Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy was conflicted from sitting on his direct appeal because Chief Justice Amestoy had been Vermont's Attorney General during petitioner's trial; and (4) petitioner's original PCR counsel had been ineffective in arguing his case, failing to appeal, and failing to notify petitioner that his petition had been dismissed so petitioner could appeal himself. Petitioner cited\n   <em>\n    Martinez v. Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/\">\n    566 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), to argue that ineffective assistance of counsel at his original PCR proceeding created cause to bypass the procedural hurdles of successiveness and abuse of the writ. The State filed a motion to dismiss the petition as successive, an abuse of the writ, and \"for failure to state claims cognizable in a PCR petition.\" Petitioner's court-appointed counsel did not respond to the State's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. In March 2013, the PCR court granted the State's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the court concluded on the basis of the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Maples v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446021,12186229\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/266/\">\n    565 U.S. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446021,12186229\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/266/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446021,12186229\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/266/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), that ineffectiveness of petitioner's lawyer in his first PCR proceeding could overcome the procedural bars of successiveness and abuse of the writ to enable the court to consider the merits of petitioner's PCR claims on the basis of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. However, the court concluded that petitioner had failed to establish that the first PCR court had erred in determining that his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim was without merit. In particular, petitioner did not demonstrate that the errors of counsel during his underlying trial actually and substantially prejudiced him because he did not show that the alibi witnesses he contended trial counsel should have contacted would have provided exculpatory testimony. Because petitioner did not demonstrate prejudice from his initial PCR counsel's alleged ineffectiveness with respect to this claim, his claim was \"barred as successive and an abuse of the writ.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. The court noted that petitioner's claim that he had ineffective assistance on direct appeal of his underlying conviction because one of his lawyers on direct appeal had a conflict was likewise successive. The court further explained that even if petitioner could link his failure to raise this claim in his original PCR petition to ineffective assistance of PCR counsel, his claim failed on the merits. The lawyer alleged by petitioner to be ineffective at trial did not represent him on appeal, and petitioner failed to show how the only lawyer who represented him both at trial and on appeal was incompetent in his appellate representation. Because the claim failed on the merits, the alleged ineffectiveness of petitioner's lawyer in his first PCR case in failing to raise the issue caused no prejudice, and the PCR court dismissed this claim as an abuse of the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16. Finally, the court concluded that petitioner's stand-alone claim of ineffective assistance of prior PCR counsel was beyond the scope of the PCR statute-which \"is limited to correcting a defective conviction or sentence resulting from a violation of the law.\" 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7131 ;\n   <em case-ids=\"12446021,12186229\" https:=\"\" index=\"25\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;id\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446021,12186229\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/266/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 7133.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17. In December 2014, petitioner, pro se, filed his eleventh PCR petition (PCR 2015-382).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner elaborated on the circumstances surrounding the in-court disclosure that his trial counsel had previously represented a witness in the case, and explained that he had told his lawyer that he believed this witness had committed the murder. Petitioner argued that the trial court should have advised him of his right to conflict-free representation and the dangers of this particular conflict, giving him the opportunity to decide whether to accept the risks and dangers of the conflict after consultation with independent counsel. He identified examples of failures by his trial counsel that he attributed to the conflict. Petitioner's appointed counsel filed no response to the State's motion to dismiss the petition as successive and an abuse of the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18. In September 2015, the court dismissed the petition on the basis that his claims had either already been raised and addressed on the merits in previous petitions or they could have been raised in previous petitions. Furthermore, the court\n   noted that \"there is nothing to suggest that if trial counsel had done what [petitioner] now thinks he should have done, the result at his trial or sentencing would have been different.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19. Now on consolidated appeal in PCR 2013-191 and PCR 2015-382, petitioner appears to argue that: (1) the PCR court \"jumped the gun\" in dismissing PCR 2013-191 because his petition merely sought appointment of counsel and did not yet raise the merits of that petition; (2) the PCR court improperly failed to inform him that the State had filed a motion to dismiss in PCR 2013-191, preventing him from protecting his rights; (3) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue alibi witnesses who would have provided exculpatory evidence; (4) he was ineffectively represented on direct appeal because he had filed an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim against his appellate lawyer; (5) the court's decision in his first PCR proceeding was compromised because the judge in that matter had participated in pretrial rulings in the underlying prosecution; and (6) requiring him to represent himself in this appeal deprives him of meaningful access to the courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III. Successive Petitions and Abuse of the Writ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20. Vermont's PCR statute, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7131, provides \"prisoners with an opportunity to challenge the legality of their confinement, and thus to guard against illegal restraints on liberty.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Laws\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994284\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/66/\">\n    2007 VT 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994284\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/66/\">\n    182 Vt. 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994284\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/66/\">\n    928 A.2d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).

We accordingly decline to decide at this juncture which standard governs our review of the trial court's dismissal of claims raised in a second or subsequent PCR petition on account of abuse of the writ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   IV.

The Court did not purport to require states to adopt\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , or a\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   -like rule, for examining the implications of ineffective assistance of original PCR counsel on state procedural limits such as successiveness and abuse of the writ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 33. To show cause under\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner must demonstrate that the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim has merit and that the initial PCR counsel was ineffective in arguing, or declining to argue, this claim. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Horn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124930\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/113/#p119\">\n    757 F.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119 (3d Cir. 2014) (explaining that under\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , petitioner must show that \"default was caused by ineffective assistance of [PCR] counsel\" and that \"the underlying claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness is substantial, meaning the claim has some merit\" (quotation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 34. Petitioner urges us to adopt\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , or some similar rule, as an exception to the principles set forth above concerning successive petitions and abuse of the writ. As we understand his argument, he would have us conclude under our state law that where counsel in the initial PCR proceeding has been ineffective in raising or advocating a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel (and perhaps other claims that could only be raised for the first time on initial collateral review) that ineffectiveness would satisfy the \"cause\" prong of the \"cause and prejudice\" test that applies to the abuse-of-the-writ analysis of claims raised for the first time in a second or subsequent petition. He apparently also urges us to hold that ineffective assistance of counsel in the initial PCR proceeding constitutes grounds to relitigate subsequent petitions raising claims previously resolved on the merits, although it is less clear how this exception would fit into either of the alternate frameworks for evaluating successive petitions described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   V. Application to Petitioner's Claims on Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 35. We need not decide whether to accept petitioner's invitation to import the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   into our state law governing successive PCR petitions and abuse of the writ because we conclude that, even if we did so, petitioner's claims in this case would fail. In particular, we conclude that (1) he has failed to show prejudice from the claimed ineffectiveness of trial counsel with respect to identifying alibi witnesses and securing their testimony; and (2) he has failed to show prejudice in connection with his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal of his conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A. Trial Counsel's Failure to Secure Testimony of Alibi Witnesses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 36. Even if we adopted some version of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   in our state law, petitioner's attempt to circumvent the successive-petition limitation due to the alleged ineffectiveness of his initial PCR counsel in advocating the ineffectiveness-of-trial-counsel claim would fail. First, the claim is clearly successive, having been previously resolved on the merits-twice. Second, to avoid the successive-petition limitation even by his own argument, petitioner would have to show that he has been prejudiced by trial counsel's alleged ineffectiveness. Finally, he has not demonstrated any such prejudice, relying only on speculation and hypothetical possibilities to support his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 37. Petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel due to counsel's failure to pursue alibi witnesses was addressed on the merits on two previous occasions-by the PCR court in his original PCR petition and by this Court in his third petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Towne\n   </em>\n   , No. 94-105, slip op. at 1. This claim is successive. Even if this Court revived our prior test to allow for consideration of the interests of justice in considering whether to review a successive petition, petitioner has not established any basis for departing from our general reluctance to allow relitigation of a claim raised and decided on the merits in a prior PCR proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 38. Moreover, even if we adopted some version of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and applied it to successive petitions as well as abuse-of-the-writ claims, petitioner would have to show prejudice. The need to demonstrate prejudice arises at two junctures in the analysis. First, we have adopted the\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel under the Vermont Constitution. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    In re Sharrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20VT%2069\">\n    2017 VT 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9, --- Vt. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491671\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/1236/\">\n    175 A.3d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner must show\n   (1) \"that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness informed by prevailing professional norms,\" and (2) that there is a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    In re LaBounty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605851\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/177/635/\">\n    2005 VT 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605851\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/177/635/\">\n    177 Vt. 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605851\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/177/635/\">\n    869 A.2d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.)

In other words, under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , to establish that initial PCR counsel was ineffective for failing to effectively advocate the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, failing to appeal the PCR court's dismissal of the ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim, and failing to notify petitioner of the dismissal so he could appeal himself, petitioner must demonstrate that it would have made a difference if counsel had advocated more effectively, appealed the dismissal, or notified petitioner of the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 39. Second, as noted above, to avoid the limitation on successive petitions under\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , petitioner \"must also demonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say that [he] must demonstrate that the claim has some merit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/\">\n    566 U.S. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether cast as a component of the threshold \"ineffective assistance\" determination, or as a necessary element of the analysis under\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , petitioner's burden of persuasion in seeking to circumvent the limitations on successive petitions requires that he make some showing to support his claim that if trial counsel had properly investigated alibi witnesses and secured their testimony, it would have helped petitioner's defense. See\n   <em>\n    Laws\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994284\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/66/\">\n    2007 VT 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994284\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/66/\">\n    182 Vt. 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994284\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/66/\">\n    928 A.2d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that once State establishes basis for abuse-of-writ claim, burden shifts to petitioner to show cause for prior failure to raise claim in question);\n   <em>\n    In re Dunbar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848719\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/209/#p211\">\n    162 Vt. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211-12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848719\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/209/#p211\">\n    647 A.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 319 (1994) (explaining that petitioner alleging ineffective assistance of counsel bears burden of proving that counsel's performance fell below professional standard and \"that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced the defense\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 40. As the PCR courts in both proceedings below noted, there is no evidence to suggest that if trial counsel had done what petitioner contends he should have done, the result of his trial and sentencing would have been any different. Petitioner speculates that the one identified witness and the ten unidentified witnesses would have confirmed his alibi. He does not offer any affidavits, deposition testimony, or other basis other than his own conjecture to support his belief on this point. Petitioner's speculation on this point is insufficient to establish the requisite prejudice at either step of the analysis noted above. Accordingly, whether we review the trial courts' determinations with or without deference, we conclude that there is no basis for entertaining successive petitions on the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on counsel's failure to secure the testimony of additional alibi witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   B. Counsel's Alleged Conflict of Interest on Direct Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 41. For similar reasons, even if we incorporated into Vermont law the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   approach to reviewing claims for post-conviction relief raised in the second or subsequent PCR petitions, we would\n   reject petitioner's argument because his claim that his appellate counsel was ineffective due to a conflict does not have substantial merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner argues that his appellate counsel was ineffective because petitioner was represented on appeal by his trial counsel, Attorney Stetler, and during the course of his direct appeal, petitioner filed his first PCR petition claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, thereby creating a conflict of interest for his appellate counsel. In contrast to his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective due to his failure to muster alibi witnesses, it does not appear that any court has previously resolved this claim on the merits. Petitioner apparently raised the claim for the first time in his ninth PCR petition, which was dismissed as successive. For the reasons set forth above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b636-39, petitioner can only avoid dismissal on the basis of abuse of the writ if he can establish cause for failing to raise the claim in the earliest possible petition, and prejudice as a result of the claimed conflict. In other words, even if petitioner could show cause for failing to raise this claim in the earliest possible petition, he would also have to show that if his initial PCR counsel had raised the issue it would have made a difference to his conviction or sentence-that is, that the claim has merit. We conclude that he has not made such a showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 42. Court records reflect that Attorneys E.M. Allen and William A. Nelson entered appearances for petitioner in his direct appeal. Attorney Allen was Vermont's Defender General during the course of much of petitioner's direct appeal, but there is no evidence that he played a direct role in the appeal. Attorney Nelson-who did not represent petitioner during his trial-authored the appellate brief and presented the oral argument. The evidence supports the PCR 2013-191 court's finding that Attorney Stetler was not counsel of record in the direct appeal. The fact that Attorney Stetler was apparently pictured in a newspaper article sitting at counsel table during the oral argument on appeal does not undermine this conclusion. Petitioner has not demonstrated how the alleged conflict arising from his ineffective-assistance claims regarding Attorney Stetler undermined his representation by Attorney Allen or Attorney Nelson-the lead counsel on the appeal-during his preparation and presentation of the appeal. Regardless of whether we review the trial courts' decisions with or without deference, because petitioner's claims fall short on the merits, he cannot avoid the impact of the abuse-of-the-writ limitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    This Court dismissed petitioner's direct appeal of the trial court's decision as untimely.

Even assuming \u00a7 7131 can be extended to disqualify a PCR judge who only heard pretrial motions in the underlying case, petitioner's claim exceeds the scope of the PCR statute because it would not invalidate the conviction or sentence or otherwise make his criminal judgment vulnerable to collateral attack.\n    <em>\n     Towne\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%206151843\">\n     2005 WL 6151843\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1-2.
