We agree with the state that the Appellate Court properly considered the evidence presented at trial and, accordingly, affirm its judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Appellate Court set forth the following facts. \"On May 24, 2010, Brian Donnelly, a patrol officer with the Yale Police Department, heard a police broadcast regarding a domestic dispute involving the defendant. Donnelly responded by proceeding to Winchester Avenue [in New Haven], where he spotted a vehicle matching the broadcast description of the defendant's vehicle. Donnelly followed the vehicle, which in fact belonged to the defendant. After Officer Lester Blazejowski arrived in support, Donnelly stopped in front of the defendant's vehicle at the intersection of Ashmun and Grove Streets. Donnelly and Blazejowski exited their cruisers, approached the defendant's vehicle, and ordered the defendant to put his vehicle in park and to show his hands. The defendant refused to comply and, instead, reached toward the passenger side of the vehicle and then inside his pants. Donnelly thought the defendant was attempting to retrieve a weapon. He ordered the defendant to show his hands, but, instead, the defendant again reached over to the passenger side of the vehicle and then inside his pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Blazejowski opened the driver's side door and attempted to remove the defendant from his vehicle, but he resisted. Donnelly also tried to remove the defendant from his vehicle, but the defendant resisted and continued to reach for the waistband of his pants and elsewhere in the vehicle. Donnelly finally was able to remove the defendant from the vehicle. While the officers\n   were trying to handcuff the defendant, the defendant tried to kick Donnelly and attempted to stab him with a screwdriver. A struggle ensued during which the officers attempted to handcuff the defendant, who swung his hands, kicked his feet, and fought 'wildly.' Donnelly incurred scrapes and cuts that resulted in pain and 'swelling.' At some point during the struggle, the defendant removed a bag of marijuana from his pants and put it in his mouth. After having been subdued with pepper spray, the defendant spit out the marijuana. Eventually, the defendant was handcuffed and formally arrested.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486180\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/1216/#p283\">\n    167 Conn.

Thus, both parties offer precedent in a manner that appears to be in conflict, and the state goes so far as to suggest that we should overrule\n   <em>\n    Goldson\n   </em>\n   in light of\n   <em>\n    Schovanec\n   </em>\n   if necessary.

The majority of these cases do not reach the issue of whether the offenses stem from the same act or transaction-generally because the issue was not in dispute or because this court chose to dispose of the case at step two.

See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177649\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/161/\">\n    id., at 168-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177649\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/161/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (resolving double jeopardy claim without addressing question of whether evidence may be reviewed when determining if offenses stem from same act or transaction). Second, the issue in\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Unlike Brown, the defendant in the present case was not charged with multiple offenses for the same conduct under a theory of temporal severability. Indeed, in the present case, the state alleged \"that the two crimes occurred at the same time and place ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486180\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/1216/#p283\">\n    167 Conn.

Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 169,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177649\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/161/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the state did not suggest that the offenses are separate because they occurred on different days but, rather, because each resulted from different conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177649\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/161/\">\n    Id., at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486180\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/1216/#p283\">\n    142 A.3d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We also disagree with the defendant's argument that allowing a review of the evidence at step one contravenes constitutional principles of notice and unduly complicates his legal defense. The state contends that this argument is unpreserved and subject to\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review, which it would fail because the defendant cannot establish the existence of a constitutional violation. Even if we assume for the sake of argument that the defendant's claim would survive\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review, it fails for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the defendant conceded at oral argument before this court that his claim of lack of notice was predicated on the ramifications of overruling\n   <em>\n    Goldson\n   </em>\n   , which we have not done.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the information afforded notice because it separately charged the defendant with assault of public safety personnel and interfering with an officer. To the extent this notice claim is\n   premised on the defendant's uncertainty as to what conduct corresponded to each charge, the confusion could have been remedied by filing a motion for a bill of particulars or raising the issue in the trial court. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schovanec\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489954\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/581/\">\n    326 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   328 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489954\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/581/\">\n    163 A.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We note that the defendant ... did not request a bill of particulars regarding count four, which contained the charge of larceny in the sixth degree.... Furthermore ... [b]y failing to raise the claim of double jeopardy before the trial court, the defendant contributed to the ambiguity that is now present in the record.\"). Indeed, the defendant conceded that he chose not to request a bill of particulars \"because it would likely have made interfering not [a lesser included offense] of the assault, but a separate offense, and thereby increased the defendant's exposure to an additional year of incarceration.\" This concession undermines the defendant's argument that he lacked notice and suggests, rather, that the defendant was aware that the charges stemmed from distinct conduct and that he chose not to clarify for strategic reasons.\n   Finally, we address the defendant's argument that the two step process should parallel the test for determining whether a lesser included offense instruction should be given because that test prohibits a review of the evidence. We reject this argument. The defendant asserts, citing to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tomlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2636241\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/266/608/\">\n    266 Conn. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20A.2d%2012\">\n    835 A.2d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), that Connecticut uses the cognate pleadings approach to determine whether one crime is a lesser included of another, a test he claims relies on the pleadings rather than the evidence presented at trial. This argument is incorrect because the cognate pleadings standard is one prong of a larger four-pronged test that does rely on evidence to determine whether a lesser included offense instruction is warranted. See id., at 617-18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20A.2d%2012\">\n    835 A.2d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that cognate pleadings approach is second prong of four-pronged test to determine if defendant is entitled to lesser included offense instruction). Indeed, two prongs of that four-pronged test envision review of the evidence. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3964282\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/742/#p764\">\n    289 Conn. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 764,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=961%20A.2d%20322\">\n    961 A.2d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (\"With respect to the third prong, we must examine whether there is any possibility that the evidence introduced at trial would justify a conviction of the lesser included offense.... With respect to the fourth prong, we must determine whether the evidence that would have supported a conviction on the lesser included offense was disputed by the parties.\"). Even if it did not involve evidentiary review, the cognate pleadings test applies to a different context than that of the present case.

Rather, as we have already explained, the attempt to swallow the marijuana and the assault of public safety personnel were separate acts warranting separate charges. Although we recognize that, on some level, the offenses appear closely related, that alone is not a determinative consideration. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Schovanec\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489954\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/581/\">\n     326 Conn. at 329\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489954\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/581/\">\n     163 A.3d 581\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (upholding conviction of separate offenses resulting from theft of wallet and use of credit card that had been in wallet). We are also not persuaded by the defendant's related argument that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the offenses were premised on different conduct because the state did not prove when Donnelly's injury occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Therefore, we also reject the defendant's argument that, \"[b]ecause the information alleged that both offenses were committed at the same time and place, the defendant met his burden of showing the charges arose out of the same act or transaction.\" This statement cannot be correct, as it would mean step one must be decided entirely in terms of temporal proximity. If true, two completely distinct crimes committed by the same individual at the same location and time would trigger double jeopardy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The defendant tries to qualify this sweeping assertion by arguing that, \"as a corollary of this rule, if the charging documents are ambiguous, the court must construe them in the defendant's favor.\" The only controlling precedent the defendant offers in support of this argument is\n    <em>\n     Goldson\n    </em>\n    , which the defendant misreads. Admittedly, this court stated in\n    <em>\n     Goldson\n    </em>\n    that, \"[i]f separate charges explicitly addressing different temporal aspects of the same conduct do not avoid the double jeopardy clause, surely an information and bill of particulars stipulating a single date and time cannot do so.\"\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Goldson\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706559\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/178/422/\">\n     178 Conn. at 425\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=423%20A.2d%20114\">\n     423 A.2d 114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
