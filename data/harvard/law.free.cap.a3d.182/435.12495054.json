Is this decision in conflict with 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 110, the 2002 amendment thereto removing jurisdiction as an element of the offense, its constitutional underpinnings, and decisions of this Court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   (2) Where the lower [c]ourt dismissed the prosecution under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 110 because all the prongs of the test for dismissal under that statute were met, did the trial [c]ourt properly dismiss the charges?\n  </blockquote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
