Olesen, Assigned Public Defender (Wyatt Feeler, Assigned Public Defender, George Washington University Community Legal Clinics of Washington, DC) on brief, for Petitioner.\n </attorneys>\n <attorneys id=\"p-6\">\n  Argued by Ryan R.

In certain limited circumstances, one such\n   adverse inference may be that the defendant's failure to call a witness peculiarly in the control of the defendant indicates that the witness would have testified unfavorably to the defendant. This is sometimes called the \"missing witness rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   There is a related pattern jury instruction sometimes used by trial courts in Maryland known as the missing witness instruction. In that instruction, the trial court instructs the jury that, if a witness likely could have given important evidence in the case and it was peculiarly within the power of one party to produce that witness but the witness was not called and the individual's absence was not adequately explained, the jury may infer that the witness would have testified unfavorably to that party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a criminal prosecution, the State bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements of the crimes charged and a defendant has no obligation to testify, to call witnesses, or to produce evidence. When a trial court gives a missing witness instruction at the behest of the prosecution against the defendant, the court essentially endorses the particular inference that the prosecutor asks the jury to draw against the defendant. In our system of justice, this should rarely-if ever-be done, as it may be at odds with the constitutional principles that govern a criminal case. Even in the limited circumstances in which a prosecutor may legitimately urge the jury to draw an inference adverse to the defendant under the missing witness rule, there is no need for the court to endorse that element of the prosecutor's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this case, Petitioner Jerry Harris was charged with various offenses arising out a home invasion and robbery at an apartment in Baltimore City. None of the victims of the crime identified Mr. Harris as a participant in the robbery; the only evidence linking him to the crime was a latent fingerprint examination that matched prints found on pill bottles at the apartment to prints on file for his left hand, which had previously been disabled in an\n   industrial accident. Mr. Harris testified that he had been at his mother's home on the night of\n   the robbery, but his mother did not testify. At the suggestion of the trial court, the prosecutor requested a missing witness instruction that advised the jury that it could infer from the mother's absence that she would have testified unfavorably to Mr. Harris. The trial court gave that instruction and, after a lengthy deliberation, the jury convicted Mr. Harris of some of the charges related to the robbery and acquitted him of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We hold that it was error to give the missing witness instruction in this case and, for that reason, reverse Mr. Harris' convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The Home Invasion and Robbery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the evening of January 16, 2014, Gale Binko and Alease Holmes were playing cards at the kitchen table in Ms. Binko's Baltimore City apartment. Lester Allen, who also lived in the apartment, and a woman known only as \"Reds\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   were also present. Several pill bottles for Ms. Binko's prescriptions\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and some cash lay on the table.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Around 9:00 p.m., Reds decided to leave the apartment. At Ms. Binko's request, Mr. Allen accompanied Reds to the door. When they opened the front door, they were confronted by two masked men, one of whom had a gun. Back in the kitchen, Ms. Binko heard some unfamiliar voices interspersed with Mr. Allen's voice. She heard Reds say \"[T]hey got a gun.\" Reds and Mr. Allen then returned to the kitchen accompanied by the two masked men. The man with the gun was holding it to Mr. Allen's head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The second masked man, who was called \"Black\" by the masked man with the gun, grabbed approximately $350 from\n   the kitchen table in front of Ms. Binko. Black then opened Ms. Binko's blouse, groped her, and pulled out a bottle of Oxycodone pills that was concealed in her blouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The masked man holding the gun to Mr. Allen's head then directed Black to check Ms. Binko's socks. Black removed Ms. Binko's shoes, but Ms. Binko began to fight back. At one point during the struggle, Black's mask came off, giving Ms. Binko a glimpse of his face. She described him as a tall, stout, black man with a dark complexion and a mustache. She was not sure whether he had a beard. Ms. Binko testified that Black used both of his hands when he searched her blouse, pulled off her shoes, and struggled with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While Ms. Binko was engaged with the two intruders, Ms. Holmes and Reds fled through a back door. After subduing Ms. Binko, Black picked up and examined each of the three pill bottles on the kitchen table. Then he and the man with the gun left the apartment through the back door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    The Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the robbers left, Ms. Binko called 9-1-1. The police responded to the apartment within five minutes. Ms. Holmes returned to the apartment shortly thereafter, although Reds did not. Detective Franklin Gaskins interviewed Ms. Binko, Ms. Holmes, and Mr. Allen. The police were never able to locate or identify Reds. Ms. Binko was unable to make an identification of the robbers because, she later testified, she was \"upset and afraid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Detective Gaskins summoned the crime lab to the apartment. A crime lab technician lifted two prints from a large prescription bottle and one from a small prescription bottle on the kitchen table. A latent print examiner at the Police Department lab later analyzed the lifted prints. The examiner determined that the three prints matched impressions on file of Mr. Harris' left thumb, index finger, and middle finger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Detective Gaskins then took a photograph of Mr. Harris to Ms. Binko's home to display to Ms. Binko. She told the detective that she did not know Mr. Harris, that he had not been to her home, and that there was no reason for him to have handled her pill bottles. Neither Ms. Holmes nor Mr. Allen, who also testified at trial, identified Mr. Harris as one of the robbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on the fingerprint identification, Detective Gaskins obtained an arrest warrant for Mr. Harris. Following Mr. Harris' arrest in February 2014, Detective Gaskins attempted to interview him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Police Interview of Mr. Harris\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At trial, the prosecutor asked Detective Gaskins about his attempt to interview Mr. Harris following his arrest. The prosecutor asked the detective what occurred during that interview, defense counsel objected, and the following bench conference ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Court: There's nothing wrong with the question. I don't know what the answer is going to be. Meaning, if his answer is, he said, then we could get into this. It could be, I observed him crying. And then that's fine. Do you know what I mean? So I don't know where this is going.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Defense Counsel: Well, what actually occurred was that he started to sign a waiver of rights form, and then asked them if he was being charged with armed robbery. And they said yes. And he says, well, I'm not talking, you know, I want to talk to my lawyer. And he refused to sign the rest of the statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   So I think that he has a fifth amendment privilege not to incriminate himself and that, you know, his refusal to talk to police shouldn't be admissible as proof of guilt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Court: I don't know if the problem is his refusal to talk to police. I think the problem for him more is the fact that he knew what he was being charged with before they charged him. I mean, if you're an innocent man and you're brought in, how would you have said, are you\n   charging me with armed robbery? I mean, how would you pick that out of the air?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Defense Counsel: I don't know. Maybe they told him or something. Maybe that's what he heard, because they had already executed a search warrant at his estranged wife's house, and they had already executed a search warrant at his mother's house where he lived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Court: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Defense Counsel: So obviously they had to leave copies of both search warrants there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Court: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And why do you think that his refusal to speak to the police is indication of his guilt? Why do you think they would take it that way?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Defense Counsel: Because it's been my experience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Court: That?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Defense Counsel: That juries don't like when people refuse to talk to the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Court: [Prosecutor]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Prosecutor: Innocent people refuse to talk to the police too. The jury has already been given the instruction as far as, you know, (inaudible).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Court: I think it's factual. He didn't want to talk. It's not hearsay. I don't think it's highly prejudicial. And I think that you could definitely rehabilitate it, you know, into any level of prejudice that you think it might cause. The objection's overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After counsel returned to the trial tables, the court advised the detective that he could answer the question and the detective provided the following response:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Detective Gaskins: Mr. Harris provided us with a false address, denied any involvement with the robbery, and then I believe he requested an attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The prosecutor then moved on to another topic. Defense counsel did not cross-examine the detective concerning the interview. Mr. Harris' invocation of his right to counsel during the police interview was not mentioned in either testimony or argument during the remainder of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Searches of the Homes of Mr. Harris' Wife and of his Mother\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Detective Gaskins obtained a search warrant for the address that Mr. Harris provided during his police interview. The address turned out to be not a false address, but rather a former address. The woman who lived there-and whom Mr. Harris later identified as his wife\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -told the police that Mr. Harris had not stayed there for some time and gave them the address of Mr. Harris' mother, Barbara Fallin, where she believed that Mr. Harris had been staying. When the police went to Ms. Fallin's address, Ms. Fallin consented to a search of the portion of the house where Mr. Harris kept belongings, but said that she had not seen him for a couple weeks, as she had asked him to leave the house. According to Detective Gaskins, no evidence was recovered in the search of either location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    The Defense Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In his opening statement, defense counsel indicated that he was planning to call Ms. Fallin as an alibi witness on Mr. Harris' behalf. Defense counsel told the jury that Ms. Fallin would testify that Mr. Harris was at her house the entire night on the date of the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After the State rested its case, Mr. Harris, rather than Ms. Fallin, testified in his defense. Mr. Harris testified that his left arm had been amputated \"mid-arm\" as a result of a work accident in 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doctors were able to re-attach the arm, and\n   he underwent multiple surgeries and physical\n   therapy. Mr. Harris explained that he had regained feeling in his hand, but he was not able to grasp items or use his hand in the same manner as before the accident. Mr. Harris testified that he was right-handed, and that he had adapted to performing daily activities with one hand. He said that he had to use his right hand to put items in his left hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Harris testified that in late 2013 he had separated from his wife and moved in with his mother, where he was still living on January 16, 2014-the day of the robbery at Ms. Binko's apartment. Mr. Harris said that he did not know Ms. Binko, Ms. Holmes, Mr. Allen, or Reds. He denied robbing Ms. Binko or participating in a home invasion of her apartment. Mr. Harris said that he spent that day at his mother's house, that she was home with him the whole day, and that no one else was with them at the time of the robbery. Mr. Harris denied that he had given Detective Gaskins a false address when he told him the address where he had lived with his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Harris did not call Ms. Fallin to testify at the trial; nor did the State call her as a rebuttal witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Jury Instruction Conference\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After the defense rested, the Circuit Court met with counsel to discuss the jury instructions. As had been earlier suggested by the Circuit Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   defense counsel had requested a missing\n   witness instruction related to the State's failure to call Reds as a witness. The Circuit Court then suggested that the State would also seek its own missing witness instruction with respect to the failure of the defendant to call Ms. Fallin as a witness. The State opposed a missing witness instruction as to Reds, arguing that nobody had been able to locate or identify her and thus she was equally unavailable to both parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel ultimately withdrew his request for that instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The State then adopted the Circuit Court's suggestion and requested a missing witness instruction relating to the absence of Ms. Fallin. Defense counsel objected, arguing that the State had never requested a subpoena for Ms. Fallin and that there were reasons for her absence that were not relevant to the trial. The following colloquy took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Court: Okay. Okay. If a witness could have given important testimony in issue with this case-and I imagine an alibi would be considered important testimony-and if the witness was peculiarly in the power of the defendant to produce-which she was, it's his mother-but was not called as a witness by the defendant, and the absence of that witness was not sufficiently accounted for or explained-which it was not-then you may decide that-I mean, how is this not applicable?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Defense Counsel: Because it's not peculiarly within his power. He's in jail. He doesn't have the power to do anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Court: Right. You are acting as his agent, [defense counsel].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Defense Counsel: True.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Court: Okay. So you had the ability to either bring her here or subpoena her here as an alibi witness. The objection is overruled. [Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction] 3.29 missing witness instruction is being read.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defense counsel then argued that the instruction improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant to produce evidence. The Circuit Court agreed that the instruction would be improper if Mr. Harris had chosen not to testify himself, but reasoned that, because he had testified, the jury could consider his failure to call Ms. Fallin as a witness in assessing the credibility of his own testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Jury Instructions and Closing Argument\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Consistent with its ruling during the jury instruction conference, when the Circuit Court instructed the jury on the law, it included the following missing witness instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   You have heard testimony about Barbara Fallin, who was not called as a witness in this case. If a witness could have given important testimony on an issue in this case, and the witness was peculiarly within the power of the defendant to produce but was not called as a witness by the defendant, and the action\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   of that witness was not sufficiently accounted for or explained, then you may decide that the testimony of that witness would have been unfavorable to the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   During the State's closing argument, the prosecutor referred to Ms. Fallin's absence and urged the jury to draw an inference adverse to Mr. Harris. The prosecutor reminded the\n   jury that defense counsel had identified her as an alibi witness in opening statement, but had not called her during the defense case and asked rhetorically \"Where is his mother?\" The prosecutor returned to that theme later in his argument, asking: \"Who can attest to the defendant's whereabouts, other than the defendant?\" In response, defense counsel acknowledged Ms. Fallin's absence, but contended that the jury should not draw an adverse inference against Mr. Harris because a \"person not testifying is non-evidence.\" In the State's rebuttal argument, the prosecutor twice returned to the absence of Ms. Fallin. He reiterated his question \"Where is his mother?\" and also reminded the jurors that \"[t]he judge has instructed you ... that ... you can draw a reasonable inference to the fact that her testimony would have possibly been unfavorable to this defendant.\"\n   Neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel referred in their arguments to Detective Gaskins' testimony that Mr. Harris had invoked his right to an attorney during his police interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Verdict and Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The jury found Mr. Harris guilty of second degree assault against Mr. Allen; and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to commit first-degree assault, second-degree assault, conspiracy to commit second-degree assault, theft less than $1,000, and conspiracy to commit theft less than $1,000, all against Ms. Binko. The jury acquitted him of six assault charges, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony or crime of violence. The Circuit Court later sentenced Mr. Harris to an aggregate 10-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Mr. Harris appealed. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Harris v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 484,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20168446\">\n    2017 WL 168446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Md. Ct. Spec. App. Jan. 17, 2017) (unreported). The intermediate appellate court held that the Circuit Court erred when it permitted Detective Gaskins to testify that Mr. Harris had requested an attorney. But the court concluded that, in light of the fingerprint evidence linking Mr. Harris to the crime, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable because it was a \"brief remark,\" and there had been no further reference to it in testimony or argument during the remainder of the trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it gave the missing witness instruction. It reasoned that there was a sufficient factual basis to support the conclusion that Ms. Fallin's relationship with Mr. Harris rendered her testimony unavailable to the State as a practical matter and peculiarly within Mr. Harris' control. Thus, his failure to call her as a witness would support an inference that her testimony would be unfavorable to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11-12. Judge Nazarian dissented from that holding. He would have held that the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it gave the missing witness instruction and that, together with the erroneous admission of testimony concerning Mr. Harris' invocation of his right to counsel, that error required reversal of the conviction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to consider the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (1) Whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it gave a missing witness instruction advising the jury that it could draw an inference adverse to Mr. Harris based on his failure to call his mother as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (2) Whether it was a harmless error when the Circuit Court permitted Detective Gaskins to testify that Mr. Harris had invoked his right to counsel during a custodial interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the Circuit Court should not have given the missing witness instruction under the circumstances of this case. Because we reverse Mr.\n   Harris' convictions for that reason, and remand the case for a new trial, we need not address whether the erroneous reference to his invocation of his right to counsel was harmless.\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    The Missing Witness Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Genesis of the Missing Witness Rule\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Although technically not a rule, the concept known as the \"missing witness rule\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   refers to the permissible inference that a factfinder may draw from the absence of a potential witness who might have knowledge of facts at issue in the case. If the factfinder determines that the witness is \"peculiarly available\" to one party, the absence of the witness is ascribed to that party. The factfinder is then permitted to infer that the party did not call the witness because whatever testimony that individual would have given would be unfavorable to that party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Although there are common law antecedents for the doctrine, the current understanding of the missing witness rule is often traced to a Supreme Court case from the late nineteenth century.\n   <em>\n    Graves v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3571882\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/150/118/\">\n    150 U.S. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3571882\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/150/118/\">\n    14 S.Ct. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3571882\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/150/118/\">\n    37 L.Ed. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1893).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   That case concerned the propriety of a prosecutor's closing argument to the jury in a criminal case. In that argument, the prosecutor suggested that the absence of the defendant's wife from the trial undermined his alibi defense to a murder charge, although other witnesses had testified in support of the alibi. The Court summarized succinctly the missing witness rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The rule, even in criminal cases, is that, if a party has it peculiarly within his power to produce witnesses whose testimony would elucidate the transaction, the fact that he does not do it creates the presumption that the testimony, if produced, would be unfavorable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3571882\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/150/118/\">\n    150 U.S. at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3571882\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/150/118/\">\n    14 S.Ct. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Supreme Court referred to the missing witness rule as a \"presumption\" in\n   <em>\n    Graves\n   </em>\n   , most courts have treated it as a permissible inference rather than a presumption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In the years since the\n   <em>\n    Graves\n   </em>\n   decision, developments in constitutional law, changes in the rules of evidence and discovery, and questions concerning the accuracy of the adverse inference promoted by the missing witness rule have seriously weakened its viability-at least in the context of criminal case in which the inference is to be taken against the defendant. In addition, courts have expressed concerns when the missing witness rule appears not only in a party's argument, but is also endorsed in a court's jury instruction. In\n   this case we are primarily concerned with the missing witness rule as it appears in a jury instruction given by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Missing Witness Instruction in a Criminal Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   A trial court's jury instructions in a criminal case serve a number of purposes. They provide the jury with general guidelines on how to carry out its duties as factfinder (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   burden of proof, presumption of innocence, what is and is not evidence). They outline the law concerning the particular charges in the case and what elements must be proven for the jury to reach a guilty verdict. They may, as appropriate, provide guidance to the jury on how to evaluate particular types of evidence or testimony (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , expert testimony, impeachment evidence, other crimes evidence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A missing witness instruction calls the jury's attention to the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of evidence (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the imagined testimony of the missing witness), allows the jury to attribute that absence to one of the parties, and permits the jury to draw a negative inference against that party for failing to produce that evidence. A missing witness instruction adverse to a defendant is a rare instance where the trial court endorses an evidentiary inference promoted by the prosecution-an inference based not on evidence or the conduct of the defendant, but on the failure of the defendant to produce evidence. Of course, the jury has little or no basis for assessing the credibility of the imagined testimony of the absent witness. In that the instruction concerns the weight to be given to potential evidence that the jury did not hear, it is a cousin of the disfavored \"anti-CSI effect\" instruction, which also concerns evidence that theoretically might have been presented to the jury but was not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   1.

Changes in Evidentiary and Discovery Rules\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Various common law doctrines have been associated with the reasoning underlying the missing witness rule. However, changes in evidentiary and discovery rules have rendered those rationales less compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The missing witness rule was once linked to the common law \"voucher rule.\" That was the concept that a party \"vouched\" for the credibility and veracity of the witnesses that the party called to the stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739053\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/373/360/#p383\">\n    373 Md. 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383-84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739053,739031\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/818/1078/\">\n    818 A.2d 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). Under the voucher rule, one might assume that the witnesses called by a party would be favorable to that party's position and that potential witnesses that the party does not call would be unfavorable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Tahair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942896\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/101/\">\n    172 Vt. 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942896\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/101/\">\n    772 A.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1084 (2001) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, modern rules of evidence, such as Maryland Rule 5-607,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   make clear that a party no longer vouches for a witness by calling that individual to the stand. Indeed, under Rule 5-607, a party may attack the credibility of a witness that the party calls to the\n   stand. There is thus no presumption that the witnesses that a party calls will be favorable to it or, conversely, that those the party does not call will be unfavorable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Similarly, as the Supreme Court opinion in\n   <em>\n    Graves\n   </em>\n   indicated, the missing witness rule was viewed as an incentive for parties to produce as witnesses those individuals\n   who had knowledge of the facts of a case. However, modern criminal discovery rules provide for greater exchange of information by parties, such that each party has more information in advance of trial as to the universe of potential witnesses and their likely testimony.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tahair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942896\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/101/\">\n    772 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1084 ;\n   <em>\n    Malave\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20A.2d%20442\">\n    737 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   447 ;\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7912818\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/505/774/#p776\">\n    505 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   777 n.2 (Me. 1985) ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGlone v.

Most experienced litigators prefer to try a \"lean\" case-or come to regret it if they do not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel seldom call every witness who may have favorable testimony. There may be many reasons why a potential witness does not make the cut, few of which have anything to do with whether what the witness would say would be favorable to the party. As one court has noted, \"the decision to call a witness often turns on factors which have little to do with the actual content of the [witness'] testimony. Considerations of cumulation and jury fatigue may preclude calling a witness who is entirely helpful; calculations that a witness may help a lot but hurt a little may compel restraint when counsel believes that [a] burden is already met....

For example, the missing witness instruction in the First Circuit refers only to a missing government witness. Although the commentary allows for the possibility it could be revised to apply a potential defense witness, it states that a trial court should \"exercise extreme caution\" in doing so and should reiterate, as part of any such instruction, the principle that there is no obligation on the defendant to call any witnesses or produce any evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7876817\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/524/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the Seventh Circuit, \"[i]t is the view of the Committee that a missing witness instruction should not be given.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7876817\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/524/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (adding that any such instruction should reiterate the principle that a defendant has no duty to call witnesses or produce evidence).

As indicated in\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   and emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Bereano\n   </em>\n   , that procedure provides a party with notice of a trial court's intention to give the proposed instruction and an opportunity for the party either to call the witness or to persuade the court that the prerequisites of missing witness rule are not established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In this case that procedure was essentially followed in the Circuit Court's consideration of a potential missing witness instruction adverse to the State. The possibility that the court would give a missing witness instruction concerning Reds and the then-missing Mr. Allen was first broached in a pretrial conference. The prosecution later located and called Mr. Allen as a witness. In opposing such an instruction as to the still-missing\n   Reds, the prosecutor was able to refer to the commentary that accompanies the pattern missing witness jury instruction and successfully argue to the Circuit Court that the criteria for giving the instruction were not met as to Reds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   By contrast, the prosecution provided no notice of an intention to ask for a missing witness instruction as to Ms. Fallin. Indeed, the prosecutor only made the request after the Circuit Court initiated the idea during the jury instruction conference after both parties had rested. The only rationale for the instruction offered by the prosecutor was that Ms. Fallin had been mentioned in the defense opening statement. As a result of the lack of notice, perhaps, the discussion of the merits of giving the instruction with respect to the absence of Ms. Fallin was truncated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <em>\n    Application of the Peculiar Concept of Peculiar Availability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In considering whether to give the missing witness instruction as to Ms. Fallin, the Circuit Court understood that an absent witness must be \"peculiarly available\" to one side for the missing witness rule to be invoked. However, its consideration of that issue was limited. It was undisputed that Ms. Fallin was physically available to both the prosecution and the defense and could have easily been subpoenaed by the State as well as Mr. Harris. The question was whether she was unavailable to the State as a practical matter. The Circuit Court relied solely on the fact that she was the mother of Mr. Harris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Although courts have referred to relationships of \"interest or affection\" as supporting such a finding, a mother-son relationship does not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   render a mother \"peculiarly available\" to her son.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dansbury v.

In this case, the Circuit Court's analysis began-and ended-with the family relationship between Mr. Harris and Ms. Fallin: \"It's his mother.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In its opinion, the Court of Special Appeals supplemented the Circuit Court's analysis with additional facts culled from the record which, it believed, supported the premise that Ms. Fallin was peculiarly available to Mr. Harris and would be expected to favor him in any testimony. In addition to the family relationship cited by the Circuit Court, the intermediate appellate court noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   (1) Ms. Fallin allowed Mr. Harris to live with her from November 2013 through January 2015 without paying rent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   (2) Mr. Harris had given his mother $75,000 from a worker's compensation settlement that he had received\n   for his injured hand in 2008 or 2009-approximately six years before the trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   (3) Ms. Fallin attended the court proceedings on the first day of trial and had brought clothes for Mr. Harris.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20168446\">\n    2017 WL 168446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Of the additional facts cited by the Court of Special Appeals, only items 1 and 2 were known to the jury from testimony. (As to item 1, the intermediate appellate court apparently mis-read the record, as the end date should have been January\n   <em>\n    2014\n   </em>\n   rather than January 2015 and his period of residence two months rather than 14 months. Mr. Harris was arrested in\n   February 2014 and remained in custody as of the time of trial in January 2015). The events cited in items 1 and 2, which preceded the trial by one year and six years, respectively, seem to add little to the idea that Ms. Fallin was \"peculiarly available\" to Mr. Harris besides the fact that she was his mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Item 3-Ms. Fallin's presence in the courtroom and the possibility that she or Mr. Harris' estranged wife would bring clothes for him\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   -was discussed outside the presence of the jury. A court may well decline to give a missing witness instruction based on information not before the jury-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the likelihood that the witness would invoke the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. However, it would be odd for a court to tell a jury that it may draw an inference adverse to one party if it finds that the witness is peculiarly available to that party when the information on which the court believes such an inference could be based is unknown to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Not listed among the additional facts considered by the Court of Special Appeals was other evidence elicited at the trial that suggested that Ms. Fallin might\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be peculiarly available to Mr. Harris. For example, she had cooperated with the police and consented to a search of her home, and she had apparently asked Mr. Harris to leave her home sometime in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   In any event, the Circuit Court cited none of the additional facts listed by the Court of Special Appeals. Nor did the prosecutor refer to them when he argued for the instruction during the jury instruction conference. The prosecutor's request for the instruction was based solely on the fact that Ms. Fallin had been mentioned in opening statement; the Circuit Court's decision to give an instruction inviting the jury to draw an inference adverse to Mr. Harris from her absence appeared to be based only on the family relationship between Ms. Fallin and Mr. Harris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In a case involving similar circumstances, the Court of Special Appeals held that it was error to give a missing witness instruction. In\n   <em>\n    Dansbury v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5740161\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/193/718/#p748\">\n    193 Md.

According to the defendant's version, his mother and aunt, among others, were witnesses to the events surrounding that encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   However, neither the mother nor the aunt were called as witnesses at the trial. The trial court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   decided to give a missing witness instruction adverse to the defendant without considering, aside from their family relationship, whether the missing witnesses were peculiarly available to the defendant. Following his conviction, the defendant appealed. The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court had abused its discretion in giving the missing witness instruction and reversed the conviction. Among other things, the intermediate appellate court noted that the trial court had not followed the \"preferred procedure\" set forth in\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   , that the aunt and mother had been outside the courtroom during the trial and thus physically available to both sides, and that there had been no finding that they were \"peculiarly available\" to the defendant. 194 Md.

The instruction also could have led the jury to believe, incorrectly, that Mr. Harris bore a burden of proof in presenting an alibi defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <em>\n    The Missing Witness Inference in the State's Argument\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   As alluded to earlier, there are cases in which it may be appropriate for the prosecutor to ask the jury to draw a\n   missing witness inference, even though the court should not endorse that particular inference in its instructions. This is such a case. In his opening statement in this case, defense counsel had told that jury that he would present an alibi through the testimony of Ms. Fallin. When the defense substituted the defendant as its witness on his whereabouts, it was fair game for the prosecutor to point out that the defense had not presented the evidence from Ms. Fallin that it had promised, as it would have been fair game for the prosecutor to spotlight any other discrepancy between what the defense promised and what it produced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, it is not fair game for the trial court to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <em>\n    Summary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   It is frequently said that we presume that trial judges know and apply the law in making rulings and rendering decisions, unless we have reason to think otherwise.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medley v.

There is perhaps reason to think otherwise in this case. One would expect a trial court that knew and understood the law to follow the \"preferred procedure\" set out in\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   and to be \"especially cautious,\" as advised in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , when the idea of a missing witness instruction adverse to the defendant is broached. Instead, it appears from the record that it was the Circuit Court, rather than the parties, that initiated the idea of a missing witness instruction. There was apparently no effort to adhere to the \"preferred procedure\" for considering such an instruction adverse to a defendant. In deciding whether to give\n   the instruction, the trial court relied solely on the fact that Ms. Fallin was the mother of Mr. Harris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The instruction should not have been given in this case. We agree with observations made by Judge Nazarian in his dissent in the Court of Special Appeals:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   The State, not Mr. Harris, bore the burden of proof in this case, and Mr. Harris was not obligated (even if it might have bolstered his defense) to corroborate independently his sworn testimony about his whereabouts. The State had the same opportunity to subpoena Ms. Fallin as Mr. Harris did, and didn't ask for the opportunity to subpoena and call her as a rebuttal witness when it learned that Mr. Harris wasn't going to call her. There is no dispute that the State was entitled in closing to note her absence or to question the veracity of Mr. Harris's testimony, and that the jury would be entitled to disbelieve him. But it is another thing altogether to have the\n   <em>\n    court instruct\n   </em>\n   the jury, as it did here, that Ms. Fallin's absence from the witness stand permits the jury to infer that the testimony would have been unfavorable to the party who failed to call such witness, especially without first following the \"preferred procedure\" of advising the parties of its intention to give the charge at the close of defense's\n   case.

While Mr. Harris' alibi was uncorroborated, the bulk of the evidence at trial tended to undermine his identification as the suspect. Neither Ms. Binko nor Ms. Holmes nor Mr. Allen identified him as the unmasked robber called Black. Nor was there any indication that the elusive Reds, were she ever found, would tie him to the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Mr. Harris testified that his left arm had limited functionality and that he could not grasp items. The Circuit Court acknowledged that Harris's left arm was visibly \"not quite normal or regular.\" This was inconsistent with the fact that, according to Ms. Binko, Black used both his hands without\n   difficulty during the robbery and their struggle. Moreover, the evidence established that Mr. Harris and the victims did not know each other, raising the question as to how he would know that there would be cash and Oxycodone at the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   The only evidence linking Mr. Harris to the scene of the crime was the fingerprint match made by the latent print examiner.

While the latent print examiner's testimony raises questions about how Mr. Harris' fingerprints ended up on the pill bottles, it is hardly conclusive that he participated in the armed robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   In any event, we need not be convinced that Mr. Harris is innocent. Rather, to find the error harmless, we must be convinced that it did not influence the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. The viability of Mr. Harris' defense hinged on his credibility, especially with respect to his alibi. As indicated earlier, a missing witness instruction can invite a jury to draw an unreliable inference from the imagined testimony of an absent witness.

Mr. Harris lived with his mother from November 2013 until January 2014 without paying rent; in 2008 or 2009 he gave his mother $75,000 from a workers' compensation settlement and had given her money at other times. She was absent the day the defense presented its case, even though defense counsel had told the jury she would offer an alibi. Mr. Harris testified that he had been at his mother's home on January 16, 2014, the night of the robbery. All of these facts support the trial\n   judge's discretionary decision to grant the missing witness instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Majority discounts the closeness and strength of this parental relationship, citing Ms. Fallin's consent to the police searching her home. In doing so, I submit, the Majority improperly invades the province of the trial judge. A reasonable trial judge could certainly conclude that Ms. Fallin gave her consent for reasons other than disinterest in her son's welfare-such as fear of what the police would do if she refused. We should not reverse that decision based on our view of why she gave her consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   In holding that the trial court erred in giving the missing witness instruction the Majority relies in large part on \"developments\n   in constitutional law, changes in the rules of evidence and discovery, and questions concerning the accuracy of the adverse inference promoted by the missing witness rule ....\" Maj. Op. at 389, 182 A.3d at 832. To be sure, the constitutional implications, and the policy concerns reflected in the abandonment of the rule in other states are fair reasons to question the wisdom of the missing witness rule. I do not disagree with these points, and maybe, eventually jettison of the rule will prove to be the correct course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   But the Majority does not abandon the missing witness rule-it only cabins the rule to \"the rare criminal case in which a missing witness instruction adverse to a defendant may be appropriate ....\" Maj. Op. at 413, 182 A.3d at 846. In my view, if such a case exists, this is it. The parental bond, living arrangement, and prior financial dealings together with the opening statement promising Ms. Fallin as an alibi witness, combine to create a circumstance that more than justified the trial court's discretionary decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The Majority's rationale and holding leaves litigants, lawyers and trial judges without appropriate guidance from this Court. For example, it is difficult to know how much weight the Majority gives to the trial court's failure to announce in full detail all of its reasons for its decision to give the instruction. Further, I am not persuaded that imposing a strict requirement that the trial court announce all of its reasons for giving this or any instruction is wise. Such a policy invites error by our trial judges, who are without the luxury of deliberative written decisions in the midst of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   I also disagree with the Majority's statement that the justification for the missing witness rule is \"questionable\" because trial lawyers prefer to try a \"lean\" case-particularly as applied here. Maj. Op. at 393, 182 A3d at 835. In this trial, defense counsel promised the jury that Ms. Fallin would testify that Mr. Harris was with her the entire night of the crime. Surely, defense counsel did not scrap Ms. Fallin's testimony merely because it was cumulative, or the jury was fatigued. Nor is it likely that, after promising the jury Ms.\n   Fallin would provide an alibi, he abdicated her testimony because of an eleventh-hour decision that her demeanor was poor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   fails to bolster the Majority's position. The Majority is simply wrong in stating that \"the Circuit Court did not follow the 'preferred procedure' set forth in\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   .\" Maj. Op. at 406, 182 A.3d at 842.

I take this second step and examine the record for such purpose. The State used Gaskins's testimony as part of its case in chief. The prosecutor established that Gaskins had sought a warrant for Mr. Harris's arrest after learning that the print examiners had matched Mr. Harris's fingerprints to the prints found on the prescription bottles. Then the prosecutor asked Gaskins whether he \"attempt[ed] to interview Mr. Harris\" and \"[w]hat, if anything, occurred during that interview[.]\" Gaskins testified that Mr. Harris had \"provided us with a false address, denied any involvement with the robbery, and then ... he requested an attorney.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That request is inextricably linked with the notion that Gaskins believed Mr.\n   Harris to be guilty.
