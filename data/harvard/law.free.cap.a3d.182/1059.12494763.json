(New Foundations), Firetree, Ltd. (Firetree), and Orange Stones Company (Orange Stone) (collectively, Charities). Each was created as a charitable nonprofit with different but related charitable purposes. New Foundations was incorporated to provide services to families and children, with special emphasis on providing services to fragile infants and children. Firetree was incorporated to provide food and shelter to disadvantaged people. Orange Stone was incorporated to provide housing, care and treatment to halfway house residents. Each provides those services pursuant to contracts with federal, state and local government agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Also named were Allen Ertel, Catherine Ertel, Amy Ertel, Edward Ertel and William Brown (collectively, Individual Defendants) who currently serve or have served as officers and directors of the Charities. The Commonwealth contends that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Charities by engaging in a pattern of improper related-party transactions with the Charities benefiting themselves or for-profit entities that they control at the expense of the Charities and the public. Those improper-related transactions alleged are improper payments, co-mingling assets, diverting resources, and usurping business and investment opportunities for their personal benefit or for-profit entities, including, but not limited to, Treefire, Alcat Brown, BANCA and/or Park Place, which they control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Commonwealth sought restoration, return and repayment of all diverted assets by the Individual Defendants whether those assets were diverted to them or one of their for-profit entities. It also asks for the immediate transfer of all assets, in whatever form, held by or in the names of Individual Defendants' for-profit entities, and to impose fines on Individual Defendants for violating the Solicitation of Funds for Charitable Purposes Act (Act).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding the Charities, the Commonwealth seeks an accounting and removal of the Charities' Board of Directors and the appointment of a new Board of Directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Commonwealth has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment which is primarily based on its claim of illegal self-dealing by the Individual Defendants with the Charities. It contends that because of that self-dealing, the Individual Defendants should be surcharged and held jointly and severally liable for a total of $25,530,742 based on approximately 26 transactions, which they contend were illegal self-dealing.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. $4,085,000 which passed from all three Charities to the Individual Defendants through Treefire;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. $1,000,000 which passed from Firetree to WCB (William Brown);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3. $700,000 for an April 5, 2011 check that Allen Ertel wrote to himself from New Foundations' account\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4. $300,000 for an April 5, 2011 check that Allen Ertel wrote to himself from Firetree's account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   5. $625,000 for 401(k) distributions from Firetree to the Individual Defendants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   6. $520,000 for unnecessary interest paid to Individual Defendant Allen Ertel on his \"officer loan\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   7. $163,680 for unnecessary interest paid to Individual Defendant Catherine Ertel on her \"special grant\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   8. $1,824,287 in write-offs due from affiliates;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   9. $655,799 for the Treefire investment and write-off;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   10. $403,232 for the Conewego Harrisburg write-off;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   11. $90,172 for the Outer Dauphin, LLC write-off;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   12. $63,367 for the BANCA write-off;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   13. $19,200 for the RegScan write-off;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   14. $184,551 for the underpayment of the Individual Defendants' loans from Firetree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   15. $744,199 in unpaid loans due to New Foundations from the Individual Defendants-related party for-profit entities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   16. $418,885 for the unpaid loan from Firetree to Edward Ertel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   17. $115,876 in unpaid loans due to Orange Stone from the Individual Defendants-related party for-profit entities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   18. $384,000 for airplane payments made by the Charities to Alcat Brown;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   19. $4,000,000 for rental payments made by the Charities to Park Place and BANCA on properties the charities could have purchased in their own right;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   20. $271,000 for rental payments made to BANCA by Firetree and Orange Stone for a property owned by Firetree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   21. $19,822 for Firetree's payment of Park Place's real estate taxes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   22. $100,587 in proceeds for the Individual Defendants' sale of Swathmore Lane which was financed by Firetree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   23. $1,000,000 for the transfer of Firetree's assets to Firetree Place;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   24. $6,696,653.02 for the purported loan repayment through the transfer of stock which should be rejected and replaced with a cash payment in that amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   25. $10,000 for violations of the Act; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   26. $1,135,432 for the Commonwealth's costs of investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Commonwealth requested that summary judgment be granted and the following order be entered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   a.

Enter judgment in the amount of $10,000 against Firetree for violations of the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Charities and Individual Defendants have filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment contending that the evidence shows that they are upholding their mission and serving the public good in accordance with typical nonprofit practices and in compliance with Pennsylvania law. They contend that the Commonwealth has failed to identify any improper transactions engaged in by the Charities because the Individual Defendants' compensation, including\n   bonuses, retirement plan funds, health plan costs and other payments were fair and reasonable. They also contend that the lease payments made to related for-profits were also fair and reasonable. Regarding loans the Charities made to the Individual Defendants, they claim that the Commonwealth has offered no evidence of any violations of Pennsylvania law in connection with loans the Charities made to related for-profit entities and Individual Defendants. They also note that all such loans have been repaid and for the past four years, the Charities no longer permit such loans. They also contend that some of the claims for relief are out of time. As to the Commonwealth's claims for accounting violations of the Act, they allege that the Charities have already provided their books and records to the Commonwealth for inspection and they have never solicited donations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   While styled as a Motion for Partial Summary Relief, the Charities and Individual Defendants have not identified what would remain if their Motion were granted since they are asking for what seems to be all counts of the Complaint be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At oral argument on the cross-motions, it became apparent that if the issue was whether the transactions in question were illegal and self-dealing under the Nonprofit Corporation Law (Law),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   then neither summary judgment motion could be granted because they involved disputed questions of fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   II,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Commonwealth, however, at oral argument, contended that transactions were\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   illegal and self-dealing because the officers and the Board of Directors of a nonprofit charity have a fiduciary obligation-the same as a Trustee-and trust law applies. As a result, it claimed that the Individual Defendants must disgorge the gross amounts of the challenged transactions regardless of whether those transactions were fair and reasonable, even if the Charities benefited from the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Commonwealth, however, did not brief this issue and neither party had briefed the standard that should be employed in determining the legality of related transactions. As a result, an order was entered ordering the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issue of whether self-dealing between a charity and related individuals\n   or entities is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   illegal, requiring disgorgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   To determine if any of the Individual Defendants, as board members of the Charities, have engaged in illegal self-dealing, it is necessary to determine what the obligations of a director of a nonprofit are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nonprofit corporations are formed under the Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   They are governed by a board of directors who are a \"group of persons under the direction of whom the business and affairs of the corporation are managed irrespective of the name by which the group is designated.\" 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5103(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The status and duties of a director of a nonprofit corporation are set forth in several sections of the Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5712 sets forth the director's status, obligations and duty of care to the nonprofit corporation.

This provision deals with \"excess income\"-a.k.a. \"profits\" derived from the nonprofit's operation.

The one that is at issue here is 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5547(a) (emphasis added), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Every nonprofit corporation incorporated for a charitable purpose or purposes may take, receive and hold such real and personal property as may be given, devised to\n   <em>\n    , or otherwise vested in such corporation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    in trust\n   </strong>\n   , for the purpose or purposes set forth in its articles.\n   <em>\n    The board of directors or other body of the corporation shall, as trustees of such property, be held to the same degree of responsibility and accountability as if not incorporated\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The question then is whether the actions of directors of nonprofits formed for charitable purposes are governed by the same standard as other nonprofit directors, or whether this provision deems all the charitable assets held \"in trust,\" making those directors' standard of care the same as trustees of a charitable trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The answer to this question is important because if all the assets are held in trust, then trust principles apply to directors of\n   nonprofits. Unlike 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5728, which permits self-dealing in certain circumstances, self-dealing is much more proscribed when involving charitable assets.

It points to 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5545, which allows a nonprofit \"the right to receive such income and, in so doing, may make an incidental profit.\" Because none of the Charities' property was donated and it is allowed to retain earnings, they contend that its assets are not trust property within the meaning of Section 5547(a) and the Individual Defendants are not trustees of any of the nonprofits' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Commonwealth, however, points to other language contained in 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5545, which is also in the Charities' Articles of Incorporation, providing that \"[a]ll such incidental profits shall be applied to the maintenance and operation of the lawful activities of the corporation, and in no case shall be divided or distributed in any manner whatsoever among the members,\n   directors, or officers of the corporation.\" It argues that since the only assets of the corporation comes from incidental profit, that means that all assets of the Charities, whether they be in cash or other personalty or realty, are imbued with the corporations' charitable purposes and, as such, are held in trust for the benefit of the public at large.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   It points to\n   <em>\n    In re Roxborough Memorial Hospital,\n   </em>\n   17 Fid. Rep.2d 412 (Phila. Orph. Ct. 1997), to support its position that 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5547(a) encompasses all the assets of a nonprofit corporation formed for charitable purposes, not only assets that have been expressly donated. That decision stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   The Hospital has generated revenues from the services provided. Such revenues like the assets used to generate them are to be used for the charitable purposes as set forth in the Hospital's articles of incorporation.

However, \"[a]ll such incidental profit shall be applied to the maintenance and operation of the lawful activities of the corporation, and in no case shall be divided or distributed in any manner whatsoever among the members, directors or officers of the corporation.\" 15 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 5545.\n   <em>\n    Accordingly, all property held by a nonprofit corporation is held in trust to carry out its charitable purposes.

In that case, it was proposed that excess funds from the sale of the hospital be given to the Roxborough Memorial Health Foundation, also a nonprofit charitable corporation, to carry out community-based health initiatives in the service area of the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In approving the request, the court held that when a Pennsylvania nonprofit charitable corporation undertakes any action governed by 15 Pa.C.S. Chapter 59, review by the court is required to determine whether or not property committed to charitable purposes will be diverted from its intended purposes. If it is shown that proceeding under Chapter 59 will result in diversion, the court shall enter an order pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. Chapter 61. With regard to charitable nonprofits, 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5976 (b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Distribution of property committed to charitable purposes.-\n   </strong>\n   If the assets of the corporation include any property committed to charitable purposes, the board of directors or other body shall apply to the court for an order pursuant to section 5547(b) (relating to nondiversion of certain property) specifying the disposition of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Because all of a charitable nonprofit's assets are committed to a charitable purpose, when a charitable nonprofit ceases business, then any remaining funds or property must be given to a charitable nonprofit with a similar charitable purpose. 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5547(b) provides that \"property cannot be diverted from the objects to which it was donated, granted or devised, unless and until the board of directors or other body obtains from the court an order under 20 Pa.C.S. Ch. 77 (relating to trusts) specifying the disposition\n   of the property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is unlike a nonprofit that is not a charity, which can, upon dissolution, distribute the assets to its members. 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5975(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   None of that, though, addresses whether 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5547(a) makes all the assets of a charitable nonprofit held \"in trust\" and, correspondingly, makes all charitable nonprofit directors' standard of care the same as trustees of charitable trusts. That determination depends on a textual analysis of how the phrase \"may take, receive and hold such real and personal property as may be given, devised to, or otherwise vested in such corporation\" is interpreted. If it is interpreted to not include revenues and excess revenues generated by a charity that are in or reflected in cash or property, then charitable nonprofit directors do not have a trustee duty of care but, rather, the same duty of care of all directors of nonprofits. However, if this provision is interpreted to include revenues and excess revenues-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , all assets-then charitable nonprofit directors are the equivalent of trustees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5547(a), the \"may take, receive and hold real and personal property\" part of the phrase indicates that something is being given to the nonprofit and not something generated from internal operations. Similarly, the part of the phrase that the trustee principles apply to property \"as may be given, devised to, or otherwise vested in such corporation\" deals with gifts, bequests and other property that is vested in the corporation for a charitable purpose. While it could be argued that the term \"otherwise vested\" includes all property that the charitable nonprofit holds, in the context of the overall phrase, it refers to that which is placed in its possession for charitable purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re Roxborough\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Memorial Hospital\n   </em>\n   , the money cy pres'd to the foundation was properly vested in that charitable nonprofit to which trust principles would apply.
