Pursuant to the power vested in the government of Anne Arundel County, Maryland (\"the County\") through 1986 Md.

The\n   <em>\n    Halle\n   </em>\n   Class, in response, filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court.

The\n   <em>\n    Halle\n   </em>\n   Class appealed then to the intermediate appellate court. In a 29 July 2013 unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court's 25 March 2011 order. The\n   <em>\n    Halle\n   </em>\n   Class petitioned again for a writ of certiorari. We denied that petition also. The circuit court awarded, on remand on 13 May 2014, counsel fees in the amount of 39 percent of the $1,342,360 in refunds, plus five-percent interest on each refund, and, on 8 August 2016, issued its final judgment.

[The\n   <em>\n    Dabbs\n   </em>\n   Class] also argued that the amendments to the Impact Fee Ordinance in Bill No. 27-07 and Bill No. 71-08 unconstitutionally interfered with their vested rights in refunds. After hearing from the parties, [the circuit court entered, ultimately, a declaratory judgment in favor of the County as to all issues raised in the proceeding.] [T]he circuit court ruled that the County had applied the Impact Fee Ordinance as required by this Court's 2008 opinion and found that there are no impact fees available for refund under \u00a7 17-11-210. Further, the circuit court rejected [the\n   <em>\n    Dabbs\n   </em>\n   Class'] constitutional and state law challenges to the Impact Fee Ordinance, finding that most of the challenges had already been resolved against the class plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Halle\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   More specifically, the circuit court found that the County prepared the six FY charts in the format approved by the\n   <em>\n    Halle\n   </em>\n   courts, properly comparing the amount of impact fees collected in each FY and district under review to the amount of impact fees expended (disbursed) and encumbered as of the end of the sixth FY following the FY of collection. Kurt Svendsen, the County's Assistant Budget Officer, who had been employed by the County since September 1, 1997, was responsible for (a) the preparation of the County's Capital Budget portion of the Annual Budget and Appropriation Ordinance, and (b) the monitoring of encumbrances and expenditures recorded in connection with appropriations for capital projects. Because Svendsen monitored expenditures and encumbrances recorded against appropriations of capital projects on an almost daily basis, he was delegated the responsibility for conducting the six FY test under \u00a7 17-1-210(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In the present case, the County prepared six FY charts for FYs 1997-2002 in the same manner as the charts prepared in\n   <em>\n    Halle\n   </em>\n   for FYs 1988-2002, but also included impact fee expenditures on temporary classrooms. The charts indicated that all impact fees collected in FYs 1997-2002 were expended or encumbered within six FYs following the FY of collection and, thus, no impact fees collected in these FYs were available for refund.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Lastly, the circuit court found that, in applying the six FY test, the County properly interpreted the term \"impact fees encumbered\" in \u00a7 17-11-210(b) to mean:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) the amount of impact fees collected in a district account in a FY which have not been expended on June 30 of the sixth FY following the FY of collection, for which there is\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) as of the same date, an encumbrance (purchase order) on an impact fee eligible capital project in the district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   According to the circuit court, this definition is the only logical one based on [generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) ], the applicable provisions of the County Charter, and Annual Budget and Appropriation Ordinances. Under GAAP, an appropriation states the legal authority to spend or otherwise\n   commit a government's resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stephen Gauthier,\n   <em>\n    Governmental Accounting Auditing and Financial Reporting\n   </em>\n   at 305 (Government Finance Officers Ass'n 2001). Meanwhile, \u00a7 715(a) of the County Charter provides that County officials and employees may not spend or commit funds in excess of appropriations, and \u00a7 17-11-201(2) defines an encumbrance as \"a legal commitment for the expenditure of funds, chargeable against the applicable appropriation for the expenditure, that is documented by a contract or purchase order.\" Thus, the court concluded that when determining the amount of \"impact fees encumbered,\" the County was correct in comparing the amount of unexpended impact fees in the district account at the end of the relevant FY to the encumbrances entered in relation to capital projects in the district that have been determined by\n   the [Planning and Zoning Office] to be eligible in the district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As pertinent to the certiorari questions for which we granted the petition in this case, the intermediate appellate court-in reliance on\n   <em>\n    Waters Landing, Ltd.

Under the prior amended \u00a7 17-11-210(b), within 60 days following the end of the sixth fiscal year\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   from when impact fees were collected, the County was to give notice to the public of the availability of impact fee refunds, if any. Upon the notice's publication, an eligible property owner must apply for a refund within 60 days of the publication of the last notice. The County, following an assessment that the applicant had paid rightfully the fees, would refund any available unexpended impact fees to the eligible property owner, with interest. Until such time, property owners in the district from which funds were collected were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   entitled to refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Here, impact fees collected from the\n   <em>\n    Dabbs\n   </em>\n   Class through FY 2003 (the last year in the applicable six-year period and which was the basis of the refund claims asserted here) would be eligible for refunds (if any existed) on or about 29 August 2009, i.e., six years (and the 60-day\n   notice period) following the fiscal year of impact fee collection. The effective date of the repeal of the refund provision of \u00a7 17-11-210 occurred well before any impact fees collected through 2003 became ripe for a refund claim. The rationales of\n   <em>\n    McComas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Aviles\n   </em>\n   evince a transparent legislative practice that if a party's rights have not vested before a statute's repeal, there can be no claim as of right to the relief the statute once granted. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    McComas\n   </em>\n   , the County, before paying any potential impact fee refunds, had to determine (after a petition by an eligible property owner) if refunds were due from the FY of relevant collection. Until such time, no eligible owner had\n   vested rights in the refunds. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Dabbs\n   </em>\n   Class' claims for refunds of impact fees collected through FY 2003 was not ripe until 29 August 2009-after the effective date of the repeal of the refund provision in \u00a7 17-11-210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Dabbs\n   </em>\n   Class protests that this constitutes a \"cooking of the books,\" i.e., the County misrepresented intentionally facts to the court, and the passage of Bill No. 27-07 and Bill No. 71-08 were done with intent to deprive the\n   <em>\n    Dabbs\n   </em>\n   Class of money they were owed. We disagree, and in response, associate ourselves with the eulogy pronounced by the circuit court in dispensing with this argument,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [the\n   <em>\n    Dabbs\n   </em>\n   Class] seem to broadly suggest that when the Impact Fee Ordinance was enacted that those provisions that pertained to accounting of the fees paid and the possibility of a refund at some future time,\n   <em>\n    were somehow frozen in amber unable\n   </em>\n   to be revised or improved by the County as experience demonstrated a need. This would be a surprising result given that as explained above, development impact fee provisions were novel in Maryland and in the County and in some respects were an on going experiment in fiscal funding of the needs arising from development projects. It is exactly the type of legislation that over time may need review and revision to accomplish its intended goals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   (emphasis added).
