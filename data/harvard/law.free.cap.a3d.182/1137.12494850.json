For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm in part and reverse in part, and vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff has alleged that, on or about April 26, 2010, while he was being held as a pretrial detainee at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), he was attacked by a fellow inmate, Ian Rosado (Rosado). As a result of this attack, plaintiff suffered lacerations and permanent scarring on his face. In his complaint, plaintiff alleges that Rosado, on the day before the attack, told defendant Matthew Galligan (Galligan), a correctional officer at the ACI, that he was going to attack plaintiff. The plaintiff has also alleged that Galligan informed various John Doe defendants of Rosado's planned attack, and that Galligan abandoned his post for eighteen minutes on April 26, 2010, in order to provide Rosado with an opportunity to assault plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 12, 2010, plaintiff was convicted of the following crimes, for which he was being detained: first-degree murder, felony assault, using a firearm when committing a crime of violence, carrying a pistol without a license, and possession of arms by a person convicted of a crime of violence or who is a fugitive from justice. He was subsequently declared a habitual offender. The trial justice sentenced plaintiff to two consecutive life sentences, plus an additional twenty-year sentence to be served\n   consecutively to the second life sentence, two ten-year sentences to run concurrently with the first life sentence, and, as a habitual offender, to an additional twenty-five-year sentence, to be served after the other sentences and to be served without the possibility of parole. Thereafter, on November 10, 2010, plaintiff filed an initial civil complaint alleging negligence on the part of defendants for the April 26, 2010 attack. The plaintiff then filed an amended complaint on April 12, 2013. The plaintiff timely appealed his conviction, and this Court affirmed the conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Final judgment of conviction entered on May 2, 2014. The civil action proceeded in the ordinary course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The day before trial was scheduled to commence, the trial justice\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raised the issue of the civil death statute, in light of plaintiff's sentences of life imprisonment. The defendants immediately responded with a motion to dismiss the case in accordance with \u00a7 13-6-1, arguing that plaintiff was deemed civilly dead and that, therefore, his civil rights and property rights effectively were terminated. On July 12, 2016, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which proposed to add a claim for violations of plaintiff's constitutional rights under color of law. The defendants objected, arguing that it would cause undue delay, futility, and prejudice to defendants. The plaintiff also objected to defendants' motion to dismiss the case based on \u00a7 13-6-1, arguing that: (1) the civil death statute was not applicable to this case; (2) the civil death statute in Rhode Island is invalid under the Supremacy Clause to the extent that it impairs plaintiff's capacity to sue under \u00a7 1983 ; and (3) \u00a7 1983 invalidates any state law that precludes access to state remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 28, 2016, the trial justice granted defendants' motion to dismiss based on the civil death statute, declaring that the Superior Court had \"no jurisdiction to hear this case. Therefore, the complaint is dismissed.\" The trial justice did not address plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff timely appealed. Before this Court, plaintiff argues that \u00a7 13-6-1 does not require dismissal of his complaint, and that the trial justice erred in failing to address his motion to file a second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure \"questions a court's authority to adjudicate a particular controversy before it.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyer v.

The statute unambiguously declares that a person such as plaintiff, who is serving a life sentence, is deemed civilly dead and thus does not possess most commonly recognized civil rights. Section 13-6-1. The Legislature has enumerated certain exceptions to \u00a7 13-6-1 -\"[h]owever, the bond of matrimony shall not be dissolved\"-but there is no exception for claims impacting a prisoner's civil rights. We decline to read such an exception into the statute. Our interpretation of \u00a7 13-6-1 leads to the necessary and logical conclusion that the Superior Court had no authority to hear this case, because plaintiff's civil rights were extinguished by operation of law once his conviction became final when it was affirmed on May 2, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiff points to\n   <em>\n    Vaccaro\n   </em>\n   , and argues that his claim is not barred by \u00a7 13-6-1 because his conviction was not final until three-and-a-half years after he filed his initial complaint in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaccaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7965300\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/422/1253/\">\n    422 A.2d at 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the trial justice and both parties incorrectly identified the issue in this case as lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Section 13-6-1. The plaintiff does not fall under any exception to \u00a7 13-6-1, as prescribed by the Legislature; thus he is without recourse. Under our holdings in\n   <em>\n    Hartt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chase\n   </em>\n   , it is clear that the Superior Court is vested with subject-matter jurisdiction, in the fundamental sense, over plaintiff's claims; however, it would have been error and an excess of jurisdiction for the Superior Court to consider plaintiff's claims when the Legislature has declared plaintiff to be civilly dead. We cannot imagine a case in which the Superior Court is divested completely of its statutorily-granted subject-matter jurisdiction. We do, however, hold that, in cases such as this, it would be error for the Superior Court to proceed. We conclude that the trial justice prudently and accurately dismissed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    The Second Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in failing to address his motion to file a second amended complaint. This Court agrees. On July 12, 2016, after the trial justice raised the issue of the civil death statute\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff moved for leave to file a second amended complaint and provided a copy to the trial justice. Without addressing plaintiff's motion,\n   the trial justice granted defendants' motion to dismiss the case on the basis of \u00a7 13-6-1. The plaintiff's proposed second amended complaint specifically named Galligan in his individual and official capacities and raised, for the first time, claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1988 ; the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; the Rhode Island Constitution; and the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff attempted to add a \u00a7 1983 claim because, he contends, that statute precluded the Superior Court from dismissing his complaint based on his interpretation that \u00a7 1983\"invalidates any state law which stands in the way of any person filing suit to vindicate violation of federal protected rights\" \"under color of law[.]\" The plaintiff has failed to produce any authority that holds that a state court is bound to hear a \u00a7 1983 action where this Court has deemed the party to be civilly dead. Rather, plaintiff simply argues that the phrase \"or other proper proceeding for redress\" set forth in \u00a7 1983\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   must include \"not only violations of civil rights under color of law, but also\n   <em>\n    related\n   </em>\n   tortious acts associated with the violation of constitutional rights-and that any state law which prevents anyone from filing suit is invalid under the broad language of \u00a7 1983.\" (Emphasis in original.) The plaintiff's generic assertions are unaccompanied by jurisdictional support, which will be necessary on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under this Court's procedural law, plaintiff is prohibited from adding new claims and new parties six years after his injury and after the statute of limitations has run.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeSantis v.

The practice of changing the entire nature of a case from a negligence claim to a civil rights action after the trial was scheduled to begin has been condemned by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faerber v.

Bechtel Power Corporation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531232\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/780/124/#p139\">\n    780 F.2d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 139 (1st Cir. 1985) ) ). The trial justice correctly noted in her decision dismissing the case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"There was no 1983 claim pled or filed. This case was ready trial. It was ready trial on a negligence suit. The plaintiff did not plead any civil rights action. And I understand that we have very liberal pleading in our state. However, the fact is this case was a go for trial. It was a go on a negligence claim. And it was not a go on a civil rights claim. It's too late.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nevertheless, we conclude that the trial justice should have addressed the plaintiff's second amended complaint before granting the defendants' motion to dismiss. Although we consistently have held \"that the decision to grant or to deny a motion to amend a complaint is confided\n   to the sound discretion of the hearing justice[,]\" the trial justice is nonetheless required to rule on the motion.\n   <em>\n    Harodite Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7278561\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/24/514/#p529\">\n    24 A.3d at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
