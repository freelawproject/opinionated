Appellant presents us with the following question:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Did the court err in denying appellant's petition for writ of error coram nobis?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we answer that question in the negative and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Guilty Plea.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 22, 2008, pursuant to a binding agreement, appellant pleaded guilty, in\n   the Circuit Court for Montgomery\n   County, to two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the plea agreement, the court bound itself to impose an overall sentence not exceeding twenty years' imprisonment. Additionally, the court bound itself to impose a sentence of executed incarceration not to exceed eighteen months. On October 31, 2008, consistent with the plea agreement, the court imposed a 10-year term of imprisonment, with all but 18 months suspended, for one robbery conviction, and a concurrent 364-day term of imprisonment for the other robbery conviction. The court also imposed two years of supervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Violation of Probation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 11, 2009, appellant was released from incarceration and began his probation. On November 23, 2010, appellant was found to have been in violation of the terms of his probation after he admitted that he been convicted of a number of other crimes that occurred while he was serving his probation, including, theft, possession of a firearm by a minor, and making a false statement to police. Thereafter, the court directed the execution of six years of the eight and one-half year term of imprisonment it had previously suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Petition for a Writ of Error Coram Nobis.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2016, appellant, relying on\n   <em>\n    Padilla v.

The relevant portions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provide that the Attorney General of the United States has the power to remove an alien from the United States who\n   has been convicted of an \"aggravated felony.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A \"crime of violence\" is defined by 18 U.S.C \u00a7 16 as \"an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\" or \"any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The phrase \"term of imprisonment\" \"is deemed to include the period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that imprisonment or sentence in whole or in part.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(48)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A), if the Attorney General determines that the alien's \"life or freedom would be threatened [by being deported to] that country because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\" then the Attorney General may withhold deportation. However, the Attorney General lacks the authority to withhold deportation if the alien is convicted of a \"particularly serious crime.\" A \"particularly serious crime\" is defined as an \"aggravated felony\" for which an alien has a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, an alien who is convicted of robbery and receives a sentence in excess of one year's imprisonment, like appellant, is subject to removal from this country regardless of how much of that sentence is suspended. Moreover, if an alien is sentenced to more than five years' imprisonment for robbery (regardless of how much of that sentence is suspended), like appellant, then the Attorney General lacks the authority to withhold deportation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appellant argued that, based on the foregoing, the VOP court had two options at its disposal which could have ameliorated appellant's negative immigration consequences. The VOP court could have either sentenced appellant to less than one year's imprisonment, which would have had the\n   effect of removing the \"aggravated felony\" status of appellant's robbery conviction, or sentenced appellant to less than five years' imprisonment, which would have had the effect of removing the \"particularly serious crime\" status of appellant's robbery conviction, which would have, in turn permitted the Attorney General to withhold deportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellant claims that his attorney's failure to address these immigration related concerns before, or during, the VOP hearing amounted to a deprivation of his right to effective assistance of counsel.

The court also said that it would not have considered a sentence of under one year for the violation of probation. The court then reserved on the issue of whether, under the circumstances of this case, counsel was required to inform appellant and/or the court of the immigration consequences of the sentencing on the VOP, and concomitantly, whether VOP counsel made a serious attorney error in failing to advise appellant and/or the court of such consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    The Order Denying the Petition for a Writ of Error Coram Nobis.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 25, 2017, after receiving supplemental briefing from the parties, the court issued an Opinion and Order denying appellant's petition. The court focused its analysis on whether the original ten-year sentence with all but 18 months suspended, or the six-year VOP sentence, was the operative sentence for immigration consequence purposes. The court found that the federal government, when considering appellant's removability, would consider appellant as having received a ten-year sentence because that was the sentence imposed in 2008. The court ruled, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The [c]ourt shall focus on the question of whether the 6 year sentence imposed for the violation [of probation] is the operative sentence for purposes of the INS because the resolution of that issue is dispositive of [appellant's] request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Citing to\n   <em>\n    In re: Song\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20173\">\n    23 I. &amp; N. Dec., 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) and\n   <em>\n    In re: Cota-Vargas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20849\">\n    23 I. &amp; N. Dec., 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), [appellant] argues that the sentence of 6 years imposed for the violation of probation is the controlling sentence for immigration purposes. The original sentence imposed is a nullity for immigration purposes. As the State points out in their\n   Reply, neither of these cases support that proposition. In both cases, the original sentences were struck on reconsideration and new sentences were imposed\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   .\n   Under those circumstances, the INS considered the new sentences only and treated the original sentences as a nullity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   What occurred here is entirely different. Here the [c]ourt originally imposed a sentence of 10 years, suspend all but 18 months, and placed [appellant] on two years of supervised probation. [Appellant] after serving 18 months was free in the community on probation. Thereafter, the [c]ourt found he violated the probation and of the remaining 8\u00bd years backup time that he faced, imposed an additional 6 years for [appellant] to serve on the original sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Under these circumstances, the [c]ourt finds that INS would not consider the original sentence of 10 years a nullity. Instead they would view the [appellant] as having received a sentence of 10 years, 7\u00bd of which he ultimately had to serve. For that reason, there was no adverse consequence for immigration purposes to be suffered as a result of the admission to the violation. The adverse consequence had already been suffered as a result of the original 10 year sentence. Therefore, [VOP counsel] was not ineffective in failing to advise [appellant] of any adverse immigration consequences as a result of admitting the violation. For the same reason, the [c]ourt finds that [VOP counsel] was not ineffective for failing to argue to the [c]ourt that if the [c]ourt imposed a sentence of less than 5 years on the violation, [appellant] could argue that he should not be deported. Such an argument if made, would be an incorrect statement of the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Contentions on Appeal.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, appellant claims that, when the coram nobis court wrote in its opinion and order, \"[t]herefore, [VOP counsel] was not ineffective in failing to advise [appellant] of any adverse immigration consequences as a result of admitting the violation,\" the coram nobis court \"found as a matter of fact\n   that [a]ppellant's attorney at the probation revocation hearing did not discuss the immigration consequences of [a]ppellant's plea.\" That failure to so advise, according to appellant, amounted to a serious attorney error under the teachings of\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and its progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to appellant, because the coram nobis court found, as a fact, that counsel did not discuss the immigration consequences with appellant, which was a serious attorney error, and because the court had already announced its finding of prejudice\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   during the hearing on the coram nobis petition, the court had effectively found both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , test were satisfied, and therefore it erred in not granting relief. In appellant's view, the coram nobis court wrongly believed that appellant also had to show that any \"lesser sentence [imposed by the VOP court] would have affected his deportation status,\" which appellant did not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the alternative, appellant argues that the coram nobis court was legally incorrect in finding that the operative sentence for immigration purposes was the original sentence because, according to appellant, under federal law the determinative sentence is the VOP sentence.

Thus, appellant claims that, because a VOP sentencing is a resentencing under Maryland law, and because immigration authorities, when evaluating a defendant's sentence for immigration purposes, will look to the new and reduced sentence after a resentencing, that, had appellant received a sentence under five years upon violating his probation, his immigration consequences would have been less severe. Therefore, according to appellant, had counsel for appellant\n   argued in mitigation for imposition of a sentence of under five years, or under one year, the court could have \"re-imposed\" a sentence of under five years' incarceration which would have ameliorated appellant's immigration consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    The State's Contentions on Appeal.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As an initial matter, the State does not accept the appellant's assertion that \"the [coram nobis] court found as a matter of fact that [a]ppellant's attorney at the probation revocation hearing did not discuss the immigration consequences of [a]ppellant's plea.\" The State argues that, when the coram nobis court said \"[t]herefore, [appellant's counsel at the violation of probation hearing] was not ineffective in failing to advise [appellant] of any adverse immigration consequences as a result of admitting the violation,\" the court was merely assuming, for argument's sake, that counsel did not advise appellant about the potential adverse immigration\n   consequences associated with violating probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the State claims that, appellant's advice, or lack thereof, was immaterial to the coram nobis court's legal conclusion that appellant's original ten-year sentence was the determinative sentence for immigration purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The State agrees with the coram nobis court that the operative sentence for ascertaining appellant's immigration consequences flowing from his criminal convictions was the original ten-year sentence, with all but 18 months suspended, imposed on October 31, 2008, after appellant pleaded guilty, and before he violated the terms of his probation.

Such a result seems untenable.\n   Second, a major necessary premise of appellant's argument is that, upon being found to have been in violation of probation, a defendant's sentence is \"imposed\" or \"reimposed.\" As noted previously, appellant cites a number of Maryland cases for this proposition. As the Court of Appeals explained in no uncertain terms in\n   <em>\n    Moats v.

We have contributed to that false notion by occasionally using the term \"reimpose\" when describing the effect of the revocation ...

Hence the authority relied on by appellant has been disapproved by a subsequent decision of the Court of Appeals and carries, therefore, no weight. With appellant's premise removed, his argument collapses under its own weight. It is apparent to us that, once appellant received his 10-year partially suspended sentence, the immigration related consequences became operative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   While we make no comment about whatever other possible methods appellant may, or may not, have had to ameliorate his immigration situation, that relief was not available to him during the violation of probation proceedings. Therefore, any lack of advice about immigration consequences was irrelevant to those proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Third, we agree with the State that the Board of Immigration Appeals cases cited by appellant suggesting that a conviction, which originally had adverse immigration consequences because of the length of the sentence, can, nonetheless, become a conviction without adverse immigration consequences upon a downward modification of sentence, (1) are distinguishable from this case, and (2) are in tension with decisions from several federal circuit courts of appeal. As the State correctly pointed out, none of the cases relied upon by appellant involved a revocation of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    In re Min Song\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20173\">\n    23 I. &amp; N.

This is so because, even if appellant were 100% successful in pursuing this strategy by successfully persuading the VOP court that he was not in violation of the terms of his probation, his original sentence of ten years imprisonment with all but 18 months suspended, would remain unchanged and would still cause appellant the exact same adverse immigration consequences that he had then and currently has now.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    An \"aggravated felony\" also includes murder, rape, sexual abuse of a minor, certain acts of money laundering, certain firearms and explosive crimes, illicit trafficking in a controlled substance, theft and burglary for which the sentence was greater than one year, child pornography, certain prostitutions crimes, sabotage and treason, fraud involving a loss of greater than $10,000, and other offenses.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(43).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The parties do not seem to dispute that robbery classifies as a violent crime under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
