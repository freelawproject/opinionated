The petitioner claims that the habeas court erred in concluding that he was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel and denying his petition for certification to appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the petitioner has failed to adequately brief his claims of error, we decline to review them, and thus dismiss the petitioner's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The habeas court set forth the following relevant procedural history. \"The petitioner ... seeks habeas corpus relief from a total, effective sentence of imprisonment for twenty years and ten years special parole, imposed following a jury trial at which the petitioner was convicted of sexual assault first degree and risk of injury to a minor in a file denoted as CR-09-0151382-0; and sexual assault first degree and risk of injury to a [child] in a second file denoted CR-09-0138933-T. The latter case had been transferred to the Windham Judicial District from the Hartford Judicial District for companionized adjudication. On June 21, 2013, the Appellate Court dismissed the appeal from the judgments of conviction because no appellate brief was filed in accordance with that court's orders,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Artiaco,\n   </em>\n   AC 34962.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The amended petition sets forth ... a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"At his criminal trial, Attorney Christopher Grotz represented the petitioner, and the petitioner specifies\n   twenty ways in which trial counsel was ineffective, to wit:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"a.

Trial counsel improperly argued third-party culpabililty during his closing argument, knowing that there was no permissible inference based on the state's evidence for such argument, resulting in the appearance of impropriety before the jury through the trial court's admonition that there was no evidence that anyone other than the petitioner committed the alleged crimes.\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The habeas court summarily rejected ten of the petitioner's specifications of ineffective assistance on the ground that the petitioner provided no credible evidence to support those allegations, specifically, grounds a, b, c, i, j, k, l, m, o, and p. The habeas court addressed the petitioner's remaining allegations of ineffective assistance, explaining the factual and legal bases for each of them. The court found that the petitioner failed to prove deficient performance as to his allegations that: Grotz failed to prevent his two criminal cases from being tried together (d and e); Grotz failed to file motions in limine to prohibit Livingston and Edell from testifying about the victim's credibility and the ultimate\n   question of whether she was sexually abused (g and h); that better preparation by Grotz would have altered the trial court's ruling to preclude his expert's testimony (q and r); and Grotz's belated presentation of a third-party culpability defense during final argument amounted to a concession that the victim had been sexually abused and prompted the trial court to state, in the jury's presence, that such a defense was baseless and improper (s and t). The habeas court found that Grotz's performance was deficient in failing to file motions in limine to restrict constancy of accusation testimony (f), but that the petitioner had failed to prove that he was prejudiced by said deficiency. The court also found that the petitioner had failed to prove that he was prejudiced by Grotz's failure to retain an appropriate expert regarding the conduct of the interviews of the victim (n). The court thus denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus based upon the alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The habeas court thereafter denied certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner frames the substantive issue for our review as \"whether the habeas court erred in denying the habeas petition where trial counsel was ineffective and prejudice resulted.\" He cites to no specific claim of error by the habeas court, either in any heading or in the text of his brief. \"Ordinarily, [c]laims are inadequately briefed when they are merely mentioned and not briefed beyond a bare assertion.... Claims are also inadequately briefed when they ... consist of conclusory assertions ... with no mention of relevant authority and minimal or no citations from\n   the record ....

In fact, in his brief to this court, the petitioner fails to identify which of the habeas court's determinations he is challenging, either by way of putting headings on his arguments or addressing them in the text of his purported analysis. In his thirty-five page brief, the petitioner begins his \"argument\" on page thirty, commencing with a paragraph that exceeds two full pages in length and can only be described as a stream of consciousness condemnation of Grotz's representation of the petitioner at his criminal trial. The petitioner refers broadly and vaguely to various allegations of errors and omissions by Grotz at the petitioner's criminal trial. The pages that follow fare no better. The petitioner's \"argument\" consists only of allegations of deficient performance-both vague and conclusory-with no reference whatsoever to the habeas court's resolution of those allegations. His brief is devoid of any claim of error by the habeas court. In the absence of specific challenges to the habeas court's\n   rulings, it goes without saying that his brief is bereft of any legal analysis challenging those rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The petitioner's reply brief is a scant improvement over his initial brief. There, the petitioner focuses primarily on alleged inadequacies in the respondent's brief. Although he does make passing mention of certain alleged errors by the habeas court, he again fails to set forth, in any coherent fashion, legal or factual analyses in support of his claim that the habeas court erred in denying any aspect of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Like his initial brief, the petitioner's reply brief is riddled with incomplete and incomprehensible sentences. His briefs are a model of abstract and conclusory assertions, rendering his claims indiscernible and, thus, unreviewable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The petitioner also claimed that he was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel. The habeas court agreed, and thus restored the petitioner's appellate case,\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Artiaco,\n    </em>\n    AC 34962, to the docket for scheduling of briefs in accordance with the rules and protocols of this court. That appeal remains pending.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    See footnote 1 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    In his petition for certification to appeal, the petitioner did not specify which of the habeas court's findings or conclusions he sought to challenge on appeal. Instead, he broadly asserted that the habeas court erred in denying his claim of ineffective assistance because he had proven the claim by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
