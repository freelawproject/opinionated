See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20564\">\n    320 Conn. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 566-68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20A.3d%20729\">\n    132 A.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Specifically, the issues presented by this case are relatively case specific and discrete, given its factual and procedural posture arising from the Appellate Court's remand in\n   <em>\n    Barlow I\n   </em>\n   . We do, however, make two additional observations about this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   First, resolution of the first certified issue depends on whether the Appellate Court's remand order in\n   <em>\n    Barlow I\n   </em>\n   was a reversal\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   order of a new trial that would trigger the recusal obligation under \u00a7 51-183c. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Gagne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vaccaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071596\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/133/431/#p439\">\n    133 Conn. App. 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20A.3d%20380\">\n    35 A.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (holding that \u00a7 51-183c plainly and unambiguously required new trial judge at hearing on motions for attorney's fees on remand from Appellate Court judgment reversing in part prior fee award), rev'd on\n   other grounds,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20649\">\n    311 Conn. 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20A.3d%20196\">\n    90 A.3d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Although the interpretation of judgments is a question of law subject to plenary review; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brundage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20740\">\n    320 Conn. 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%20697\">\n    135 A.3d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ; given the posture of this case, we are reluctant to usurp the Appellate Court's authority to interpret its own rescript in\n   <em>\n    Barlow I\n   </em>\n   , which the habeas court properly determined was ambiguous on this point. See\n   <em>\n    Barlow II\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486199\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/290/#p426\">\n    166 Conn.

Accordingly, in the interest of intercourt comity, we defer to the Appellate Court's construction of its own ambiguous judgment allowing the admission of new evidence with respect to prejudice at the proceedings on remand as, in essence, a remand for a new trial requiring a new habeas judge to try the case under \u00a7 51-183c.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , supra, 320 Conn. at 567,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20A.3d%20729\">\n    132 A.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[i]n dismissing this appeal, we take no position as to the correctness of the Appellate Court's opinion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Second, and more significantly, this case highlights the need for our appellate courts, in crafting remand orders, to be cognizant of disputes that might arise over the application of \u00a7 51-183c, in particular the need for clarity and consistency between the opinion and the\n   rescript.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Appellate Court recognized; see\n   <em>\n    Barlow II\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486199\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/290/#p426\">\n    166 Conn.
