The legal representative of his estate filed a multi-count civil suit against a number of public entities and their employees, including three nurses employed by the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After joinder of issue, the nurses moved to dismiss with prejudice the counts in plaintiffs' complaint alleging professional and/or medical malpractice based on plaintiffs' failure to file a timely Affidavit of Merit (AOM) as required by the Affidavit of Merit statute, N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-26 to -29. The trial court granted the nurses' unopposed motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nearly two months later, plaintiffs, represented by substitute counsel, moved to restore the counts dismissed by the court based on the doctrine of substantial compliance and due to \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Plaintiffs' substitute counsel argued that former counsel's failure to take any action to comply with the\n   requirements of the Affidavit of Merit statute, including failing to oppose defendants'\n   motion to dismiss, constituted \"extraordinary circumstances\" warranting a dispensation from the draconian sanction of dismissal with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion and restored the counts in plaintiffs' complaint alleging professional malpractice against the nurses. The court found plaintiffs provided sufficient evidence to justify the application of the equitable doctrine of substantial compliance to relax the time restrictions of the Affidavit of Merit statute. The court also found that plaintiffs' original counsel's failure to comply with the requirements of the Affidavit of Merit statute, including his failure to oppose the nurses' motion to dismiss with prejudice the counts in the complaint alleging professional malpractice, constituted \"extraordinary circumstances,\" providing plaintiffs with an additional, independent basis for relief under the court's equitable powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By leave granted, the nurses now appeal arguing the trial court erred in finding plaintiffs established grounds to warrant relief from the time restrictions established by the Legislature in N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-27. We agree and reverse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record shows plaintiffs' original counsel failed to take any measures to comply with the clear, time-sensitive requirements of the Affidavit of Merit statute. In fact, from his earliest interactions with the judicial system, counsel behaved as if the civil complaint he prepared and filed did not raise any claims based on the tort of professional malpractice. The doctrine of substantial compliance is not applicable when the record shows a complete failure to take\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   measures to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Likewise, the equitable concept of \"extraordinary circumstances\" has never been used to relieve an attorney from the legal and ethical consequences of failing to competently perform his or her professional responsibilities. As the Supreme Court reaffirmed in its most recent, comprehensive review of the subject, an \" 'attorney inadvertence' will not, standing alone, support a finding of extraordinary circumstances[.]\"\n   <em>\n    A.T.\n   </em>\n   , 231 N.J. at 349,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460784,12491873\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/932/\">\n    175 A.3d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We are keenly aware of the seriousness of the allegations raised in this civil action. The circumstances that plaintiffs allege caused this young man's death are unimaginably horrific. Those who are found civilly liable should be held accountable. However, as established by the Legislature and recognized by the Supreme Court, \"an affidavit of merit strikes at the heart of the cause of action[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Paragon Contrs., Inc. v.

He was thereafter\n   transported to the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Facility (MCACF) where he was involved in some kind of altercation. Once in the cell, Yearby attempted to clog the toilet, requiring his removal from the cell to permit maintenance staff to enter and unclog the toilet. According to MCACF records, Yearby refused to leave the cell. An \"extraction team\" consisting of specially trained Corrections Officers physically removed Yearby from the cell; he was handcuffed,\n   restrained with a \"spit mask,\" and placed in a \"watch cell.\" The Corrections Officers involved alleged that Yearby \"was throwing feces and urine from his cell toilet, while yelling 'I'll kill all y'all when I get out of here.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We describe what allegedly occurred next by quoting directly from the trial judge's letter-opinion dated September 16, 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   After the extraction, Mr. Yearby was placed in an inmate restraint chair at approximately 7:25 PM and was placed in the care of the facilit[y's] nursing staff. Defendant [Angela] Ward, the nurse on duty[,] stated that they checked on Mr. Yearby in 15-minute intervals. Watch records indicate that [d]efendant Ward conducted her last check on Mr. Yearby at approximately 3:15 AM on November 2, 2014, however the [c]ourt notes that the times recorded appear to have been written over and the original time listed on that entry appears to be 2:55 AM ... At 3:23 AM a \"Code Blue\" alert was called because Mr. Yearby appeared unresponsive and EMTs were called.... The Middlesex County Medical Examiner later determined the cause of death to be \"blunt force trauma of head and neck with cervical fracture and spinal cord injury\" but was unable to identify the manner of death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 29, 2015, the Estate of David Eric Yearby and Veronica Yearby individually and as Administratrix of the Estate filed a complaint and demanded trial by jury against nineteen individually named defendants, including Registered Nurses Gideon Thuo and Angela Ward and Licensed Practical Nurse Nicole Tuesday. All three of these defendants were employees of the MCACF. Plaintiffs' complaint contained a total of thirteen numbered counts and named all nineteen defendants as civilly liable. Counts I to IV alleged violations of the New Jersey Civil Rights Act, N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 to -2, predicated on defendants' \"special relationship\" to and interactions with decedent as an inmate. Counts V alleged negligence under the Tort Claims Act (TCA), N.J.S.A. 59:1-1 to 12-3. Count VI alleged negligent failure to train; Count VII alleged a gross neglect and a deviation of the standard of care owed to decedent as a \"mentally disabled\" individual; and Count VIII alleged negligent supervision and negligent hiring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs do not make any specific allegations against defendants Thuo and Ward until Count IX. Plaintiffs allege that Thuo \"represented to [decedent], [d]efendant Middlesex County, and the\n   general public that he devoted his full time and professional attention to the use and employment of those skills, and, applied the skills, judgment and expertise to the medical needs of the general public and of the [decedent] in particular.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs further allege that nurse Thuo provided \"improper nursing care\" that resulted in \"damages suffered\" by decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to defendant-nurse Ward, plaintiffs allege she performed \"improper nursing care\" that caused decedent to suffer\n   damages. Plaintiffs also claim that defendant Ward was negligent, careless, and was not \"adequately trained in nursing care, and care for an inmate in an inmate restraint chair.\" Defendant Ward also \"[f]ail[ed] to conform with recognized standards of care, exercised by nurses in the same specialty and the same area[.]\" Plaintiffs allege that these collective acts and omissions by defendant Ward \"constitute negligence and/or carelessness and/or recklessness[,]\" as may become apparent through \"discovery.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The allegations against defendant Nicole Tuesday, a licensed practical nurse (LPN) are reflected in Count XI of plaintiffs' complaint. Plaintiffs allege that defendant Tuesday provided decedent with \"improper nursing care\" resulting in damages. Counts XII alleges \"willful disregard\" against all of the nineteen named defendants; Count XIII is based on the Wrongful Death Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:31-1 to -6, and again names all defendants. In the Civil Case Information Statement (CIS) filed contemporaneously with the complaint, plaintiffs' counsel checked \"No\" in response to the question: \"Is this a professional malpractice case?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 20, 2016, defendants Thuo, Ward, and Tuesday filed an answer to plaintiffs' complaint denying any civil liability for the injuries suffered by decedent while in the custody of the MCACF and asserted twenty-five affirmative defenses. Of particular relevance\n   to the issue raised in this appeal, affirmative defense fifteen asserts: \"that [p]laintiff has failed to file an appropriate Affidavit of Merit for claims of professional negligence against [d]efendants Angela Ward, RN (Registered Nurse), Nicole Tuesday, LPN (Licensed Practical Nurse), and Gideon Thuo, RN (Registered Nurse), licensed persons pursuant to New Jersey Statutes, N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-26, et seq. and applicable case law.\" In the CIS, defendants responded \"Yes\" to the question: \"Is this a professional malpractice case?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-27, \"within 60 days following the date of filing of the answer to the complaint by the defendant,\" plaintiffs were required to provide each defendant \"with an affidavit of an appropriate licensed person that there exists a reasonable probability that the care, skill or knowledge exercised or exhibited in the treatment, practice or work that is the subject of the complaint, fell outside acceptable professional or occupational standards or treatment practices.\" Here, to meet this first statutory deadline, plaintiffs were required to file and serve defendants with an appropriate AOM from a registered nurse by March 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-27 authorizes the trial court to grant \"no more than one additional period, not to exceed 60 days, to file the affidavit pursuant to this section, upon a finding of good cause.\" Thus, had plaintiffs sought such an extension of time and assuming the trial court would have found \"good cause\" for granting it, plaintiffs were required to file and serve defendants with an appropriate AOM by no later than May 19, 2016. Here, it is undisputed that plaintiffs' counsel did not make any effort to comply with the mandate of the Affidavit of Merit statute within the timeframe established by the Legislature in N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-27. It is also undisputed that the trial court did not make any\n   effort to\n   conduct a\n   <em>\n    Ferreira\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   conference prior to the expiration of the initial sixty-day statutory period, nor at any time thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In a letter dated June 6, 2016, plaintiff Veronica Yearby informed her original counsel, who represented her individually and in her capacity as Executrix of the Estate of David Yearby, that she had retained substitute counsel to represent plaintiffs \"in connection with a lawsuit\" filed against all of the named defendants in this case. On June 13, 2016, original counsel signed a Substitution of Attorney withdrawing as plaintiffs' counsel of record in this case. Substitute counsel signed the same document confirming her appearance as superseding attorney. However, substitute counsel's signature is not dated. By letter dated June 17, 2016, substitute counsel filed the Substitution of Attorney with the Clerk of the Middlesex County Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On June 20, 2016, defendants Thuo, Ward, and Tuesday filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the counts in plaintiffs' complaint alleging professional malpractice for failure to comply with the requirements of the Affidavit of Merit statute. In an order dated July 8, 2016, the trial court granted defendants' unopposed motion to dismiss with prejudice \"with respect to any and all claims of professional negligence/medical malpractice[.]\" In a transmittal letter dated July 11, 2016, defendants' counsel served plaintiffs' counsel with a copy of the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By letter dated July 11, 2016, substitute counsel apprised the Middlesex County Civil Assignment Office that she \"had recently been retained\" to represent plaintiffs in this case. She also enclosed a copy of the fully executed substitution of counsel document and noted that her office had \"recently received the file from the previous attorney.\" She requested that the court conduct \"a case management conference in this matter so we can prepare the\n   case properly.\" In a form response entitled \"Response to Case Management Request\" dated July 14, 2016, the Court Services Officer placed an \"X\" next to the fifth \"DENIED\" category that stated: \"There is a pending motion to dismiss for failure to provide discovery[.]\" No other comments or explanations were included.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In an email dated July 12, 2016, defendants' counsel forwarded to substitute counsel discovery material previously provided to plaintiffs' original counsel. Defense counsel asked substitute counsel to consider this gesture as \"the good faith attempt of these defendants to obtain compliance and avoid further motion practice.\" On July 25, 2016, thirteen days after this email, defendant-nurses moved to dismiss without prejudice the remaining counts of plaintiffs' complaint as a discovery sanction under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:23-5(a)(1), for plaintiffs' failure to provide discovery requested on December 5, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The next significant procedural event occurred on August 18, 2016. On this date, a law firm entered its appearance as additional counsel of record for plaintiffs in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' new counsel advised defendants' counsel that \"[m]oving forward, kindly copy [new counsel] on all correspondence in this matter.\" On August 31, 2016,\n   plaintiffs filed a motion pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:50-1(f) to reinstate the counts in the complaint alleging professional malpractice that were dismissed with prejudice on July 8, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   An attorney with the law firm that made up plaintiffs' new legal team submitted a certification in support of the motion to restore plaintiffs' complaint that contains sixty-seven numbered paragraphs. In a section denoted \"PLEADINGS,\" this attorney acknowledged that defendants Ward, Tuesday, and Thuo filed an answer to plaintiffs' complaint on January 20, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the section labeled \"[ORIGINAL COUNSEL'S] GROSS NEGLIGENCE/BLATANT MISCONDUCT,\" substitute counsel\n   describes what, in his judgment, are multiple examples of professional negligence committed by plaintiffs' original counsel in the prosecution of this civil action. With respect to defendant-nurses, substitute counsel acknowledges that on June 20, 2016, original counsel received the notice of motion to dismiss with prejudice the counts alleging professional negligence based on plaintiffs' failure to comply with the Affidavit of Merit statute. New counsel claims that on June 21, 2016, plaintiffs' new legal team conducted a conference call with original counsel \"to discuss all aspects of the within matter.\" According to substitute counsel: \"During that conference call, [original counsel] did not advise [substitute counsels] of [d]efendants Ward, Tuesday, and Thuo's Motion to Dismiss [p]laintiffs' professional negligence/medical malpractice claims with prejudice.\" Substitute counsel alleges that on July 11, 2016, original counsel emailed the new legal team a copy of the court's July 8, 2016 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the section of the certification labeled \"ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE [PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL COUNSEL'S] GROSS NEGLIGENCE/MISCONDUCT,\" the new counsel describes how they conducted \"a joint, in-depth review of the file to assess original counsel's shortcomings in representing [p]laintiffs in the within matter.\" From this point forward, substitute counsel devotes the bulk of the certification to describing how original counsel failed to contact the physician who performed decedent's autopsy and failed to review the evidence in the possession of the Medical Examiner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In this section of his certification, substitute counsel mentions defendant-nurses only once. In paragraph sixty-five, substitute counsel states: \"On or about August 31, 2016, [p]laintiffs obtained an Affidavit of Merit from Jennifer Graney, RN, BSN, LNCC. (A copy of the Affidavit of Merit is attached[.] ).\" Graney's AOM dated August 31, 2016 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   1.

The motion judge issued a letter-opinion explaining his reasons for granting plaintiffs' motion on October 24, 2016. As framed by the judge, the issue was whether plaintiffs were entitled to equitable relief from the 120-day time restriction in N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-27. The judge\n   correctly noted that he had the authority to grant equitable relief from the strict enforcement of the Affidavit of Merit statute in cases where there are \"extraordinary circumstances\" or a showing of \"substantial compliance\" with the statutory mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We will first review the trial court's analysis based on the doctrine of substantial compliance.
