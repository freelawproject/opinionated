The principal vehicle of abuse was the giving preemptively and\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   by the trial judge of an \"anti-CSI effect\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   instruction to the jury, which had the now asserted effect of relieving the State of meeting its high burden of proof. As a result, he maintains that the instruction invaded the province of the jury and deprived him of a fair trial. Moreover, the trial judge abused his discretion further by \"coercing the jury to come to a verdict,\" and by relying impermissibly on certain considerations in sentencing Taylor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellee, the State of Maryland, responds that Taylor failed to preserve properly his challenge to the CSI effect jury instruction because his objection \"failed to state distinctly the matter to which he objected and the grounds of the objection,\" as required by Md. Rule 4-325(e). Furthermore, the State maintains that the trial judge adhered to the language of the Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions (MPJI) when instructing the jury regarding the unanimity requirement, and sentenced properly Taylor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the end of the day, although we shall hold that the trial judge abused his discretion in propounding to the jury the CSI effect instruction, the error was harmless, beyond a reasonable doubt, on this record. Moreover, we hold that Taylor waived his challenge to the trial judge's continuing deliberation instruction to the jury. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering evidence of Taylor's adult and juvenile records during sentencing. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following evidence was adduced by the State at trial. On the morning of 13 June 2008, the victim was alone in her apartment in Salisbury. At approximately 1:00 a.m., someone knocked on her front door. She opened the door \"just a crack\" and saw a nude man masturbating, while standing to the left on her patio and looking at, but not facing directly, her. As she was shutting the door, the man tried unsuccessfully to push his way in. The victim locked the door and dialed 9-1-1. The man broke the lock on the door and entered the apartment. He wore only a t-shirt hanging around his neck, which he pulled over the lower part of his face upon entering the apartment. The shirt, according to the victim, fell to his neck and revealed his full face during the encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The victim ran to her kitchen and retrieved a 12-inch knife. The man approached her and \"grabbed or touched her arm\" holding the knife. She was able to twist her arm free, which, in the process, caused the knife to make contact with the intruder,\n   without inflicting apparent injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim was able to see clearly the man's face because her living room lights, and possibly her kitchen lights, were on during the encounter in the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The man backed-off when the knife touched him. Then, he noticed the victim's purse on the kitchen counter. He seized the purse, containing the victim's wallet, and fled the apartment. The victim testified that the incident lasted \"three to four minutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Baker arrived at the scene at 1:03 a.m., shortly after the man fled. He observed \"golf-ball sized holes or dents\" in the victim's apartment door. The victim told Officer Baker that the intruder was \"medium skinned with no tattoos or scars, and that he had a grey t-shirt around his neck.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officer did not seize the knife from the crime scene for forensic testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later, Detective Corporal Richard Kaiser became the lead investigator regarding the incident. During his review of the police case file compiled to that point, he noticed that the apartment door had not been processed for fingerprints or the holes/dents photographed. Detective Kaiser contacted the property manager for the apartment complex and learned that a maintenance person had replaced the victim's door, moving her former door to another apartment in the complex. He went to the location of the \"suspect\" door and dusted its knob for prints. No usable fingerprints were recovered. Detective Kaiser noted also that the door had several large \"golf ball size[d]\" dents in it. He too did not seize the victim's kitchen knife\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for forensic examination nor attempt to secure any fingerprints from inside the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 12 July 2008, one month after the incident, Detective Scott Elliott requested the victim look at a photo array to see if she could identify anyone as the person who exposed himself to and robbed her. She identified Taylor after \"4 seconds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State charged Taylor in the circuit court with first, third, and fourth-degree burglary, attempted second-degree rape, robbery, second-degree assault, indecent exposure, malicious destruction of property, and theft less than $100. At the close of the evidence at his trial, during jury instructions, the following occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [The Court to the jury]: There is no legal requirement that the State offer scientific evidence as part of its case, such as DNA, fingerprinting, blood typing, fiber analysis, hair follicle analysis, or anything of that nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [At the close of all instructions]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [The Court to counsel]: Any additions or exceptions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Taylor's Counsel]: We would except, [y]our Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [The Court]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Taylor's Counsel]: Your honor, I would just except to the Court's scientific evidence instruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [The Court]: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The jury convicted Taylor of all charges, save attempted second-degree rape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court \"sentenced [Taylor] to [seventeen] years for count one, first-degree burglary; ten years for count four, robbery; and three years for count seven, indecent exposure. The sentences were to run consecutively, for a total of [thirty] years executed time. The remaining convictions merged.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   No appeal was filed timely. Appellant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for post-conviction relief on 9 June 2016, alleging that his trial\n   attorney's performance was ineffective and prejudiced Taylor's rights by failing to \"file both a notice of appeal and an application for review of his sentence by a three-judge panel.\" On 1 December 2016, Taylor's recently-acquired post-conviction public defender (joined by the State and accepted by the circuit court) entered into \"a consent order that [among other forms of relief] allowed [Taylor] to file a belated notice of appeal [from his 2008 conviction] and [an] application for review of his [2008] sentence in exchange for waiving his right to pursue any further post-conviction relief.\" Accordingly, Taylor filed, on 29 December 2016, a Notice of Appeal. This is the posture in which the matter reaches us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this appeal, Appellant frames the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   I. Did the trial court err when propounding to the jury an anti-CSI effect instruction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   II. Did the trial court commit reversible error by coercing the jury to come to a verdict; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   III. Did the trial court consider evidence impermissibly in sentencing Taylor to thirty years executed time where the sentencing guidelines called for 1-5 years?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The CSI Effect Jury Instruction.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Argument.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Taylor maintains that the trial judge committed reversible error when,\n   <em>\n    over Taylor's objection\n   </em>\n   , he propounded preemptively and spontaneously a CSI effect instruction to the jury. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Stabb v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703632\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/423/454/\">\n    423 Md. 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703632\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/423/454/\">\n    31 A.3d 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) and\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700387\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/421/434/\">\n    421 Md. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700387\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/421/434/\">\n    26 A.3d 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), Taylor asserts that the trial judge's CSI effect jury instruction invaded the province of the jury, relieved the State of its burden of proof, and deprived Taylor of his right to a fair trial. Although Taylor's trial occurred in 2008 (before the Court of Appeals decided\n   <em>\n    Stabb\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   ), the case is before us as a belated appeal from his convictions because of the consent order granting his post-conviction petition, which transmogrified the proceeding into a direct appeal from the final judgment entered\n   by the circuit court in December 2008.\n   <em>\n    Stabb\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   , therefore, should compel us to hold that the instruction administered here was an abuse of the trial court's discretion, based either on a contemporary application to this appeal of the CSI effect cases decided after Taylor's 2008 trial or a retrospective application of that case law, as permitted by\n   <em>\n    Allen v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3995803\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/204/701/\">\n    204 Md. App. 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3995803\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/204/701/\">\n    42 A.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In response to the State's non-preservation argument, Taylor protests that he preserved the CSI effect jury instruction issue by objecting timely to the court's scientific evidence instruction. Taylor\n   urges, alternatively, that should we hold inadequate his objection as not in strict compliance with Md. Rule 4-325(e), we ought to hold his effort sufficient to have complied substantially with the rule. If all else fails, Taylor asserts that we should consider his contention under plain error review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Appellee's Arguments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The State argues that Taylor failed to preserve his objection to the CSI effect jury instruction for appellate review. Under Md. Rule 4-325(e), Taylor was obliged to \"state[ ] distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\" Taylor fell short of that mark because he offered the trial court no explication of the grounds for his objection to the CSI effect jury instruction. Moreover, substantial compliance with Md. Rule 4-325(e) by making only a general objection cannot be adequate because, at the time of Taylor's trial, the trial judge did not have the benefit of the holdings and reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Stabb\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   to appreciate that what he did may not have been appropriate on the trial record before him. Thus, \"it is unfair to hold the trial court to that standard, when under\n   <em>\n    Evans v. State\n   </em>\n   [,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116362\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/174/549/\">\n    174 Md.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Allen v. State\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to our analysis of this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The State contends finally that, even if this Court were to find the CSI effect jury instruction challenge preserved, the error, if any, was harmless. The complained-about missing forensic evidence, i.e., Taylor's DNA or fingerprints linking him to the crime scene, was not essential to the State's case-in-chief meeting the standard of guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Preservation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Maryland Rule 4-325(e), governing objections to jury instructions, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This rule \"makes clear that an objection to a jury instruction is not preserved for review unless the aggrieved party makes a timely objection after the instruction is given\n   <em>\n    and states the specific ground of objection thereto\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Gore v.

While \"general\" objections may be sufficient to preserve appellate arguments in some contexts, i.e., the admissibility of evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 4-323(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Md. Rule 4-325(e) requires a distinct\n   and specific objection to a jury instruction to preserve the challenge for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newcomb v.

The principal reason for this standard is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   to enable the trial court to correct any inadvertent error or omission in the oral charge, as well as to limit the review on appeal to those errors which are brought to the trial court's attention.' In this manner, the trial judge is afforded 'an opportunity to amend or supplement his charge if he deems an amendment necessary.' Succinctly put, then, the rule is designed to afford the trial judge and opposing counsel ample opportunity to be informed of the nature and grounds of the exception.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Sergeant Co. v.

Thus, we must hold that Taylor's objection failed to comply strictly with Md. Rule 4-325(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Taylor's first fallback position is that we should find his challenge preserved nonetheless under the standard of substantial compliance with the rule.

As the court stated, the record clearly demonstrates that defendants counsel failed to object to the instruction at issue during the proceedings, and further that the defendant's failure to raise such issue in the trial court precludes us from such consideration on appeal. Despite holding that the issue was waived, the intermediate\n   appellate court engaged in a legal analysis of the issue, which was therefore not authoritative or essential in the determination of the case. Further, unlike the case at hand, the missing evidence in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   , i.e., photographic or video evidence of the drug transaction, was not of critical importance to the case. Instead, the State relied on the eyewitness testimony and identification of two detectives directly involved in the transaction. The failure of police to provide additional evidence was therefore not a crucial issue, despite the defense argument that such evidence could possibly have served to bolster the State's case in order to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt ... Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   where the non-existent evidence, pictures or video of the transaction, were\n   supplemental evidence which would have supported the eye witness accounts, the evidence lacking here could have been direct evidence to affirmatively linking the knife introduced to the alleged assaults .... Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   , defense counsel gave \"robust and vehement closing argument\" in addition to extensive cross-examination on the issue of the failure of police to record the transaction ....

Basically, the instruction directed the jury to ignore the fact that the State had not presented evidence connecting the knife to the crime, implying that the lack of such evidence is not necessary or relevant to the determination of guilt, and to disregard any argument by defense to the contrary.

This Court should decline to review, under plain error, Taylor's appellate challenge on this point. Taylor \"failed to demonstrate that the trial [judge] erred\" when admonishing the jury with this instruction. The State argues that the trial judge's instruction was substantially similar to the MPJI-CR 2:01, and did not \"alter the spirit or substance of the pattern instruction.\" Taylor, therefore, failed to demonstrate \"that the error was 'plain' or that it was egregious[ ] in light of the instructions as a whole.
