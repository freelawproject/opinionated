The plaintiffs also claim that the court erred in finding that the defendant fully complied with the requirements of \u00a7 14-60 (a), resulting in its protection from liability to the plaintiffs. We disagree, and, accordingly, affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts, as set forth in the defendant's memoranda of law in support of its motions for summary judgment and in the plaintiffs' memoranda of law in opposition to summary judgment, are undisputed. On May 9, 2013, Luis Martins and his father, Jorge Martins, purchased a 2013 Hyundai Veloster automobile from the defendant. Because the defendant had\n   not received the automobile manufacturer's certificate of origin, the parties could not complete the transfer of Luis Martins' motor vehicle registration from his previous vehicle, a 2007 Jeep Wrangler vehicle, to the new vehicle. The defendant loaned a dealer number plate to Luis Martins while the registration process was pending. The defendant and Luis Martins signed the loan agreement at approximately 7 p.m. on May 9, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 8, 2013, at approximately 3 p.m., Luis Martins, while driving the Hyundai Veloster automobile, was involved in a motor vehicle accident in Danbury. As a result of the accident, his passengers, Lindsey Beale, Casey Leigh Rutter and Jason Ferreira sustained traumatic injuries; Beale died from her injuries. At the time of the accident, the Hyundai Veloster automobile displayed the dealer number plate belonging to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In separately filed complaints, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant owned or controlled the automobile driven by Luis Martins and was, therefore, liable for any damages resulting from the June 8, 2013 accident. On February 17, 2015, the defendant filed a substantially\n   similar motion for summary judgment in each case, asserting that it was not liable to any of the plaintiffs because the accident occurred \"twenty-nine days and [twenty] hours after the plates were loaned out, and thus well within the thirty day period of time required by Connecticut law.\" Attached as evidence in support of its motion, the defendant included an affidavit from William Sabatini, the chief financial officer of the defendant; a temporary insurance identification card issued to the Martins by Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company for the Hyundai Veloster automobile with an effective date of May 9, 2013; an insurance declaration page for that automobile; copies of the Martins' drivers' licenses; a registration certificate and insurance identification card for Luis Martins' previous vehicle; a completed department of motor vehicles registration form for the 2013 Hyundai Veloster automobile signed by the Martins and dated May 9, 2013; purchase and finance documents relating to the sale of the 2013 Hyundai Veloster automobile, including a manufacturer's certificate of origin dated April 15, 2013; and the signed loan agreement. The plaintiffs filed a substantially similar memorandum of law in each of the cases in opposition to the motions for summary judgment, claiming, inter alia, that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether the defendant complied with the requirements of \u00a7 14-60 (a), and that the period of the loan agreement exceeded the thirty day time limit set forth in \u00a7 14-60 (a) (3). The sole evidence attached to their opposition memoranda was a transcript excerpt from Sabatini's January 6, 2015 deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 27, 2015, the court issued a memorandum of decision rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendant in each of the cases. The court found that the defendant \"satisfied its obligations pursuant to [ \u00a7 14-60 ] in that the Martins provided proof of valid insurance coverage during the dates of May 9, 2013,\n   and June 19, 2013,\" and that the Martins \"had possession of the loaner vehicle for [twenty-nine] days and [twenty] hours at the time of the accident as they were awaiting the pending registration for the new vehicle.\" Accordingly, the court concluded that the defendant complied with \u00a7 14-60 and was protected from liability for the accident. These consolidated appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first set forth our standard governing review of a trial court's decision to grant a motion for summary judgment. \" Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49 ] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and\n   any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law ... and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact....

Because \u00a7 14-60 (a) (3) limits the temporary loan of a dealer number plate to \"not more than thirty days in any year,\" the plaintiffs maintain that the defendant is liable to them because the Hyundai Veloster automobile displayed the dealer number plate when the accident occurred on June 8, 2013, which they allege was the thirty-first day after the loan of the plate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[ Section 14-60 ] reflects the legislative effort to protect the public from reckless driving of loaned motor vehicles....

The accident occurred at approximately 3 p.m. on June 8, 2013. Depending on the method used to calculate the thirty day period set forth in \u00a7 14-60 (a), the accident occurred within or beyond the thirty day period. For example, if, as the plaintiffs argue, May 9, 2013, the date of the execution of the loan agreement, is included as the first day of the thirty day period, the accident occurred on the thirty-first day after such execution. If May 9, 2013, is not included as one of the thirty days, however, and the first day of the thirty day period begins on May 10, 2013, as the defendant argues, the accident would have occurred on the thirtieth day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that the parties intended for the loan of the dealer number plate to begin on May 9, 2013, and that common sense dictates that insurance coverage began the moment the vehicle left the defendant's lot. Specifically, the plaintiffs posit that by excluding May 9, 2013 in the counting of the thirty day period, \"if the borrowing driver were to crash while driving off the lot or later that same day, then [ \u00a7 14-60 ] would not protect the dealer because the loan would not yet have begun.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) As\n   evidence in support of the parties' intent, the plaintiffs submitted a transcript excerpt from Sabatini's deposition, in which he stated that May 9 was the first day of the Martins' loan period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court determined that the plaintiffs' argument that \"the court must accept the first date\" is \"contrary to [our] case law ....\" Nevertheless, the court noted, even if it accepted, arguendo, the plaintiffs' argument, and used twenty-four hour periods beginning from 7 p.m. on May 9, 2013, to calculate the thirty day period, \"the [Martins] had possession of the loaner vehicle for [no more than] [twenty-nine] days and [twenty] hours at the time of the accident ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We agree with the court that the accident did not occur more than thirty days after the execution of the loan agreement even if the thirty day period set forth in \u00a7 14-60 (a) began at approximately 7 p.m. on May 9, 2013. The only way for the thirty day period set forth in \u00a7 14-60 (a) to have expired before June 8, 2013, the date of the accident, was if the five hours remaining in the day after the execution of the loan agreement at approximately 7 p.m. on May 9, 2013, were counted as one full day, and no relevant Connecticut precedent was offered by the plaintiffs in support of this approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 14-60 (a) (3) provides in relevant part that \"[n]o dealer or repairer may loan a motor vehicle or number plate ... for not more than thirty days in any year ....\" It appears that neither the computation method nor the interpretation of the phrase \"not more than thirty days\" contained in \u00a7 14-60 (a) (3) has been previously discussed by our appellate courts. We are mindful that \"[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language; and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.

The plaintiffs additionally claim that since the vehicle registration process was not completed until June 10, 2013, because the registration was not \"pending,\" as required by \u00a7 14-60 (a) (3), until two days after the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With respect to the plaintiffs' first claim, there is nothing in \u00a7 14-60 (a) that requires a written selection of one of the three statutory options, each of which contemplates the use of dealer number plates on vehicles for a limited duration. In this case, it is not disputed that the dealer number plate was going to be displayed on the new automobile that the Martins had purchased, and not on a vehicle to be used by them while their\n   vehicle was being serviced, or on a vehicle being demonstrated to them. Additionally, with respect to the use of a dealer number plate pursuant to \u00a7 14-60 (a), it is clear that this statute is intended both to encourage dealers to ensure that the customer has insurance coverage; see\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Collins Chevrolet, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"535640\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/199/245/#p249\">\n    199 Conn. at 250-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=506%20A.2d%201035\">\n    506 A.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; which requirement was indisputably satisfied in this case, and to encourage the user of the dealer number plate to drive with care.

We, however, do not accept the plaintiffs' narrow interpretation of that statute, which would permit the loan of dealer number plates only for new pending registrations of purchased vehicles and not for the transfer of registrations between vehicles in connection with a purchase of a new vehicle. In other words, to accept the plaintiffs' interpretation and limit \u00a7 14-60 (a) (3) only to new registrations would mean that any purchaser of a motor vehicle from a dealership who also trades in a vehicle or transfers the number plates from an old vehicle to a new vehicle, would not be able to borrow a dealer number plate while the registration process was pending. \"The purpose of [ \u00a7 14-60 ] is to make effective the statutory provision to require the registration of motor vehicles and to prevent avoidance thereof.... It was not intended that others, under cover of the general number or distinguishing mark of\n   the dealer, should be able to operate cars belonging to or controlled by themselves.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baron Motors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1738601\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-cir-ct/2/378/#p381\">\n    2 Conn.

Simply put, the statute permits the loan of dealer number plates, for a limited time, to a person who purchased a vehicle from the dealer, while waiting for that vehicle to be registered with the department of motor vehicles, or otherwise pending the registration process. The circumstances of the present case are akin to\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Collins Chevrolet, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"535640\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/199/245/#p249\">\n    199 Conn. at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=506%20A.2d%201035\">\n    506 A.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where in that case, the dealer loaned a dealer number plate to the purchaser of a truck while the registration for the truck was pending. The truck owner was involved in an accident within the time period permitted under \u00a7 14-60 (a) (3) and the truck owner subsequently registered the truck in his own name two days after the accident.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=506%20A.2d%201035\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court did not err in concluding that the defendant met its burden in demonstrating that the parties to the loan agreement intended for the defendant to loan the dealer number plate for up to thirty days while the registration was pending because of the missing certificate of origin for the newly purchased vehicle. The defendant complied with the requirements of \u00a7 14-60 (a) by obtaining proof of insurance from the Martins for that period of time. As discussed in part I of this opinion, the accident occurred within that time period. The plaintiffs have not demonstrated the existence of any genuine issues of material fact that contradict the defendant's compliance with \u00a7 14-60 (a). Although the parties failed to designate on the loan agreement form, via a check in a box, the specific category of the loan, the undisputed evidence submitted in support of the motions for summary judgment was that the Martins did not borrow the dealer number plate to test drive a vehicle nor did they have a vehicle undergoing repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   There are no other relevant factors that would raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the defendant's\n   compliance with \u00a7 14-60.

Pursuant to our precedent as discussed in this opinion, \u00a7 14-60 (a) (3) provides for thirty full days of use of a dealer number plate, even if it means that the total time of use exceeds thirty days by some amount of time less than a full day.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The statute also provided that a bill of sale had to be filed for record at least fourteen days prior to the sale.

See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 14-274 (prohibiting commercial drivers from operating motor vehicle if they have been on duty \"more than sixteen hours in the aggregate in any twenty-four-hour period\"); General Statutes \u00a7 14-382 (owners of snowmobiles or all-terrain vehicles required to file change of address with commissioner \"[w]ithin forty-eight hours\").

The statutory requirement is that the plate be used \"not more than thirty days in any year.\" It can be reasonably inferred, therefore, that a dealer may loan a dealer number plate in fewer than thirty day increments, so long as the total loan period does not cumulate to more than thirty days in any year. It would add complexity to record keeping, for example, if dealerships had to maintain precise records of loan periods for fractional or partial days, e. g., by hours or minutes. If the legislature had intended to permit fractional hourly or minute counting of the time period, the statute would more likely have stated the time period in hours and/or minutes instead of days.
