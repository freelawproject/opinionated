Frye (collectively, the Estate) entered by the Superior Court (Penobscot County,\n   <em>\n    Anderson, J.\n   </em>\n   ) on the Estate's action seeking enforcement of a property insurance contract for the loss of a dwelling by fire. MMG contends that the court erred by interpreting Carroll's insurance contract with MMG as providing coverage to the Estate, notwithstanding the Estate's lack of any insurable interest in the property after Carroll's death. We agree with MMG and vacate the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Viewed in the light most favorable to MMG, as the nonprevailing party, the summary judgment record establishes the following undisputed facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Mason v. Amica Mut. Ins.

Frye and Thelma Frye executed a deed conveying their residence in Eddington to their sons, Curtis and Daryl, but reserving a life estate in the property for themselves. Thelma died in 2013. After Thelma's death, Carroll purchased homeowner's insurance from MMG\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the \"residence premises\" for the period from August 12, 2013, to August 12, 2014. The policy defined the \"insured\" as \"[y]ou and residents of your household who are ... [y]our relatives ... or ... [o]ther persons under the age of 21 and in the care of any person named above.\" Carroll was the only named insured on the policy and the only resident of the property; neither Curtis nor Daryl had lived on the property for decades, and neither was ever added to the policy as a named insured. The policy also contained a death clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Death\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   If any person named in the Declarations or the spouse, if a resident of the same household, dies, the following apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   We insure the legal representative of the deceased but only with respect to the premises and property of the deceased covered under the policy at the time of death; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   \"Insured\" includes:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n   </strong>\n   An \"insured\" who is a member of your household at the time of your death, but only while a resident of the \"residence premises\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n   With respect to your property, the person having proper temporary custody of the property until appointment and qualification of a legal representative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Carroll died on January 8, 2014. Six weeks later, on February 25, 2014, there was a fire on the property. Curtis and Daryl were appointed personal representatives of the Estate on April 23, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 5] MMG paid the Estate's claim for loss of personal property from the fire but denied coverage for the dwelling itself. MMG cancelled the policy on August 12, 2014, and retained the entire premium collected for the 2013 to 2014 policy term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 6] The Estate-through Curtis and Daryl as personal representatives-and Curtis and Daryl as individuals filed a complaint against MMG on December 22, 2015, alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment that the loss of the dwelling from the fire is covered by the MMG policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 7] MMG and the Estate each moved for a summary judgment on both counts. The court granted the Estate's motion as to both counts and denied MMG's motion. The court concluded that Curtis and Daryl, as Carroll's only children, qualified as Carroll's \"legal representatives\" according to the policy's death clause and therefore had the right to enforce the policy. The court also determined that MMG was estopped from asserting that the Estate lacked sufficient interest in the property to enforce the policy because MMG's conduct misled Carroll regarding the scope of coverage and Carroll justifiably relied on that misleading conduct. Based on this determination, the court declared that Carroll's policy with MMG covered the loss of the dwelling from the fire that occurred after Carroll's death. MMG appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 8] MMG challenges the court's entry of a summary judgment in favor of the Estate. We review the supported facts in the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to MMG, as the nonprevailing party, to determine de novo if any genuine issue of material fact exists for trial and whether, based on the undisputed facts, the Estate was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Mason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323490\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/158/495/\">\n    2017 ME 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323490\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/158/495/\">\n    158 A.3d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the parties do not dispute the material facts; this appeal depends entirely upon the application and interpretation of the insurance policy as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Insurance coverage is enforceable when two conditions are met. The first condition is contractual, i.e., the claimed loss must fall within the scope of an executed policy.\n   <em>\n    Harlor v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/\">\n    2016 ME 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/\">\n    150 A.3d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 10] The second condition is statutory. Pursuant to 24-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2406 (2017), insurance coverage is enforceable only when the claimant has an insurable interest in the insured property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   No contract of insurance of property or of any interest in property or arising from property shall be enforceable as to the insurance except for the benefit of persons having an insurable interest in the things insured as at the time of the loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   \"Insurable interest\" as used in this section means any actual, lawful, and substantial economic interest in the safety or preservation of the subject of the insurance free from loss, destruction,\n   or pecuniary damage or impairment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The requirement of an insurable interest is central to the purpose of insurance generally, which is to indemnify the insured against his or her own pecuniary loss.\n   <em>\n    Getchell v.

Carroll\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 11] There is no dispute that Carroll would have satisfied both conditions if the house had been damaged while he was alive. He and MMG executed a contract that covered the dwelling in Eddington for the period from August 12, 2013, to August 12, 2014, in which Carroll was the sole insured (both as the named insured and the sole resident of the dwelling).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 12] Carroll also had an insurable interest in the Eddington property that was the subject of the policy. Pursuant to the 1994 deed, Carroll reserved a life estate in the property when he deeded a remainder interest in the property to Curtis and Daryl (the remaindermen), but retained a possessory interest as a life tenant, allowing him to possess the property until his death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   33 M.R.S. \u00a7 101 (2017) (stating that \"an interest which must terminate not later than the death of one or more persons is a 'life estate' even though it may terminate at an earlier time\");\n   <em>\n    Watson v.

By its plain terms, the death clause sets out who can stand in Carroll's shoes to act on behalf of the\n   <em>\n    Estate\n   </em>\n   -as the insured decedent-in the enforcement of the policy as to the\n   <em>\n    Estate's\n   </em>\n   property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The death clause does not apply to property that is not part of the Estate, and\n   because Carroll had only a life estate in the dwelling, the dwelling was never part of the Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b6 19] In short, although any covered property in Carroll's Estate remained insured after Carroll's death according to the terms of the death clause, the Estate had no insurable interest in the real property by operation of the established black-letter law of life estates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20A.2d%20684\">\n    271 A.2d at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is this distinction that underlies MMG's agreement to pay on the policy for the loss of Carroll's personal property within the dwelling. That personal property was not part of the life estate, it therefore did become part of Carroll's Estate upon Carroll's death, and the Estate was thus able to enforce Carroll's policy as to that personal property. In the absence of such an insurable interest, the Estate-including Curtis and Daryl, whether as heirs or as personal representatives-is barred by section 2406 from enforcing the policy as to the dwelling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   2.

From 1994 until Carroll's death, their insurable interest was as remaindermen; from Carroll's death forward, their insurable interest was as record owners (whose possessory rights had recently been created by their father's death).
