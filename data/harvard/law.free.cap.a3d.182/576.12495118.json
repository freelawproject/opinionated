These cases come to us in the wake of what is considered generally to be the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. It is common knowledge that in 2008 the stock market plummeted, and with it the value of real estate throughout the country tumbled as well. It also is well known that Rhode Island was not immune from the effects of that economic collapse. Indeed, as both the plaintiffs and the defendant agree, the value of the plaintiffs' properties decreased in 2008 and 2009. This appeal, though, is not a contest about the value of the plaintiffs' properties. Rather, this appeal is about whether certain sections of G.L. 1956 chapter 5 of title 44 require the plaintiffs to base their tax appeals on the fair market value of their properties \"as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the plaintiffs appealed their assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010, the defendant maintained that they were locked in to the value of their properties as of December 31, 2007, the year of Portsmouth's last revaluation. The plaintiffs, whose properties had experienced a substantial decline in value after December 31, 2007, disagree. After a nonjury trial based on an agreed statement of facts, the trial justice concluded that, based on the language set forth in the pertinent sections of chapter 5 of title 44, the plaintiffs were not \"locked in\" to the values of their properties as of December 31, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put another way, the trial justice decided that the plaintiffs were authorized under the law to challenge the defendant's assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010 by employing the fair market values of their properties as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, respectively. We agree. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The facts here are undisputed and straightforward. The plaintiffs all own property in the Town of Portsmouth. More specifically, each of the plaintiffs owns a condominium in the same development. In 2007, consistent with his statutory duties as the tax assessor for Portsmouth, defendant conducted a full-scale revaluation of all real estate in the town, including plaintiffs' properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant determined that, as of December 31, 2007, the full and fair cash values\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   of plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   properties were as follows: the Balmuth Property, $4,430,200; the Qua Property, $5,320,800; and the Antle Property, $4,076,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Then, in 2008, the economy cratered. There is no question that real estate values were adversely affected by the downturn. Nevertheless, as he was permitted to do, for his assessment for tax year 2009, defendant carried forward the December 31, 2007 valuations of plaintiffs' properties. For tax year 2010, he did the same. Thus, for tax years 2009 and 2010, defendant assessed plaintiffs' property taxes based on the fair market values of those properties as of December 31, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   However, as of December 31, 2008-the date of assessment for tax year 2009-and December 31, 2009-the date of assessment for tax year 2010-the fair market values of plaintiffs' properties had decreased. As of December 31, 2008, the parties stipulate that the fair market values of plaintiffs' properties were as follows: the Balmuth Property, $4,107,333; the Qua Property, $4,788,720; and the Antle Property, $3,668,850. As of December 31, 2009, the fair market values of plaintiffs' properties were as follows: the Qua Property, $4,256,640; and the Antle Property, $3,261,200.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs sought review of those assessments on the ground that they had been overtaxed for tax years 2009 and 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the procedure set forth in \u00a7 44-5-26(a), plaintiffs first appealed to defendant. He denied their appeals, informing plaintiffs that, under chapter 5 of title 44, he had properly carried forward the December 31, 2007 valuations for use in determining his assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Portsmouth Tax Assessment Board of Review, where they were again denied relief. Still unsatisfied, plaintiffs then petitioned for relief in the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Over the course of several years, plaintiffs' tax appeal cases were consolidated as they wound their way through the normal course of litigation. Ultimately, after the parties submitted an agreed statement of facts, a justice of the Superior Court granted plaintiffs the relief for which they had petitioned. The trial justice found that plaintiffs could challenge defendant's tax assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010 using the fair market values of their properties as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, respectively. He concluded that, contrary to defendant's interpretation of the language set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 44-5-15 and 44-5-26 (language we will discuss\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), plaintiffs were not confined to the December 31, 2007 valuations. The trial justice reasoned that, under \u00a7 44-5-30, plaintiffs had satisfied the preconditions necessary to prevail on their tax appeals. Citing \u00a7 44-5-30, he wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"For judgment to enter in favor of the taxpayer challenging [a] property tax assessment, the taxpayer must demonstrate: (1) that an account has been given; (2) that the tax has been assessed in excess of the property's full and fair cash value; and (3) that the taxes on the\n   property have been paid prior to judgment entering.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 44-5-30 provides, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"If the taxpayer has given in an account, and if on the trial of the petition, either with or without a jury, it appears that the taxpayer's real estate * * * has been assessed * * * at a value in excess of its full and fair cash value, * * * the court shall give judgment that the sum by which the taxpayer has been so overtaxed, * * * with his or her costs, be deducted from his or her tax * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Seizing on the use of \"shall\" in that statute, the trial justice determined that he was bound to enter judgment in plaintiffs' favor because they had satisfied their burden under \u00a7 44-5-30. He explained that defendant had even conceded as much, in that there was no dispute that plaintiffs had (1) given an account; (2) been assessed taxes in excess of their properties' full and fair cash value for tax years 2009 and 2010; and (3) timely paid their taxes for tax years 2009 and 2010. Accordingly, a judgment entered in plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant timely appealed, posing to this Court a single question of statutory interpretation: whether, pursuant to chapter 5 of title 44, plaintiffs were locked in to the fair market valuations of their properties as of December 31, 2007, when they appealed defendant's assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court reviews questions of statutory interpretation\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whittemore v.

Under \u00a7 44-5-1, \"[t]he tax is apportioned upon the assessed valuations as determined by the assessors of the city or town as of December 31 in each year at 12:00 A.M. midnight, the date being known as the date of assessment of city or town valuations.\" Pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-13, \"[t]he assessors shall assess all valuation and apportion any tax levy on the inhabitants of the city or town and the ratable property in the city or town according to law, and the assessed valuation of the ratable property is made as of the date of assessment provided in \u00a7 44-5-1[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"All real property\n   subject to taxation shall be assessed at its full and fair cash value, or at a uniform percentage of its value, not to exceed one hundred percent (100%), to be determined by the assessors in each town or city * * *.\" Section 44-5-12(a). With respect to real estate in particular, \"[t]he assessors shall make a list containing the true, full, and fair cash value * * * as defined in [ ]\u00a7 44-5-12 * * * of the ratable estate in the city or town, placing the real estate [and other assets] in separate columns * * *.\" Section 44-5-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Before assessing any valuations, though, the tax assessors of all the cities and towns must comply with the notice provisions set forth in \u00a7 44-5-15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 44-5-15 also requires the annual filing of an account by a taxpayer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The notices require every person and body corporate liable to taxation to bring in to the assessors at the time they may prescribe a true and exact account of all the ratable estate owned or possessed by that person or body, describing and specifying the value of every parcel of the real estate\n   <em>\n    as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation\n   </em>\n   and personal estate as of December 31 of the tax year * * *.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The account required under \u00a7 44-5-15 is a pillar of our local taxation structure; it must be made under oath, and it serves as a condition precedent to appealing a tax assessment. Section 44-5-16(a);\n   <em>\n    Whittemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800933\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/530/#p540\">\n    139 A.3d at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, as prescribed by \u00a7 44-5-17, \"[i]f any person brings in an account as provided in \u00a7 44-5-15, the assessors shall nevertheless assess the person's ratable estate at what they deem its full and fair cash value * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Generally, a taxpayer seeking to appeal a tax assessment with which he or she is dissatisfied has an exclusive statutory remedy to do so. As \u00a7 44-5-27 instructs, that remedy is provided in \u00a7 44-5-26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under \u00a7 44-5-26(a), \"[a]ny person aggrieved on any ground whatsoever by any assessment of taxes against him or her in any city or town * * * may within ninety (90) days from the date the first tax payment is due, file an appeal in the local office of tax assessment * * *.\" From the local office of tax assessment, the aggrieved taxpayer may appeal to the local tax board of review and then, if still dissatisfied, file a petition for review in the Superior Court. Sections 44-5-26(a) and (b). In addition to setting forth the procedural and timing requirements required to perfect a tax appeal, \u00a7 44-5-26 further directs that \"[a]ppeals to the local office of tax assessment are to\n   be on an application[,]\" and that \"[t]he application shall be in\" a particular form. Section 44-5-26(b);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appendix. Contained in that form are two provisions that are of significance to defendant's position in this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 44-5-26(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, included in the form under the heading \"REASON(S) REDUCTION SOUGHT\" is a space in which an aggrieved taxpayer can list his or her property's \"Fair Market Value (\n   <em>\n    as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation for real estate\n   </em>\n   and as of December 31 of the tax year for personal estate * * *)[.]\" (Emphasis added.) Next, below the form's signature block and under the heading \"TAXPAYER INFORMATION ABOUT APPEAL PROCEDURE[,]\" the form informs the taxpayer, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"You may appeal your assessment if your property is: (1) OVERVALUED (\n   <em>\n    assessed value is more than the fair market value as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation for real estate\n   </em>\n   and as of December 31 of the tax year for personal estate for any reason, including clerical and data processing errors * * *).\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, rounding out the maze of local taxation statutes is \u00a7 44-5-30, entitled \"Judgment on petition where taxpayer has filed account.\" Section 44-5-30 provides, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"If the taxpayer has given in an account, and if on the trial of the petition, either with or without a jury, it appears that the taxpayer's real estate * * * has been assessed * * * at a value in excess of its full and fair cash value, * * * the court shall give judgment that the sum by which the taxpayer has been so overtaxed, * * * with his or her costs, be deducted from his or her tax * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Turning to the merits of this appeal, defendant and plaintiffs offer differing interpretations of the above-quoted sections contained within chapter 5 of title 44. Stressing the language of those statutes and of the form required by \u00a7 44-5-26(b), defendant argues that, when plaintiffs appealed his assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010, they were restricted to the valuations of their properties as of December 31, 2007, the date of Portsmouth's last revaluation. In support of that interpretation, defendant focuses on two statutory provisions, both of which refer to the fair market value of property \"as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation.\" Specifically, defendant directs us to \u00a7 44-5-15, which requires the annual filing of an account stating the value of \"real estate as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation[,]\" and the form required by \u00a7 44-5-26(b), which refers twice to the fair market value of real estate \"as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation[.]\" According to defendant, those provisions, when read together with the other sections of chapter 5 of title 44, mandate that plaintiffs must base their tax appeals on the valuations of their properties as of December 31, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The plaintiffs disagree. To support their position that the law permits a challenge to defendant's tax assessments using annual valuations, they first point to this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wickes Asset Management, Inc. v. Dupuis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11322724\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/679/314/\">\n    679 A.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 1996). It is true that, in\n   <em>\n    Wickes\n   </em>\n   , we held that \"a property owner disputing an assessment carried over from a prior year is not precluded from challenging the assessment and is therefore not necessarily 'locked into' that value until the next decennial revaluation * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Wickes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11322724\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/679/314/\">\n    679 A.2d at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the guiding principle of\n   <em>\n    Wickes\n   </em>\n   was that, under the statutory scheme in place at that time, \"the Legislature ha[d] provided interim remedies for a person aggrieved\n   by an annual tax assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11322724\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/679/314/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Court noted, those interim remedies were set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 44-5-26 and 44-5-27.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11322724\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/679/314/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   However, it is significant that, at the time\n   <em>\n    Wickes\n   </em>\n   was decided, revaluations of real property were conducted every ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wickes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11322724\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/679/314/\">\n    679 A.2d at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As defendant correctly points out, that has since changed. In 1997, a year after\n   <em>\n    Wickes\n   </em>\n   , the General Assembly overhauled the revaluation process, enacting P.L. 1997, ch. 179, \u00a7 1 (later codified as \u00a7\u00a7 44-5-11.5, 44-5-11.6, and 44-5-11.7 ). Under the new revaluation statute, rather than requiring cities and towns to conduct revaluations every ten years, the General Assembly mandated that \"each city and town shall conduct a revaluation within nine (9) years of the date of the prior revaluation and shall conduct an update of real property every three (3) years from the last revaluation.\" P.L. 1997, ch. 179, \u00a7 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 44-5-11.6(a)(2)(i)-(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The transition to a more frequent revaluation-and-update schedule was based on a detailed list of legislative findings. Among other things, the General Assembly recognized that the old ten-year revaluation led to inequitable results for taxpayers. As the General Assembly explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"The state's ten year property revaluation cycle is the longest revaluation cycle in the country. Infrequent revaluations translate into disparities in property tax burden between types and classes of property within and among cities and towns.

On this point, we agree with defendant that perhaps the trial justice should not have relied on\n   <em>\n    Wickes\n   </em>\n   to the extent he did. However, that does not resolve the question of statutory interpretation at hand. Even with this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Wickes\n   </em>\n   being of doubtful value here, what remains unclear is whether plaintiffs are, as defendant argues, confined to the values of their properties as of December 31, 2007. Based on our thorough review of the language contained in chapter 5 of title 44, the only thing that appears clear to us now is just how unclear the conflicting statutory language is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For example, \u00a7 44-5-1-the statute that empowers cities and towns to tax-provides in succinct and unambiguous language that \"[t]he tax is apportioned upon the assessed valuations\n   <em>\n    as determined by the assessors of the city or town as of December 31 in each year\n   </em>\n   at 12:00 A.M. midnight, the date being known as the date of assessment of city or town valuations.\" (Emphasis added.) A plain reading of that language would suggest that plaintiffs' position is correct: they may challenge the valuations of their properties \"as of December 31 in each year[,]\" freeing them from the bonds of the December 31, 2007 valuations. On the other hand, we are confronted with the language of \u00a7 44-5-15 and that in the form required by \u00a7 44-5-26(b). In each of those places there is language providing that taxpayers state the value of their\n   <em>\n    real estate\n   </em>\n   \"as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Also, it does not escape our notice that, in accordance with the 2001 amendments to \u00a7 44-5-15 and to the form required by \u00a7 44-5-26(b), taxpayers must state the value of their\n   <em>\n    personal estate\n   </em>\n   \"as of December 31 of the tax year,\" providing fertile ground for an argument that the General Assembly intended to treat the valuation of real estate and personal estate differently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 44-5-15 and 44-5-26(b);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   P.L. 2001, ch. 365, \u00a7 1. A plain reading of those amendments lends support to defendant's argument that plaintiffs are able to challenge their tax assessments only by using the fair market value as of December 31, 2007, the date of the last revaluation before their challenges. Unfortunately, the conflict between the language of \u00a7 44-5-1 and that of \u00a7 44-5-15 and the statutory form required by \u00a7 44-5-26(b) is only the\n   most glaring, but not the sole, ambiguity lurking in chapter 5 of title 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To cloud matters further, there is also the language of \u00a7 44-5-12(a), which states that \"[a]ll real property subject to taxation shall be assessed at its full and fair cash value, * * * to be determined by the assessors in each town or city[.]\" And, lest we forget, the language of \u00a7 44-5-13-that \"[t]he assessors shall assess all valuation and apportion any tax levy on the inhabitants of the city or town and the ratable property in the city or town according to law, and the assessed valuation of the ratable property is made as of the date of assessment provided in \u00a7 44-5-1\"-and the language of \u00a7 44-5-30-which instructs that \"the court shall give judgment\" in favor of the taxpayer\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"[i]f the taxpayer has given in an account, and if on the trial of the petition [filed pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-26], * * * it appears that the taxpayer's real estate * * * has been assessed, if assessment has been made at full and fair cash value, at a value in excess of its full and fair cash value * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Those provisions add further uncertainty to the resolution of the issue at hand; that is, whether the General Assembly intended that plaintiffs be locked in to the December 31, 2007 valuations per chapter 5 of title 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Therefore, it is readily apparent that we are faced with ambiguous statutory language. We can reach no other conclusion than that the inartful drafting of the pertinent statutory language here renders it plainly \"susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Drs.

Unfortunately, neither the 2001 amendments to \u00a7 44-5-15 and the form required by \u00a7 44-5-26(b), adding the phrase \"in the year of the last update or revaluation[,]\" nor the legislative findings contained in \u00a7 44-5-11.5 are determinative in discerning legislative intent. On one hand, as defendant argues, perhaps by virtue of the 2001 amendments, the General Assembly intended to lock in taxpayers\n   like plaintiffs to the December 31, 2007 valuations. But, on the other hand, perhaps, as plaintiffs argue, in enacting those amendments, the General Assembly simply intended for tax assessors such as defendant to be allowed to use those valuations as a carry-forward, easing the administrative burden of conducting yearly valuations while still affording taxpayers with the opportunity to pursue tax appeals on an annual basis using annual valuations. The language of the pertinent statutes does not resolve our linguistic dilemma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, based on the ambiguities created by the conflicting statutory provisions quoted above and the lack of clear legislative intent to the contrary, we hold that plaintiffs had the right to appeal the yearly tax assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010 based on the fair market valuations of their properties as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inn Group Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7366484\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/593/49/#p55\">\n    593 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   55 ;\n   <em>\n    Maggiacomo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544019\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ri/122/615/#p618\">\n    122 R.I. at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544019,8004823\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/410/1332/\">\n    410 A.2d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, when plaintiffs appealed defendant's assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010, they were not locked in to the December 31, 2007 valuations of their properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In so holding, we are cognizant of defendant's reliance on alternative canons of statutory construction to support his position. He argues first that the specific provisions of \u00a7 44-5-15 and the form required by \u00a7 44-5-26(b) should control over the general provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 44-5-1 and 44-5-12.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Whitehouse v.

In the alternative, defendant maintains that, because the language in \u00a7 44-5-15 and \u00a7 44-5-26(b)'s form was added after the language in \u00a7 44-5-1 and \u00a7 44-5-12, the later provisions should govern here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, we respectfully dissent. We do agree with the majority that the conflicting statutory language in \u00a7\u00a7 44-5-1, 44-5-12(a), 44-5-13, and 44-5-15, and the form required by \u00a7 44-5-26(b), is inarticulately drafted and ambiguous, requiring us to employ our maxims of statutory construction.

This is specific legislation directed at only those choosing to appeal their real estate valuations and, as such, must be considered as controlling the remaining valuation provisions of the statute. Likewise, the fact that the 2001 amendment was adopted later than the overall taxing change of 1997 gives insight to the General Assembly's attempt to clarify when an appeal can be taken. Using\n   these two rules of construction convinces us that the General Assembly limited taxpayer appeals to the year of the last update or revaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We gain comfort in this view when considering the possible ramifications of the majority's interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some taxpayers could seek a revaluation every year, requiring municipalities, such as defendant, to expend funds in justifying them. Interpreting the statute in that manner would unnecessarily burden already strained municipal budgets, ultimately passing the costs on to taxpayers. Likewise, the loss of revenue, which occurred in this case, would leave cities and towns attempting to recoup their losses by, again, looking to remaining property owners. In these times when most owners do not have expendable income, we cannot fathom the General Assembly wanting to do that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For these reasons, we must respectfully voice our dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    Appendix\n   </strong>\n   the waters of the state, floating or nonfloating, which is designed or remodeled as a place of habitation and is not principally used for transportation, and this definition includes platforms and waterborne hotels and restaurants; \"local tax assessor\", for the purposes of this section, means the assessor for the city or town within whose harbor line the houseboat is physically situated.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-84\"><strong>History of Section.</strong> P.L. 1981, ch. 370, \u00a7 1.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    44-5-26.

It is the intent of the general assembly to ensure that all taxpayers in Rhode Island are treated equitably. Ensuring that taxpayers are treated fairly begins where cities and towns meet defined standards related to performing property values. All properties should be assessed in a uniform manner, and properties of equal value should be assessed the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   TO DISPUTE YOUR VALUATION OR ASSESSMENT OR CORRECT ANY OTHER BILLING PROBLEM OR ERROR THAT CAUSED YOUR TAX BILL TO BE HIGHER THAN IT SHOULD BE, YOU MUST APPEAL WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE THE FIRST TAX PAYMENT IS DUE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   You may appeal your assessment if your property is: (1) OVERVALUED (assessed value is more than the fair market value as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation for real estate and as of December 31 of the tax year for personal estate for any reason, including clerical\n   and data processing errors; (2) disproportionately assessed in comparison with other properties; (3) classified incorrectly as residential, commercial, industrial or open space, farm or forest; (4) illegal tax partially or fully exempt; (5) modified from its condition from the time of the last update or revaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   WHO MAY FILE AN APPLICATION: You may file an application if you are (1) the assessed or subsequent (acquiring title after December 31) owner of the property; (2) the owner's administrator or executor; (3) a tenant or group of tenants of real estate paying rent therefrom, and under obligations to pay more than one-half (\u00bd) of the taxes thereon; (4) a person owning or having an interest in or possession of the property; or (5) a mortgagee if the assessed owner has not applied. In some cases, you must pay all or a portion of the tax before you can file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   WHEN AND WHERE APPLICATION MUST BE FILED. Your application must be filed with the local office of tax assessment within NINETY (90) days from the date the first tax payment is due. THESE DEADLINES CANNOT BE EXTENDED OR WAIVED BY THE ASSESSOR FOR ANY REASON. IF YOUR APPLICATION IS NOT FILED ON TIME, YOU LOSE ALL RIGHTS TO AN ABATEMENT AND THE ASSESSOR CANNOT BY LAW GRANT YOU ONE. AN APPLICATION IS FILED WHEN RECEIVED BY THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   PAYMENT OF TAX. Filing an application does not stay the collection of your taxes. In some cases, you must pay the tax when due to appeal the assessors disposition of your application. Failure to pay the tax assessed when due may also subject you to interest charges and collection action. To avoid any loss of rights or additional charges, you should pay the tax as assessed. If an abatement is granted and you have already paid the entire year's tax as abated, you will receive a refund of any overpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   FILING AN ACCOUNT. Rhode Island General Laws Section 44-5-15 requires the annual filing of a true and exact account of all ratable estate owned or possessed by every person and corporate body. The time to file is between December 31, and January 31, of intention to submit declaration by March 15. Failure to file a true and full account, within the prescribed time, eliminates the right to appeal to the superior court, subject to the exceptions provided in Rhode Island General Laws Section 44-5-26(b). No amended returns will be accepted after March 15th. Such notice of your intention must be sent by certified mail, postage prepaid, postmark no later than 12 o'clock midnight of the last day, January 31. No extensions beyond March 15th can be granted. The form for filing such account may be obtained from the city or town assessor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   ASSESSOR'S DISPOSITION. Upon applying for a reduction in assessment, you may be asked to provide the assessor with further written information about the property and to permit them to inspect it. Failure to provide the information or permit an inspection within thirty (30) days of the request may result in the loss of your appeal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   APPEAL. The assessor shall have forty-five (45) days to review the appeal, render a decision and notify the taxpayer of the decision. The taxpayer, if still aggrieved, may appeal the decision of the tax assessor to the local tax board of review, or in the event that the assessor does not render a decision, the taxpayer may appeal to the local tax board of review at the expiration of the forty-five (45) day period. Appeals to the local tax board of review shall be filed not more than thirty (30) days after the assessor renders a decision and notifies the taxpayer, or if the assessor does not render a decision within forty-five (45) days of the filing of the appeal, not more than ninety (90) days after the expiration of the forty-five (45) day period.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-103\">DISPOSITION OF APPLICATION (ASSESSOR'S USE ONLY) GRANTED Assessed Value_________________________ Date Sent_____________ Abated Value___________________________ Date Returned____________ DENIED Adjusted Value_________________________ Assessed Tax___________________________ On-Site Inspection DEEMED DENIED Abated Tax_____________________________ Date Adjusted Tax___________________________ By________________________ Date Voted/Deemed Denied Tax Board of Review Date Change Certificate No.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Any person still aggrieved on any ground whatsoever by an assessment of taxes against him or her in any city or town may, within thirty (30) days of the tax board of review decision notice, file a petition in the superior court for the county in which the city or town lies for relief from the assessment, to which petition the assessors of taxes of the city or town in office at the time the petition is filed shall be made parties respondent, and the clerk shall thereupon issue a citation substantially in the following form:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Attributed to Senator Russell B.

The dissent too cautions of such a descent into fiscal disarray. Besides noting that appealing a tax assessment is in and of itself rather cost-prohibitive, we nonetheless conclude that such a policy concern is best addressed by the General Assembly, not this Court.
