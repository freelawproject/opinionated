She also emphasizes her inability to obtain a doctor's note before her discharge. Under these circumstances, Claimant's four call offs in the two weeks following her medical leave do not rise to the level of willful misconduct. Accordingly, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Claimant worked for Allied Barton Security Service (Employer) as a command center operator on the night shift beginning in 2010. One year later, she was diagnosed with a heart condition that ultimately required corrective surgery. In May 2016, she requested FMLA leave for her cardiac surgery and post-operative recovery. Employer approved her medical leave starting the week of June 23, 2016. Prior to her approved medical leave, Claimant reduced her schedule to part-time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Employer scheduled Claimant to work 12 consecutive hours on the third shift on September 23, 2016, for her first day back at work after FMLA leave. However, she called off work that day because she was not feeling well. Referee's Dec., 12/7/16, Finding of Fact (F.F.)

Claimant worked her next scheduled shift the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That same week, on September 30, Claimant called off work again because she was not feeling well enough to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Attendance Form, 10/3/16.

F.F. No. 5. By the time her doctor provided a note, Employer advised her via text message that termination papers were in the mail. Employer terminated Claimant's employment for these four absences for violation of its attendance policy (Policy). F.F.

Without objection, the referee admitted the doctor's note at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The referee determined Claimant was ineligible for UC benefits under Section 402(e) of the Law. The referee made the following pertinent findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. [E]mployer's time and attendance policy provides that where employees call out from 4 or more assigned shifts in a 90-day period, the consequence will be termination of employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3.

Claimant appealed to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, Claimant argued the referee disregarded that Claimant's absences constituted only one chargeable offense because they all related to the same illness. C.R., Item No. 10. She also requested a remand hearing to submit additional evidence, including doctor's notes discussing possible flare-ups during her recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ultimately, the Board adopted the referee's findings and conclusions, and it determined Claimant was ineligible for UC benefits. The Board reasoned: \"[C]laimant did not receive a note from her doctor until\n   October 14, 2016, two weeks after she knew she needed it and one week after she was discharged. Even then, [C]laimant did not notify [E]mployer to see if she could be rehired.\" Bd. Op., 3/3/17, at 1. The Board also did not consider the additional evidence Claimant submitted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   noting: \"[C]laimant had an opportunity to present this evidence at the hearing, but failed to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the Board denied Claimant's request for a remand hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Claimant filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Board denied. Claimant now petitions for review from the Board's decision on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in her uncounseled brief, Claimant argues the Board erred in determining her four medical absences constituted willful misconduct. She asserts she attempted to obtain the requested doctor's note to excuse her absences. However, based on circumstances beyond her control, she was unable to do so before her discharge. She also contends she had good cause for calling off work based on her documented illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Claimant does not dispute the material facts, that she called off for four shifts when she was ill without providing a doctor's note. She also does not contest that this conduct was cause for discharge under the Policy. Nevertheless, she maintains her inability to return to work when scheduled because she needed more recovery time than anticipated did not constitute willful misconduct under the Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pursuant to Section 402(e) of the Law, 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(e), a claimant is ineligible for UC benefits when an employer discharges her for willful misconduct. The Law does not define \"willful misconduct.\" Appellate courts define \"willful misconduct\" in the UC context as: \"(a) wanton or willful disregard for an employer's interests; (b) deliberate violation of an employer's rules; (c) disregard for standards of behavior which an employer can rightfully expect of an employee; or[,] (d) negligence indicating an intentional disregard of the employer's interest or an employee's duties or obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Grieb v.

Therefore, we consider the circumstances of her policy violation, including whether it was deliberate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Employer discharged Claimant for violating the Policy by calling off work four times in 90 days. That she called off because of illness was immaterial. The Policy provides: \"Termination will result if ... you have 4 chargeable actions relating to attendance within a rolling 90[-]day period.\" C.R., Item No. 3. Chargeable actions include chargeable absences, defined as \"call offs for anything other than a death in the family.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"281063,11881303\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/703/452/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Policy does not exempt absences for illness; however, it states \"consecutive multiple days off for an illness,\n   <em>\n    with documentation\n   </em>\n   , generally count as one chargeable action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"281063,11881303\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/703/452/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The alleged misconduct here is comprised of Claimant's four absences in a 90-day period. Although the Board focused on Claimant's failure to provide a doctor's note prior to her discharge, that conduct did not violate the Policy, and it was not the reported grounds for her discharge. The Policy did not require a doctor's note; a note merely reduced consecutive chargeable absences to one chargeable action. Additionally, the Policy did not specify a timeframe for submitting documentation of an illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Significantly, it is undisputed that Claimant's four absences were due to illness. Claimant called off for her first shift of 12 consecutive hours following her medical leave for open-heart surgery and post-operative recovery. The referee found that Claimant called off work the first time because she \"was not feeling well.\" F.F. No. 4. Employer likewise did not contest that Claimant's illness was the reason for her other three absences. Employer's separation documentation lists the reason for all four absences as \"illness.\" C.R., Item No. 3 (Attendance Forms).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[T]he law is clear that absence due to illness is not\n   <em>\n    willful\n   </em>\n   misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Green v.

When the violation of an employer's absence policy is grounds for termination, and the policy makes no distinction between absences for illness and absences for other reasons, we do not discern willful misconduct based on the policy violation alone.\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   in that the reason for discharge was reaching a ceiling of unauthorized absences within a certain timeframe. There, the claimant was discharged because he reached the terminable threshold of 8 absences in a 12-month period. The employer's policy permitted termination for any unauthorized absences,\n   without differentiating for absences caused by illness. The claimant argued that while his absences, five of which related to illness, may have been grounds for discharge, they did not constitute willful misconduct under the Law. We agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This Court reasoned that the Board erred in counting the claimant's illness-related absences as a deliberate disregard for the employer's interests. Despite the claimant receiving warnings about being close to the terminable threshold of absences, we emphasized the \"distinction between cause for dismissal under an employer's policy and disqualifying conduct under the [Law].\"\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=433%20A.2d%20587\">\n    433 A.2d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When a claimant violates a policy because of her illness, we do not ascribe deliberate disregard to her violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phila. Parking Auth. v. Unemployment Comp.

N.T. at 6, 8-10. Indeed, Claimant eventually obtained a doctor's note as requested, but was unable to do so within the week between her third call off and her discharge. Her attempts to obtain the doctor's note within a week's time, while unsuccessful, did not evince a willful disregard of Manager's request for documentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bogan v.

In\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Parking Authority\n   </em>\n   , the claimant reached her maximum sick leave under the policy, such that additional sick days led to discipline. As a result, she requested and received approved FMLA leave. Nonetheless, the employer discharged her for noncompliance with its sick leave policy. In concluding the claimant did not commit willful misconduct, we explained, \"apply[ing] its regular policy for employees who have called in sick, to an employee who has requested, certified, and received leave under the FMLA is not reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207356313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207356313\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   slip op. at 9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207356313\">\n    2015 WL 7356313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Policy here permits the discharge of an employee who is ill four times within a 90-day period regardless of the circumstances.
