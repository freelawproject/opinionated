There is one minor child born to the parties since the date of the marriage .... The marriage between the parties has broken down irretrievably and there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The plaintiff is sixty-one years old and in good health. He graduated from the [United States] Naval Academy, holds an aerospace engineering degree and has training in nuclear power. He served in the [United States] Navy on and off for twenty-eight years. He worked in the private sector for Northrop Grumman as a military consultant before being recalled to active duty. He retired as a Commander from the United States Navy [Navy] at age forty-nine. His last military assignment was in the country of Bahrain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"When the plaintiff retired from the Navy, one month after the parties married, he started working for himself as a day trader. In 2003, his day trading account was\n   valued at $147,375. Since then, he has consistently lost money trading. The parties' 2008 income tax return shows a business loss of $7748; the 2009 income tax return shows a business loss of $9136; the 2011 income tax return shows a business loss of $14,274; and the 2013 income tax return shows a business loss of $11,535.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"He currently has $1000 left in his trading account. The plaintiff has not made any efforts to seek gainful employment since his retirement. In spite of the plaintiff's significant losses, his plans are to continue day trading as long as he has any money left in his trading account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"In July, 2014, the plaintiff elected to receive his military pension without a right of survivorship. At that time, he received $20,000 in a lump sum. He currently receives $650 gross weekly from his pension with a net of $475. The plaintiff lists on his financial affidavit $681 in weekly expenses. That amount includes $70 per week on a first mortgage, $35 per week on a second mortgage, and $95 in property taxes. The plaintiff's assets include a Navy Federal Credit Union account with a current balance of $1000; a U.S.A. account with a current balance of $15; a TD Bank account with a current balance of $19; and savings bonds valued at $1130. He also has an [individual retirement account (IRA) ] with a current balance of $600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The plaintiff's financial affidavit lists a total of $57,478 in liabilities.

The plaintiff was there serving in the Navy and the defendant was a flight attendant stationed there. They married on May 17,\n   2003, and when the plaintiff retired from the Navy, they came to live in Connecticut. The plaintiff started working for himself as a day trader. The defendant has always wanted the plaintiff to get a job, but he has refused to do so. In 2007, the parties decided to have a child and the child was born on April 4, 2008. After the birth of the minor child, the defendant still wanted the plaintiff to seek employment, but he insisted that he would stay at home day trading and taking care of the minor child. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"During the course of the marriage, the plaintiff managed the household bills, but it was the defendant's income that funded the expenses. The plaintiff was not working and his day trading business was deteriorating. In 2014, when this action started, the plaintiff told the defendant that she could stay in the home as long as she paid for the household expenses. On February 4, 2015, a court order entered wherein the plaintiff was responsible to pay for the two mortgages, taxes, home-owners [insurance], electricity, internet, cable, TV and home phone. The defendant was to pay $300 per week to the plaintiff for contributions to the household expenses as long as she resided in the home. The parties were to share the minor child's expenses equally. In April, 2015, the defendant moved out of the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"On September 23, 2015, a parenting plan was submitted to the court and it was accepted .... The agreement provides for joint legal custody, but it does not designate a primary residence. The agreement provides that the plaintiff is to parent the child each week from Sunday at 12 noon until Tuesday at 6:30/7 p.m., and Wednesday at 7 p.m. until Friday at 5 p.m. The defendant is to parent the child each week from Tuesday at 6:30/7 p.m. until Wednesday at 7 p.m., and from Friday at 5 p.m. until Sunday at 12 noon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The parenting plan does not provide for child support. According to the child support guidelines submitted by the plaintiff, assuming that he is the custodial parent, the presumptive child support is $166 per week from the defendant to the plaintiff. According to the Connecticut child support guidelines submitted by the defendant, assuming that she is the custodial parent, the presumptive child support is\n   $105 per week from the plaintiff to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Since the date of separation, neither party has paid child support to the other. Moreover, the plaintiff has refused to pay for any of the child's extracurricular activities, including summer camp, karate and Girl Scouts (Brownies). The plaintiff does not want to contribute toward the child's expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The plaintiff claims that the marriage broke down in 2010 when the defendant was briefly hospitalized for depression. He also claims that the marriage suffered from lack of communication. The court does not find the plaintiff credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The defendant claims the marriage broke down after the birth of their child. At that time, she felt depressed for the lack of help in the marriage, the loss of money from day trading, the accumulation of debt, the plaintiff's refusal to seek employment, and the plaintiff's heavy drinking.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the basis of those factual findings, the court dissolved the marriage and adopted the parenting plan agreed to by the parties. The court did not award child support to either party, deviating from the child support guidelines due to the shared physical custody of the minor child. The court ordered the defendant to pay alimony to the plaintiff in the amount of $75 per week for four years, modifiable as to amount only, but terminable on the death of either party or the plaintiff's remarriage or cohabitation. The court ordered that the\n   defendant would be entitled to claim the minor child as a dependent for tax purposes. Each party would be responsible for his or her own debts as listed on their financial affidavits and for their respective attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court awarded the marital home, located on Main Street in Rocky Hill, to the plaintiff. The court ordered that the plaintiff keep as his sole property all funds in his Navy Federal Credit Union, USAA, and TD Bank accounts and the savings bonds listed in his financial affidavit, and that the defendant keep as her sole property all funds in her TD Bank checking and savings accounts and the United States savings bonds listed in her financial affidavit. The court ordered the parties' jointly held TD Bank savings account to be liquidated and that all funds in it be shared equally. The court ordered that the plaintiff keep as his sole property the coins and the metals he kept in his safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court further ordered that the plaintiff keep as his sole property the IRA listed on his financial affidavit and that the defendant transfer to the plaintiff, by way of a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), 40 percent of her John Hancock 401(k), valued as of the date of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration and articulation, arguing, inter alia, that the court improperly treated the plaintiff's pension as an income stream rather than as property. The court denied the defendant's motion and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court erred in treating the plaintiff's military pension as a source of income rather than as property subject to equitable distribution. In response, the plaintiff argues that the court properly treated his pension as a source\n   of income because it was in pay status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the defendant.\n   \"The purpose of a dissolution action is to sever the marital relationship, to fix the rights of the parties with respect to alimony and child support ...

The court explained: \" Section 46b-81 requires a trial court to make an equitable distribution of the parties'\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   ; to go about doing so sensibly, a court must determine at the outset which of the parties' resources are subject to division and assignment under that provision. Although [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-82 authorizes the trial court to award alimony in addition to or\n   <em>\n    in lieu of\n   </em>\n   [a distribution of property] pursuant to section 46b-81... the trial court may decide to exchange alimony for property only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   determining the value of the property in the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"This classification is significant for two reasons. First, property, even if not so characterized by the trial court, will\n   ultimately be awarded to one of the parties;\n   the statutory duty to distribute property equitably contemplates that the trial court effect such awards consciously rather than by default. Second, although it may be permissible in the distribution phase to exchange some form of alimony for a property award when equitable to do so ... it must be remembered that these awards are of different quality and consequence for the recipient spouse. An award of property is final; the party who receives property pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81 owns it in his or her own right and controls it. Periodic alimony, on the other hand, is conditional, subject to modification or elimination.

This court therefore concluded that, \"unlike the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Krafick\n   </em>\n   , the court in the\n   present case did not remove the defendant's pensions from the scales, but instead balanced them against the order of no child support, and in consideration of the fact that the majority of the pensions had been earned prior to the marriage.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491849\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/601/#p430\">\n    Id., at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491849\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/601/#p430\">\n    175 A.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.15. Thus, although this court in\n   <em>\n    Kent\n   </em>\n   did not require that the pensions in pay status be part of the property award, this court nonetheless concluded that such pensions be treated as property, valued and either distributed or considered as an offset or balance to the trial court's financial orders.\n   Here, the trial court referenced the plaintiff's military pension only in setting forth its factual findings as to the plaintiff's gross and net weekly income and the fact that he received $20,000 upon his election to receive his pension benefits. The court did not mention the plaintiff's pension in its property distribution orders, omitting it completely from the category entitled: \"Pension, IRA and Retirement Assets.\" It thus did not assign the pension a value, or order that it be distributed to either party. Nowhere in its decision, moreover, did the court state that it was considering the pension as an offset or a balance against any of its other financial orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is therefore clear that the trial court improperly classified the plaintiff's pension only as a source of income, not as property subject to equitable distribution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[T]he issues involving financial orders are entirely interwoven, [and] [t]he rendering of a judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489515\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/158/419/#p869\">\n    171 Conn.
