Upon approaching the car, the officer claimed to have detected the odor of burnt marijuana. Subsequent investigation revealed ten white pills in N.P.'s jacket pocket. He was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a prescription drug, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-10.5(e)(2), a fourth-degree crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The prosecutor recommended the complaint proceed to court on the \"mandatory counsel calendar.\" The probation officer assigned to court intake services noted the prosecutor's recommendation and placed the matter on the July 3, 2017 court calendar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 30, without notice or hearing, the judge entered an order that is the subject of our review. She noted the complaint was referred to court pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-71(b) because it charged N.P. with a fourth-degree crime and the prosecutor had not consented to its diversion. However, citing N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-73(a), the judge diverted the complaint to the Juvenile Conference Committee (JCC), noting she was providing a statement of reasons to the complainant \"pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-73(b).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The letter sent by the judge to the complaining police officer stated this was N.P.'s first involvement with the juvenile justice system, and the offense with which he was charged \"resulted in no personal injury or property damage.\" The judge also identified the \"most important factor\" in her decision-\"the availability of appropriate services outside referral to the court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judge stated that given the nature of the offenses, even \"if th[e] matter were heard in court and [N.P.] plead[ed] guilty ..., it [was] probable ... he would be given a deferred disposition.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-43(b)(1). She explained that under a deferred disposition, there would be no monitoring or counseling for N.P. However, the JCC could impose \"a multitude of creative conditions\" and provide \"the individualized attention [N.P.] may need.\" The judge explained that the JCC met in the evening, a more\n   convenient time for all involved, and the officer would be able to attend its meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    State in the Interest of N.P.\n   </em>\n   (A-0841-17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Now seventeen-years-old, N.P. was arrested again on July 13, 2017, when a Spotswood police officer approached a car in a school parking lot at 11:30 p.m. An adult was in the driver's seat and N.P. was in the front passenger seat. Police allegedly found a small amount of marijuana in the center console and subsequently seized several bags with small traces of marijuana as well as smoking devices. N.P. was charged with possession of marijuana, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-10(a)(4), and possession of drug paraphernalia, N.J.S.A. 2C:36-2, both disorderly persons offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 15, 2017, the prosecutor screened the case, referred it to the mandatory counsel calendar, and intake services forwarded the complaint to court, noting the prosecutor did not consent to its diversion. On September 12, without notice or hearing, the judge entered the order under review, diverting the complaint to an Intake Services Conference (ISC) pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-73(a). The order also noted the complaint alleged disorderly persons violations of chapter 35 of the Criminal Code, and pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-71, the prosecutor had not consented to diversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Upon receiving notice that an ISC conference was set for October 2, the State objected in a letter to probation, noting we had already granted leave to appeal in A-0135-17, and questioning whether intake services had considered the factors listed in N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-71(b) (listing eleven factors \"intake services shall consider ... in determining whether to recommend diversion\"). The judge responded in writing, noting that although we had granted leave to appeal the June 30, 2017 order regarding N.P.'s April arrest, we had not stayed proceedings in the Family Part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   She further explained that it had been the practice for many years in the vicinage to \"escalate cases to the [ISC] when a juvenile incurs a subsequent charge while pending before the [JCC].\" \"[M]ore importantly,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   the judge concluded N.P. would benefit from services ISC could put in place while N.P.'s \"enrollment to the [JCC] was pending.\" The judge summarized: \"The [c]ourt is confident that its decision to divert the complaint to the [ISC] is in the [j]uvenile's best interests and furthers the purpose of the ... Code, which is to rehabilitate the [j]uvenile.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    State in the Interest of D.S.\n   </em>\n   (A-0138-17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On February 23, 2017, sixteen-year-old D.S. entered Colonia High School, where he was not a student, and allegedly participated in two classes before being asked to leave. The State also alleged D.S. posted a recording of his exploits on Twitter and criticized the lax security at the school. Several days later, police arrested D.S. and charged him with fourth-degree criminal trespass, N.J.S.A. 2C:18-3(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For reasons unexplained by the record, the prosecutor did not screen the complaint until June, and, on June 29, 2017, intake services referred the complaint to court, noting the prosecutor did not consent to diversion. On June 30, once again without a hearing, the judge entered the order under review diverting the case to the JCC pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-73(a). The judge sent a letter to the complaining witness, the principal of Colonia High School, noting D.S. was a first time offender whose alleged offense involved no personal injury or property damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The principal, school security officer and superintendent of schools signed a letter dated July 6, 2017, objecting to the court's diversion order. On July 20, the judge returned the letter because it was an ex parte communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In her written statement of reasons filed in response to the State's motion for leave to appeal, the judge explained that the State's policy of objecting to diversion was contrary to past practices, since the State had consented to diversion in at least five other cases involving trespass on school property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    State in the Interest of A.W., J.D., J.DO., A.S, and J.Z.\n   </em>\n   (A-0308-17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On March 11, 2017, a South River officer stopped a car containing five juveniles because it had a broken taillight. The officer allegedly smelled burnt marijuana coming from the car, and an ensuing investigation revealed a bag with less than fifty grams of marijuana and a pipe. The juveniles, sixteen-year-old A.W., seventeen-year-old J.D., sixteen-year-old J.Do., sixteen-year-old, A.S., and seventeen-year-old J.Z., were arrested and charged with possession of marijuana, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-10(a)(4), and possession of drug paraphernalia, N.J.S.A. 2C:36-2, both disorderly persons offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The prosecutor screened the complaints and referred them to court. Noting the prosecutor's recommendation, intake services forwarded the complaints for court action and set a court date of June 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On that day, the judge held hearings as to each complaint on the record with the prosecutor, defense counsel and the juvenile present. The judge heard from the prosecutor as to why the State refused to consent to diversion and, over the prosecutor's objection, entered an order referring each complaint to the JCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The State moved for reconsideration, and the judge heard oral argument on August 11. In a comprehensive oral opinion, the judge denied the motion for reconsideration without prejudice. She supplemented her decision in a written statement\n   of reasons filed in response to the State's motion for leave to appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Resolution of these appeals turns on the interplay between intake services, the Family Part judge and the prosecutor that the Code and our Court Rules intend.

Where the juvenile was charged with conduct that if committed by an adult would be a crime, (as in A-0135-17 and A-0138-17), the judge reasoned that although N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-71(b) (Section 71) required intake services to refer the complaint to court because the prosecutor had not consented to diversion, N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-73(a) (Section 73) \"vest[ed] the trial court with the ability to divert the complaint to the JCC.\" She stated, \"it would be in the interests of justice to vest the juvenile judge, and not the prosecutor's office, with the discretion to divert complaints,\" and would further the court's\n   <em>\n    parens\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    patriae\n   </em>\n   obligations. The judge further explained that if the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   gave the prosecutor \"unfettered discretion\" to decide which complaints to divert, it would conflict with Section 73, which vested the responsibility for that decision with the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   She further concluded that interpreting the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   as the State urged was inconsistent with Section 73's plain language and \"would mean there [were] no checks and balance[s] on the State's powers. For example, there would be no way to stop the State\n   from arbitrarily deciding to divert only non-minority complaints, or those complaints from one municipality.\" The judge also reasoned that if the State could unilaterally refuse to consent to diversion, juveniles would be forced to retain counsel, thereby frustrating, in part, the purpose of diversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Regarding the five juvenile complaints that are the subject of A-0308-17, the judge concluded she acted in accordance with Section 73. She noted that intake services scheduled the cases for court, the juveniles were present with counsel and the prosecutor was given an opportunity to be heard. The judge concluded the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   did not apply because, by its terms, it was inapplicable to complaints charging disorderly persons offenses, except repetitive disorderly persons offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A.S. is the only juvenile to file opposition to the State's appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   A.S. agrees with the judge's reasoning and argues that Section 73 and the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   permit the judge to divert a complaint charging a juvenile with Title 35 and Title 36 disorderly persons offenses without the consent of the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In construing any statute, \"[o]ur task ...

Essentially, in every appeal, the judge concluded Section 73 vested the court, not the prosecutor, with the ultimate authority to divert a juvenile complaint, regardless of the offense charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In part, the judge reasoned Section 73 was inconsistent with the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   , and, by entering the orders under review in the two appeals where the juveniles are charged with crimes (A-0135-17 and A-0138-17), she expressly concluded the statute trumped the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   .

The State contends this is mere oversight. The judge, however, specifically concluded that because those offenses were not included in the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   , the express language of Section 73 permitted her to divert the complaints without the prosecutor's consent. We agree with the judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Section 71 requires that intake services \"refer[ ] for court action\" any complaint charging a Title 35 or 36 disorderly persons offense unless the prosecutor consents to diversion. N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-71(b). The statute only limits the authority of intake services. No section of the Code limits the authority of the judge to divert the complaint after it is referred for court action. Indeed, without mention of the prosecutor's role, Section 73 vests the judge with the discretionary authority to divert any juvenile complaint. N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-73(a). Nor does the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   , which governs the procedure to be followed once the complaint is referred to court, limit the judge's authority to divert a complaint charging a Title 35 or 36 disorderly persons offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Inadvertence may be, as the State contends, the only reason why Title 35 and 36 disorderly persons offenses are not contained in the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   . However, \"[t]he approach taken in respect of the construction of court rules is the same as that for the construction of statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758748\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/191/503/#p508\">\n    191 N.J. 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758748\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/191/503/#p508\">\n    924 A.2d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (citations omitted). The plain language of the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   only prohibits the judge from diverting a juvenile complaint charging a crime or repetitive disorderly persons offense without the prosecutor's consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, we affirm the orders entered in A-0308-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Even though our reasoning in this part of the opinion would apply to the second\n   appeal involving N.P., A-0841-17, because the juvenile was charged in the underlying complaint with only Title 35 and 36 disorderly persons offenses, we nevertheless reverse and remand in that appeal. First, the judge never accorded the\n   State a hearing in that matter before diverting the complaint. Second, because we are reversing in A-0135-17, involving the same juvenile, and holding that the judge may not divert that complaint without the prosecutor's consent, we believe it prudent to have the judge accord the State and defense counsel an opportunity to be heard before any further action is taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Reversed and remanded in A-0135-17, A-0138-17 and A-0841-17; affirmed in A-0308-17. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The record is essentially limited to the allegations contained in the filed complaints and police reports, and the judge's letters to complaining witnesses. Additionally, in response to two of the State's motions for leave to appeal, the judge provided a comprehensive, supplementary written statement of reasons,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rule\n    </em>\n    2:5-6(c), which we greatly appreciate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The judge mistakenly concluded she had continuing jurisdiction over the April 2017 complaint against N.P., the subject of A-0135-17. She cited\n    <em>\n     Rule\n    </em>\n    2:5-6(a), which states \"[t]he filing of a motion for leave to appeal shall not stay the proceedings in the trial court ... except on motion made to the court ... which entered the order or if denied by it, to the appellate court[,]\" and noted we had not entered any stay. However, we granted the State's motion for leave to appeal in A-0135-17 on September 8, 2017, thereby divesting the judge of jurisdiction regarding that complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     R.\n    </em>\n    2:9-1(a) (granting Appellate Division exclusive jurisdiction over all proceedings on appeal). We agree with the judge, however, that we had not exercised any jurisdiction over the July 2017 complaint, which was properly before her.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    We do not dispute the judge's statements, except to say the record does not provide information regarding the prosecutor's past practices.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The judge noted that despite supporting the State's motions for leave to appeal in\n    <em>\n     N.P.\n    </em>\n    (A-0135-17) and\n    <em>\n     D.S.\n    </em>\n    (A-0138-17), she opposed the State's motion for leave to appeal in these cases. She explained that because the juveniles in those cases were charged with conduct that would be a crime if committed by an adult, the conflict between\n    <em>\n     Rule\n    </em>\n    5:20-1(c), requiring the prosecutor's consent to diversion, and N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-73(a), which contained no such requirement, needed to be resolved. However, because all five juveniles in this case were charged with disorderly persons offenses, there was no conflict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    While we address the judge's rationale below, we point out that\n    <em>\n     Rule\n    </em>\n    2:5-6(c) permits the judge to\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n    comment on whether the motion for leave to appeal\n    <em>\n     should be granted\n    </em>\n    on the ground, among others, that a controlling question of law not theretofore addressed by an appellate court of this state is involved and that the grant of leave to appeal may materially advance the ultimate resolution of the matter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n    [ (Emphasis added).]\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The rule is designed to permit the trial judge to alert us to an issue that would benefit from our early intervention, not argue against our involvement.

Complaints charging non-divertible offenses must be forwarded for court action as required by Section 71, unless the prosecutor \"otherwise consents\" to diversion. The Court has recognized that in the juvenile realm, the prosecutor's charging decision has \"added significance[,]\" transforming the State's role \"from investigative to accusatory.\"\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.
