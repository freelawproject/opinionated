Paluch, Jr., (Appellant) appeals an Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Somerset County (trial court) that granted summary judgment in favor of Jeffrey A. Beard, William S. Stickman III, Gerald L. Rozum, Steven M. Gates, Allen G. Joseph, Daniel Gehlmann, Mandy Biser, Robert Snyder, Robert S. Bitner, Donald Williamson, Melissa Hughes, Timothy Lucas, Susan Darr, and John Doe Officer # 1 (Appellees, collectively) and against Appellant with prejudice. Appellees argue the appeal should be quashed because Appellant did not timely file his statement of errors complained of on appeal (Statement) as required by Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure,\n   Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has required strict adherence to Pa.R.A.P. 1925, and because Appellant has not shown good cause for non-compliance, we are constrained to find Appellant has waived all of his issues and quash the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant initiated this civil action against Appellees\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by filing a complaint in August 2007. In the complaint, Appellant alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that he was retaliated against for speaking out about prison conditions, which resulted in him being placed in the Special Management Unit (SMU) upon his transfer to a different state prison. Appellant also claimed he was assaulted by another inmate and mail from his attorney was improperly opened by prison staff. Appellees filed an answer to the complaint, denying the allegations and averring, in part, that the transfer to the SMU was for legitimate penological reasons, the fight was mutual, and that his mail was opened after it tested positive for drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following years of litigation, Appellees moved for summary judgment on June 13, 2013, which the trial court ultimately granted on December 30, 2015. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on January 22, 2016. In response to the notice of appeal, the trial court issued an order, dated January 27, 2016, and filed January 28, 2016, pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), directing Appellant to file his Statement within 21 days. The order directed Appellant to file the Statement and serve it upon the trial court. It also directed Appellant to review and comply with Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and advised that any error not included in the Statement would be deemed waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant's Statement was due February 18, 2016. Instead of filing his Statement, Appellant filed what he called a \"Motion for Special Relief\" with the trial court on February 18, 2016, wherein he advised the trial court that he could not file a Statement because he did not know the trial court's reasoning for its December 30, 2015 Order. He asked the trial court to file an opinion explaining its reasoning and to grant him additional time to file his Statement. The trial court did not act on the \"Motion for Special Relief.\" This prompted Appellant to file a second \"Motion for Special Relief\" on June 8, 2016, wherein Appellant reasserted the difficulty he had with filing his Statement without the trial court's reasoning. Appellant again requested the trial court issue an opinion explaining its decision to grant summary judgment in Appellees' favor and allow him additional time to file his Statement. Once again, the trial court did not act on the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, on August 19, 2016, Appellant filed his Statement, which was six months late. On January 23, 2017, the trial court issued a three-paragraph opinion, pursuant to Rule 1925(a)(1) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   explaining its rationale for granting the motion for summary judgment. On appeal to this Court, Appellant raises four issues: (1) whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in Appellees' favor when discovery was outstanding; (2) whether genuine issues of material fact exist and Appellant was deprived of due process to demonstrate those facts because of the outstanding discovery issues; (3) whether the trial court erred in not allowing Appellant to file an amended complaint; and (4) whether the case should be transferred to another county or, alternatively, that the trial court judge should recuse himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 15, 2017, Appellees filed a motion to quash the appeal. Appellees allege Appellant's Statement was untimely because it was not filed within 21 days of the trial court's order as required by Rule 1925(b). As such, Appellees argue all issues have been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant responds that he was confused as to what matters were in error because he did not have the benefit of the trial court's reasoning behind its decision. He points to the two \"Motions for Special Relief\" he filed asking the trial court to file an opinion so he could comply and file his Statement. He also notes that the trial court accepted the untimely Statement and addressed the merits of granting the motion for summary judgment. As a result, Appellant asserts, his Statement should be deemed timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By order dated September 12, 2017, this Court directed Appellees' motion to quash be decided with the merits of Appellant's appeal. Because we conclude that Appellant's Statement is untimely, we do not reach the merits because they are waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"In our early jurisprudence, this Court held that an untimely Rule 1925(b) statement did not waive all issues where the trial court issued an opinion addressing\n   the merits of the appellant's issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

Cmwlth. 2018). Appellant advocates for this approach here. However, this approach was expressly disapproved by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and now \"[w]aiver is not cured by the trial court's filing of a Rule 1925(a) opinion addressing the merits of the issues on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352457\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/176/1038/#p1041\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352457\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/176/1038/#p1041\">\n    at 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pursuant to Rule 1925(c)(2), \"[u]pon application of the appellant and for good cause shown, an appellate court may remand in a civil case for the filing nunc pro tunc of a Statement.\" Pa.R.A.P. 1925(c)(2). In his response to the motion to quash, Appellant argues he was confused as to what issues he would raise because he was without the benefit of the trial court's opinion. While we recognize it is difficult for a party, especially a pro se individual, to file a statement of errors complained of on appeal without knowing the reasoning behind a trial court's decision, the Rules provide for this exact contingency. Rule 1925(b)(4)(vi) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   If the appellant in a civil case cannot readily discern the basis for the judge's decision, the appellant shall preface the Statement with an explanation as to why the Statement has identified the errors in only general terms. In such a case, the generality of the Statement will not be grounds for finding waiver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)(vi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Consistent with this Rule, our courts have held that a vague 1925(b) statement\n   is sometimes necessary when the record lacks the trial court's reasoning, and in such cases, a vague 1925(b) statement will not be grounds for waiver.
