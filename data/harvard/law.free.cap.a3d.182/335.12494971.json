The Office appeals, essentially asking the following questions\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. Did the circuit court err as a matter of law when it ruled that it lacked\n   the legal authority to release the escrowed child support payments to the children's maternal grandmother because she was not the original payee on the child support order?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. Did the circuit court err as a matter of law when it eliminated Brown's child support arrearages?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We answer both questions in the affirmative. Therefore, we shall reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 14, 1997, Jada was born to Lashaun Polly and Douglas Brown. The following year, the Prince George's County Office of Child Support Enforcement (the \"Office\"), filed a complaint against Brown for child support on Polly's behalf. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County found in favor of Polly and ordered Brown to pay $432 per month in child support, through the Office, beginning June 1, 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 3, 2004, a second child, Sonee, was born to Polly and Brown. In 2011, the Office filed a motion to establish paternity and a motion to modify child support to include Sonee. On October 13, 2011, the circuit court declared Brown to be Sonee's father and ordered Brown to pay $818 per month in child support for both children, through the Office, beginning July 1, 2011. Finding that Brown was $1,518.01 in arrears, the court also ordered him to pay $25 per month toward the balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 8, 2014, Polly died. Jada was 17 years old; Sonee was 10. Willie Mae Polly, the children's maternal grandmother began caring for the children. On December 14, 2014, the Office began holding in escrow Brown's child support payments because there was no order authorizing the Office to release the payments to the grandmother. On April 12, 2016, the Office filed a motion to intervene on behalf of the grandmother in the child support case, seeking an order authorizing it to disburse the payments it held in escrow to the grandmother because Sonee lived with her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, Brown owed $15,557.77 in arrearages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   About three months later, in July 2016, the circuit court awarded custody of Sonee to Brown, to start on August 14, 2016; the grandmother was given reasonable visitation. On August 1, 2016, Brown filed a motion asking the circuit court to terminate his on-going child support obligation, eliminate his arrearages, and order the Office to release the escrowed child support payments to him because Sonee would soon be living with him pursuant to the custody order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 25, 2016, a magistrate held a hearing on the Office's motion to intervene. Although the Office agreed with\n   Brown that his on-going child support obligation should be terminated, the Office sought an order authorizing it to release the money it held in escrow, $5,029.77, to the grandmother. The escrowed money was child support payments Brown had made from December 14, 2014, when the Office began holding Brown's child support payments in escrow, until August 2016, when Sonee began living with Brown. Brown argued that the grandmother was not entitled to the escrowed funds because it was offset by the Social Security death\n   benefits around $1,100 per month that she received on behalf of the children following Polly's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The magistrate sympathized with the grandmother. However, the magistrate did not believe that she had the legal authority to release the escrowed funds to the grandmother, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   You know, Counsel, I agree with you that she was taking care of the children, but I have-there's no legal authority for me to give her that money. There's nothing, you know, ordering-and he does have a moral obligation to support. But he needs to do that on his own. There was no motion or no grant of support or even a change in payee was not entered in this case prior to recently. So I can't-you know, I have no legal authority, ma'am, unfortunately, to just give you this money[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The magistrate recommended, in a written proposed order, that the circuit court: order the Office to release the money held in escrow to Brown; terminate Brown's ongoing obligation to pay child support; and eliminate Brown's arrearages in their entirety. The Office filed exceptions to the magistrate's recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the subsequent exceptions hearing before the circuit court, the Office argued that the magistrate had erred in believing that she had no legal authority to release the escrowed money to the grandmother. The court, like the magistrate, also disagreed with the Office's position, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   But she voluntarily kept the children, so how can she now say that she's entitled to that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I understand, you know, from an equitable standpoint it's reasonable, but from a legal standpoint, considering the rule of law, I don't know what law to point to that says when a person takes it upon themselves to voluntarily accept the responsibility of a child, in this case her grandchildren, that she's entitled to be paid for the expenses she's incurred doing something she freely did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I just can't say that [the magistrate] erred. I don't feel comfortable. If you had case law that was on point and I could say, okay, yeah, I see your position, but without the rule of law, I don't-I can't find that what she-what her decision was, was in error. That's the problem I'm having.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 27, 2016, the circuit court entered a written order: dismissing the Office's motion to intervene as moot; directing the Office to release the escrowed money to Brown; terminating Brown's obligation to pay child support, and eliminating Brown's child support arrearages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Office filed a timely notice of appeal and a motion to stay the proceedings in circuit court pending appeal, which the circuit court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because these proceedings contain three layers (magistrate, circuit court, and appellate court), we shall first set forth the appropriate standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Colleen had cared for her minor sister, Fiona, since their mother's death three years earlier. Colleen sought custody of Fiona, a modification of child support, and arrearages from their father, who had not paid any support since their mother's death. The circuit court agreed with the father's argument that Colleen did not have standing to recover child support arrearages, and that even if she had standing it would not award arrearages to her because the amount of arrearages would be offset by the Social Security death benefits that Fiona had received. Colleen appealed and we reversed. We determined that even though Colleen was not a natural parent and had not been granted legal custody or guardianship, \"her in\n   <em>\n    loco parentis\n   </em>\n   status was sufficient to give her standing to sue [her father] for child support\" because \"[t]o conclude otherwise would run contrary to the guiding principle in all Maryland child custody and support cases: the best interests of the child.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5728338\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/136/497/\">\n    136 Md.
