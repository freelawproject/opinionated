Lima, appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying his motion to vacate his conviction following his guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit larceny in the sixth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-125b. The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion because, under General Statutes \u00a7 54-1j,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court\n   was required but failed to ask the defendant whether he understood the possible immigration consequences of\n   pleading guilty before accepting his plea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the defendant and reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history is relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On August 1, 2014, the defendant entered a plea of guilty under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to conspiracy to commit larceny in the sixth degree after he conspired with another individual to commit a shoplifting at Price Chopper in Southington. During the plea canvass, the court asked the defendant several questions, including whether he was under the influence of alcohol, drugs or any other medication. The defendant answered in the negative. The court also asked the defendant whether he had had enough time to discuss his case with his attorney and was satisfied with his attorney's advice; whether his attorney had reviewed with him all of the evidence that the state claimed that it had to prove his guilt; and whether his attorney had informed him of the maximum possible penalty he was facing in the event of conviction. The court also asked the defendant if he knew that by pleading guilty, he was giving up his right to have a trial, to require the state to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to present his own witnesses and his own testimony. The defendant responded in the affirmative to all of the\n   court's inquiries. The court then told the defendant: ''If you are not a U.S. citizen, this conviction may result in your removal from the United States or deportation under federal law.'' The court followed that admonition with the question: ''Has anyone forced or threatened you to enter your plea today?'' The defendant responded in the negative and affirmed that he was entering his plea of his own free will. The court asked the defendant: ''[I]s there any reason why I shouldn't accept your plea?'' The defendant responded: ''Not at all.'' The court found that the plea was ''knowingly and voluntarily made with the assistance of competent counsel,'' and thus ordered that it be accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thereafter, on August 11, 2015, pursuant to \u00a7 54-1j (a) and (c), the defendant filed a motion to vacate his conviction and\n   withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that the trial court improperly failed to determine whether he understood the immigration consequences of his guilty plea and that he had discussed the possible immigration consequences of the plea with his attorney before entering it. The trial court denied the defendant's motion, concluding: ''By advising the defendant in this case that his conviction for conspiracy to commit larceny could result in his removal or deportation from the United States under federal law, the trial court adequately and substantially warned the defendant that his immigration status could be adversely affected as a consequence of his decision to plead guilty. Although the trial court did not specifically inquire of the defendant if he understood the potential immigration consequences, the transcript reflects that the trial court did personally address the defendant, and that the defendant was satisfied with his counsel's representation. Specifically, the defendant told the court that he was 'absolutely' satisfied with the representation that he received from his public defender. Additionally, subsequent to advising the defendant that his plea could result\n   in his deportation or removal from the United States, the court asked the defendant if there was any reason why his plea should not be accepted. The defendant responded: '[N]ot at all.' Viewed in its entirety, the transcript indicates that the defendant understood the trial court's questions and remarks during the plea canvass. The court found the defendant's plea was knowingly and voluntarily made with the assistance of competent counsel. Implicit in that finding by the trial court is a determination that the defendant understood the court's warning about the possible immigration consequences of his guilty plea.'' The court then concluded that: ''Based on the foregoing, the undersigned finds that the trial court substantially complied with the provisions of ... \u00a7 54-1j when the defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced on August 1, 2014.''\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court erred in denying his motion to vacate the judgment on his guilty plea because the court failed to determine that he understood the possible immigration consequences of his guilty plea as required under \u00a7 54-1j (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ''[A guilty] plea, once accepted, may be withdrawn only with the permission of the court.... The burden is always on the defendant to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty.... Whether such proof is made is a question for the court in its sound discretion, and a denial of permission to withdraw is reversible only if that discretion has been abused.''

The court simply advised the defendant that his conviction could result in his removal or deportation from the United States. Rather than ask the defendant if he understood that advisement, which arguably was insufficient to comply with \u00a7 54-1j (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court asked the defendant if anyone had forced or threatened him to plead guilty. In denying the defendant's motion to vacate, the court relied upon the facts that the defendant, when entering his guilty plea, had expressed his absolute satisfaction with his attorney's representation of him and told the court that there was no reason ''at all'' that his plea should not have been accepted. Those statements by the defendant, however, are meaningless in the absence of some indication that the defendant knew and understood the potential consequences of his guilty plea. In other words, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant knew that his attorney should have discussed the potential immigration consequences with him, and thus there could have been no basis for the defendant to express a dissatisfaction with his attorney for not advising him of those potential consequences. Similarly, if the defendant did not understand the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea, he could not have known that said potential consequences might be a valid reason to ask the court not to enter his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In support of its argument that the court substantially complied with \u00a7 54-1j (a), the state relies upon\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174318\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/527/#p532\">\n    303 Conn. at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20A.3d%20237\">\n    35 A.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court affirmed the judgment denying the motion to vacate the defendant's guilty plea and held that the court had substantially complied with \u00a7 54-1j (a) even though it had not addressed the defendant personally and determined whether he understood the immigration consequences of his guilty plea because it had, instead, asked the defendant's attorney if he had discussed those consequences with the defendant and whether the defendant understood them.
