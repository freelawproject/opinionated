On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court improperly admitted evidence of his prior misconduct; (2) the trial court improperly allowed a constancy of accusation witness to testify as an expert regarding delayed disclosure; and (3) the prosecutor committed improprieties that deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. A was seven years old when the defendant began sexually abusing her in 2004. A met the defendant one year earlier, when her brother was enrolled in one of his martial arts classes. A's older sister, J, brought their brother to and from the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When J became eighteen years old, she and the defendant, who was thirty-six years old at the time, began dating. Soon after, J moved out of her parents' house\n   and began living with the defendant in an apartment in Rockville. She and the defendant married and eventually had three children together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A often stayed at J's and the defendant's apartment on weekends. She enjoyed spending time with her sister, nieces and nephews, and the defendant's daughter from a previous marriage, M, who is close in age to A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A slept in a bed in M's room when she visited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On one such weekend when A was seven, the defendant came into M's room at night, where M and A were sleeping, put his hand underneath A's pajama shirt, and began touching her chest. The defendant then put his hands down A's pajama pants and touched her vagina. A pretended to be asleep during this encounter. Thereafter, the defendant abused A in a similar manner on multiple occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Over time, the defendant's abuse of A increased in severity. Specifically, the defendant would enter M's room at night, go over to A's bed, rub A's vagina, and penetrate it with his finger. A recalled that the defendant abused her in this way \"[t]oo many times to count.\" On other occasions, the defendant put his penis in A's mouth, at times ejaculating. Furthermore, A believes that the defendant often photographed her naked body, as he sometimes came into her room and pulled her clothes off, after which she would see flashes of light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During each instance of abuse, A kept her eyes closed and pretended to be asleep because she was afraid that the defendant, who had a bad temper and held a fourth-degree black belt, might hurt her. A was still able to identify the defendant as her abuser, however, because (1) his hands felt\n   like a man's hands, and the defendant was the only adult male in the apartment, and (2) the\n   defendant, who drank often, smelled of alcohol. Despite the abuse, A continued to visit J's and the defendant's apartment, as she loved spending time with her relatives and was determined not to let the defendant \"ruin [her] fun with them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On another occasion when A was eight years old, the defendant came into M's room and picked A up from her bed. M woke up and asked her father what he was doing. The defendant told her that he was bringing A to the bathroom. The defendant then carried A to his and J's bedroom, laid her down on their bed, and performed oral sex on her. Afterward, he carried A back to her bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Another time, the defendant, J and A were in the living room watching a movie when J began performing fellatio on the defendant. The defendant told J to ask A if she wanted to join. J then twice asked A if she wanted to participate. A declined and stared at the television. When the movie finished, A walked into M's room. No further abuse occurred on that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When A was ten years old, the defendant again picked A up from her bed and carried her to his bedroom. A awoke and heard J ask the defendant, \"what if she wakes up?\" to which the defendant replied, \"don't worry, she shouldn't.\" The defendant then encouraged J to fondle A, and J put her hand up A's shirt and began touching her chest. Meanwhile, the defendant pulled down A's pants and began performing oral sex on her. Eventually, the defendant stopped and carried A back to her bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The last instance of abuse occurred when A was twelve years old. On that night, A fell asleep on the couch in the living room while watching television. At some point, A heard the defendant come home from work. Thereafter, A heard a \"rustling\" sound, which she later learned was a condom being opened. The\n   defendant then climbed on top of A and attempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis. When he was unable to fully do so, he stopped and walked out of the room. Sometime later J came into the living room. A cried out to her, and revealed to her sister that the defendant had tried to molest her. J told A that she would yell at the defendant and that it would not happen again. J then walked out of the room and came back with the defendant, who was \"freaking out, saying how he [was] going to go to jail ... [and] not going to see his kids anymore.\" J told him not to worry and that \"[A was] not going to do that.\" After this incident A rarely, if ever, returned to J's and the defendant's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2012, the defendant lost his job and he, J, and their children moved into J's parents' house, where A also lived. While he was living in the family home, A often voiced her dislike of the defendant and kept her bedroom door locked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In June, 2013, the defendant was arrested on charges stemming from a domestic violence incident during which he struck J in the face in front of their son. J's and A's father subsequently ejected the defendant from the house, and he did not return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For years, A did not disclose the abuse because she feared that the news would break up her sister's family. Furthermore, A felt betrayed by J's response to her revelation that the defendant had tried to molest her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2013, however, the defendant was arrested for sexually abusing another girl.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   When this happened, A's father asked her\n   whether the defendant had also sexually abused her. A responded that the defendant had tried to put his hands down her pants, but refused to say anything more. When A's father suggested reporting the abuse to the police, she said that she did\n   not want to because her classmates would find out. A's father, wanting to protect A, did not tell his wife or anyone else about the conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 6, 2014, when A was seventeen years old, she attended a youth group meeting at her church. Suzy Williams, an adult mentor for the group and a social worker, often brought A to the meetings. After the meeting, A told Williams that it was the best day of A's life because the man who had sexually abused her for years had been arrested, and she would never have to see him again. A also told Williams that the abuser was her brother-in-law, who was married to her sister, J. Williams asked whether the defendant had had sex with A, and she responded that he had \"went as far as he could go.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Williams, who was a mandated reporter of suspected child abuse, alerted the Department of Children and Families (department) and the police as to what A had told her. The defendant subsequently was arrested on charges arising from his abuse of A and tried before a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At trial, the court admitted into evidence three letters written by the defendant to J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the letters, the defendant, angry that J was not writing him back, threatened to reveal her role in A's abuse. Specifically, the defendant stated that J \"not only [knew] what was going on but ... helped and supported in it,\" and that, on many nights, J made arrangements for the older children so that they were not in the house, presumably to facilitate the defendant's abuse of A. The defendant also wrote that the police wanted him \"to confirm that [J] gave [him] a BJ in front of [A].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant was subsequently found guilty by the jury on all charges contained in the state's substitute information and sentenced to a total effective term of twenty-nine years incarceration followed by sixteen years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence uncharged misconduct of the defendant through C, who testified that the defendant sexually abused her. Specifically, the defendant argues that the uncharged misconduct was not sufficiently similar to the charged conduct, and that the prejudicial effect of its admission outweighed its probative value. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. On July 30, 2015, the state filed a motion to join for trial three separate cases alleging sexual misconduct against the defendant. On August 26, 2015, the defendant filed an objection to the state's motion for joinder. That same day, the court held a hearing on the state's motion. At the hearing, the state amended its motion, requesting to join only two of the three cases-those involving A and C. The state argued that joining those two cases was appropriate because the evidence in each case would likely be cross admissible pursuant to the\n   standard for introduction of uncharged sexual misconduct set forth in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713810\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/418/\">\n    288 Conn. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%2045\">\n    953 A.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). The defendant responded that doing so would substantially prejudice him because the severity of misconduct alleged in the case involving A was far greater than that alleged in the case involving C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court denied the state's motion, finding that, although the respective incidents of alleged abuse as to A and C were not too remote in time, and C and A\n   were similarly situated, the alleged abuse of A and C was not sufficiently similar to warrant trying the cases together. Specifically, the court found that the defendant's abuse of A was far greater in duration, frequency, and invasiveness. Moreover, the court found that introducing evidence of the defendant's alleged abuse of A in the trial concerning his alleged abuse of C would be more prejudicial than probative. The court made clear, however, that its ruling did not preclude the admissibility of the defendant's alleged abuse of C in the trial concerning his abuse of A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On September 28, 2015, the defendant filed a motion in limine in the present case, in which he sought to preclude the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence at trial, arguing that any such evidence was not relevant and, even if deemed relevant, its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. The next day, the state filed a notice of its intent to introduce uncharged misconduct evidence at trial \"to establish the defendant's propensity to sexually assault young girls ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On October 5, 2015, the court heard argument on the defendant's motion in limine. At that time, the prosecutor made an offer of proof regarding the anticipated testimony of C. Specifically, the state proffered that (1) C, like A, was a minor when she was allegedly abused by the defendant; (2) C was friends with the defendant's daughter, M, and was \"like a little sister\" to J; (3) on the day of the alleged abuse, C spent the night at the defendant's house and fell asleep on the couch in the living room watching a movie with the defendant and J; (4) on three separate occasions throughout the night and into the morning the defendant attempted to touch C's vagina while she was sleeping, both over and under her clothes; and (5) C believed that the defendant also may have taken photographs of her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The state argued that the uncharged misconduct evidence was relevant because it was not too remote in\n   time to the last alleged incident of abuse of A, which had occurred about one year prior. The state also argued that the charged and uncharged misconduct were sufficiently similar because C, like A, alleged that the defendant had touched her vagina over and under her clothes while she was sleeping. Furthermore, the state argued that the escalation of the abuse of A did not preclude admissibility of C's testimony because the defendant had access to C for only a short period of time and, therefore, the defendant did not have an opportunity to escalate his abuse of her. Finally, the state argued that the prejudicial effect of the uncharged misconduct evidence did not outweigh its probative value because it supported the defendant's propensity to sexually assault young girls, and the defendant's alleged abuse of C was far less severe than that of A. In response, the defendant argued that the uncharged misconduct evidence was \"detrimental\" to him, and requested that, because the state had not proffered the live testimony of C, the court defer ruling on its motion until the defense could voir dire her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court subsequently granted the state's motion to introduce uncharged misconduct evidence through C, provided that C testified consistently with the state's\n   proffer at trial. In doing so, the court concluded that the state's proffer satisfied the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   and that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At trial, C testified consistently with the state's proffer. Specifically, she testified that she was a childhood friend of the defendant's daughter, M. During the fall of 2011, J reached out to C, who was thirteen years old at the time, to arrange a sleepover with M at the defendant's apartment. When C arrived, however, M was not there. Instead, C spent the day with J and her two sons. That evening, J and C watched movies in the\n   living room. The defendant arrived home at approximately 11 p.m. C fell asleep on the couch early the next morning, at about 3 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A short while later, C awoke to the defendant trying to touch her vagina over her sweatpants. C pushed him away, told him to move, and went back to sleep. Not long after that, C awoke again to the defendant touching her vagina-this time under her clothes. She pushed him away and asked him what he was doing. C then awoke a third time to the defendant grabbing her vagina over her sweatpants. This time, C asked the defendant, \"[w]hat the hell was wrong with [him].\" The defendant grabbed C's arm and told her not to say anything. C then told J, who was also in the living room during the three incidents, what had happened. J responded that the defendant must have thought C was her. C told J she was lying and called her guardian to come pick her up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After C testified, the court gave the jury a limiting instruction regarding the proper use of uncharged misconduct evidence. Specifically, the court instructed the jury that evidence of the defendant's misconduct toward C was not sufficient to prove that the defendant was guilty of the crimes charged. The court further instructed the jury that the state still had the burden of proving every element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. In its final charge, the court instructed the jury a second time about the proper use of uncharged misconduct evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On October 26, 2015, after the defendant was found guilty, he filed a motion for a new trial wherein he claimed, inter alia, that the court improperly admitted the uncharged misconduct evidence. On January 8, 2016, after argument, the court denied the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We begin our analysis of the defendant's claim by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \"The admission of evidence of prior uncharged misconduct is a decision properly within the discretion of the trial court .... [Every] reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court's ruling .... [T]he trial court's decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243753\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/128/633/#p638\">\n    128 Conn.

The abuse of A occurred between 2004 and 2010, and the abuse of C occurred in 2011. Because the defendant's abuse of C occurred only one year after the last instance of abuse with respect to A, the uncharged conduct is not too remote in time relative to the charged conduct.

The defendant offers no explanation regarding how the uncharged misconduct\n   evidence tended to show something other than his propensity to sexually assault young girls and, as we have already noted, that is a proper purpose for which it may be considered. Furthermore, the defendant's misconduct as to C was far less egregious than that as to A. It is therefore unlikely that C's testimony improperly aroused the emotions of the jury.\n   We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the uncharged misconduct evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly permitted Williams to testify as an expert on delayed disclosure and common behaviors of child sexual abuse victims because she (1) had already testified as a constancy of accusation witness, and (2) was unqualified\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to testify as an expert. We decline to review the former assertion because it was not preserved at trial and, with respect to the witness' qualifications, we are not persuaded that the court abused its discretion in concluding that Williams was qualified to render her opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. The defendant filed a motion in limine prior to\n   trial to prevent the state from eliciting testimony from A regarding her disclosure of abuse to others unless the state had good cause to believe that those individuals would be available to testify. During the state's direct examination of A, A testified that she had disclosed the abuse to Williams, J, and her father. On cross-examination, the defendant challenged A's credibility and elicited from her that she did not reveal the abuse to Williams until 2014, that she never revealed the abuse to her mother, and that she had never sought medical treatment or therapy as a result of the abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   After A testified, the state called Williams. Williams testified that she was employed as a social worker at a high school. Regarding her background, Williams testified that she had received both a bachelor's degree in psychology and master's degree in social work from the University of Connecticut. Williams further testified that she had received her first level of licensure three months before the trial, was working toward her final level, and hoped to become a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) by the end of\n   the year. To become an LCSW, students are required to complete three thousand working hours, one hundred of which must be supervised by a licensed clinician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Williams testified that, in order to complete the required clinical hours, she had volunteered as a director for a church youth group for the past ten years. It was through this volunteer work that Williams met A. Williams then testified regarding A's disclosure of the defendant's abuse. When the state asked Williams whether she thought it was important to press A for specific details, Williams replied, \"I did not. Oftentimes when dealing with kids-.\" The defendant then objected, citing as the basis of the objection that Williams was not \"qualified to give an opinion at [that] point.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court excused the jury and asked the state what line of questioning it intended to pursue. The state responded that Williams had completed her constancy of accusation testimony, but that it also wanted to elicit testimony from Williams regarding her experience as a social worker interacting with children who disclose sexual abuse. Specifically, the state wanted to elicit that, in Williams' experience, children often delay in disclosing abuse. The state argued that Williams was permitted to testify about her observations and experience as long as such testimony was relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The court then asked the state to voir dire Williams and thereby lay a foundation for her testimony regarding delayed disclosure and common characteristics of sexual abuse victims. During voir dire, Williams testified as to the following: (1) while working as the director of the church youth program, eight teenagers had disclosed sexual abuse to her, (2) Williams had attended two different trainings on how, as a mandated reporter, she should properly handle disclosures of sexual abuse by children, (3) as part of her training, Williams was taught that she should not press children for details of sexual abuse, (4) Williams also learned, through training, of various behaviors that children who are sexually abused commonly exhibit, including delayed disclosure, (5) the purpose of Williams' training was to assist her in preparing to work with sexual abuse victims in the future, (6) during her work as a school social worker, five children had disclosed to Williams that they had been sexually abused, and (7) she had been the person to whom the students first disclosed abuse. Thereafter, the defendant also conducted a voir dire of Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The state then clarified once again that it only sought to elicit from Williams (1) testimony as to how common it is for children to delay disclosing abuse, and (2) the\n   reasons for that phenomenon. The defendant again objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court then ruled that Williams was qualified to answer questions regarding delayed disclosure. The court based its ruling on the fact that Williams had received her master's degree in social work and acquired her first level of licensure, was close to obtaining her LCSW license, had training and practical experience interacting with school-age students who disclose sexual abuse, and had worked with a total of fourteen students who had done so. The court reminded both the state and Williams that she could not testify about why A may have delayed her disclosure or how her conduct was consistent with someone who had been sexually abused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Thereafter, the jury returned and the court provided a limiting instruction regarding constancy of accusation testimony. The prosecutor then proceeded to question Williams about her training as a mandated reporter and the topic of delayed disclosure. Williams testified that, through her work as a social worker and director of the youth group, approximately thirteen or\n   fourteen children had disclosed to her that they had been sexually abused. Regarding delayed disclosure, Williams testified that children often wait to disclose abuse because (1) they do not want to upset family members or friends who would be affected by the news, (2) they fear what will happen if their friends find out about the abuse, and (3) children often feel as though they did something to deserve the abuse and do not want that fear validated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The court, during its final charge to the jury, subsequently gave an instruction regarding the proper purpose for which the jury could consider constancy of accusation and expert testimony. Specifically, the court instructed the jury that the testimony of the constancy of accusation witnesses \"was ... limited in its scope\n   to the fact and timing of [A's] complaint, the place and nature of the alleged sexual assault, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator.\" Regarding expert testimony, the court instructed the jury that Williams had testified as an expert and that such testimony was entitled \"to such weight as [the jury] find[s] the expert's qualifications in her field entitle it to receive ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The defendant first argues that the court improperly allowed Williams to testify as an expert regarding delayed disclosure because she had also testified as a constancy of accusation witness.

The defendant initially stated that the basis for his objection to Williams testifying further was that she was not qualified to give an opinion \"at [that] point.\" After the court ruled that Williams would be allowed to testify regarding delayed disclosure, the defendant subsequently reiterated his objection. In doing so, the defendant stated three grounds as the basis for the objection: (1) the state had not disclosed to the defendant prior to trial that Williams would testify as an expert, (2) the state was attempting to improperly bolster A's credibility, and (3) Williams did not qualify as an expert in that field because she did not have the necessary experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The defendant also argued that Williams' testimony was improper because, as a mandated reporter, anything she asked A would have been in \"preparation for the prosecutor's case.\" The court then asked defense counsel how Williams' actions as a mandated reporter rendered her ineligible to offer an opinion, to which defense counsel responded, \"[w]ell, going back to, basically, she's not an expert witness, Your Honor, so she cannot ... render an opinion.\" Finally, the defendant made one final objection on the ground that Williams might attempt to relate her testimony regarding the general phenomenon of delayed disclosure back to A's disclosure. None of the defendant's many stated bases for his objection, however, is consistent with the claim he now makes on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court's response to the defendant's objections further supports our view that the defendant's claim is unpreserved, as the record indicates that the court did not understand the defendant to be objecting to Williams' prospective expert testimony because it exceeded the proper scope of the constancy of accusation doctrine. This is evidenced by the great lengths the court took to address the defendant's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The court first addressed the defendant's argument that the state improperly failed to disclose Williams as an expert, asking whether there was anything in the defendant's request for disclosure that would have required the state to \"specifically delineate who [its] experts were going to be ....\" Second, per the defendant's request, the court cautioned Williams that she was not \"in any way\" to relate her testimony regarding delayed disclosure \"to what [A] did or did not do,\" and confirmed with defense counsel that its instruction was satisfactory. Finally, the court noted that Williams' qualifications were \"the core issue\" with respect to the defendant's objection. Thus, it clearly explained why it believed that Williams was qualified to testify as an expert regarding\n   delayed disclosure, citing her employment, experience, training, and education. At no point did the court indicate that it understood the defendant to be objecting to Williams' testimony on the ground that he now asserts on appeal. We therefore conclude that the defendant's claim is unpreserved and decline to review it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly allowed Williams to testify as an expert because she was unqualified. Specifically, the defendant argues that Williams was unqualified because only fourteen children had disclosed to her that they had been sexually abused, she had never been deemed an expert in the field, and she had substantially less experience than witnesses who had testified as experts in other cases involving child victims of sexual abuse, citing\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grenier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963421\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/797/#p808\">\n    257 Conn. 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20159\">\n    778 A.2d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (testifying expert treated more than 900 victims of sexual abuse), and\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spigarolo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"563578\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/210/359/#p376\">\n    210 Conn. 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 376,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20A.2d%20112\">\n    556 A.2d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (expert evaluated and treated 100 to 150 cases of child sexual abuse), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11419207,11418984,11419240,11419277,11419086,11419407,11419441,11419317,11418807,11418939,11419037,11419358,11419135\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/933/\">\n    493 U.S. 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20S.%20Ct.%20322\">\n    110 S.Ct. 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20312\">\n    107 L.Ed.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).

At the time of trial, Williams had both practical experience and the relevant educational background regarding the issue of delayed disclosure. She had studied characteristics of child victims of sexual abuse in obtaining her bachelor's and master's degrees. Moreover, Williams had received training through the department and other programs on how to handle, as a mandated reporter, a student's first disclosure of abuse. Furthermore, while employed as a school social worker and director of the youth group, Williams was told by approximately thirteen or fourteen students that they had been sexually abused.

Specifically, the defendant argues that the prosecutor asked questions during cross-examination and made statements during closing argument that suggested that the defendant was required to provide an explanation as to why A and C would falsely accuse him of sexually abusing them. The defendant believes that the alleged improprieties diluted, distorted, and shifted the state's burden of proof, and were \"tantamount to a direct statement that the defendant had the burden of proving or disproving the state's case.\" We are not persuaded that the prosecutor's conduct deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. At trial, the defendant testified in his own defense. Specifically, the defendant testified that he never sexually abused A, either in concert with J or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The defendant also denied that he ever sexually abused C. The defendant instead offered that he, J, and C had fallen asleep watching a movie on a couch in the defendant's living room, and that he overheard C complain to J that the defendant had rolled over and put his hand on her leg in his sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The defendant further testified that, when he was unemployed, he began selling marijuana in order to support his family. On cross-examination, the defendant stated that J used to make marijuana deliveries for him on occasion, and that any incriminating statements in the letters he sent J from prison referred to his drug\n   dealing operation. The following exchange then occurred between the prosecutor and the defendant:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \"Q.

The prosecutor then referenced specific parts of the defendant's letters to J and asked him to explain how they pertained to his supposed drug dealing. The defendant maintained that his letters did not constitute admissions of sexual assault and were consistent with his admission that he sold marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Thereafter, during the state's closing argument, the prosecutor again addressed the defendant's letters to J, stating: \"If that isn't enough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the charges against the defendant, I also ask you to consider the defendant's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \"Ask ... yourselves, how credible did he come across?

Applying these factors to the questions and statements at issue in the present case, we conclude that the defendant was not denied due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   At the outset, we acknowledge that two of the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors tend to support the defendant's claim. First, the potential impropriety was not invited by the defendant. The state concedes as much. Second, the potential impropriety concerned a critical issue in the case-whether A and C had a motive to lie about the defendant's sexual abuse of them. When considered in context with the remaining four factors, however, it is clear that the potential impropriety did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Regarding the severity of the potential impropriety, it is significant that defense counsel did not object to either the prosecutor's line of questioning on cross-examination or her comments during closing argument. Our appellate courts have often given \"considerable weight to the fact that defense counsel did not object to ... [the alleged] improprieties\" and considered it \"a strong indicator that counsel did not perceive them as seriously jeopardizing the defendant's fair trial rights.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%2022\">\n    320 Conn. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20431\">\n    128 A.3d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Indeed, \"counsel's failure to object at trial, while not by itself fatal to a defendant's claim, frequently will indicate on appellate review that the challenged\n   comments do not rise to the magnitude of constitutional error ... [necessary] ... [to] clearly depriv[e] ... the defendant of a fair trial ....\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2636117\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/266/440/#p484\">\n    266 Conn. 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20A.2d%20626\">\n    832 A.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). Thus, the defendant's failure to object in both instances suggests that any impropriety was not severe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Furthermore, the severity of the impropriety is often \"counterbalanced in part by the third\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factor, namely, the frequency of the [impropriety] ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Angel T\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145535\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/262/#p289\">\n    292 Conn. 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 289,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201207\">\n    973 A.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The defendant argues that the potential impropriety was \"somewhat frequent\" and not \"just one brief isolated comment.\" The defendant takes issue, however, only with three questions contained in thirty-five transcribed pages of cross-examination, and a few isolated statements contained in the prosecutor's entire closing argument. \"Improper statements that are minor and isolated will generally not taint the overall fairness of an entire trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Felix R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%201\">\n    319 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20A.3d%20871\">\n    124 A.3d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Thus, while the potential impropriety does not encompass merely one question or statement, it certainly cannot be characterized as \"frequent\" when considered in the context of a lengthy cross-examination and closing argument.

Furthermore, even absent a specific curative instruction, the court's general written and oral instructions, in which it repeatedly stated that the prosecution had the burden of proving the elements of each crime charged in the information beyond a reasonable doubt and clearly explained the concept of the presumption of innocence, sufficiently cured any potential confusion by the jury. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Albino\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20763\">\n    312 Conn. at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20478\">\n    97 A.3d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (although defendant's \"failure to object or to ask for such measures to be taken deprived the court of an opportunity to address the improprieties with any specificity,\" court's general instructions nonetheless likely mitigated effect of improprieties).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   We now turn to the last\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factor, which assesses the overall strength of the state's case. Here, the state's case was quite strong. To begin, A's testimony was directly corroborated in part by J, who was an eyewitness and, at times, a participant in the defendant's sexual abuse of A. J corroborated A's testimony that she had performed fellatio on the defendant in front of A and asked A to join in. J also corroborated A's testimony that the defendant had brought A to his bedroom on at least one occasion, and, on that occasion, J fondled A's breasts at the request of the defendant. A's allegations were further corroborated by C's testimony concerning uncharged misconduct of the defendant. The incident C described at trial-during\n   which the defendant repeatedly tried to put his hands down her pants while she was asleep on the couch in his living room-was very similar to A's testimony that the defendant would often touch her when she was asleep in her bed or on the couch in the living room.\n   Moreover, C, like A, testified that she believed the defendant had secretly taken photographs or videos of her. C's testimony regarding the defendant's uncharged misconduct was properly introduced as propensity evidence. Therefore, the jury was free to conclude that because the defendant had sexually abused C, it was more likely that he had committed the sexual misconduct for which he was being tried. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Finally, A's allegations were corroborated by the defendant's own written statements, contained in his letters to J. Specifically, the defendant wrote: (1) \"they want me to confirm that you gave me a BJ in front of your sister cause you said you did I say nothing if I did you would be in jail to[o],\" (2) \"not only did [J] know what was going on but [she] helped and supported in it,\" (3) on \"many nights [J] ... arranged so the older kids weren't home,\" and (4) that \"had [J] said nothing they couldn't have made the charges stick but [she] sealed that deal.\" Thus, the defendant's own statements supported A's allegations that he had sexually abused her\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and even referenced a specific instance of abuse testified to by J. Therefore, considering that A's testimony was corroborated extensively, we conclude that the state's case was strong despite the lack of physical evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In sum, we conclude that (1) the potential impropriety was neither severe nor frequent, (2) the court's instructions were sufficient to correct any confusion the jury may have had regarding the state's burden of proof, and (3) the state's case was strong overall. We therefore conclude that the questions and statements made by the prosecutor and challenged by the defendant on appeal did not deprive him of his due process right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    For ease of discussion, we address the defendant's claims in a different order than that in which they appear in his brief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    The defendant also had a son from a previous marriage, who occasionally spent the weekend at the defendant's apartment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    C, the victim of that abuse, testified for the state in the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    J was also arrested on charges stemming from the abuse of her sister after partially admitting to her own involvement.

Furthermore, the defendant argues that the court's instructions in its final charge \"would have led the jury to believe that C's claims had been proven, resulting in more prejudice to the defendant.\" Because the defendant did not object at trial to the court's instruction regarding uncharged misconduct evidence either immediately after C's testimony or during the court's final charge, and does not seek review under\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    ; see\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/\">\n     213 Conn. 233\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 239-40,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n     567 A.2d 823\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1989), as modified by\n    <em>\n     In re Yasiel R.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n     317 Conn. 773\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 781,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n     120 A.3d 1188\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2015) ; or the plain error doctrine; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 ; his claim is unpreserved.

The first complainant alleged that the defendant had kissed her on her cheeks, remarked that her breasts were \"soft and beautiful,\" pinched her nipples, tapped her pelvic bone and told her that she was \"so hot,\" firmly massaged her breasts with his hands, asked if he could kiss her breasts, and proceeded to put his mouth on her breasts.

In\n    <em>\n     Gupta\n    </em>\n    , the defendant's conduct toward two of the complainants did not escalate beyond inappropriate touching. The first and only time he molested the first complainant, however, the abuse was far more severe and included tapping her pelvic bone, putting his mouth on her breasts, and biting her in a sexual manner. Thus, the defendant's initial advances toward the other two complainants were dissimilar to his initial advance toward the first complainant. In the present case, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Gupta\n    </em>\n    , the defendant's initial advances toward C and A were nearly identical.\n    <em>\n     Gupta\n    </em>\n    therefore does not support the defendant's claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The defendant argues in his reply brief that the state failed to give adequate notice that Williams would testify as an expert at trial. At oral argument, however, the defendant conceded that he never raised this claim in his principal brief on appeal. Thus, we decline to review the defendant's claim of inadequate notice.

The defendant also claims that the court improperly permitted Dawn Jackle, a department social worker who was assigned to the case, to testify as an expert because she was unqualified. Because the defendant did not object to Jackle's testimony at trial, his claim is unpreserved. Furthermore, the defendant's postverdict motion for a new trial, in which he argued for the first time that Jackle did not properly qualify as an expert and that her testimony was more prejudicial than probative, was likewise insufficient to preserve his claim for review.

Although the state was entitled to argue that there did not appear to be any reason or motive for A or C to concoct a story that the defendant had sexually assaulted them, the form of the prosecutor's questions and the manner in which she presented a portion of her closing argument risked confusing the jury as to the appropriate burden of proof because they suggested that the state was entitled to a guilty verdict in the absence of the defendant coming forward with evidence, or at least a theory, as to the witnesses' motives to fabricate their claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    We do not find persuasive the defendant's explanation that his letters referred to a drug dealing operation, as his testimony was not supported by any other evidence at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The defendant argues that \"[t]he case against the defendant cannot be considered strong ...

Furthermore, A's allegations were corroborated extensively in other ways. Therefore, the defendant is incorrect that the lack of physical evidence rendered the state's case weak.
