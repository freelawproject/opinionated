On appeal, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that the possession of the pipe bombs was protected by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Tagg\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">A federal grand jury returned a single-count indictment against Tagg, Brandon Woll, and Michael Morgan, charging them with aiding and abetting one another in the unlawful possession of a firearm, specifically, an unregistered destructive device, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5841, 5861(d), and 5871, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Woll and Morgan pled guilty pursuant to written plea agreements, and Tagg proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-13\">At trial, the government called Kelly Boaz, a bomb technician with the Orange County Sheriffs Office. He testified, <em>inter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-14\"><em>alia, </em>that on July 2, 2007, he was called to investigate an explosive device that detonated inside a trash receptacle in downtown Walt Disney World. Boaz determined that the explosive device had been a pipe bomb, as there were pieces of galvanized pipe found in and around the trash receptacle. The investigation \u201cwent cold\u201d until September 2007, at which time Boaz received an anonymous tip, informing him that Woll, Morgan, and a woman named Sarah Folsom were responsible for the pipe bomb. Boaz subsequently interviewed Tagg, whose name had come up during the investigation, and Tagg informed him that, although he had driven Woll and Morgan to the Bass Pro Shop, where he had purchased cashew nuts, he did not recall purchasing gunpowder there. Morgan informed Boaz during the investigation that the devices had been manufactured in Tagg\u2019s garage, and, upon searching Tagg\u2019s garage with his consent, Boaz found a drill, a vice grip, and PVC pipe that Morgan indicated were used to manufacture the pipe bombs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-15\">The government called Morgan, who testified that he and Woll built three pipe bombs on July 1, 2007, using galvanized steel pipe, gunpowder, a vice grip, and a drill. Because Woll and Morgan were only 20 years old \u2014 and they believed that they had to be 21 to purchase gunpowder \u2014 they asked Tagg to buy it for them so that they could make pipe bombs. Tagg reluctantly agreed, drove them to the Bass Pro Shop, and purchased gunpowder and cashews. Morgan and Woll made the pipe bombs in Tagg\u2019s garage, during which time Tagg sat in his chair seven or eight feet away, read the newspaper, and looked over at them occasionally. After Morgan and Woll finished constructing the pipe bombs and showed one to Tagg, Morgan expressed an interest in lighting one right there, but Tagg said, \u201cNo. Go off somewhere else.\u201d As a result, Morgan and Woll left Tagg\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>house and lit two of the pipe bombs, only the first of which exploded. They then went to see a movie at Disney World, after which time, at around midnight, Morgan, Woll, and Folsom detonated the third pipe bomb in the trash receptacle at Disney World.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">The government called Agent Lori McLaughlin of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (\u201cATF\u201d), the lead investigator in the case. She testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that she went to the Bass Pro Shop, where the store manager provided a receipt indicating that, on July 1, 2007, someone purchased cashew nuts and gunpowder. Although the customer paid in cash, the manager was able to retrieve the telephone number provided by the customer, which McLaughlin later discovered to be Tagg\u2019s home phone number.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McLaughlin, like Boaz, later discovered in Tagg\u2019s basement the drill and vice grip that Morgan indicated he used to make the pipe bombs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">After the government rested, the defense called Tagg and Woll, who were stepfather and stepson. They both testified that, although Tagg drove Woll and Morgan to the Bass Pro Shop, Tagg did not purchase the gunpowder, did not know that Woll and Morgan planned to build pipe bombs, and did not see them build the pipe bombs in his garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">The jury ultimately returned a guilty verdict against Tagg on the sole count of the indictment. At no time did the defense move for a judgment of acquittal. The court subsequently sentenced Tagg to two years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">\u201cWe review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and accepting all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>528 F.3d 811, 814 (11th Cir.) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. --, 129 S.Ct. 292, 172 L.Ed.2d 150 (2008). As the government points out, our standard of review is even more deferential here because Tagg did not move for a judgment of acquittal in the district court. As a result, \u201cwe may reverse the conviction only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. This standard requires the appellate court to find that the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). As discussed below, Tagg cannot show that upholding his conviction would result in a miscarriage of justice because, even applying our traditional sufficiency standard of review, he would not be entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-15\">The National Firearms Act (\u201cNFA\u201d) makes it unlawful for any person \u201cto receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record[.]\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 5841(a) (establishing the central registry). The statute defines the term \u201cfirearm\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>a \u201cdestructive device,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5845(a)(8), which, in turn, is defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany explosive ... bomb,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5845(f)(1)(A). \u201cAlthough \u00a7 5861(d) contains no express <em>mens rea </em>requirement, the Supreme Court has held that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant <em>knew </em>that the weapon he possessed had the characteristics that brought it within the statutory definition of a firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>255 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>600, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994)). In other words, the government must prove that the defendant was aware of the features subjecting the firearm to registration; however, the government does not have to prove that the defendant knew \u201cwhat features define a \u2018firearm\u2019 under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>253 F.3d 634, 638 &amp; n. 4 (11th Cir. 2001). Nor is the government required to prove \u201cthat the defendant knew that his possession was unlawful, or that the firearm was unregistered.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>255 F.3d at 1286 n. 3 (citing <em>United States v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">In this case, it is undisputed that Tagg was not convicted of actually possessing an unregistered firearm, but was rather convicted of aiding and abetting such unlawful possession by Woll and Morgan. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a) (\u201cWhoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\u201d). \u201cTo prove guilt under a theory of aiding and abetting, the Government must prove: (1) the substantive offense was committed by someone; (2) the defendant committed an act which contributed to and furthered the offense; and (3) the defendant intended to aid in its commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>233 F.3d 1308, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-6\">The first element above is not at issue in this case, as both Woll and Morgan, who actually possessed the pipe bombs, pled guilty to violations of \u00a7 5861(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, Tagg\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that he was a \u201cmere spectator\u201d and, thus, did not intentionally facilitate Woll and Morgan\u2019s possession of the pipe bombs. However, there was substantial evidence introduced at trial that could have allowed a reasonable jury to reach a contrary conclusion. Most significantly, Morgan testified that Tagg drove Woll and Morgan to the Bass Pro Shop, purchased gunpowder for them with the understanding that they planned to use it to build pipe bombs, observed Woll and Morgan build the pipe bombs in his garage with his tools, saw the finished product, and told them to go light the pipe bombs somewhere else. Morgan\u2019s testimony was corroborated in part by Officer Boaz and Agent McLaughlin, who discovered in Tagg\u2019s garage the tools that Woll and Morgan used to build the pipe bombs. McLaughlin also testified that, in investigating the gunpowder transaction, she discovered that the purchaser provided the Bass Pro Shop with Tagg\u2019s home telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">The defense introduced conflicting testimony through both Tagg and Woll, namely, that Tagg did not purchase the gunpowder and was unaware that Woll and Morgan planned to, and, in fact, did, build <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>pipe bombs in his garage. However, the jury clearly did not believe their testimony, and Tagg offers no reason on appeal why we should disturb the jury\u2019s credibility determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Siegelman, </em>561 F.3d 1215, 1219 (11th Cir. 2009) (explaining that we defer to the jury\u2019s credibility determinations); <em>United States v. Pearson, </em>746 F.2d 787, 794 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cAlthough there was substantial conflicting defense testimony, all conflicts in the evidence must defer to the jury\u2019s resolution of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d). Thus, in light of the testimony given by Morgan, Officer Boaz, and Agent McLaughlin, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Tagg intentionally facilitated Woll and Morgan\u2019s unlawful possession of the pipe bombs. <em>See Camacho, </em>233 F.3d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">Finally, and as noted above, Tagg contends that he was unaware of the features subjecting Woll and Morgan\u2019s \u201cfirearm\u201d to registration and, therefore, lacked the requisite <em>mens rea. </em>This contention is without merit because substantial circumstantial evidence introduced at trial established that Tagg knew that Woll and Morgan made pipe bombs. <em>See Staples, </em>511 U.S. at 615 n. 11, 114 S.Ct. at 1802 n. 11 (\u201c[KJnowledge can be inferred from circumstantial evidence, including any external indications signaling the nature of the weapon.\u201d). Indeed, not only did Morgan testify that he and Woll explicitly told Tagg that they intended to build pipe bombs, but Morgan also testified that he showed Tagg the pipe bombs in their final form. <em>See Miller, </em>255 F.3d at 1287 (concluding that the government sufficiently proved the defendant\u2019s knowledge where the feature at issue \u2014 the length of a shotgun barrel \u2014 was \u201ca patently obvious characteristic, readily apparent to anyone ... who observes the gun\u201d); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>253 F.3d 607, 611 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[TJhe jury could have inferred the requisite knowledge from the condition of the object.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">In sum, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find Tagg guilty of aiding and abetting the possession of an unregistered firearm. For this reason, Tagg has not shown that upholding his conviction would result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See Bender, </em>290 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">\u201cWe review constitutional claims <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Anton, </em>546 F.3d 1355, 1357 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2033, 173 L.Ed.2d 1089 (2009). Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent, landmark decision in <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), Tagg argues that his conviction violated his right to keep and bears arms under the Second Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Second Amendment provides: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. II; <em>see also Heller, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2789 (\u201cThe Second Amendment is naturally divided into two parts: its prefatory clause and its operative clause. The former does not limit the latter grammatically, but rather announces a purpose. The Amendment could be rephrased, \u2018Because a well regulated Militia is necessary to the security of a free State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">Before <em>Heller, </em>the scope of the Second Amendment was largely defined by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>307 U.S. 174, 59 S.Ct. 816, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939). In that case, the Court upheld against a Second Amendment challenge two defendants\u2019 convictions under the NFA for possession of an unregistered short-barreled shotgun. <em>Id. </em>at 175, 59 S.Ct. at 816. In a much-quoted passage, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-5\">In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a \u201cshotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length\u201d at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 178, 59 S.Ct. at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">In striking down the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on the possession of usable handguns, the Supreme Court in <em>Heller </em>concluded, for the first time, that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to possess weapons unconnected with militia service. <em>See </em>128 S.Ct. at 2787-812; <em>see also id. </em>at 2797 (stating that the Second Amendment \u201cguarantee^] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation\u201d). The Court explained that this individual right comported with the purpose of the Amendment \u2014 to prevent the elimination of the militia \u2014 because \u201cthe way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able-bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people\u2019s arms ....\u201d Id at 2801.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">The Court emphasized, however, that \u201cthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited,\u201d and one \u201cimportant limitation\u201d came from the Court\u2019s previous opinion in <em>Miller. Id. </em>at 2816-17. Specifically, the <em>Heller </em>Court explained that <em>Miller </em>stood only for the proposition that \u201cthe Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2815-lb. The Court found that limiting the type of weapons protected to those that were \u201cin common use at the time\u201d was \u201cfairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2817 (quotations omitted). The Court further explained that this limitation reinforced its earlier conclusion about the way in which the Second Amendment\u2019s operative clause furthered the Amendment\u2019s purpose. <em>See id. </em>at 2815-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">Applying <em>Heller </em>to the facts of this case, we conclude that the pipe bombs at issue were not protected by the Second Amendment. Unlike the handguns in <em>Heller, </em>pipe bombs are not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes. <em>See United States v. Dempsey, </em>957 F.2d 831, 834 (11th Cir.1992) (adopting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning that, \u201cunlike firearms which may be used for sports, recreation or for collection, pipe bombs have no legitimate purpose\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Loveday, </em>922 F.2d 1411, 1416 (9th Cir. 1991));<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>see also United States v. Fincher, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>538 F.3d 868, 870, 873-74 (8th Cir.2008) (holding that, after <em>Heller, </em>the defendant\u2019s possession of a machine gun and an unregistered sawed-off shotgun was not protected by the Second Amendment because those weapons were \u201cnot in common use by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes and therefore [fell] within the category of dangerous and unusual weapons that the government can prohibit for individual use\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1369, 173 L.Ed.2d 591 (2009); <em>cf. Heller, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2817-18, 2821-22 (striking down the handgun ban because it \u201camounted] to a prohibition of an entire class of \u2018arms\u2019 that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d for the lawful purpose of self-defense in the home, which \u201chas been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d). Thus, under <em>Heller, </em>Tagg\u2019s conviction did not violate the Second Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Tagg\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1349-10\">. The government later called Jeff Lyons, the loss prevention manager of the Bass Pro Shop, who corroborated McLaughlin\u2019s testimony about the transaction, receipt, and phone number.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">. In this respect, we note that Tagg does not dispute that the pipe bombs qualified as \"firearms\u201d under \u00a7 5845(a)(8) and (f)(1). It is true that Tagg cites our decision in <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>371 F.3d 776 (11th Cir. 2004), which held that, in order for an explosive device to so qualify, the government must prove that it was \"designed as a weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780 (\"Thus, a device that explodes is not covered by the statute merely because it explodes. Statutory coverage depends upon proof that a device is an explosive <em>plus </em>proof that it was designed as a weapon.\u201d); <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(f) (excluding from coverage any destructive device that was neither \"designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon\u201d). However, Tagg cites <em>Hammond </em>only to support his distinct <em>mens rea </em>argument' \u2014 addressed below \u2014 that he was unaware of the features subjecting the pipe bombs to registration. Thus, Tagg has abandoned any contention that the pipe bombs did not constitute \"firearms\u201d under the statute. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (stating that arguments not raised on appeal are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">. Indeed, a review of both Tagg and Woll\u2019s testimony reveals several material inconsistencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">. For the sake of preservation, Tagg also raises several other constitutional issues on appeal, but he concedes that they are foreclosed by case law.
