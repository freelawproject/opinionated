Appellant was sentenced to a jail term of five to twenty-five years for the manslaughter conviction and additional three years for the gun specification. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">Appellant was indicted on June 17, 1992 on one count of aggravated murder with a firearm specification and a second count of carrying a weapon while under disability with a firearm specification. Appellant pled not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">Prior to the commencement of appellant\u2019s trial, he changed his not guilty plea to a guilty plea. In exchange for his plea, the state nolled the second count and amended appellant\u2019s charge to voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">Appellant was read his rights by the trial court, pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C), before the court accepted his plea and pronounced his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b522-17\">Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-18\">\u201cThe trial court erred in in [sic ] accepting appellant\u2019s guilty plea, as Criminal Rule 11(C) cannot be substantially complied with when appellant\u2019s plea was not knowingly and intelligently made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Appellant argues that his guilty plea was not voluntarily given because he maintained his innocence throughout the entire proceedings. He also charges that his attorney induced him to plead guilty for fear that he would lose if he were tried on the merits. Appellant concludes by contending that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201cBased on the totality of the circumstances, the trial judge should have made a stronger effort in assuring that appellant understood the implications of his plea and that his actions were voluntary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">While appellant failed to indicate what stronger effort the trial court should have made, it is our opinion that the trial court complied with the law and we find no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Crim.R. 11(C) was adopted in order to safeguard a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights provided for in the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. A defendant must be personally advised by the trial court of his constitutional rights and must waive these rights voluntarily and intelligently prior to the court\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea. <em>Boykin v. Alabama </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274; <em>McCarthy v. United States </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418; <em>State v. Caudill </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 342, 345, 2 O.O.3d 467, 469-470, 358 N.E.2d 601, 603. Compliance with Crim.R. 11(C) also provides an adequate record for review when it must be determined whether a defendant voluntarily and intelligently waived his constitutional rights. <em>State v. Stone </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 163, 167, 72 O.O.2d 91, 93-94, 331 N.E.2d 411, 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">In <em>Boykin v. Alabama, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the record must show that a defendant voluntarily and intelligently waived the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to trial by jury, and the right to confront his accusers. <em>Id., </em>395 U.S. at 243, 89 S.Ct. at 1712, 23 L.Ed.2d at 279-280.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">A trial court, in addition to the constitutional duty to inform, is required to inform the defendant of certain other matters before accepting the guilty plea pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C). <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 130, 132-133, 532 N.E.2d 1295, 1297-1298. Specifically, Crim.R. 11(C)(2) requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">\u201c(2) In felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a plea of no contest, and shall not accept such plea without first addressing the defendant personally and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">\u201c(a) Determining that he is making the plea voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and of the maximum penalty involved, and, if applicable, that he is not eligible for probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u201c(b) Informing him of and determining that he understands the effect of his plea of guilty or no contest, and that the court upon acceptance of the plea may proceed with judgment and sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201c(c) Informing him and determining that he understands that by his plea he is waiving his rights to jury trial, to confront witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to require the state to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial at which he cannot be compelled to testify against himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">A reviewing court must find that the trial court did not substantially comply with Crim.R. 11 prior to vacating a defendant\u2019s guilty plea. <em>State v. Nero </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474, 476-477, citing <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 5 O.O.3d 52, 364 N.E.2d 1163. A trial court substantially complies with Crim.R. 11 where, under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant subjectively understands the rights he is waiving and the consequences of the plea. <em>State v. Stewart, supra. </em>A defendant must also demonstrate a prejudicial effect when arguing that he did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily enter a guilty plea. <em>Id., </em>51 Ohio St.2d at 93, 5 O.O.3d at 56, 364 N.E.2d at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In the instant case, the following colloquy took place between the court and appellant after the court read him his rights pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: The reason why I\u2019m doing this is because of my family. I want to see the streets again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: You wanted what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I want to see the streets again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: You want to see the streets again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir. I know deep down in my heart I didn\u2019t do this, you know, but I got a wife and five kids, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you know that the penalty for the murder charge is life imprisonment; right? And you are looking at the fact this sentence is eight to 25 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: You are looking at lesser time if you plead than if you go to trial and get convicted; is that what you are doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you know that the State has agreed that they will nolle or not prosecute on the two charges of robbery, which could result in consecutive time; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: So is that the basis on which you are entering your plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Do you have any questions about the plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I mean \u2014 I mean \u2014 I want to know, am I getting the eight to 25?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: That would be up to the Court. You understand what\u2019s going on here? You are entering a plea and the jury isn\u2019t going to be called back into the courtroom to hear evidence or opening statements. It [sic] going to be concluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">\u201cI have to satisfy myself that you understand what\u2019s happening here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT:, I understand what\u2019s happening, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: But you are not sure about the outcome is what you are saying; right? That\u2019s the question on your mind; what\u2019s going to happen to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. But you understand what the plea is, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-15\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you understand what the plea bargain is; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-17\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: You understand that it takes the place of the jury trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-19\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you understand that you give up your rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-21\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you know that the penalty for pleading guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter in this instance \u2014 involuntary manslaughter, Al?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-23\">\u201cMR. LIPOLD: Voluntary, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-24\">\u201cTHE COURT: Voluntary manslaughter. Strike that. That\u2019s an aggravated felony of the first degree. It is the Court\u2019s obligation to advise you that the penalty is a period of incarceration of five, six, seven, eight, nine or 10 years, up to 25 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-25\">\u201cIn addition, there is a firearm specification contained in the indictment. That firearm specification says that you must go to the penitentiary for a term of three years, and that three year term must be prior to and consecutive with any other sentence you receive in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u201cHas that be [sic] explained to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: It hasn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you had to know. Mr. Gibbins, you had a chance to explain the three year actual incarceration for the gun specification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">\u201cMR. GIBBINS: Repeatedly, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Keane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">\u201cMR. KEANE: Yes, we have, on more than one occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you remember any of that discussion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I remember now, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you know that the term of five, six, seven, eight, nine or 10 up to 25 years can be a period of actual incarceration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-15\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you know that the law says that you can be given a fine of up to ten thousand dollars for participating in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-17\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you know that the law says that you can be given a fine of up to ten thousand dollars, in addition to the penalty of jail, for participating in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-19\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you have any questions about the nature of this charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-21\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you have any questions about this proceeding, known as a plea bargain arrangement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-23\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-24\">\u201cTHE COURT: What plea is it that you choose to enter, then, to the charge of voluntary manslaughter with a firearm specification; guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-25\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-26\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is this plea of guilty that you entered to both the charge of voluntary manslaughter, the lesser but included offense, and the firearm specification, the use of a firearm in the commission of this offense\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-27\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-28\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is it entered of your own free will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: What you [sic] mean? I don\u2019t understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">\u201cMR. KEANE: Are you doing this voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Are you doing this of your own free will? Is this something that you are choosing to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No, I\u2019m not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is it entered with your understanding of the nature of the charge and the maximum penalty that can be imposed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is it entered voluntarily, by yourself? Are you doing it voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is anyone forcing you to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No, no one is not [sic ] forcing me to do it. I just like to do it \u2014 I\u2019m doing it for my wife and my mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: You are saying that you are doing it of your own free will. You are really doing it for your mother and your wife; is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-14\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I\u2019m doing it for myself, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: So when you said it wasn\u2019t of your own free will, the constraints on you were family constraints; is that what I\u2019m given to understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-16\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">The motivational niceties of a guilty plea are not an element of inquiry required of a trial court before a guilty plea is accepted. The court\u2019s inquiry in Crim.R. 11(C) is whether the accused, no matter what his motivations are, knows and understands the legal implications of waiving his statutory and constitutional rights in exchange for a guilty plea. The motivation can range from love of country to fear of facing the electric chair, but no violation of rights occurs unless the record shows from the totality of the circumstances that the accused\u2019s guilty plea was not voluntarily and intelligently given.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">In the instant case, appellant\u2019s motivation to \u201csee the streets again,\u201d and see his wife, mother, and children is not an act of an irrational man or a man coerced to undertake an action against his will. It is a calculated and willful act of a man seeking self-benefit. Since a Crim.R. 11 hearing requires the trial court\u2019s examination of an accused\u2019s free will to waive constitutional and statutory rights, an accused who knows he is innocent and professes his innocence but voluntarily and knowingly pleads guilty to that offense does so at his own peril, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>for the law can only go so far to protect the innocent and even the guilty. The law cannot protect an innocent man with sound mind who pleads guilty to the offense he is charged with committing, when he knows he did not have to so plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Having found no error in the trial court\u2019s acceptance of appellant\u2019s plea, we overrule appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-7\">Nahra, C.J., and Krupansky, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
