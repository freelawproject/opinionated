Beardsley, appeals a decision of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment to defendants-appellees, Manfredi Motor Transit Company (\u201cManfredi\u201d), J. Wesley Trimble, Acting Administrator, Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, and Industrial Commission of Ohio. In his sole assignment of error, appellant alleges that the trial court erred because material issues of facts are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">On a hot, humid day in July 1990, appellant suffered a heart attack (myocardial infarction) while lifting heavy hoses during the course of his employment as a truck driver for Manfredi. Appellant was treated by Frederic Pashkow, M.D., who performed a surgical revascularization on appellant to repair appellant\u2019s damaged heart, veins, and arteries. Appellant filed a claim with the Industrial Commission for workers\u2019 compensation for this injury. The district hearing officer denied appellant\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation. Upon appeal, the Cleveland Regional Board of Review also denied appellant\u2019s claim. Upon further appeal, commission staff hearing officers reversed the decision of the board of review and allowed the claim. Appellees appealed this decision to the Butler County Court of Common Pleas, which granted summary judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment, a reviewing court must make an independent review of the record. <em>Am. Energy Serv. v. Lekan </em>(1992), 75 Ohio App.3d 205, 208, 598 N.E.2d 1315, 1316-1317. A reviewing court must look at the same evidentiary materials that the trial court looked at in its analysis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">In determining if the trial court\u2019s decision was correct in granting summary judgment, a reviewing court must use the same analysis that the trial court must use under Civ.R. 56(C). First, there must be no genuine issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>material fact that remains to be litigated. <em>Newbury Twp. Bd. of Twp. Trustees v. Lomack Petroleum </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 387, 390, 583 N.E.2d 302, 304-305. Second, the moving party must be entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>Finally, it must be clear from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, that being in favor of the party moving for summary judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In this case, the trial court erred by granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact that remain to be litigated. Summary judgment was improperly granted because there is a factual dispute as to the proximate cause of appellant\u2019s injury. In order to receive workers\u2019 compensation an employee must sustain an injury in the course of and arising out of the injured employee\u2019s employment. R.C. 4123.01(C). However, workers\u2019 compensation does not cover injury \u201ccaused primarily by the natural deterioration of tissue, organ, or part of the body.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Although appellant sustained his injury while working, there is a dispute over whether his injury was a result of the lifting he was doing when he suffered the myocardial infarction or whether it was a result of the deterioration of appellant\u2019s cardiovascular system as a result of his lifestyle. Appellant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Pashkow, testified at a deposition that the root cause of appellant\u2019s myocardial infarction was appellant\u2019s preexisting coronary artery disease. Dr. Pashkow, however, also testified that the heavy exertion appellant was engaged in precipitated the myocardial infarction. Since an employee may receive compensation if an injury is accelerated in the course of employment or arising out of employment, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not appellant\u2019s injury was aggravated by his employment. See <em>Oswald v. Connor </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St.3d 38, 41, 16 OBR 520, 522-523, 476 N.E.2d 658, 661-662.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained and the trial court\u2019s decision which granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b804-8\">Koehler, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b804-9\">Fred E. Jones, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b804-10\">Jones, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A04\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Since 1986, R.C. 4123.01(C)(2) has excluded from compensable injuries those caused primarily by natural, as opposed to occupational, causes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-12\">\u201c(C) \u2018Injury\u2019 does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>a * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">\u201c(2) Injury or disability caused <em>primarily </em>by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ, or part of the body[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The purpose of R.C. 4123.01(C)(2) is to \u201cexclude from coverage persons who are injured <em>primarily </em>because of <em>natural causes, </em>and thereby protect the fund for persons who are injured in the scope of their employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Preusser v. Ohio Power Co. </em>(Dec. 6, 1993), Stark App. No. CA-9266, unreported, 1993 WL 535433. The statute frames the issue: Injuries caused \u201cprimarily\u201d by natural causes are not compensable. The only factual issue is whether Beardsley\u2019s heart attack was caused primarily by his coronary artery disease. If it was, he is not entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Dr. Pashkow\u2019s undisputed testimony is that Beardsley\u2019s heart attack was caused \u201cprimarily\u201d and \u201cfundamentally\u201d by his coronary artery disease. Because there was no evidence otherwise, there is no question of fact about the primary cause of the heart attack. Reasonable minds can conclude only that the heart attack was caused primarily by natural causes, thus excluding it from the definition of \u201ccompensable injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Summary judgment was proper and I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
