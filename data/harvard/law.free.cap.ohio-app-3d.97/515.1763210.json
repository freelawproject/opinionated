Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the rape conviction and ten to twenty-five years on the kidnapping conviction. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The victim testified that she was a third grader on October 5, 1993. While she was visiting her Aunt Vicky on July 1, 1992, she was molested by \u201cJames\u201d (appellant). She testified that she was raped by appellant. When asked to describe what happened, she stated, \u201cHe pulled down my clothes and he got on top of me.\u201d Appellant did not have his clothes on. Appellant took off her clothes and used the part of the body \u201cbetween his legs\u201d to touch between her legs. He put it inside of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">She testified that the incident took place when she asked appellant for the key to use the bathroom. She came to a locked door and was let into the building by a lady before she asked appellant for the bathroom key. She had earlier been introduced to appellant by her Aunt Vicky.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">When she asked appellant for the key, he led her to the security room door and held the door open for her. He locked the door after she was in the room. He put her on the floor and she was lying on her back. Appellant told her that if she said anything he would kill her. She was afraid. She told her grandmother and her mother the next day when she returned to Springfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">She was taken to the hospital, where she talked to a doctor and a policeman. She later talked to a social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Delores Davis testified that she is the victim\u2019s grandmother. On July 2, 1992 at about 2:30 p.m., the victim and her brothers and sister were brought back to Springfield by three adults, including appellant. She observed that the victim was by herself and did not socialize with the other children. Between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m., appellant and the other two adults, Vivian Taylor and Willie, left for Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">Davis testified that later that night her twelve-year-old daughter talked about the victim. She brought the victim to her bedroom. The victim was crying and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>very upset. She asked her what was wrong. The victim told her that a security guard took her to the security office and took off her clothes. The victim told her that the security officer \u201ctook his penis and stuck it in her vagina.\u201d Davis then telephoned the victim\u2019s mother, who came over to the house and took the victim to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Cheryl Spragg testified that she was the nurse who conducted the triage examination of the victim. The victim \u201cwas teary-eyed.\u201d \u201cHer skin was warm and dry.\u201d The victim told her that \u201cJames raped me.\u201d She denied any oral or rectal penetration. She examined between her legs and found that her labia were \u201cvery reddened and swollen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Dr. Rohn Kennington testified that he was the examining physician on duty the morning the victim was brought to the Community Hospital in Springfield. He testified that the victim told him that a man by the name of James took her to a room when she asked him for a bathroom key. While in the room, \u201che pulled his thing out, quote end quote, got on top of her and put his thing in her bottom. And she pointed to her female \u2014 to the perineal area, the area of the vagina when she told me that.\u201d \u201cHe threatened to kill her if she told anyone what he had done to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Kennington testified that during examination of the victim, \u201cthere appeared to be some redness of the opening, the labia and the opening to the vagina, and there was a tear \u2014 in the hymenal ring.\u201d \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any active bleeding, but it looked like something had happened recently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Kennington further testified that the redness and the tear indicated some type of trauma to that area. When asked to explain what he meant by trauma, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">\u201cTrauma can mean one of several things. It could represent forcible penetration in a sexual assault. It could represent, some children use instruments or experiment and sometimes injure themselves with blunt or sharp objects that they play with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. Doctor, based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty, taking into account the physical exam and the history conducted of this patient, do you have an opinion as to causation of this injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\">\u201cA. It is my opinion that, given the child\u2019s history, as well as my physical findings, this overall picture is most consistent with a child who has been sexually assaulted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">There was no sperm found.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">Susan Mitchell testified that she works \u00e1s an outpatient therapist for Clark County Mental Health Services. She works with children, adolescents and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>families. She met privately with the victim on July 20, 1992. She asked the victim what had happened. She told her that someone by the name of James took her into a room in Cleveland and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Wendy Dixon testified that she was employed by the Clark County Department of Human Services as a social worker. She interviewed the victim with the help of anatomical drawings of a female child and an adult male. The victim told her that James had hurt her. She had asked James for the key to the bathroom. He took her to an office by the bathroom and hurt her. James pushed her to the floor, took her clothes off and put his penis in her \u201cstuff.\u201d James told her that if she said anything to anyone he would kill her. She identified body parts of a male and a little girl in the drawings. She marked the parts with a yellow highlighter, explaining to Dixon how his penis went into her \u201cstuff,\u201d pointing the arrow to the vagina area.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Vivian Taylor, a.k.a. Vicky, testified that she resides at 9500 Wade Park Road, Cleveland, Ohio. She has known appellant for two years. She went to Springfield in the summer of 1992 to bring her nieces, including the victim, and nephews to Cleveland. She had earlier introduced appellant to the children. She instructed the children to inform her when they wanted to use the restroom so she could take them to the restroom downstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">After the children played at the playground, they came back upstairs to her apartment. They ate and went to bed. The victim did not act unusual. Taylor testified that she was present when the victim took a bath and she saw her naked. She did not appear to be suffering from any injury or discomfort. The next morning Andrew Hill and appellant accompanied her to Springfield to return the children. Before they departed for Springfield, they stopped at her great-grandmother\u2019s to say goodbye. The victim talked with appellant \u201clike she always did.\u201d She did not appear to be afraid of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">When they arrived at Springfield, she introduced Hill and appellant to the children\u2019s mother and their grandmother. They spent about two hours in Springfield and said their goodbyes. The victim never indicated to her that anyone had hurt her.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Andrew Hill corroborated Taylor\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Appellant testified that he knew Taylor and her nephews and nieces. He would run into them almost every day as they played in the playground. He saw the victim on the day in question at Taylor\u2019s apartment. She did not appear any different than she had all other times. He noticed that the victim was more \u201chyper\u201d than her other siblings. The victim did not show any indication that she was afraid of him. He accompanied Taylor and Hill to Springfield to drop off the children. The children were happy when they departed from Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>At no time did he take the victim to the bathroom. He denied ever having sex with the victim or taking off her clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Appellant assigns the following errors for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201cI. The court allowed impermissible hearsay testimony from the alleged victim\u2019s grandmother in violation of Ohio Rule of Evidence 803, the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 9 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cII. The medical doctor who examined the alleged victim improperly testified as to his opinion of the veracity of the statements of the child declarant in violation of State v. Boston (1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108 [545 N.E.2d 1220].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201cHI. Statements made to social workers by an alleged child-victim who testified at trial are hearsay and not admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201cIV. The evidence is insufficient to sustain the appellant\u2019s convictions for rape and kidnapping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">\u201cV. The verdicts are against the weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">In his first and third assignments of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by allowing hearsay statements made to third parties by the child victim. Appellant argues that since the child\u2019s statement to her grandmother was inadmissible hearsay, the trial court should not have allowed the child\u2019s grandmother to testify as to those statements. The state countered by arguing that the child\u2019s statement to her grandmother was admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to Evid.R. 803. Appellant further challenges the statement, claiming that it went beyond the Evid.R. 803 exception because the statement was made thirty-two hours after the event. Appellant argues that the child\u2019s activities<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after the alleged rape occurred took the statement she made to her grandmother out of the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule because \u201cthe alleged victim had more than adequate opportunity to reflect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">Evid.R. 803(2) and (4) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u201cHearsay Exceptions; Availability of Declarant Immaterial</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rules, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\"><em>u </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201c(2) Excited utterance. A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u00ab * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u201c(4) Statements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment. Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">The court in <em>State v. Dickerson </em>(1977), 51 Ohio App.2d 255, 5 O.O.3d 377, 367 N.E.2d 927, held that a statement does not qualify as an excited utterance unless it concerns an event sufficiently startling to render normal reflective thought processes inoperative and is a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence of the event and not the result of reflective thought. The Staff Notes to Evid.R. 803(2) list factors the court must consider in determining whether a statement qualifies as an excited utterance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">\u201cTo qualify as an excited utterance consideration must be given to (a) the lapse of time between the event and the declaration, (b) the mental and physical condition of the declarant, (c) the nature of the statement and (d) the influence of intervening circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">The elements to be considered in determining what constitutes an excited utterance make it difficult for us to hold as a matter of law that thirty-two hours is too much time, especially for a nine-year-old child. The Ohio State Supreme Court held in <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 295, 303, 612 N.E.2d 316, 322, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">\u201cThere is no <em>per se </em>amount of time after which a statement can no longer be considered to be an excited utterance. The central requirements are that the statement must be made while the declarant is still under the stress of the event and the statement may <em>not </em>be a result of reflective thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-14\">\u201cTherefore the passage of time between the statement and the event is relevant but not dispositive of the question. \u2018[E]ach case must be decided on its own circumstances, since it is patently futile to attempt to formulate an inelastic rule delimiting the time limits within which an oral utterance must be made in order that it be termed a spontaneous exclamation.\u2019 <em>State v. Duncan </em>[1978], 53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Ohio St.2d [215] at 219-220, 7 O.O.3d [380] at 383, 373 N.E.2d [1234] at 1237 * * (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In <em>Potter v. Baker </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 488, 55 O.O. 389, 124 N.E.2d 140, paragraph two of the syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court established a four-part test to determine the admissibility of a spontaneous exclamation:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u201cSuch testimony as to a statement or declaration <em>may be </em>admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule for spontaneous exclamations where the trial judge reasonably finds (a) that there was some occurrence startling enough to produce a nervous excitement in the declarant, which was sufficient to still his reflective faculties and thereby make his statements and declarations the unreflective and sincere expression of his actual impressions and beliefs, and thus render his statement or declaration spontaneous and unreflective, (b) that the statement or declaration, even if not strictly contemporaneous with its exciting cause, was made before there had been time for such nervous excitement to lose a domination over his reflective faculties, so that such domination <em>continued </em>to remain sufficient to make his statements and declarations the unreflective and sincere expression of his actual impressions and beliefs, (c) that the statement or declaration related to such startling occurrence or the circumstances of such startling occurrence, and (d) that the declarant had an opportunity to observe personally the matters asserted in his statement or declaration.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>See, also, <em>State v. Duncan </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 215, 7 O.O.3d 380, 373 N.E.2d 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In the instant case, the admissibility of the victim\u2019s grandmother\u2019s testimony would depend on the court\u2019s finding that the victim was still under stress of the startling occurrence. <em>Taylor, supra. </em>Being mindful of the fact that merely being upset clearly does not meet the standard for admissibility under Evid.R. 803(2), <em>Taylor, supra, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 303, 612 N.E.2d at 322, we shall review the testimony of the victim\u2019s grandmother.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201cQ. Well, you tell us what was going on that afternoon between the adults at least.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cA. It is just they came and brought the children back home and they introduced themselves, and Vivian and them talked, and I talked with Vivian and them, and that was just about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">\u201cQ. Were the kids in the apartment at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">\u201cA. No. They had went outdoors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-12\">\u201cQ. And [the victim] came back, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-13\">\u201cA. [The victim] went off to herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-14\">\u201cQ. What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201cA. She didn\u2019t socialize with the rest of them.

She went outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u201cQ. And you saw this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">\u201cQ. Did you go outside and actually see her off by herself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">\u201cA. Yes. We had went \u2014 we had left from upstairs and went out and got chairs and sit out in front of. the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">\u201cQ. What were the kids doing outside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">\u201cA. They were out there playing on the monkey bars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-13\">\u201cQ. How about [the victim]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-14\">\u201cA. [The victim], she had still went off to herself. She had left the rest of the children.

You didn\u2019t see her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-16\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-17\">\u201cQ. All right.

Do you know if [the victim] ate that evening either at your house or your daughter\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-29\">\u201cA. She didn\u2019t eat at either one of their house. She said they had brought chicken coming back to Cleveland in the van, and they ate in the van.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201cQ.

She responded that she did not believe that her aunt would believe her.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">It is not uncommon for children to be dismissed as telling unfounded stories when they relate stories of such magnitude to an adult relative, and children can always sense the reaction of adults to their stories. Therefore, based on the totality of the circumstances (the occurrence of the incident in Cleveland, the child\u2019s mistrust of her aunt, and the child\u2019s return to an environment where she felt more comfortable without much lapse of time), we cannot conclude that the child did not remain in the state of excitation when she told the story of her encounter with appellant to her grandmother. <em>State v. Duncan, supra; </em>see <em>Presley v. Presley </em>(1990), 71 Ohio App.3d 34, 593 N.E.2d 17; see, also, <em>State v. Fox </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 481, 585 N.E.2d 561 (seven-year-old child\u2019s statement one day after the alleged rape was admitted as excited utterance); <em>State v. Barton </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 455, 594 N.E.2d 702 (three-hour lapse of time did not render the statement inadmissible.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Since the victim remained in an agitated state upon her return when she told her story to her grandmother, her statement is admissible as an excited utterance under Evid.R. 803(2). See <em>State v. Wallace </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 87, 524 N.E.2d 466; <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220. Appellant\u2019s argument is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Appellant further argues that the social worker\u2019s testimony of what the victim told her was also inadmissible hearsay. The state countered by arguing that the statements made to the social worker fall within the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule. The state in support of its argument cited this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Shepherd </em>(July 1, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 62894, unreported, 1993 WL 243071, citing <em>State v. Duke </em>(Aug. 25, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 52604, unreported, 1988 WL 88862, and <em>State v. Cottrell </em>(Feb. 19, 1987), Cuyahoga App. No. 51576, unreported, 1987 WL 6799. The state quoted this court\u2019s holding in <em>Shepherd </em>that \u201cthis court has consistently held that a young rape victim\u2019s statements to social workers, clinical therapists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>and other medical personnel are admissible under Evid.R. 803(4).\u201d We note that the cases cited by the <em>Shepherd </em>court were decided before <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220. However, we recognize the need to explain our reasoning in <em>Shepherd </em>to avoid an unwarranted broad expansion of the Evid.R. 803(4) hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We begin with the provisions of Evid.R. 803(4) concerning statements made for purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. It states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cStatements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">It is settled law in Ohio that statements made for the purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment are admissible under Evid.R. 803(4). See <em>State v. Boston, supra; State v. Dever </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 401, 596 N.E.2d 436; <em>Scott v. Campbell </em>(1961), 115 Ohio App. 208, 20 O.O.2d 298, 184 N.E.2d 485; <em>Cleveland Ry. Co. v. Merk </em>(1932), 124 Ohio St. 596, 180 N.E. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">In <em>State v. Boston, supra, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cEvid.R. 803(4) extends the common-law doctrine to admit statements made to a physician or medical attendant without regard to the purpose of the examination or the need for the patient\u2019s history. In other words, the patient\u2019s statements are admissible even though made to a physician consulted for the purpose of enabling the doctor to testify and even when no treatment is contemplated. Staff Note to Evid.R. 803(4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">\u201cEvid.R. 803(4), effective July 1, 1980, permits the admission of three types of patient statements: (1) medical history, (2) past or present symptoms, pain or sensations, and (3) description of the inception or general character of the cause or external source of the disease or injury. <em>These statements, to be admissible, must be made by the patient for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment. Furthermore, all three types of statements are admissible only where they are \u2018 </em>* * * <em>reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 46 Ohio St.3d at 121, 545 N.E.2d at 1233.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">The <em>Boston </em>court continued, 46 Ohio St.3d at 122-123, 545 N.E.2d at 1234-1235:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">\u201cAnother dilemma in applying Evid.R. 803(4) is whether a statement by a child to a psychologist, counselor, social worker, minister, etc., is admissible under the medical diagnosis or treatment exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">\u201cIn <em>[State v.] Eastham </em>[ (1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 307], at 312, 530 N.E.2d [409], at 413, Justice [Herbert R.] Brown noted in his concurrence that the Staff Note to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Evid.R. 803(4) stated that the rule was derived from the assumption that a person will be truthful about his <em>physical </em>condition to a <em>physician </em>because of the risk of harmful treatment resulting from untruthful statements. The concurrence concluded that \u2018[statements made during the course of treatment for a mental health condition, however, are not imbued with the same aura of reliability [as a patient\u2019s statements to his physician]. In such situations, a patient\u2019s veracity, perception, memory or narrative ability may be impaired.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 312, 530 N.E.2d at 413-414.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201cEvid.R. 803(4) provides that the statements must be made \u2018 * * * for purposes of <em>medical </em>diagnosis or treatment * * *.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) In the case before us, Dr. Lord did not \u2018treat\u2019 Cynthia. Further, Dr. Lord is a psychologist \u2014 not a medical doctor \u2014 and the definition of \u2018psychologist\u2019 found in R.C. 4732.01(A) does not include medical training. See, also, R.C. 4731.09. Under the circumstances, would Dr. Lord\u2019s testimony be admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4)?\u201d (Emphasis and bracketed material sic.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Thus, as did the <em>Boston </em>court, we ask under the circumstances of this case would the social worker\u2019s testimony be admissible under Evid.R. 803(4)? We think not. It is our opinion that the state misunderstood the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dever, supra. Dever </em>did not challenge the <em>Boston </em>court\u2019s holding that the Evid.R. 803(4) exception to the hearsay rule is limited to statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment. <em>Dever </em>held the following, 64 Ohio St.3d at 413, 596 N.E.2d at 445-446:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u201cIn applying our holding to the facts of this case, we find that the trial court properly evaluated the circumstances accompanying the making of the child\u2019s statements. <em>Since there is insufficient reason to doubt that the statements were made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the statements were admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 803(1). </em>Neither Evid.R. 803(4) nor 102 requires exclusion of the child\u2019s statements from the evidence, when as here the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the requirements of Evid.R. 803(4) were met.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The <em>Dever </em>court modified <em>Boston </em>to the extent that it allows a child\u2019s statement to a doctor to come under diagnosis or treatment even when the child\u2019s initial motivation was not to seek treatment from the doctor. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 596 N.E.2d at 443-444.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">We would not adopt a rigid rule as to what constitutes \u201cdiagnosis and treatment\u201d or limit diagnosis and treatment to licensed physicians, as such a narrow holding would undercut the function of nurses, psychiatrists, therapists, and various individuals who treat victims of sexual abuse. We are equally not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>prepared to hold that a social worker by merely being a social worker is automatically included in the category of individuals who can render treatment or diagnose sex abuse victims. The inclusion of a social worker into this select group of care providers must depend on her function. Where a social worker\u2019s function does not include diagnosis or treatment (whether it be mental or physical treatment of a child sex abuse victim), any statement made to the social worker cannot be admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule in Evid.R. 803(4). Thus, our previous holdings in <em>Shepherd, supra, </em>should not be interpreted to create a <em>per se </em>rule that all statements made to social workers regardless of their functions qualify under the exception to the hearsay rule in Evid.R. 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We look to the functions of the social worker in the instant case to determine whether the victim\u2019s statement to her could be interpreted as being for diagnosis or treatment. The following colloquy took place between the prosecutor and the social worker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">\u201cQ. Ms. Dixon, whom are you employed by?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cA. The Clark County Department of Human Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201cQ.

She stated that James had hurt her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">A careful review of the record shows that the function of the social worker in the instant case is neither diagnosis nor treatment. She just wanted to determine if further investigation was warranted after getting the child\u2019s statement. Those not allowed or certified as medical experts or clinical therapists cannot be accorded as a matter of law the privilege of giving medical diagnosis or treatment for evidentiary purposes just because they come in contact with children. The trial court\u2019s admission in the instant case of the social worker\u2019s testimony is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">The next issue is whether appellant suffered any prejudice. Admission of inadmissible hearsay is analyzed in the same manner as the admission of any other evidence at trial. For the purposes of prejudice, a reviewing court looks at the evidence in relation to the entire trial to determine its effect. The most difficult problem associated with admission of out-of-court statements is a possible violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">The defendant\u2019s right of confrontation is provided in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which states that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him * * See <em>Pointer v. Texas </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 400, 403, 406, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1067-1068, 1069, 13 L.Ed.2d 923, 926-927.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">The United States Supreme Court addressed the relationship between the Confrontation Clause and an out-of-court statement admitted during trial in <em>California v. Green </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, 497. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-16\">\n<em>\u201cViewed historically, then, there is good reason to conclude that the Confrontation Clause is not violated by admitting a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements, as </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\n<em>long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cThis conclusion is supported by comparing the purposes of confrontation with the alleged dangers in admitting an out-of-court statement. Confrontation: (1) insures that the witness will give his statements under oath \u2014 thus impressing him with the seriousness of the matter and guarding against the lie by the possibility of a penalty for perjury; (2) forces the witness to submit to cross-examination, the \u2018greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth\u2019; (3) permits the jury that is to decide the defendant\u2019s fate to observe the demeanor of the witness in making his statement, thus aiding the jury in assessing his credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201cIt is, of course, true that the out-of-court statement may have been made under circumstances subject to none of these protections. <em>But if the declarant is present and testifying at trial, the out-of-court statement for all practical purposes regains most of the lost protections. </em>If the witness admits the prior statement is his, or if there is other evidence to show the statement is his, the danger of faulty reproduction is negligible and the jury can be confident that it has before it two conflicting statements by the same witness. Thus, as far as the oath is concerned, the witness must now affirm, deny, or qualify the truth of the prior statement under the penalty of perjury; indeed, the very fact that the prior statement was not given under a similar circumstance may become the witness\u2019 explanation for its inaccuracy \u2014 an explanation a jury may be expected to understand and take into account in deciding which, if either, of the statements represents the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\"><em>\u201cSecond, the inability to cross-examine the witness at the time he made his prior statement cannot easily be shown to be of crucial significance as long as the defendant is assured of full and effective cross-examination at the time of trial.\u201d </em>(Footnote omitted; emphasis added.) See, also, <em>Mattox v. United States </em>(1895), 156 U.S. 237, 242-243, 15 S.Ct. 337, 339-340, 39 L.Ed. 409, 411; <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In the instant case, the victim testified at trial and was subjected to full cross-examination by appellant\u2019s trial counsel before the jury. We cannot share appellant\u2019s view that the out-of-court statements testified to by the social worker are any more damaging than the testimony of the declarant herself at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Thus, we hold the admission of the social worker\u2019s testimony to be harmless and overrule appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Appellant argues in his second assignment of error that the trial court erred by allowing a state\u2019s witness to testify as to the veracity of the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>statements. Appellant argues unpersuasively that admission of Dr. Kennington\u2019s testimony concerning the truthfulness of the child\u2019s statements was in error because experts are prohibited from stating an opinion of the veracity of the statements of another individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">It is settled law that the judge of the veracity of a witness is solely the trier of facts. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212. An expert is prohibited from invading the territory of the jury by interjecting his opinion concerning the truthfulness of the statement of any witness. That could be very prejudicial and reversible error. <em>State v. Boston, supra. </em>But in the instant case a careful examination of the record indicates that appellant suffered no prejudice that he did not bring upon himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Kennington during cross-examination testified in favor of the defense, and to its delight, that the child\u2019s injury could have been caused by something other than sexual contact. Counsel did not stop at that as is shown in this colloquy between appellant\u2019s trial counsel and Kennington:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cQ. Doctor, you have indicated that what you observed in her vaginal area could have been caused, the tearing and whatever else you saw, could have been caused by things other than sexual assault, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">\u201cQ. Could have been caused by the child herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\u201cCould it have been caused by a fall, playground equipment, things of that nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">\u201cQ. And it is also a fact, is it not, Doctor, that you have no way of knowing whether or not the history that you got was truthful or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">\u201cA. I guess I would have to disagree with that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\">\u201cQ. You have no idea if what was related to you by the little girl as to what happened, you have no way of knowing whether that is the truth or is not the truth. Isn\u2019t that a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-15\">\u201cA. No, I wouldn\u2019t say that it is. I think I can have an idea and a pretty good opinion about the truthful nature of her statement. It is not like in a laboratory where you can document something a hundred percent, but I have dealt with a lot of these children and I usually have a pretty comfortable opinion about whether or not the child is telling the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-16\">\u201cQ. You did assume that she was telling you the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-17\">\u201cMR. KOLASINSKI: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u201cQ. In making your findings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201cYou assumed she was being truthful. Is that a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201cA. I would say that the way\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201cQ. It is a simple question, Doctor. Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cMR. KOLASINSKI: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201cA. If I am allowed to respond in my own way here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Go ahead and respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201cA I would say that the manner in which [the victim] related her story to me rings true, is consistent with a child who has been assaulted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">\u201cQ. Now, you did not notice any other trauma on this child, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-14\">\u201cA. No. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">The record shows that the objections came from the state. Appellant never objected to the answers that he invited or even asked the court to strike the answers as being unresponsive. The rule of invited error remains true in this case as in all cases. A party who invites an error at trial has no one to blame but himself and cannot seek solace in the appellate court. See <em>Lester v. Leuck </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 91, 26 O.O. 280, 50 N.E.2d 145; <em>State v. Kniep </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 681, 622 N.E.2d 1138. Common sense tells us that one who shoots himself in the foot cannot stop the shooting or its effect after the fact. The law takes the same approach when one invites an error. It was, therefore, not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to refuse to give a curative instruction or grant a mistrial. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 72, 523 N.E.2d 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">Appellant in his fourth and fifth assignments of error argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him and also that the verdicts are against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree on both counts. On a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the relevant inquiry is whether after viewing the entire evidence admitted at trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty. <em>Jackson v. Virginia; State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">In the instant case, the state presented the victim, who testified about her ordeal and also identified appellant as the culprit. Other witnesses also testified. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>There is nothing shown by appellant .that would convince us that the jury should not have found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We also do not find anything in the record to show that the jury lost its way. The jury listened to the testimony of witnesses to both parties and observed their demeanors. It was in a better position that we are to judge the credibility of those witnesses, and it did. See <em>State v. DeHass, supra; State v. Davis </em>(1988), 49 Ohio App.3d 109, 550 N.E.2d 966; <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. Having found no error in the verdict of the jury to convict and no error in the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the verdict, we overrule appellant\u2019s assignments of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-7\">Nahra, C.J., and Weaver, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-14\">.
