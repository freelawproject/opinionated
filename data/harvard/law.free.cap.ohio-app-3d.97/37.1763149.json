(\u201cCadillac\u201d), appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas dismissing its complaint against defendant Buckeye Union Insurance Company (\u201cBuckeye Union\u201d) pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Cadillac sets forth the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss because in determining that appellant had no enforceable rights against appellee, the court incorrectly interpreted relevant case law as well as the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">In order for a court to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to recovery. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753. When construing a complaint upon a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, it is presumed that all factual allegations in the complaint are true. <em>Tulloh v. Goodyear Atomic Corp. </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 541, 544, 584 N.E.2d 729, 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">According to Cadillac\u2019s complaint, Mid-State Builders, Inc. (\u201cMid-State\u201d), entered into a contract with the Columbus Board of Education for window and door replacement at various schools. In compliance with R.C. Chapter 153, Mid-State executed a bid guaranty and contract bond with Buckeye Union. Thereafter, Mid-State entered into a contract with Advanced Glazing Technology, Inc. (\u201cAdvanced Glazing\u201d) which, in turn, entered into a contract with Cadillac to provide materials to Advanced Glazing in connection with the window and door replacement project. Advanced Glazing failed to pay Cadillac the sum of $24,138.86 for the materials provided under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">Cadillac subsequently served Buckeye Union with notice of a claim under the contract bond on or about June 11, 1992. Cadillac submitted a second and third notice of claim to Buckeye Union on February 19, 1993 and May 27, 1993, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>respectively. As of this date, Cadillac\u2019s claim has not been paid by Buckeye Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Cadillac filed the instant action against Buckeye Union and Advanced Glazing seeking recovery from the former under the bond and seeking an award of damages from the later for breach of contract. The trial court sustained Buckeye Union\u2019s motion to dismiss Cadillac\u2019s claim under the bond pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In sustaining Buckeye Union\u2019s motion, the trial court relied on <em>J.T. Weybrecht\u2019s Sons Co. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co. </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 436, 53 O.O. 345, 119 N.E.2d 836, and its own previous decision in a related case captioned, <em>EFCO Corp. v. Advanced Glazing Technology, Inc., </em>case No. 92CVH0-10-8379.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aor\">. The trial court held that <em>Weybrecht, supra, </em>did not permit Cadillac to recover under the bond, as a matter of law, since Cadillac was \u201cone degree removed from the original contractor.\u201d Accordingly, upon review of the trial court\u2019s judgment, this court must determine whether the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Weybrecht </em>permits a materialman of a subcontractor to recover under a bid guaranty and contract bond executed pursuant to R.C. 153.54 (formerly G.C. 2365-1), where the materialman is not in privity with the general contractor. R.C. 153.54(C), as amended in 1980, provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u201cIf the bidder enters into the contract, the bidder shall, at the time he enters into the contract, file a bond for the amount of the contract to indemnify the state, political subdivision, district, institution, or agency against all damage suffered by failure to perform the contract according to its provisions and in accordance with the plans, details, specifications, and bills of material therefor and to pay all lawful claims of subcontractors, materialmen, and laborers for labor performed or material furnished in carrying forward, performing, or completing the contract; and agree and assent that this undertaking shall be for the benefit of any subcontractor, materialman, or laborer having a just claim, as well as for the state, political subdivision, district, institution, or agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In <em>Weybrecht, supra, </em>the Youngstown City Board of Education entered into a contract for construction of a school. The general contractor entered into a contract for mill work \"with Carver-Behan which, in turn, contracted with plaintiff J.T. Weybrecht to furnish material for portions of the mill work. The general contractor paid Carver-Behan, which completed the work for the general contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tor. However, Carver-Behan failed to pay to J.T. Weybrecht the sum of $8,517.54 which it owed for materials furnished. J.T. Weybrecht filed suit against Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., the project surety, seeking recovery under the contract bond. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed a judgment in favor of J.T. Weybrecht, holding at the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">\u201cAs used in Sections 2365-1 to 2365-4, inclusive, General Code [now R.C. 153.54 et seq.], the word \u2018subcontractor\u2019 will be given its ordinary meaning so that it may include one who, under a contract with the general contractor, merely furnishes material for use in performance of the general contract, but so that it will exclude a subcontractor of a subcontractor of the general contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Both parties rely on the <em>Weybrecht </em>decision in support of their respective positions. Buckeye Union contends that the <em>Weybrecht </em>decision ehminates any distinction between subcontractors and materialmen for the purposes of R.C. 153.54 and that under <em>Weybrecht, </em>a materialman not in privity with the general contractor cannot look to the contract bond for recovery of monies owed to it by a subcontractor of the general contractor. We disagree with this interpretation of the <em>Weybrecht </em>case. Indeed, we believe that <em>Weybrecht </em>actually supports Cadillac\u2019s recovery under the contract bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">In our recent decision <em>EFCO Corp. v. Advanced Glazing Technology, Inc. </em>(May 19, 1994), Franklin App. No. 93APE10-1377, unreported, 1994 WL 194984, this court examined the <em>Weybrecht </em>decision in depth and rejected Buckeye Union\u2019s interpretation. In <em>EFCO, supra, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">\u201cIn <em>Weybrecht, </em>the court concluded that the meaning of \u2018subcontractor,\u2019 as used in G.C. 2365-1 to G.C. 2365-4, would include a materialman, such as Carver-Behan; that the conditions of the bond were intended to cover the debts of a subcontractor as well as a general contractor; that, as a subcontractor, Carver-Behan had defaulted on its obligation and, hence, Weybrecht was entitled to recover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">\n<em>\u2018We disagree with appellee that, in Weybrecht, the court abandoned the distinction between a subcontractor and a materialman and we conclude that, in Weybrecht, the court found a materialman was a type of subcontractor or included within the term \u2018subcontractor.\u2019 We also disagree with appellee that Weybrecht was seeking to enforce a claim belonging to Carver-Behan against the general contractor.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">\n<em>it * * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\"><em>\u201cLast, we disagree with appellee that, in Weybrecht, the materialman was granted recovery on its claim because it was in privity of contract with the general contractor. The facts of Weybrecht are clear that Weybrecht\u2019s only </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>contract was with Carver-Behan, not the general contractor.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In <em>EFCO, supra, </em>we relied upon our prior decision in <em>Lake Erie Constr. Co., Inc. v. Setterlin Co. </em>(Aug. 12, 1986), Franklin App. No. 86AP-408, unreported, 1986 WL 9048, wherein we made the following observations about the <em>Weybrecht </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\"><em>\u201cThe resulting state of the law under R.C. 153.54 </em>ei <em>seq. is that \u2018a materialman of a materialman\u2019 is protected, as presumably a laborer for a laborer would be; but a subcontractor who provides both labor and materials must look for assistance elsewhere. </em>The strained logic of the present interpretation of R.C. 153.54 <em>et seq. </em>by the Supreme Court of Ohio is apparent, but since the <em>Weybrecht </em>decision is by a higher court, any change in the law must come from it or from the legislature. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We agree with our prior interpretation of the <em>Weybrecht </em>case in <em>Lake Erie </em>and <em>EFCO, supra, </em>and for the reasons stated therein we reject Buckeye Union\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In the alternative, Buckeye Union attempts to distinguish <em>Weybrecht </em>on the grounds that R.C. 153.54 as amended in 1980 differs from the prior enactment of the statute interpreted in <em>Weybrecht. </em>More specifically, the relevant language of former R.C. 153.54 refers to \u201call subcontractors,\u201d whereas R.C. 153.54(C) as amended in 1980 refers to \u201cany subcontractors.\u201d We fail to see how this distinction could possibly affect the rule of law expressed in <em>Weybrecht. </em>Cf. <em>Wagner-Smith Co. v. Dyson Elec. Co. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 447, 449-450, 14 OBR 566, 568-569, 472 N.E.2d 54, 55-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">In applying <em>Weybrecht to </em>the facts as alleged in Cadillac\u2019s complaint, we hold that the complaint states a claim for relief against Buckeye Union under the contract bond, since Cadillac was a materialman of Advanced Glazing, which was a subcontractor of the general contractor, Mid-State.- The fact that Cadillac is one degree removed from the general contractor is not dispositive of Cadillac\u2019s claim against Buckeye Union in light of the rule expressed in <em>WeybrecM.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Last, Buckeye Union contends that allowing Cadillac to recover under the bond those monies owed to it by Advanced Glazing will unfairly result in a double payment by Mid-State since Mid-State has already paid Advanced Glazing in full and is contractually obligated to indemnify Buckeye Union for any sums Buckeye Union pays under the bond. In the context of our review of a dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), we are confined to the factual allegations of Cadillac\u2019s complaint, which makes no reference to an indemnity agreement. Cf. <em>Slife v. Kundtz Properties </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App.2d 179, 69 O.O.2d 178, 318 N.E.2d 557. Moreover, the indemnity agreement between Mid-State and Buckeye Union is not part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the record herein. Finally, in light of the Ohio Supreme Court decision in <em>Weybrecht, </em>it is clear that any perceived inequities arising from R.C. 153.54 must be remedied either by the Ohio Supreme Court or the state legislature, and not by this court upon review of the trial court\u2019s judgment. See <em>EFCO, supra, </em>at 7; <em>Lake Erie, supra, </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We find that the trial court erred to the prejudice of Cadillac when it dismissed Cadillac\u2019s complaint against Buckeye Union. Cadillac\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Having sustained Cadillac\u2019s sole assignment of error, we hereby reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b76-8\">Peggy Bryant and Close, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\">.
