A trial to the court commenced on October 13, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The state\u2019s evidence showed that appellant and his wife, Patricia Thompson, developed a relationship with Felicia when Felicia visited her aunt, who was living with appellant\u2019s family. Felicia continued to visit appellant\u2019s family every weekend even though her aunt moved out of state in March 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Sometime before June 3, 1993, Kimberly Newman, Felicia\u2019s mother, told Felicia she could no longer visit or talk on the phone with appellant because of her deteriorating grades and behavior. Newman testified that she told appellant not to contact Felicia anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">On Wednesday, June 9, 1993, Felicia was staying at a friend\u2019s house with her mother\u2019s permission. Mark Young, the friend\u2019s father, testified that Felicia became upset around the time she called appellant. Felicia testified that she called appellant\u2019s home to talk to Patricia Thompson, his wife, who was not home. Appellant upset Felicia by telling her she must not love him and his family anymore because she had quit visiting them. Appellant then asked her to come to his house. Felicia stated that she agreed because she did not want to cause any problems. Appellant\u2019s wife testified that Felicia was upset because her mother\u2019s boyfriend had hit her.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Young agreed to allow appellant to pick up Felicia since she was so upset and because appellant told Young he was her uncle. Appellant then came to Young\u2019s house with a friend, Buzz O\u2019Dell. Appellant appeared to be drunk and was carrying a handgun in his back pocket. Appellant asked Young, whom he had never met, to lie to Felicia\u2019s mother about the reason for allowing Felicia to leave with appellant. Felicia left Young\u2019s house without complaint and spent the night at appellant\u2019s house without her mother\u2019s knowledge or permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">On Thursday, June 10, Patricia Thompson took Felicia to Kimberly Newman\u2019s place of employment. Newman told Felicia that she was in trouble. In Patricia Thompson\u2019s presence, Felicia lied to her mother about why she had spent the night at appellant\u2019s home. Newman could not keep Felicia at work, so she asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Patricia Thompson to keep Felicia until she could pick her up after work. Newman\u2019s boyfriend picked Felicia up, which upset Felicia because she knew she would be in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">On the next day, Friday, June 11, 1993, Felicia tried to call appellant while her mother was not home and spoke with his wife. Felicia claimed that Patricia Thompson asked her to come to appellant\u2019s house; Patricia Thompson stated that Felicia asked to come. Subsequently, O\u2019Dell arrived at Felicia\u2019s home to pick her up, with appellant following on a motorcycle. They then stopped at three bars before arriving at appellant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">That evening, appellant called the Middletown Police Department, making allegations that Felicia was afraid to go home due to abuse by her mother\u2019s boyfriend. Since they did not have jurisdiction, the Middletown police officers referred the case to the Butler County Sheriffs Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Deputy Darrell Sizemore, the responding officer, was already aware of a missing person report on Felicia filed by Newman. When he arrived at appellant\u2019s home, appellant told Sizemore that he wanted custody of Felicia. Sizemore told appellant he could not give him custody of the child. At appellant\u2019s request, Sizemore questioned Felicia. However, Felicia did not tell Sizemore she was being abused in her mother\u2019s home; instead she told him about basic parental restrictions such as not being allowed to stay up as late as she wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Since he could discern no reason to keep Felicia away from her mother, Sizemore told Felicia in the presence of appellant and his wife that Felicia would have to go home. Patricia Thompson and Felicia left the room to gather Felicia\u2019s clothes. Patricia Thompson returned a few moments later and stated that Felicia had jumped out a window and run away. At some point, Newman and her boyfriend had arrived and the situation grew hostile, so Sizemore sent them home, promising to come and assist them in making a report. After searching appellant\u2019s home, Sizemore told appellant that if Felicia came back, she would have to be returned home. Sizemore also told appellant that he had to follow proper procedures, such as calling the Butler County Children Services Board, if he felt Felicia needed to be placed in another home.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Felicia testified that O\u2019Dell pulled her out the window. O\u2019Dell claimed that he did so at Patricia Thompson\u2019s request and with her help. O\u2019Dell took Felicia to his home, where appellant picked her up some time later. Appellant did not notify the police or the children services board of Felicia\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Felicia remained at appellant\u2019s house by herself on Saturday, June 12, while appellant went fishing. Felicia claimed she told appellant she wanted to go home but appellant would not take her. However, despite having access to the phone, she never attempted to call her mother. Patricia Thompson admitted that Felicia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>was supposed to stay in the house since they did not want the police to find her. That evening, O\u2019Dell announced he was taking Felicia home, and he returned her to her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">After hearing the evidence, the trial court dismissed the charge relating to Saturday June 12, 1993. However, the court found appellant guilty of the other two charges, specifically stating that appellant\u2019s motive was irrelevant to the issue of guilt. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In his sole assignment of error, appellant states that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of contributing to the unruliness of a minor without considering his affirmative defense that he was attempting to protect the child from abuse. Appellant argues that he is immune from prosecution under R.C. 2151.421 since he had a good faith belief that the child was abused and he attempted to report that abuse to authorities. We find this assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">R.C. 2919.24(A)(1) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall * * * [a]id, abet, induce, cause, encourage, or contribute to a child * * * becoming an unruly child, as defined in section 2151.022 [2151.02.2] of the Revised Code * * R.C. 2151.022(A) defines an \u201cunruly child\u201d as any child \u201c[w]ho does not subject himself to the reasonable control of his parents * * * by reason of being wayward or habitually disobedient.\u201d The state is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the offense, including whether the child was in fact unruly. <em>State v. Miclau </em>(1957), 167 Ohio St. 38, 4 O.O.2d 6, 146 N.E.2d 293, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Andriola </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 69, 71, 590 N.E.2d 403, 403-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">R.C. 2151.421(G) confers immunity from civil or criminal liability on any person reporting in good faith known or suspected abuse of a child under eighteen years of age to a peace officer or children services board, and on any person participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from those reports. See <em>Gersper v. Ashtabula Cty. Children Serv. Bd. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 127, 570 N.E.2d 1120. Appellant claims that since he had a good faith belief that Felicia was being abused he was immune from liability, and the trial court erred in failing to consider this immunity as an affirmative defense. We disagree. R.C. 2151.421 is inapplicable since appellant\u2019s convictions were not based upon or the result of his reporting the suspected abuse to the police. They were based upon harboring the child without her mother\u2019s permission and contrary to the instructions of a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">We find only one Ohio case addressing the issue of affirmative defenses to violations of R.C. 2919.24 or its predecessor, former R.C. 2151.41. In <em>State v. Kosinski </em>(Jan. 12, 1981), Geauga App. No. 880, unreported, 1981 WL 4419, a mother was convicted of contributing to the unruliness of a minor after she removed her deaf-mute daughter from a foster home in which she was placed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>court order and took her to another state. The mother claimed her daughter had been raped by a teenage male in the foster home. The Geauga County Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, concluding that the trial court did not err in refusing to admit testimony about the alleged rape. It found that there were no affirmative defenses to violations of former R.C. 2151.41, see R.C. 2901.05(C), and that testimony about the rape was irrelevant to the issue before the court, <em>i.e., </em>whether the mother was guilty of contributing to the unruliness of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We agree with the <em>Kosinski </em>court\u2019s reasoning. R.C. 2919.24(A) is a strict liability offense and therefore the defenses available to the accused are limited. <em>State v. Wood </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 855, 861, 580 N.E.2d 484, 488. The issue before the court was whether appellant contributed to the child\u2019s unruliness, <em>i.e., </em>whether he aided or encouraged her in defying her mother. See <em>In Matter of Cooper </em>(Sept. 22, 1989), Seneca App. No. 13-88-34, unreported, 1989 WL 108730. The state presented sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could reasonably find that the elements of the offense had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore this court will not reverse the conviction. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Even if the affirmative defense of protecting Felicia from abuse were available to appellant, the facts of this case are such that the defense is not persuasive. If appellant believed the child was being abused, he had ample opportunity to report that abuse to the proper authorities, but he did not. Instead, on Wednesday evening, appellant took the child from a friend\u2019s house where she was not in danger of being abused and harbored the child without her mother\u2019s knowledge or permission. Appellant did not call the police or other authorities, but instead returned the child to her mother the following day. On Friday evening, when appellant finally called the police, he did not follow the police officer\u2019s instructions and did not contact the police or the children services board when the child returned to his house from O\u2019Dell\u2019s residence. Patricia Thompson even admitted that on Saturday they were hiding the child from the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The defendant bears the burden to prove an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and the trier of fact may reject that defense on the grounds of credibility. R.C. 2901.05(A); <em>State v. Barr </em>(Sept. 24, 1990), Preble App. No. CA90-02-004, unreported, at 4-5, 1990 WL 138353. In this case, though the trial court stated that appellant\u2019s motive was irrelevant, its comments also indicated it did not find that appellant had proved his allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Based upon the foregoing, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b668-10\">Jones, P.J., Koehler and Walsh, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
