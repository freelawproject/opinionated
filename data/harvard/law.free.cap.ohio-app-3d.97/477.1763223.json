Blackmon, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas granting a dismissal of plaintiff-appellant Pharmed Corporation\u2019s complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over defendant-appellee Biologies, Inc. Pharmed timely appeals, raising the following assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Pharmed argues an Ohio court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over Biologies is consistent with R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) and Civ.R. 4.3(A) since Biologies engaged in \u201ctransacting any business in this state.\u201d Pharmed further argues asserting jurisdiction over Biologies does not offend fundamental notions of fair play and substantial justice as required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the reasons that follow, we agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Pharmed initiated the present action through the filing of its complaint alleging breach of contract. Pharmed alleged that in March 1993, Pharmed and Biologies entered into negotiations whereby Pharmed would purchase ten beds from Biologies at a price of $13,500 each, contingent on Pharmed securing a two-year simple-interest loan. Pharmed sent Biologies a deposit of $13,500 but was unable to secure the loan. Pharmed demanded return of the deposit, but Biologies refused, necessitating the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">In an affidavit attached to Biologics\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, Mark Hagopian, President of Biologies, a Florida corporation, averred Biologics\u2019s principal place of business is in St. Petersburg, Florida and that Biologies owns no real estate in Ohio, nor does Biologies maintain any offices, production facilities or places of business in Ohio. Hagopian further averred that Biologies has no employees, sales representatives, or other agents in Ohio, nor has Biologies ever solicited business or derived substantial revenues from goods or services used or consumed in Ohio. In sum, it was averred, Pharmed has never engaged in any other persistent course of conduct in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Concerning Biologics\u2019s contact with Pharmed, Hagopian averred an independent sales representative, Ron Carew, who does business out of Clearwater, Florida, brought the two parties together. Carew is neither an employee nor an agent of Biologies and has no authority to bind or act on behalf of Biologies. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>parties entered into said contract for the sale of said beds after negotiations, which took place primarily by mail, telephone, and facsimile. Hagopian acknowledged that on one occasion, he went to Ohio to view Pharmed\u2019s facilities, but maintained no other representative of Biologies went to Ohio in connection with this matter. All other meetings between the parties occurred in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The beds were to be delivered, according to standard terms of sale, F.O.B. at Biologics\u2019s place of business in Florida. However, Pharmed had not completed the purchase of the beds and no beds have been delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In opposition to Biologics\u2019s motion, Elias Coury, Vice President of Pharmed, substantially corroborated Hagopian\u2019s affidavit concerning the negotiations involved in the contract. Coury added Pharmed was interested in purchasing the beds for resale in Ohio and Biologies was aware these beds were to be used within Ohio. Additionally, a signed memorandum of the agreement was attached to Coury\u2019s affidavit. The memorandum of agreement indicates Biologies agreed to a repurchase option on five of the beds to be exercised one year after consummation of the contract should Pharmed be unable to resell the beds in Ohio. A plaintiff has the burden of establishing the trial court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant once the defendant timely challenges the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Giachetti v. Holmes </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 306, 308, 14 OBR 371, 373, 471 N.E.2d 165, 167-168; <em>L.B. Cleveland, Inc. v. Metal Purchasing Co., Inc. </em>(Feb. 15, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 58163, unreported, 1990 WL 14117. Where the trial court determines jurisdiction without an evidentiary hearing, as in the present case, the trial court must (1) view the allegations in the pleadings and the documentary evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, and (2) resolve all reasonable competing inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Giachetti, supra, </em>14 Ohio App.3d at 307, 14 OBR at 372, 471 N.E.2d at 166-168. In such a case, the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction to overcome a motion to dismiss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Recently, in <em>U.S. Sprint Communications Co. Ltd. Partnership v. Mr. K\u2019s Foods, Inc. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 181, 184-185, 624 N.E.2d 1048, 1051-52, the Ohio Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u2018When determining whether a state court has personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation the court is obligated to engage in a two-step analysis. First, the court must determine whether the state\u2019s \u2018long-arm\u2019 statute and applicable civil rule confer personal jurisdiction, and, if so, whether granting jurisdiction under the statute and the rule would deprive the defendant of the right to due process of law pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) See, also, <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall Co. v. Mitchell\u2019s Formal Wear, Inc. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 73, 559 N.E.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Ohio\u2019s \u201clong-arm statute,\u201d R.C. 2307.382, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201c(A) A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201c(1) Transacting any business in this state[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1) further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">\u201cWhen Service Permitted. Service of process may be made outside of this state, as provided in this rule, in any action in this state, upon a person who, at the time of service of process, is a nonresident of this state or is a resident of this state who is absent from this state. \u2018Person\u2019 includes an individual, his executor, administrator, or other personal representative, or a corporation, partnership, association, or any other legal or commercial entity, who, acting directly or by an agent, has caused an event to occur out of which the claim that is the subject of the complaint arose, from the person\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">\u201c(1) Transacting any business in this state[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">The \u201clong-arm statute\u201d and foregoing Civil Rule are consistent and, in fact, complement each other. <em>Kentucky Oaks, supra, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 75, 559 N.E.2d 477. Each is very broadly worded and permits jurisdiction over nonresident defendants who are transacting any business in Ohio. <em>Id. </em>Transact \u201c \u2018 * * * means to prosecute negotiations; to carry on business; to have dealings * * *. The word embraces in its meaning the carrying on or prosecution of business negotiations but it is a broader term than the word \u2018contract\u2019 and may involve business negotiations which have been either wholly or partly brought to a conclusion * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 ed. 1979) 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">In determining whether a nonresident defendant\u2019s activities amount to \u201ctransacting any business\u201d in Ohio, .courts must review the facts of each case on a case-by-case basis. <em>U.S. Sprint, supra, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 185, 624 N.E.2d at 1052. In <em>Kentucky Oaks, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that the following conduct constitutes \u201ctransacting any business\u201d within the state:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">\u201cIn the case at bar, Mitchell\u2019s negotiated the lease by telephone contact to Ohio with an Ohio-based limited partnership. Mitchell\u2019s intentionally and voluntarily entered into a ten-year contract by signing the document in Georgia and mailing it to Ohio. The document creates ongoing duties and obligations for the life of the contract. Undoubtedly, both parties sought the benefit of each other\u2019s bargain in hopes of realizing a pecuniary gain. The fact that Mitchell\u2019s maintained no physical presence in Ohio does not preclude a finding that it transacted business in this state.\u201d <em>Id., </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 75-76, 624 N.E.2d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">Significantly, the lease in <em>Kentucky Oaks </em>concerned property located in Kentucky but owned by the Ohio-based limited partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>In addition to <em>Kentucky Oaks, </em>we believe <em>Hammill Mfg. Co. v. Quality Rubber Prod., Inc. </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 369, 612 N.E.2d 472, is analogous to the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Hammill, </em>the Lucas County Court of Appeals found that the following conduct amounts to \u201ctransacting any business\u201d in Ohio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cIn the case at bar, QRP negotiated the contract by telephone contact to Ohio with an Ohio-based corporation. QRP intentionally and voluntarily entered into a contract by issuing the purchase order in California and mailing it to Ohio. The document creates ongoing duties and obligations for the life of the contract. Undoubtedly, both parties sought the benefit of each other\u2019s bargains. The fact that QRP maintained no physical presence in Ohio for the initial contract does not preclude a finding that it transacted business in this state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374, 612 N.E.2d at 475.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Finally, we also rely on <em>Columbus Show Case Co. v. CEE Contracting, Inc. </em>(1992), 75 Ohio App.3d 559, 599 N.E.2d 881, in reaching our decision <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Columbus Show Case, </em>the Franklin County Court <em>of </em>Appeals found the following conduct sufficient to constitute \u201ctransacting any business\u201d within Ohio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201cCEE\u2019s president stipulates that communications leading up to the contract with appellant were accomplished by telephone or mail between its office in the state of New York and appellant\u2019s office in Columbus, Ohio. The mere fact that no employee or agent of CEE was \u2018physically\u2019 present in Ohio during negotiations between parties to the case at bar, or that CEE has not maintained a \u2018physical presence\u2019 at any time in Ohio, is not supportive of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of that action for lack of personal jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\u201cIn the situation presented by the litigation between appellant and CEE, we note that three state court systems could be utilized. The actual showcases were installed in New Jersey and the New Jersey sales tax assessed is at least part of the damages alleged; so, New Jersey is one possible legal forum. CEE is located in New York, and apparently did the contracting from New York; so, New York is a potential forum. Finally, Ohio, whose involvement for purposes of this litigation is set forth in the affidavits before the trial court, presents the third forum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">\u201cUnder the circumstances, litigation in Ohio is the most appropriate. CEE\u2019s home state of New York is the least appropriate since appellant has not been demonstrated to have any ongoing presence there and since none of the actual work contemplated in the contract for installation of the showcases * * * occurred there and since CEE apparently had ongoing business responsibilities there. However, neither of the parties is a resident there. Apparently some or all of the work incident to the manufacturing of the showcases was done in Ohio, and apparently the installation of the showcases was coordinated through Ohio. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Finally, the fact that CEE initially approached appellant, as opposed to appellant approaching CEE, is significant in determining the most appropriate forum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">After a thorough review of the record and the foregoing case law, we conclude Biologics\u2019s conduct in negotiating, and entering, a contract for the sale of the beds in question amounts to transacting business within the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We initially note that the mere fact Biologies maintains no physical presence in Ohio is not dispositive. Biologies acknowledged it has derived some revenue from goods or services used or consumed in Ohio and has engaged in some conduct in Ohio, although it is said Biologies has not derived substantial revenues or engaged in a persistent course of conduct. More important, it is undisputed that Biologies, in Florida, engaged in negotiations with Pharmed, in Ohio, by mail, telephone and facsimile. Further, Mr. Hagopian, Biologics\u2019s president, acknowledged that on one occasion, he went to Ohio to view Pharmed\u2019s facilities. The parties, by memorandum of agreement and conduct, established a contract with continuing and ongoing duties and obligations. The memorandum of agreement reflects Biologies agreed to a repurchase option on five of the beds should Pharmed be unable to resell them in Ohio. Finally, we assume, for purposes of jurisdiction, that Biologics\u2019s conduct in refusing to return the $13,500 deposit harmed Pharmed, an Ohio-based corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Accordingly, pursuant to R.C. 2307.282(A)(1) and Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1), we conclude the trial court has personal jurisdiction over Biologies.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Next, we must decide whether the trial court can exercise personal jurisdiction over Pharmed without offending the dictates of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A state may assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant if the nonresident defendant has \u201ccertain minimum contacts with it such that maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Internatl. Shoe Co. v. Washington </em>(1945), 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95, 102; <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall, supra, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 76, 559 N.E.2d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">In <em>Kentucky Oaks, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court, quoting favorably from Justice Brennan\u2019s majority opinion in <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 462, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528, noted at 53 Ohio St.3d at 76-77, 559 N.E.2d at 481:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">\u201cJustice Brennan, in writing for the majority of the court, reviewed prior cases and concluded that \u2018 * * * the constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant <em>purposefully </em>established \u201cminimum contacts\u201d in the forum State. <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra </em>[326 U.S.] at 316 [66 S.Ct. at 158, 90 L.Ed. at 102].\u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>[471 U.S.] at 474 [105 S.Ct. at 2183, 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 542]. The nonresident defendant has purposefully established minimum contacts \u2018 * * * where the defendant \u201cdeliberately\u201d has engaged in significant activities within a State * * * <em>or </em>has created <em>\u201ccontinuing obligations\u201d </em>between himself and residents of the forum * * * he manifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are shielded by \u201cthe benefits and protections\u201d of the forum\u2019s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to require him to submit to the burdens of litigation in the forum as well.\u2019 (Citations omitted and emphasis added in part.) <em>Id. </em>at 475-476 [105 S.Ct. at 2184, 85 L.Ed.2d at 542-543]. Furthermore, minimum contacts are satisfied when the defendant foreseeably causes injury in the forum state if \u2018 \u201c * * * the defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\u201d * * *\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 474 [105 S.Ct. at 2183, 85 L.Ed.2d at 542] (quoting <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson </em>[1980], 444 U.S. 286, 297 [100 S.Ct. 559, 567, 62 L.Ed.2d 490, 501]).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u201cJustice Brennan also noted that the question of whether personal jurisdiction exists does not end with a finding that the nonresident defendant has purposely established minimum contacts and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201c \u2018Once it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum State, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with <em>\u201cfair play and substantial justice.\u201d </em>* * * Thus courts in \u201cappropriate case[s]\u201d may evaluate \u201cthe burden on the defendant,\u201d \u201cthe forum State\u2019s interest in adjudicating the dispute,\u201d \u201cthe plaintiffs interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,\u201d \u201cthe interstate judicial system\u2019s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,\u201d and the \u201cshared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\u201d * * * <em>These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required. </em>* * * On the other hand, where a defendant who purposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks to defeat jurisdiction, he must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.\u2019 (Citations omitted and emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>[471 U.S.] at 476-477 [105 S.Ct. at 2184-2185, 85 L.Ed.2d at 543].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Applying the foregoing guidelines to the case <em>sub judice, </em>we conclude that Biologies has purposely established sufficient minimum contacts through its activities and conduct and has foreseeably caused injury to an Ohio corporation to have reasonably anticipated being haled into court in Ohio. Accordingly, it is evident to us that assertion of personal jurisdiction over Biologies by an Ohio court comports with fair play and substantial justice as required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Biologies conducted significant activities within the state of Ohio by negotiating with an Ohio-based corporation by phone, facsimile and mail for the sale of beds which, Biologies knew, were to be resold by Pharmed within Ohio. Biologies further established continuing obligations between itself and Pharmed by agreeing to a repurchase option of five of the beds should Pharmed be unable to resell them. Additionally, by accepting a down payment of $13,500 on the beds and failing to return it after Pharmed was unable to obtain the contingent financing, we assume Biologies has foreseeably caused injury to an Ohio resident such that it should have reasonably anticipated being haled into an Ohio court.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Finally, the requirements of fair play and substantial justice are served by assertion of personal jurisdiction over Biologies in the case <em>sub judice. </em>It has long been recognized that modem transportation and communications have made it much less burdensome for a party to defend a lawsuit in a state where he engages in economic activity. <em>Kentucky Oaks, supra, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 76, 559 N.E.2d at 480, citing <em>McGee v. Internatl. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1957), 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223. We also note that Biologies has failed to demonstrate that the burden of defending this lawsuit in Ohio is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Ohio courts also have an interest in adjudicating the dispute, and Pharmed has an interest in obtaining the relief requested. Ohio courts have recognized the state\u2019s interest in resolving suits brought by one of its residents against a nonresident defendant over conduct which has occurred or partially occurred within the state. <em>Kentucky Oaks, supra, </em>citing <em>Wright Internatl. Express, Inc. v. Roger Dean Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(S.D.Ohio 1988), 689 F.Supp. 788; see, also, <em>U.S. Sprint, supra; L.B. Cleveland, Inc., supra; Yauger v. Hamilton Sorter Co., Inc. </em>(Oct. 18, 1993), Butler App. No. CA93-02-030, unreported 1993 WL 414183; <em>CompuServe, Inc. v.
