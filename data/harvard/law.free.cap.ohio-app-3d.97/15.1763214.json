In this judgment, the court found appellant, Robin Skaggs, guilty of a violation of R.C. 2923.21(A)(3), improperly furnishing firearms to a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>On August 13, 1993, deputies of the Ashtabula County Sheriffs Department responded to a report of gunfire from a mobile home located in Lenox Township, in which a thirteen-year-old boy had been nicked in the head by a bullet. Upon arrival, the deputies, along with a S.W.A.T. team, secured appellant\u2019s residence, and found appellant\u2019s two sons, Rockwell and Robin, Jr., inside. Detective Frey from the Sheriffs Department found three weapons lying on a mattress in a bedroom: two 7.62 mm. Japanese assault rifles and a .22 caliber rifle. The boys were transported to the youth development center at which time they were interviewed by the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The boys initially stated that they had been discharging the weapons at a garbage dump where they normally shot. However, when confronted with evidence of several spent 7.62 mm. casings found in the bedroom as well as outside the bedroom window, the boys admitted that they had been shooting from inside the mobile home. The boys were not asked whether they had had permission to discharge these guns; however, Detective Frey testified that he did not see any locked cabinets for the storage of either the guns or the ammunition. Appellant was never asked about how the weapons were stored or whether he had placed any restrictions on their use by his sons. Appellant did indicate that his sons shot all the time from the rear of the mobile home.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">At trial, the state called appellant\u2019s son, Rockwell. He testified that they had taken the guns from an unlocked closet and had acquired the ammunition by breaking the hinges off of a locked box containing the ammunition. He testified that on all other occasions, they target shot under the supervision of their parents. At this point, the state rested and the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Appellant took the stand in his own defense and testified that he kept the weapons in a closet and that the boys had been instructed not to use them when he was not present. He farther testified that the ammunition was kept in a box on the other side of the bedroom, and that Detective Frey had never asked him whether the boys had permission to use the guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">On cross-examination, appellant acknowledged that on a prior occasion, his son, Rockwell, had fired a shot at a man to protect his mother. Upon learning of this, appellant indicated that he wished that his son had shot the son of a bitch. Appellant stated that his wife had been present during this incident, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Before this court, appellant advances the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">\u201cThe judgment rendered by the Ashtabula County Court, Eastern Area, is erroneous in the following respects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">\u201c1. In overruling defendant\u2019s motion for discharge at the close of the State\u2019s case and at the close of the evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u201c2. In that the judgment and finding is not sustained by sufficient evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">\u201c3. In that the judgment and finding of the court is contrary to law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">\u201c4. For other errors occurring at trial to the prejudice of defendant and apparent on the face of the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Appellant argues that there was no evidence presented at trial that he \u201cfurnished\u201d the firearms to his sons, and that the state failed to present evidence that appellant\u2019s sons were under eighteen years of age. Therefore, appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence, based upon insufficient evidence, and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">R.C. 2923.21 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201c(A) No person shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\"><em>U </em>* if: sf:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">\u201c(3) Furnish any firearm to a person under age eighteen, except for purposes of lawful hunting, or for purposes of instruction in firearms safety, care, handling, or marksmanship under the supervision or control of a responsible adult.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">Appellant argues that R.C. 2923.21 imposes no duty to <em>prevent </em>a minor from acquiring or using a firearm, but rather prohibits the <em>furnishing </em>of a firearm to a minor, <em>ie., </em>a voluntary or proactive act. From this, appellant contends that the state presented no evidence that appellant <em>acted </em>in such a manner that would constitute the furnishing of the guns to his sons. Rather, he argues that the only evidence offered as to this point indicates that appellant never gave his sons permission to use his firearms when he was not present, and that appellant\u2019s sons had to break the hinges off of a locked box to gain access to the ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">The state counters by arguing that appellant\u2019s sons had initially lied about where they had been shooting the guns and that, therefore, the credibility of Rockwell\u2019s testimony about the locked ammunition box was in doubt. The state further argues that Detective Frey never found the broken lock, and that appellant never brought this matter to anyone\u2019s attention prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">It would seem that the state would have us shift the burden to <em>appellant </em>to establish that he did not furnish the weapons to his sons. However, it is the state\u2019s burden to establish that appellant furnished the guns to his sons. A review of Detective Frey\u2019s testimony reveals that he did not investigate as to how the boys came into possession of the firearms. While he testified that he did not find any ammunition box with broken hinges, he never testified that he searched for one or questioned appellant or his two sons as to how the boys gained access to the weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>In its brief before this court, the state places great emphasis on the issue of whether appellant\u2019s sons actually broke into a locked ammunition box to gain access to the ammunition. However, we would note that R.C. 2923.11(B)(1) provides a definition of firearm. This definition specifically provides that \u201cfirearm\u201d includes an <em>unloaded </em>firearm. Therefore, it is immaterial whether appellant attempted to restrict his sons from free access to the ammunition box. The only issue is whether appellant \u201cfurnished\u201d his (unloaded) firearms to his minor sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">While R.C. 2923.21 fails to provide a definition of \u201cfurnish,\u201d it is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 608, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201cTo supply, provide, or equip, for accomplishment of a particular purpose. * if: * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Implicit in this definition is the requirement of some type of positive act by which a firearm is supplied, provided, or equipped. This construction is supported by a reading of R.C. 2923.19, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">\u201c(A) No person, * * * possessing * * * any dangerous ordnance, shall negligently fail to take proper precautions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">\u201c(1) To secure the dangerous ordnance against * * * its acquisition or use by any unauthorized or incompetent person * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Where these two statutory sections differ is that R.C. 2923.21 is directed at \u201cfirearms\u201d while R.C. 2923.19 is concerned with \u201cdangerous ordnances.\u201d The latter clearly encompasses the negligent failure to take proper precautions in securing a dangerous ordnance from acquisition by a minor. The fact that R.C. 2923.21 fails to contain similar language in relation to firearms indicates that it does not encompass a situation where a party fails to act. Rather, some act of supplying, providing, or equipping is necessary to sustain a conviction under R.C. 2923.21.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">The testimony brought forth at trial established that appellant kept his firearms in an unlocked closet. Further, there was uncontroverted testimony that the boys were only allowed to use the guns under appellant\u2019s supervision. Certainly, given this set of facts, we must conclude that there was insufficient evidence for the trier of fact to conclude that appellant <em>furnished </em>firearms to his sons. The state failed to put forth any evidence which would suggest that appellant acted in any manner to supply or equip his sons with his weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Appellant also contends that the state failed to introduce any evidence showing that his sons were under the age of eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The state counters by noting that appellant stipulated at trial that appellant was the father of the two boys. Further, Detective Frey testified that when the boys were taken into custody, they were transported to the youth development center, where he was of the understanding that they had been cited for some type of delinquency. The state argues that this is sufficient circumstantial evidence demonstrating that appellant\u2019s sons were under the age of eighteen, thus establishing this element of the charged offense. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We find that appellant effectively stipulated to this fact, when, before the state presented its case, his counsel stipulated that appellant\u2019s sons did discharge his firearms \u201cwithout there being any adult present * * *.\u201d This stipulation, along with the other circumstantial evidence, was sufficient to establish the fact that appellant\u2019s sons were under eighteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">We conclude, however, that the state failed to prove that appellant \u201cfurnished\u201d his firearms to his sons. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded in order for the trial court to enter judgment in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b54-10\">Joseph E.
