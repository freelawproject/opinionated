Hamilton, not guilty of transportation of a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle in violation of R.C. 2923.16(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">On March 6, 1994, defendant was driving eastbound on U.S. 33 when his van was pulled over by Trooper Richardson of the Ohio State Highway Patrol for traveling sixty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five mile per hour zone. Trooper Richardson issued a speeding citation to defendant and asked him questions pertaining to his place of departure and destination. Trooper Richardson next asked defendant for permission to search his van. Defendant stated he would allow a search of his van, and he was provided with a consent and search form to that effect. Defendant was then asked if he had any guns or drugs in the van. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>He responded that he had no drugs, but that there were guns in the van. Trooper Richardson proceeded to search the van, uncovering a twelve-gauge shotgun, a .22 caliber rifle, a loaded air pistol, and a loaded .32 caliber revolver.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Defendant was charged with one count of knowingly transporting a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle in violation of R.C. 2923.16(B). On March 21, 1994, an arraignment hearing 'was held at which defendant pled no contest to the charge set forth in the state\u2019s complaint. Following defendant\u2019s plea, the trial court entered a finding of not guilty to the charge and ordered that the weapons found in the van be returned to defendant. On April 19, 1994, the state filed a motion with this court, seeking leave to appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal at arraignment. While the principles of double jeopardy preclude any further proceedings against this defendant, we are nonetheless authorized by <em>State v. Bistricky </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644, to review the substantive ruling of the trial court resulting in defendant\u2019s acquittal. In <em>Bistricky, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201c * * * a court of appeals has discretionary authority pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A) to decide whether to review substantive law rulings made in a criminal case which results in a judgment of acquittal so long as the verdict itself is not appealed.\u201d <em>Bistricky, supra, </em>at 160, 555 N.E.2d at 646.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">On May 5, 1994, we sustained the state\u2019s motion and granted leave to appeal pursuant to <em>State v. Bistricky.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The state raises the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred by suppressing evidence sua sponte without giving the state an opportunity to respond' or appeal the trial court\u2019s suppression of evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">The state argues that by acquitting the defendant, the trial court denied the state the right to appeal the court\u2019s finding that Trooper Richardson lacked probable cause to search defendant\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">The right of the state to appeal from the granting of a motion to suppress is statutory in nature and is set forth in R.C. 2945.67(A) and Crim.R. 12(J). R.C. 2945.67(A), which governs the general right of the state to appeal in a criminal case, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-12\">\u201cA prosecuting attorney, village solicitor, city director of law, or the attorney general may appeal as a matter of right any decision of a trial court in a criminal case, or any decision of a juvenile court in a delinquency case, which decision grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, complaint, or information, a motion to suppress evidence, or motion for the return of seized property * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Moreover, Crim.R. 12(J) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201cThe state may take an appeal as a matter of right * * * from the granting of a motion to suppress evidence if, in addition to filing a notice of appeal, the prosecuting attorney certifies that: (1) the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay; and (2) the granting of the motion has rendered the state\u2019s proof with respect to the pending charge so weak in its entirety that any reasonable possibility of effective prosecution has been destroyed. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is apparent that while no motion to suppress was ever filed with or granted by the trial court, the court in substance <em>sua sponte </em>suppressed the evidence found in defendant\u2019s van and characterized its ruling as a judgment of acquittal. At defendant\u2019s arraignment hearing, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201c * * * However, on the charge upon your plea of no contest, my finding is not guilty. I don\u2019t find that the officer had any right to search your van. And I\u2019m going to enter a finding of not guilty to that charge. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">It is well established that when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201c * * * [a] motion to suppress is granted, it is not for the trial court to determine the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence to proceed with the prosecution and hence enter a judgment of acquittal. Rather, the state must be permitted to determine whether it will seek a stay of proceedings in order to exercise its right of appeal pursuant to Crim.R. 12(J), or alternatively to proceed to a final verdict or judgment. The choice is that of the prosecution.\u201d <em>State v. Fraternal Order of Eagles Aerie 0337 Buckeye </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 166, 169, 569 N.E.2d 478, 481.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">We therefore hold that it was error for the trial court to indirectly rule on the admissibility of the state\u2019s evidence by granting a final judgment of acquittal. To this extent, the judgment of the Bellefontaine Municipal Court is reversed. However, notwithstanding the erroneous basis of the trial court\u2019s judgment, the actual acquittal of this defendant must be affirmed inasmuch as this defendant cannot be twice be put in jeopardy. <em>State v. Fraternal Order of Eagles Aerie 0337 Buckeye, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b685-12\">Hadley and Evans, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
