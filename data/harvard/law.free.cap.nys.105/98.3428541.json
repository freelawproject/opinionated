The action was brought to recover the price of certain corduroys claimed to have been sold and delivered by the plaintiff to defendants. The answer pleaded a general denial, the statute of frauds, and a breach of warranty, in that the goods delivered failed to comply with the samples upon the faith of which the order 'for the corduroys was alleged to have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">' Under the general denial the defendants attempted to prove that there was no sale, and that the goods were delivered merely for inspection. We think the evidence presented was conclusive against this contention. So far as the alleged breach of warranty is concerned, the learned trial justice having found on conflicting testimony that the goods were in accord with the sample shown at the- time of the sale, that question is not now before us for determination. The evidence offered upon the trial was sufficient upon this point to sustain the finding of the trial court. \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b124-17\">The only question now open for our determination is whether the sale made falls within the condemnation of the statute of frauds. The plaintiff claims that the correspondence between the parties and the letters written by the defendants after the goods were sent are sufficient to meet the requirements of the statute. In order to determine this question it is necessary to set out in full the somewhat voluminous correspondence between the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-18\">New York, June 18, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-19\">J.

In reply would say that, after very careful consideration and examination of the cases, we cannot agree to accept your cancellation. Our Mr. Smith reports that the two pieces of Corduroys which he examined under your direction were absolutely first class in every particular, and are merchantable first quality goods. Further than this, before being shipped to you, these goods were examined both by - the finishing works and by our own superintendent, and the reports we have show them to be first quality. We are perfectly willing to be fair in the matter, and, if y\u00f3u can show that the goods are seconds or unmerchantable, we will accept your cancellation. We are. willing to have the matter adjudicated by the arbitration of some disinterested corduroy man, but we will not accept your cancellation on any other terms. So far as the disposition of the goods is concerned, would say that you must use your own best judgment regarding this. We have delivered the goods to you in good condition, and we will hold you responsible for them. When the bill becomes due, we will proceed to collect the amount owed to us. We are herewith returning you the invoice in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">Yours very truly, .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_a\">J.

But those two cases delivered to us are, as stated before, very imperfect and cannot be cut into garments without having most of them come out damaged'. We therefore consider those goods unmerchantable and entire useless to us. We are returning to you those two cases to-day, amount of which you will please place to our credit, and, if you will be kind enough to- take the trouble to examine those goods thoroughly, you will find that we are justified in refusing to accept same.

In reply would say that we understand that these goods were brought here by a truckman and we refused to accept delivery of them. We have no desire whatsoever to force you to take goods which are not satisfactory to you; but, before allowing you to return them to us, we must have proven to our satisfaction that the goods are not up to the sample sent you at the time of the sale. When Mr. Smith was up to see you, he was not given the opportunity to examine the goods, as you showed him only two pieces, and would not allow him to go over any more of the goods. These two pieces Mr. Smith reports to us were of first-class quality, and, if the remainder of the two cases were not satisfactory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>you should have shown him exactly on what you based your complaint.

As*a result of repeated adjudications it is now settled that the written evidence required by the statute need not be comprised in a single statement, but that letters, telegrams, bills, receipts, or other forms of writings which sufficiently evidence the contract of the parties are sufficient. 1 Green-leaf on Evidence, \u00a7, 268; Brown on Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 345a and 6; Wilson v. Lewiston Mill Co., 150 N. Y. 318, 44 N. E. 959, 55 Am. St. Rep. 680; Hagedorn v. Lang, 34 App. Div. 117, 122, 54 N. Y. Supp. 602; Blum v. Blum (Sup.) 90 N. Y. Supp. 445. Thus in Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 2454, the author, after drawing a distinction between those statutory provisions which require the contract to be put in writing and those which require a \u201cnote or memorandum in writing\u201d of the \u201cagreement,\u201d and pointing out that in the first class the writing required is constitutive, while in the latter it is merely evidential, says, in reference to the provisions of the statute of frauds requiring a \u201cnote or memorandum\u201d of the agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">\u201cIn other words, the writing is not the contract, but is distinct from it and is merely the parties admission that such a contract was made. The difference is plain, and is generally conceded, and shows its practical results in various ways. For example, the written admission may be made subsequently to the contract; it may even in terms attempt to repudiate the contract; it may be in a letter to a third person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">In Browne on the Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 354a, it is said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">\u201cIt therefore always has been held that letters addressed to a third party, stating and affirming a contract, may be used against the writer as a mem-. orandum of it, and for the same reason an oral contract may be taken out of the statute by letters which admit the making of the contract by the writer, but in terms repudiate his liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">Reading the letters of the defendants in the correspondence set forth above in the light of the authorities, it is clear that they constitute a sufficient \u201cnote or memorandum\u201d of the contract between the parties to meet the requirements of the statute. The fact that these letters of the defendants were written subsequent to the sale, and that in terms they repudiate the defendants\u2019 liability, make them none the less conclusive as evidence of the sale that was made. In the letter of June 19th the defendants say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u201cWe note contents of your letter of the 19th, and beg to state that we have examined the corduroys thoroughly and find that we cannot possibly use them. Those goods were sold to us as firsts,?\u2019 etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In the letter of June 28th the defendants say: ,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">\u201cWe note contents of your favor of the 15tli, and in reply we do not mean to cancel our order on those corduroys placed with you, as we bought , hose goods in good faith, and can use quite an additional quantity of same, provided,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">And again in the letter of July 2d, which was- the last the defendants wrote to the plaintiff, they say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">1 \u201cIf you have perfect goods, on hand- to -deliver to us, we are ready to accept same at prices sold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">It is impossible to read these letters without coming to the conclusion that the sale was made, that its terms were agreed upon, and that the only point in dispute between the parties related to the quality of the goods. All of the essential terms of a contract were evidenced by these letters, and by the bill or invoice to which the letters refer, which was sent back and forth between the parties during their correspondence .several times. The letters of the defendants show that the sale was made upon the terms set out in the bill or invoice, and the latter contains a memorandum of all the terms of a valid contract. Thus in the bill or invoice the parties are named, the subject-matter and time of delivery are specified, and the consideration is expressed. Nothing was omitted which was requisite to comply with the terms of the statute. Myers v. Harris (Sup.) <em>104 N. </em>Y. Supp. 514; Blum v. Blum (Sup.) 90 N. Y. Supp. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The case of Wilson v. Lewiston Mill Co., 150 N. Y. 314, 44 N. E. 959, 55 Am. St. Rep. 680 upon which the appellants rely, does not support their contention. In that case it was held that the facts there disclosed did not constitute one who was a salesman of the plaintiff an agent of the defendant, so as to make his letters to the plaintiffs transmitting the- defendant\u2019s bid such a memorandum as was required by the statutes of frauds of the state of Maine. The letter of the defendants under consideration in that case neither recognized nor admitted the making of the contract to which it alluded, and the facts of that case were such as to clearly distinguish it from the facts of the case now before us. The opinion of the court in Wilson v. Lewis-ton Mills Co., supra, so far as it discusses the nature of the written evidence requisite to satisfy the .statute of frauds, is strong and convincing authority for the view above expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
