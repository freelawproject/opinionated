The plaintiff claimed the car had been brought to a stop, and, while in the act of attempting to board it, it was suddenly started, and that he was thrown and sustained the injuries in reference to which he testified. The defendant contended that the car was in motion, that it had not come to a stop, and that the plaintiff ran after it, and, in attempting to board it while it was in mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>tion, was injured. The learned trial justice charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">\u201cAs a matter of law it was the duty of the company to give the man a fair and reasonable chance to get aboard the ear, and if, without his fault, the accident occurred through the negligence of the defendant, your verdict would have to be for the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">To this part \u00f3f the charge the defendant duly except\u00e9d. We think that this part of the charge was erroneous, and that a new trial should be ordered. The rule laid down by the learned trial justice was too broadly stated. The duty, which the justice declared the defendant was under, did not arise until the car had been brought to a stop or the plaintiff had been invited to board \u2018it. The jury were justified in drawing the inference,- from the charge made by the trial justice, that the defendant was-negligent in not bringing the car to-a stop, so that the plaintiff might have \u201ca fair and reasonable chance to get aboard the car.\u201d In view of the issue between the parties as to the manner in which the accident happened, we think that the error committed was prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with- costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
