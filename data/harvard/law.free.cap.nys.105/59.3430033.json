The negligence is that the door had no hook to fasten it back to the wall of the vestibule when open. It never had one. The house was a new one. The accident happened in July, and both this outer door and the inside vestibule door were standing open. The plaintiff\u2019s mother was a tenant of the house, and was also its janitor, and the plaintiff lived with her. There is no evidence that the mother ever complained to the defendant of the lack of a hook on the door, or asked that one be put there.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">It would be, carrying the liability of a landlord for negligence to an extreme that has no foundation to uphold this judgment. If the door was dangerous without a hook that was just as plain to every one as to the landlord. It has remained until now for any one to suggest that the millions of front doors without hooks to hold them back when open are dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and' new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
