It charges, either directly or inferentiaiiy, that the firm of Tobin <em>&amp; </em>Tobin is connected in business with and pursuing the methods of one Anthony, who, according to the articles, has been notorious for years as a broker of bogus insurance, that he was once convicted for selling \u201cfake\u201d policies, and served a sentence in jail. The articles certainly have a tendency to injure the business of the firm by charging that the persons con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>nected with it are not honest, and that the firm is doing a dishonest business. They are libelous per se. Whatever injures the firm injures each partner, and each may maintain an dction to recover the damage caused thereby to his interest. 18 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law (2d Ed.) p. 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed with costs, with leave to the defendant to withdraw its demurrer and interpose an answer on payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
