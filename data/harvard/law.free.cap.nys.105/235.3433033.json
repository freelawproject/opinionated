J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiI\">The appeal herein having been reached for argument, the respondent raises the point that the printed case has never been settled or signed by the justice before whom the action was tried. An examination of the record shows this to be true. \u201cA case on appeal must be \u2018settled and signed\u2019 by the trial judge. A stipulation that it is a copy of the record filed does not cure the defect. The certificate must state that the case contains all the evidence.\u201d Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 997; Gregory v. Clark, 53 App. Div. 74, 65 N. Y. Supp. 687. The case must therefore be sent to the lower court for amendment. Brush v. Blot, 11 App. Div. 626, 42 N. Y. Supp. 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-18\">Judgment will be affirmed, with costs, unless the appellant causes the return to be settled and signed within 30 days, or, if the same has been settled and signed, he causes the record to be amended so as to show that fact, and pays $10 costs and disbursements on this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
