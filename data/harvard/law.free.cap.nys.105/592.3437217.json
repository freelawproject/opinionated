At the place of the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>cident the road was of a single track, with here and there side tracks called \u201csidings.\u201d A short distance west of Stormville station was a siding called \u201cStormville Long Siding.\u201d Before the train started eastward from a station three or four miles west of Stormville, an order had been given to the engineer and conductor of the train to meet a west-bound freight train known as \u201cExtra 439\u201d-at Stormville long siding. The regulations of the defendant required extra 439 to take this siding and to leave the track clear for the train on which the intestate was at work. Extras were designated by the engine number, and this number, \u201cExtra 439,\u201d referred to the engine number. This was commonly understood. When the train of the intestate approached the siding, those in charge of the train saw a locomotive engine detached at rest on the siding. They assumed and took it for granted that it was the locomotive engine of the train known as \u201cExtra 439\u201d which they were to meet there. They continued on their way, passed the siding, and just beyond it their train collided with train extra -439, and the intestate was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">At the close of the case the court, in response to motions by the defendant, directed a verdict for the defendant and ordered the exceptions to be heard in this court in the first instance. This disposition was made upon the ground that the proximate cause of the injury was the violation of a direct and specific order. In the language of Mr. Justice Burr, who presided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201cThere was a direct and specific order given to the employes of this train to stop at that siding until another particular train, specified and described, had passed there. That order was disobeyed, and that was the disobedience of a fellow servant, for which the defendant is not responsible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We are of opinion that the learned court made a correct disposition of the case. Eor aught that appears the. collision would have been avoided if the engineer and conductor had obeyed the orders, which were clear, definite, and precise. Obedience to the orders\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201cmust be intrusted to the employes having charge of the trains. Such obedience is matter of executive detail, which, in the nature of things, no corporation, or any general agent of a corporation, can personally oversee, and as to which employes must be relied upon.\u201d Rose v. Boston &amp; Albany R. R. Co., 58 N. Y. 217, 221; Slater v. Jewett, 85 N. Y. 61, 67, 39 Am. Rep. 627.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The rulings are sustained, and the motion for a new trial is denied, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
