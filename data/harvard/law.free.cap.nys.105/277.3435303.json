The facts set forth in the answer of the defendant clearly show that Henry S. Kearney is a proper and necessary party defendant. It is there alleged that he was a copartner of the defendant\u2019s husband, and that the property involved in the litigation belonged to the copartnership, and that it had been dealt with in accordance with the partnership agreement; Mr. Kearney having realized a considerable profit from the transaction. On the face of the transaction John E. McDonald was the actual owner of the property, and the plaintiffs, his heirs at law, have a right to bring in Mr. Kearney and to have it determined whether he has a right to profits, aggregating over $20,000, which resulted from a sale of this property. This controversy cannot be determined with any practical results to the plaintiffs without the presence of Mr. Kearney, and under such circumstances it- is made the duty of the court to direct him to be brought in. Section 452, Code Civ. Proc.; Holly v. Gibbons, 176 N. Y. 520, 530, 68 N. E. 889, 98 Am. St. Rep. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
