This was done because of the extreme age of the plaintiff, and the likelihood that he might not live until the cause should be reached iq its regular order for trial. The appeal from the order of the calendar judge is based on an erroneous notion of the authority of trial judges. We do not in this judicial department interfere with trial judges in respect of their calendar rules and practice. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>section of the Code relative to preferences must be availed of bjT a party wanting a preference as of right; but that is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
