They contend that the action is for partition only, and cannot be maintained, for the reason that it is not alleged that the plaintiffs hold and are in possession as joint tenants or tenants in common of the property sought to be partitioned, as required by section 1532 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that the proof shows that the defendant widow is, and has been since said conveyances were made, in the sole possession thereof, and that the trial court erred in not dismissing the complaint upon their motion based on that ground; citing Doane v. Mercantile Trust Company, 160 N. Y. 494, 55 N. E. 296. The complaint alleges a good cause of action for the setting aside of the deeds, as well as for partition; and the question whether the grantee named in the deeds was the daughter, and, if so, whether there had been a delivery and acceptance, were proper subjects of inquiry. Booth v. Fordhan, 73 App. Div. 109, 76 N. Y. Supp. 664; Drake v. Drake, 61 App. Div. 1, 70 N. Y. Supp. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">It is well-settled law that all controversies as to the title of property sought to be partitioned may be litigated and decided favorably to a plaintiff, although in the same action he obtains partition. Place v. Kennedy, 89 App. Div. 167, 85 N. Y. Supp. 766. The Court of Appeals in Weston v. Stoddard, 137 N. Y. 119, 33 N. E. 62, 20 L. R. A. 624, 33 Am. St. Rep. 697, Satterlee v. Kobbe, 173 N. Y. 91, 65 N. E. 952, and Wallace v. McEchron, 176 N. Y. 424, 68 N. E. 663, has established the rule that possession is not necessary to the maintaining of an action of partition by one having an interest by ownership in fee. in the property. In the Doane Case, supra, no facts were alleged showing that the plaintiffs had any interest in the property; while in the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>bar it is alleged that the deceased was seised in fee of the premises when h\u00e9 executed the deeds, that they were invalid and void, and for that reason, the grantor dying intestate, the property descended to his heirs at law, whose names and the interest of each are specifically stated, and it appeared upon the trial that three of such heirs and the widow were in the actual occupancy of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The facts presented are extraordinary, and the contentions of the respective parties find support to an almost equal degree. Christian Leidenthal, the deceased grantor, was an active, forehanded German, who during his lifetime had acquired property of considerable value. He was twice married; his first wife being the mother of his six children, who are parties to the action. No children were born of his second marriage. On June 11th, 1890, he married the wom\u00e1n who is now his widow; he being then 48 and she 41 years of age. Their married life was a happy one. He was then engaged in conducting a meat market business, and derived an income from the rentals of some of his real property. Shortly prior to the execution of the deeds one of his tenants threatened to sue him for damages. The evidence clearly establishes that the main cause leading to their execution was \u2018his apprehension that a judgment would be recovered and enforced from his property. By five deeds and a bill of sale, dated May 1, 1902, acknowledged May 15th, and recorded and filed May 16th, in which deeds his wife, by the name of \u201cMary Leidenthal,\u201d united, he conveyed all of his real property (being that which is the\" subject of this action) and transferred his business to \u201cAnna Maria Leidenthal,\u201d without describing the grantee as either wife or daughter.; and the only meritorious question of fact presented by the record is whether his widow or his daughter Anna is such grantee. The learned justice at the trial found, among other things, that the Annie Mary Leidenthal named in said deeds was the daughter of Christian Leidenthal, and his wife, the defendant Mary Leidenthal, intended that the said daughter of Christian Leidenthal should be the grantee therein, and that the deeds were without consideration, never delivered to the grantee, and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We cannot say that these findings are against the weight of the evidence, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
