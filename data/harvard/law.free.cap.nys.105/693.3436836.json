A large quantity of fine silk and cotton texture, known as \u201cmull,\u201d was treated by the plaintiffs with the Perozone and ruined. At the trial the plaintiffs claimed the fault lay in the liquid. The defendant contended it lay in the manner of its use. After the damage, the plaintiffs delivered to the defendant samples of unbleached mull, such as had been injured, and the defendant\u2019s president testified that in its laboratory the samples were bleached with n\u00a9 difficulty whatever by following the directions that had been given to the plaintiffs. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\">\u201cWe used Perozone for the bleach. It came from the same source that Davis &amp; Quick\u2019s [the plaintiff\u2019s] goods came from, our regular factory stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-12\">\u201cBy the Court: Q. Not out of the same batch that they did? A. No, sir; that is, not likely to be\u2014may have been.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then asked the witness the following questions, which were objected to (although the ground of the objection \u25a0does not appear), the objections were sustained, and the defendant, excepted, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-14\">\u201cQ. What can you say about the uniformity of various batches?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-15\">\u201cQ. Had you any reason to suspect or believe that there was any difference in the preparation of the batches?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-16\">\u201cQ. Do you know of any reason why the three barrels of Perozone sold them differed from the others in your warehouse?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">While the last two of the questions are doubtless open to criticism as to form, the three questions addressed themselves to a phase of the 1 controversy which was material to the issue. The plaintiffs claimed that because of some ingredient of the Perozone the goods were spoiled. To meet that claim the defendant showed that it bleached some of the same goods with Perozone without injurious effects, and should have been allowed, if it could, to meet the evidence adduced by the question of the court to show that the reagent used in the test by the defendant did not differ from that sold to the plaintiffs. The exclusion of the evidence was, therefore, error.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-18\">The witness Dr. Frederick E. Lichte was in the dyestuff and chemic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>al business and was a practical bleacher. While he was in the act of testifying that he had by the use of Perozone bleached mull similar to that destroyed with good results, the court interrupted the examination with this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">\u201cIt is admitted that the material has ordinarily done its work properly. I will not let you accumulate evidence on that point. I am going to coniine the plaintiffs to the proof that this particular lot was bad. You certainly can see that it is idle to multiply evidence on that branch of the case, when your adversary has conceded it, and I have told you that I will so charge the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">To this ruling the defendant excepted. This was error. We search the record in vain for any stipulation or concession by the plaintiffs that Perozone would bleach cotton and silk mull. The concession seemed to go no farther than this language of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">\u201cWe concede that it can, under some circumstances, bleach a certain class of goods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">To rebut the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Perozone was at fault, it was, of course, material for the defendant to show, if it could, that fabric of the same character had been successfully treated by the witness with Perozone; it then being probably important for the defendant to show that the Perozone used by the witness was of the same chemical composition with that sold to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">There were other errors alleged to have been committed by the learned trial court during the progress of the trial; but, inasmuch as similar situations may not arise upon the new trial, it is unnecessary to discuss them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">For the errors pointed out, the judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">HIRSCHBERG, P. J., and RICH and MILLER, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b721-12\">GAYNOR, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AP6\">The questions were indefinite and asked for conclusions. A trial judge may, and should exclude such questions, if asked on the direct examination. Only questions calling for precise facts are admissible, and then the judge and jury draw conclusions. And no one will deny that on cross-examination a trial judge has wider latitude in respect of the examination of witnesses than on direct examination; he may curtail it, and keep it within bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">As to the declaration of the trial judge that it was admitted by the plaintiff\u2019s side that Perozone worked all right and was efficient, was a good article, and that the only question he was going to try and submit to the jury was whether the particular lot sold to the plaintiff was bad, by reason of some neglect in making it, that alone constitutes a stipulation by the plaintiff, it being then there acquiesced in. But more than that, a trial judge\u2019s word imports verity, and a stipulation may rest in his word alone. It is not necessary that the record show in addition a formal stipulation of counsel. More still, when the record is examined, it is found that the case was tried on the theory stated by the trial judge; and that the charge sent it to the jury on that question only.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">This was a long and tedious trial, and no substantial error seems to exist for us to set it at naught, and have the work all done over again.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
