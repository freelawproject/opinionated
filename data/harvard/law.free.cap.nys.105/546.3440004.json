This chattel mortgage covered ail of his personal property. Thereafter, upon the 24th day of April, 1900, having failed to pay the note and chattel mortgage, the defendant executed to the plaintiff a bill of sale of this same property. After the property was taken by the plaintiff under the bill of sale, a horse and a cow were seized by the governmental officials 'as having been smuggled in from Ganada, and were sold. The plaintiff thereby lost the benefit of the value of these articles and property which were included in the chattel mortgage and in the bill of sale. This action was then brought by the plaintiff against the defendant to recover damages for fraud in having falsely represented this horse and cow as his property and free from any claim. The complaint was dismissed at the trial, and from the judgment entered upon such dismissal, as well as from the order denying the motion for a new trial, this appeal has been taken.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b573-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Argued before SMITH, P.

We are not prepared entirely to agree to this proposition. But nevertheless we think the judgment was right, as we are unable to find any damage flowing from the false statements made by the defendant in the chattel mortgage. The evidence of the plaintiff is to the effect that he relied, in taking the mortgage, upon the statement in the mortgage itself to the effect that the defendant was the true and lawful owner. All of this indebtedness, however, has accrued prior to the signing of the mortgage by the defendant, and prior, therefore, to the representation which is made the basis of the fraud in this action. To support an action for false representation, the damage must have been caused thereby. No property has been parted 'with by reason of any false representations to the defendant, and-without proDf of such fact no legal damage is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
