On September 2, 1904, he applied for a leave of absence without pay until December 2, 1904, which was granted. On October 14, 1904, charges were preferred against him by the commissioner, based upon his physical inability to perform his duties, a copy of which was duly served, and an opportunity given him to be heard on October 21st. On October 24th following, he was dismissed from the department for physical incompetency. This action was brought to recover the compensation attaching to his position from the time of the injury to November 1, 1904. Upon the trial the plaintiff testified that he never-made any application for absence on sick leave, and never authorized' any one to make such application for him. Section 537 of the Charter of Greater New York (Laws 1901, p. 242, c. 466) empowers the commissioner of street cleaning, \u201cin his discretion, to deduct and withhold pay, salary, or compensation from any member or members of the force for and on account of absence for any cause without leave.\u201d At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the learned trial justice granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground that the plaintiff had failed to establish a cause of action, and from the judgment entered thereon the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The plaintiff having been absent, according to his own evidence, without leave, during the time for which he seeks to recover, the fact that he had not been paid for the period during which he rendered no services did not establish a cause of action; the statute expressly authorizing the commissioner to deduct and withhold his compensation. Nor do. the provisions of section 536, providing that in cases where certain employ\u00e9s (of whom plaintiff was one) are temporarily absent, and their places filled by others, they shall not receive compensation for the time absent, \"unless such injury or illness was caused by service in the department,\u201d' aid plaintiff. Such an employ\u00e9 is. re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>quired, as a condition precedent to receiving compensation, to apply for absence on sick leave, and this, if granted, under the provisions of section 537, entitles him in the discretion of the commissioner to full pay, if the absence is not longer than 20 days, and to one-half pay, if longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">No cause of action was established, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
