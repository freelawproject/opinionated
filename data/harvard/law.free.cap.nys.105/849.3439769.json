He found, however, as matter of law, that such encroachments did not constitute an incumbrance or defect of title, and that the contract of sale was not sufficient to cover the violation filed by the department of health, and, while the reasonable cost and expense of complying with the requirements of such department was $475, refused to make an allowance for the same, and directed the delivery of a deed upon payment of the remainder of the full contract price, and that, if the plaintiff failed to accept such deed and make such payment on a day specified, his complaint be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">In the view we take of the case, it is unnecessary to consider the alleged violations or their effect upon the legal rights of the parties. It is undisputed that a brick building on adjoining property encroaches upon the premises agreed to be conveyed 3 inches at its front on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>street line and 1% inches at its rear, a distance from the street of 36 feet; that the survey exhibited to defendant, upon which plaintiff based in part his refusal to accept the title, disclosed this fact. We think this rendered the title unmarketable, and justified the plaintiff in rejecting the title. Klim v. Sachs, 102 App. Div. 44, 92 N. Y. Supp. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted; cost\u2019s to . abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">\u2019 JENKS and HOOKER, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b876-7\">GAYNOR, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Atzf\">I think the learned trial judge decided this case with scientific discrimination, and correctly. The complaint prays for specific performance, but that an allowance, or abatement of the contract price, be made for the small encroachment, and for an alleged health violation. But there was no evidence of the value of the strip encroached upon, or of the diminution of the value of the lot thereof. The trial judge correctly ruled that in the absence of such evidence he could not fix any amount in abatement. The other objection to the title was that an anonymous complaint had been made to the health board that a nasty smell came from a privy vault, and that an ex parte order was made therein by the clerk of the board of health that the vault be emptied and filled, and that a water-closet be substituted. The trial judge ruled that the contract of sale did not cover the so-called health violations, and was in this right. The contract is in so many words merely that the sale shall be \u201cfree and clear of incumbrances and violations.\u201d There is no evidence to show what this obscure word \u201cviolations\u201d means; nor is there any evidence that there was a violation of any health law. The anonymous communication was not evidence, nor was the ex parte order of the health board clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Judgment,of specific performance was given, but without any abatement, and I recommend affirmance. The Special Term of the Supreme Court is filled -with suits like this, and attorneys who bring them should try them scientifically. Most of them are purely technical and vexatious.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">WOODWARD, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
