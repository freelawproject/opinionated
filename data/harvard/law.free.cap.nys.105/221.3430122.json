The testimony on behalf of the plaintiff, elicited from a boy eight years old at the time of the accident, was that the witness and the deceased, who was about nine years of age, were playing with other boys in the roadway of a public street, and that while the deceased was stooping over, with his back to the .approaching vehicle, drawn by one horse and loaded with coal, the driver of which was not looking, because he was asleep or in a drunken stupor, he was knocked down and the horse stepped on his head, crushing his skull, from the effects of which he almost immediately died.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-19\">Conceding that the deceased had a right \"to play in the roadway of the street, and that under the circumstances' he was excused from looking for a vehicle approaching from behind, and that the defendants\u2019 driver was careless in managing his horse, we think the motion for a new trial should have been granted on the ground that the overwhelming weight of evidence shows that the accident happened in an entirely different manner from that claimed by the plaintiff. The testimony of the defendants\u2019 driver, sustained by corroborating circumstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ces, was that while driving along the street, having a load of a ton of \u25a0coal, his horse presumably on- a walk, the deceased, playing with other boys, suddenly ran swiftly from the sidewalk into the horse, striking the thill of the wagon, which threw him backward, his head striking \u25a0on the pavement with great force, and that stopping almost immediately, and before the front wheels of the wagon had touched the boy, the driver got down from his wagon, picked up the boy, carried, him into the vestibule of a school building at its janitor\u2019s suggestion, and that an ambulance was immediately summoned, and on its arrival the plaintiff was dead. The janitor testified that the boy lay on the pavement 'between the horse\u2019s hind legs and front wheel. The direction of the head he was unable to state. The physician who made the post mortem examination stated that the back of the head of the boy was crushed 'in, the broken fragments lacerating the brain, showing an injury such as might be inflicted by some blunt instrument or great force, and that \u25a0 there were no marks of violence on the face or other portions of his body. The undertaker testified to the one injury only, except that there was an abrasion of the cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The \"testimony of these three witnesses called in behalf of the plaintiff shows the extreme improbability of the boy\u2019s skull having been fractured by the liorse stepping on the back of his head. If the injury had been inflicted in that manner, there would have been some signs of it on the face. Pressure sufficient to crush the skull in the manner de.scribed would have pressed the face of the boy against the pavement in such a manner as to show much greater indication of the fact than it did. Manifestly the abrasion of which the undertaker speaks was slight, else the coroner\u2019s physician would have discovered it; nor is it probable that a horse on an ordinary walk, in lifting his foot to step, would have inflicted so severe an injury as that from which the boy died. On the other hand, a violent fall, striking the back of the head squarely upon the pavement, might produce the precise injury which \u2022caused the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Without determining whether upon the facts claimed by plaintiff the defendants\u2019 servant was shown negligent and his intestate free from contributory negligence, we are of the opinion that the weight of evidence was that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate brought the injury -upon himself, without any fault on the part of the defendants\u2019 servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs- to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">CLARKE and LAMBERT, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"pAqd\">INGRAHAM, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWj\">I dissent. I think the question of the defendants\u2019 negligence and the deceased\u2019s contributory negligence was for the jury, and that there was evidence to sustain the verdict. The nature of the injury was not such as could have been caused by the deceased falling on the asphalt pavement. It appeared that the skull was crushed in which is entirely consistent with the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff that the injury was caused by the horse\u2019s hoofs striking the boy on the skull. It is quite inconsistent, it seems to me, with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>mere fall of the deceased on the asphalt pavement. A blow from the horse\u2019s feet had the f. :ce necessary to crush the skull, and corroborates the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">PATTERSON, P. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
