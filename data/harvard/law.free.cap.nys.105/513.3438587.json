The plaintiff was engaged in wheeling coal from a coal pile in defendant\u2019s yard -to the boiler house, and was under the general superintendence and direction of one Hassett. The coal was being taken from a pile some eight or ten feet high. It had frozen, so that a crust had been formed on top, and as the coal was taken from the bottom of the pile there was left an overhanging crust eight to twelve inches thick, and as the removal of tiie coal below continued the crust was so undermined and became so weakened that it finally fell upon plaintiff and crushed his leg. The action was tried as one under the employer\u2019s liability act, and the questions of defendant\u2019s negligence, plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, and of assumed risk, were submitted to the jury as questions of fact. A verdict for plaintiff of $800 was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-19\">The notice under the employer\u2019s liability act was sufficient, in view of the provision of the statute that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-20\">\u201cNo notice under the provisions of this section shall be deemed invalid or insufficient solely by inaccuracy in stating the time, place or cause of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>jury, if it be shown that there was no intention to mislead, and the party entitled to notice was not in fact misled thereby.\u201d Section 2, c. 600, p. 1749, Laws 1902.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">There was evidence sufficient to authorize the jury to find the plaintiff free from contributory negligence, and that there was no assumption of risk by him. These questions are made expressly by the statute questions for the jury to determine. There was evidence sufficient to warrant the finding by the jury of negligence on the part of the defendant, under the employer\u2019s liability act. Hassett was a superintendent. He was notified, several days before the accident, that the overhanging crust was dangerous and that it ought to be removed. He promised to look after it, but failed to do so. Under the common law this may have been a detail of the work for which the employer, having furnished a competent superintendent to supervise the work, would not have been liable under such cases as Russell v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 188 N. Y. 344, 81 N. E. 122; but under the employer\u2019s liability act the duty to remove the crust was upon the superintendent, if not the defendant, and the defendant would be liable for the superintendent\u2019s neglect of duty, if it was his alone, and not the negligence of the defendant primarily. Section 1, c. 600, p. 1748, Laws 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur, except McLENNAN, P. J., and ROBSON, J., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
