During the progress of the trial two exhibits, respectively 11 and 12,' relating to the suit on trial, were offered in evidence, and appear to be in the Spanish language. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of these exhibits upon the ground that they were in a foreign language and not translated. The objection was overruled, and the exhibits admitted, to which exception was taken. In Squadrilli v. Ciervo (Sup.) 101 N. Y. Supp. 661, this court held that causes should be tried altogether in the English language, reversing a judgment rendered where some of the exhibits were in the French language. Because of- this error, it is needless to consider any other -question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Judgment reversed, and record returned to the file for amendment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
