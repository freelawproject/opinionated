Certain of the objectors and the accounting party appeared at the hearing, and at the outset the accounting party called a witness. After several preliminary questions, tlie counsel for the contestants said: \u201cI want to interpose an objection to the attempted proof -of this claim, on the ground that there is no authority or jurisdiction in the surrogate to hear such a claim. The Surrogate: What do you mean? I don\u2019t understand your point. Counsel: This administratrix has come in and filed an account- setting forth the personl property left by the decedent. She now comes in on the same accounting with a claim that this property was a gift to her. The Surrogate: The Code says that a claim of an administrator or executor against an estate must be proved before it will be allowed. I don\u2019t see your point. Counsel: My point is this: That the administratrix in a sense is estopped as to that. She takes an inconsistent position. The Surrogate: She takes the position which the Code says she must take. You can take your choice \u2014whether you are willing that -she should assume the affirmative and prove her claim, or you can insist on your objection of want of jurisdiction and admit that she is in possession of property under claim of gift. Counsel: I object on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction. The Surrogate: Objection sustained on the ground that, as the property is in her possession as her own individual property, there is no necessity for her accounting therefor.\u201d The objections were dismissed by the decree.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b877-8\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

Sexton v. Sexton, 64 App. Div. 385, 72 N. Y. Supp. 213, affirmed 174 N. Y. 516, 66 N. E. 1116. The objection of the contestants first made was upon the lack of power in the surrogate to hear the claim, and was then restated as against the inconsistent position 'of the accounting party with respect to the property. But the learned surrogate had no right to push the counsel to the alternative that, if he insisted on his objection to the \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d he must \u201cadmit that the accounting party was in possession of property under a claim of gift.\u201d The counsel had admitted nothing, and he had a right to make his objections, whether good or bad, and to ask for rulings upon them. There was no allegation with the objection, or to be implied therefrom, to the ef\u00edect that, \u201cas such property had been delivered to the administratrix during the lifetime of the deceased, it did not constitute a part of the estate of the deceased, and therefore was not the subject of investigation on such hearing.\u201d The point of the objections, as I interpret them, was, first, as to the juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>\u25a0diction generally; and, second, to inconsistent position of the accounting party\u2014her \u201cestoppel,\u201d as the counsel put it.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">But, even if the counsel was bound to accept (as he was not) the alternative of the learned court, \u201cor you can insist on your objection of want of jurisdiction and admit that she is in possession of property under claim of gift,\u201d it was not an admission that she personally owned the property; for such possession 'does not imply that it was in her possession as .\u201cher own individual property.\u201d The course of the counsel cannot be construed as a waiver of the contestants\u2019 claim, or as - a \u25a0concession of that of the respondent. An objection to the jurisdiction, if not well taken, certainly cannot oust the court of jurisdiction; and .the court cannot in effect determine that such an objection leaves nothing for the court to determine in the controversy before it. I think that the court should have proceeded with the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">\u201d Decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court reversed, with costs, and proceedings remitted to the surrogate for a hearing on the merits. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
