Sarasohn, \u25a0deceased, brings this action against his mother, his brother, the children of a deceased sister, and the administrators of his father\u2019s estate to compel the specific performance of a contract alleged to have been made between himself and his father. The contract sued on was alleged to have been made on or about the 9th day of February, 1904, was written in the Hebrew language by one Widrowitz, a Hebrew rabbi, was subscribed by Kasryel H. Sarasohn and the plaintiff, and was thereafter and remained in the possession of said Widrowitz until after the decease of said Kasryel H. Sarasohn, was subsequently placed in the possession of one Arnold Kohn under a stipulation, who produced it under subpoena at the trial of certain probate proceedings in the Surrogate\u2019s Court and, having been left in the possession of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, was produced from the files of that court on the trial of this action. A translation of said paper writing is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-18\">\u201cMemorial words concluded between Rabbi K. H. Sarasohn and his son Chaim (Hyman):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-19\">\u201c(1) Rev. K. H. Sarasohn obligates himself to give his son above mentioned after his weddingj which will take place shortly with his bride-elect, the sum of one hundred dollars each and every month, besides suitable apartments and offices in his house No. 187 East Broadway, without charge. This obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>tion shall continue as long as the above named Hyman has not a share in the business of publishing newspapers of the said Rev. K. H. Sarasohn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201c(2) In the coming spring the said Rev. K. H. Sarasohn will go to Europe.' The entire period which he shall remain in Europe his said son shall stand in the place of his father to give (or express) his opinion in the said business of publishing newspapers above mentioned, but in all matters relating to politics and Socialism he shall not have any say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u201c(3) The Rev. K. H. Sarasohn obligates himself to make a will, as is required, that after the passing away of the days and years there shall be to the said son Hyman, above mentioned, 25 per cent, of the said business of printing newspapers. This share is only to Hyman personally or to his descendants ; but if, God forbid, it shall happen that said Hyman shall have no children surviving him, his wife shall not inherit, only the other heirs of the said Rabbi K. H. Sarasohn. And the house 185 East' Broadway there shall be to him one-fourth part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\u201c(4) If after the passing away of the days of the Rev. IC. H. Sarasohn there will not be left of him with what to satisfy the three grandchildren of my daughter Rebecca, of blessed memory, then it is the' obligation of the said Hyman to satisfy each with the sum of $2,000 or to give them 5 per cent, of the said business of publishing newspapers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">\u201c(5) All the mortgage that the said Hyman holds on the mother shall be at once void (or shall be canceled). All this is concluded in the presence of the undersigned. We the undersigned have accepted all the foregoing with our good will, with a perfect understanding, and with a full and settled mind. We have come to this signature the 23d of the month of Sehebat, 5664, here in New York.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">It appears that Rev. Kasryel H. Sarasohn was a devout Hebrew rabbi, and in 1874 founded in the city of New York a business of printing and publishing newspapers in the Yiddish language; that the elder son, Ezekiel, came to this country in 1876, and has always been connected with said newspaper business, and that for a number of years he and his brother-in-law, Kamaiky, who married the only daughter of Kasryel Sarasohn, were partners with the. elder Sarasohn in the conduct of that business, each having a one-third interest thereof. The plaintiff came to this country about a year after his elder brother, and although as a boy he did some work in the business, yet he was educated as and is a lawyer and had no interest in the newspaper business. From small beginnings that business had so grown that after the death of Kasryel his one-third interest was sold by his personal representatives to the surviving partners for the Sum of $94,-000. It appears that a paper writing, purporting to be the last will and testament of Kasryel H. Sarasohn, was offered for probate in the Surrogate\u2019s Court of the county of New York, and that, objection being made, probate was refused on the ground that the said paper was not subscribed by the decedent in the presence of one of the two purported witnesses thereto, was not acknowledged by him to said witness, and the said decedent did not, at the time of making such subscription, or any other time, declare to the said witness that the instrument so subscribed was his last will and testament. That paper writing was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">\u201cAs a human being does not know his end, and it is incumbent upon him while he is still alive to provide that his end shall be well, I express my wish in writing how after my death all my property which I have accumulated with divine mercy shall be divided, and I request and command my sons to comply with all that is set forth in this will, (a) At first there shall be paid all debts which are due or shall become due from me until the last penny, (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>All that I am possessed of, either in property, cash, and my share in the business of newspapers, shall be ten per cent, thereof given to charity; two-thirds here, to wit, to the Talmud Terah, and to the Hachnothah Orchim, and to the Montifiore Home; and one-third balance shall be sent to the Holy Land to the Home for Aged and the Hospital. From the remainder of my share shall be to my son Hyman Abraham 20 per cent., and the balance 13% per cent, \u2022shall be equally divided between my son Ezekiel and one-half to the orphans of my daughter Rebecca, of all that remains to the partnership of which to me belongs 33% per cent, (c) To my wife shall be given $50 each week for the balance of her life, and security shall be given to her for the same. (d&gt; To the orphan girl \"which I have brought up shall be given $500. (e) To my brother 500 rubles shall be given annually, (f) To David Bloch there shall be paid the sum of $300 for an old debt, (g) To Kram shall be paid $333 due on my share, (h) On the note which my son Ezekiel holds against me only $2,000 is due. (i) If it shall be impossible for ICamaiky and my son Ezekiel to continue in, partnership with my son Hyman Abraham, for convincing reasons, they have the privilege to pay him his share and shall be determined by three persons consented to by all parties. I do request my sons and son-in-law to publish my father\u2019s work \u2018Ugas Elion,\u2019 and I ask them to help my relatives as much as in their power. All of the above I direct of my free will and with clear understanding. In the presence of Rabbi O. H. Widrowitz and Mr. Enoch Wollberg. And I have signed my name this 4th day, the month of Tevath, 5665.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">\u201cKasryal Hirsch Sarasohn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201cSealed, signed and delivered. In our presence it was signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201cChain Jacob Widrowitz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">\u201cEnoch Wollberg.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The learned Special Term, after a trial, entered a judgment dismissing the complaint upon the merits. It seems to me that that judgment should be sustained upon two grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">First. That the plaintiff did not sustain the burden of establishing the due execution and delivery of the alleged contract sued upon, so as to make it a valid and enforceable instrument. The father having died without leaving a valid will, the plaintiff seeks to prevent the due distribution of his estate in accordance with the laws of the state governing intestacy, and seeks to substitute for a last will and testament made, published, and declared in accordance with the form and requirements of the law a contract to make a will. As said by the Court of Appeals i\u00f1 Rosseau v. Rouss, 180 N. Y. 116, 72 N. E. 916:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">\u201cWe have repeatedly held that such a contract must not only be certain ami definite, and founded upon an adequate consideration, but also that it must be established by the clearest and most convincing evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">There is no evidence showing or -tending to show a delivery of this instrument. There is no evidence showing or tending to show that the plaintiff ever had it in his possession for one instant, and there is no evidence showing or tending to show its delivery to any one for him, or for any purpose indicating that ICasryel H. Sarasohn intended it to be an effectual disposition of his property. The evidence is conclusive that from the time it was written until after the death of the elder Sarasohn it remained in the possession of Rabbi Widrowitz, who wrote it. How it happened to be in his possession, why' he kept it, why no other members of the family, who apparently were as close and dear to the father as the plaintiff, knew of it, is not explained. And yet the one man in all the world who could have explained how it happened to be drawn, what occurred when it was signed, why it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>not delivered to the plaintiff, and how it happened that it was put and kept in his possession, was not put upon the stand by the plaintiff to clear up this most important lapse in the testimony as to the validity of this instrument, although, as it appears by the record, he sat in court during the trial of this case. It might have been put in escrow to become effective upon some future contingency. It might have been a tentative draft. It might have been drawn to relieve the father of the importunities of the son, or in order that a copy might be made from it for the purpose of influencing those interested in the marriage of the plaintiff and his then affianced bride, without any intention of accomplishing anything except moral suasion. These are a few of the inferences that may be drawn from the fact of the presence in court of the one important witness and that the plaintiff did not or dared not put him upon the stand. A lawyer himself, appearing as attorney for himself, aided by most able and careful trial counsel, it is inconceivable that, if the testimony of Widrowitz would have aided this plaintiff in his efforts to obtain this much larger share of his dead father\u2019s estate than he would be entitled to if there were no such valid instrument, he would not have been put -upon ffhe stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">It is a familiar proposition of law that, when it is shown that a party to a litigation has evidence within his control and does not produce it, an unfavorable inference may be drawn. Bleecker v. Johnston, 69 N. Y. 313; Sugarman v. Brengel, 68 App. Div. 377, 74 N. Y. Supp. 167; Kirkpatrick v. Allemannia Fire Ins. Co., 102 App. Div. 329, 92 N. Y. Supp. 466. The importance\u2014I might say the necessity\u2014of the evidence thus withheld is illustrated by the different positions taken by the plaintiff. In his original complaint, verified by him on March 9, 1905, it is alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201cThat on or about the 9th day of February this plaintiff * * * and his said father * * * duly made, executed, and delivered to this plaintiff his certain agreement in writing. * * * <em>\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In his amended complaint, verified by the plaintiff on the 14th of November, 1905, it is alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201cThat in order to commit to writing a parol agreement to the same effect made in or about the month of October, 1903, on or about the 9th day of February, 1904, the plaintiff * * * and the said Kasryel H. Sarasohn * * * entered into an agreement in writing bearing date that day. * '* * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">In support of the claim thus made of a prior oral agreement of which this paper was a memorandum, testimony of witnesses as to prior statements of the father was admitted in evidence which otherwise would have been inadmissible. But there is no evidence sufficient to establish the making of any such oral agreement of which this paper is a mere memorandum. This paper was the contract between the parties, if any there was. Yet even in the amended complaint, and in the third paragraph thereof, it is alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">\u201cThat at the time of the execution and delivery of the said - contract so made. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">The pleader evidently had in mind this necessary element of delivery in the establishment of the validity of such an alleged contract. There was produced upon the trial by counsel for the plaintiff, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>explanation of how it came in his possession, a copy of this paper writing, containing the words \u201ccopied from the body of the writing which lies in my hand, letter for letter\u201d; and said additional words bore at the foot thereof the original signature of said Kasryel H. Sarasohn and the signature of Rabbi Widrowitz. This is not sufficient proof of the delivery of the paper writing of which it purports to be a copy, because we again have the fatal omission of explanation by Widrowitz of how the copy happened to be made and what became of it. It does not purport to be a duplicate. It is not the second part of an indenture. It does not bear the signatures of the original parties, for the signature of the elder Sarasohn is attached to the certificate of accuracy of the copy, and not in execution of the paper itself. Delivery would certainly be necessary to make such a paper as the one sued on effectual as a contract. If, without delivery, Sarasohn had made a dozen of such papers, which were kept in his desk under his own control, and there discovered after his death, no effect could be given to any of them. It seems to me, therefore, that the plaintiff has failed in an essential part of his case, and that for that reason alone the judgment was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Second. It is an elementary principle in the exercise of equity jurisdiction that a contract will not be specifically enforced, unless it is certain in its terms. Stanton v. Miller, 58 N. Y. 192; Shakespeare v. Markham, 72 N. Y. 406; Winne v. Winne, 169 N. Y. 272, 59 N. E. 832, 82 Am. St. Rep. 647; Rosseau v. Rouss, supra. It seems to me that this paper, even if, arguendo, it be conceded to have been executed and^ delivered, was too indefinite and uncertain to permit a court of equity to decree its specific performance. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">\u201cThere shall be to the said son, Hyman, above mentioned, twenty-five per cent, of the said business of printing newspapers. * * * (4) If after the passing away of the days of the Rev. K. H. Sarasohn there will not be left of him with what to satisfy the three grandchildren of my daughter Rebecca, of blessed memory, then it is the obligation of the said Hyman to satisfy each with the sum of $2,000 or to give them 5 per cent of the said business of publishing newspapers.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201cfrom the remainder of my share shall he to my son Hyman Abraham 20 per cent., and the balance 13% per cent, shall be equally divided between my son Ezekiel and one-half to the orphans of my daughter Rebecca of all that remains to the partnership, of which belongs to me 33% per cent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The plaintiff claims, irrespective of certain shares of stock in the \u2022 Jewish Press Publishing Company, that, as the value of the business of printing said newspapers has been established by the sale of the one-third thereof for $94,000 to be $232,000, he is entitled to one-fourth thereof\u2014that is, 70,500\u2014which, taken from the $94,000,\" his father\u2019s \u25a0 share, leaves $23,500 to be distributed between his mother, his brother, and his deceased sister\u2019s three children. If, however, the 25 per cent, of the business of printing newspapers means 25 per cent, of the share of the elder Sarasohn in the business of printing newspapers, plaintiff would be entitled only to one-fourth of $94,000, or $23,500, instead of $70,500; and if we, look at the attempted will, which the plaintiff offers as proof tending to establish the validity of his contract, as aii effort upon his father\u2019s part to perform, for an indication of the father\u2019s interpretation of the intent of the- contract,\" we find that, after providing for the payment of his debts to the last penny, of all that he possesses in property, cash, and his share in the business of newspapers, he gives 10 per cent, to charity, and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Ignoring, for the moment, the bequest of 10 per cent, to charity, we find that from the remainder of the father\u2019s share \u201cof all that remains to the partnership, of which belongs to me 33% per cent.,\u201d was given 20 per cent, to Hyman. Twenty per cent, of $91,000, his share, less 10 per cent, for charity, making $81,000, is $16,800. But if the 33% per cent, is to be treated as the principal sum, and the 20 per cent, thereof does not mean 20 per cent, of 100 per cent., but the proportionate share that 20 is to 13% out of a total of 33%, we then get 60 per cent, of $81,000 or $50,400; so that, upon these constructions we get as. his possible share these amounts: $70,500, or $23,500, or $16,800, or $50,400. Under section 4 of the alleged contract the obligation is to give the three children of Rebecca $2,000 each\u2014that is, $6,000\u2014or 5 per cent, of the business of publishing newspapers. This 5 per cent, would be $14,100, if it is to be construed as the plaintiff asks us to construe the third clause\u2014that is, 5 per cent, of the whole business; or it would be $4,700, if it is to be construed as 5 per cent, 'of Kasryel\u2019s one-third of the business; or, if calculated, as provided by the will, as one-half of 13%, it would be $11,800, treating the 33% as a whole, or it would be $6,720, if we treat it as the literal reading would require\u2014one-half of 13% per cent, of this one-third of the partnership. -</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">If we consider the shares of stock in the Jewish Press Publishing Company, which are conceded to come within the phrase of the alleged contract \u201cbusiness of printing newspapers,\u201d these difficulties are presented: The total number of shares issued by the corporation was 390. According to the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation, he would be entitled to 25 per cent, thereof, or 97% shares. But ICasryel Sarasohn owned but 67 shares. The plaintiff suggests no satisfactory solution of this dilemma. If the 25 per cent, is to be calculated on the 87 shares, he would be entitled to 21% shares. But this interpretation of the paper he strenuously opposes. These varying results, and there are other possible combinations of figures suggested by the various counsel, demonstrate, I think, that it is impossible for a court, asked to compel the specific performance of \u25a0 a contract, to determine with that precision which is required in such an action what the contract really means. Without considering the. many other questions presented by this record, we hold that the plaintiff has failed to prove the-paper writing sued on to be a valid executed and delivered contract so certain and definite in its terms as to permit a decree of specific performance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">It follows that the judgment and order appealed-from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">SCOTT and LAMBERT, JJ., concur.
