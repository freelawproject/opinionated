Its original complaint, which sought to amend the mortgage given by the defendant, was demurred to and the demurrer sustained, with leave to amend upon payment of costs of the trial and appellate courts. 90 App. Div. 207, 86 N. Y. Supp. 60. In pursuance of the leave granted on the sustaining of this demurrer to serve an amended complaint, the plaintiff served what it called an \u201camended and supplemental\u201d complaint, and, on motion, certain portions of this complaint w.ere stricken out. Thereafter plaintiff moved to be permitted to serve the supplemental complaint which appears in the record, and from a denial of that motion this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">It is claimed that the order striking out certain portions of the \u201camended and supplemental\u201d complaint, which were substantially like the allegations contained in the present supplemental complaint, and which order was not appealed from, is res adjudicata of plaintiff\u2019s right to now serve any additional pleadings containing the same allegations. We do not concur in this view, for the allegations which were stricken out had no place in the amended complaint which was permitted to be served after the sustaining of the demurrer, but were appropriate only to a supplemental pleading. While the supplemental complaint contains allegations and asks relief somewhat different from that demanded in the original complaint, we are of the opinion that, upon proper terms leave to serve should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">The order appealed from is reversed, without costs, and the motion for leave to serve a supplemental complaint granted, upon payment by plaintiff of $10 costs of the motion and of all costs of the action not heretofore paid. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
