Hamilton W. Cary and Others (herewith decided) 105 N. Y. Supp. 125, and are controlled by the same considerations. The only difference consists in the fact that by the trust deed in the present case Mr. Bostwick undertakes to extend the trust, and consequently suspend the absolute ownership of the personal property constituting the trust fund during the lives of his daughter, Nellie Bostwick Morrell, and of her husband, Erancis L. Morrell, if he should survive her. Having thus suspended the absolute ownership of the property for the longest period permitted by the statute, it was incompetent to create a further suspension during the lifetime of Mrs. Bostwick. Therefore, as to the property constituting this trust fund, it must be held that Jabez A. Bostwick died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">The judgment will be modified accordingly, and, as modified, affirmed, with costs in this court to all parties separately appearing, payable out of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">McLAUGHLIN and LAUGHLIN, JJ., concur.
