The complaint was in writing, and alleged, in substance, that the plaintiff left a pair of bob-sleds at the residence of his son, which was on a farm owned by the defendant; that the defendant took possession of said bob-sleds, claiming that they belonged to the plaintiff\u2019s son, and has since refused to surrender them to the plaintiff, although he has demanded the same. The relief demanded was that the defendant-surrender the bob-sleds, together with th.e damages for withholding the same, or their value in money. On the trial in- the Justice Court the plaintiff had a judgment for $11 damages, besides costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">The defendant claimed that he purchased the bobs at an execution sale under a judgment against the plaintiff\u2019s son; that the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>present- at the sale, njade no objection to its taking place, and made no \u25a0claim to the property. It is not necessary to determine whether this \u25a0conduct on his part amounted to a waiver of his claim of title to the property, as the judgment for the plaintiff could not stand, for the sufficient reason that it had no proof to sustain it. There was no allegation and no proof whatever of the value of the sleds, nor of any damage suffered by the plaintiff because of the detention thereof. There was absolutely no foundation in the evidence upon which a money judgment could have been awarded, and there was no alternative left for the County Court except to reverse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
