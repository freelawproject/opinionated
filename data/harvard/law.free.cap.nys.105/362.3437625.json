It is manifest that, had plaintiff\u2019s reply been before the court on the original motion, a bill \"of particulars would properly have been ordered in large part as asked for. The plaintiff was entitled to know the names of the stocks or other securities claimed to have been purchased by defendant for the plaintiff, ,and the amounts and times of purchase or sale, and from or through whom bought, or to and through whom sold, and the time and manner of plaintiff\u2019s direction to defendants respecting such stocks, the times of defendants\u2019 reports to plaintiff, and the manner and times of plaintiff\u2019s confirmation or.approval of the same. All these were matters of record in defendants\u2019 office, or,_ if not, were more peculiarly within defendants\u2019 knowledge than in that of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Under the circumstances leave to renew the motion should have been granted, and the order denying the same must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
