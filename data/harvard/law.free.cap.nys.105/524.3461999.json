The negligence alleged consisted in leaving the approach to a bridge unguarded. The plaintiff started to drive across the bridge. Her horse, after going part way across, became frightened, stopped, refused to proceed further, and backed the wagon off the bridge and over the embankment constituting the approach to the bridge. There was clearly evidence sufficient to authorize the finding by the jury that the highway commissioner was guilty of negligence which caused the accident and injuries to the plaintiff, and the further finding that the plaintiff was free from contributory negligence. We cannot say that the verdict was contrary to the evidence, nor that it was for too large an amount of damages. It is claimed, however, that errors were committed, in the reception of evidence and in the charge, requiring the verdict to be set aside and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The real ground of negligence on the part of the commissioner to be considered and passed upon by the jury was the failure to have a guard or barrier along the side of the approach to the bridge, to prevent teams going off the embankment. It appeared that when the bridge was repaired or rebuilt, six years before the accident, a timber was placed there, and remained until about six months before the accident, when it was removed by the commissioner and used in another part of the town. There was disagreement as to the reason for placing this timber upon the approach to the bridge originally, and what use was made of it while it remained there\u2014whether it was designed and used as a guard or barrier or as a sidewalk. Considerable evidence was given upon this subject on both sides, and among other things a witness was permitted to state what the former commissioner, who placed the timber there, said about it at that time, viz., \u201cthat he wanted a stick of timber brought and put there to keep people from running off the bank.\u201d While the trial justice did state in his charge the ground of negligence as leaving the approach to the bridge unguarded at the time the accident occurred, still he at times wandered away from this ground, and talked about the negligence in removing the timber six months before the accident, and, getting further away from the real ground of negligence, he charged the jury that if the purpose of putting the timber upon the approach to the bridge six years before the accident, and the use made of it while it lay there, was as a sidewalk, and not a barrier to prevent people from driving off the embankment, then plaintiff could not recover, it would end the lawsuit, and their verdict should be for the defendant. No exception was taken to these matters contained in the charge by either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">It is hardly necessary to discuss the errors thus committed. The only proximate cause of the accident, if any, was the dangerous condition of the approach at the time the accident occurred, by reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>its being allowed to be unguarded, and whether it was at that time so dangerous as to charge the town with .liability by reason of the negligence of the commissioner was the question of fact for the jury. Even if the removal of the timber six months before the accident was a negligent act, still that was not the proximate, cause of the accident. It was not the fact of such removal, but that there was no guard there when the accident occurred, that was the proximate cause. It was not necessary the timber should remain there. Any other guard might have been placed there before the accident, as the photographs show one was so placed after the accident occurred. The attention of the jury should have been kept to the real ground - of negligence, which could be found to be the proximate cause of the accident, and counsel should have been confined, in giving their evidence, to the same ground. But all hands appear to have agreed and assented to the manner in which the case was tried and submitted to the jury, except that the evidence of what the old commissioner said when he placed the timber upon the approach, six years before the accident, was objected to by the defendant, and an exception was taken. And defendant also excepted to the refusal by the trial justice to charge that the taking away of the timber six months before the accident was not the proximate cause of the injury, and the leaving of that question to the jury as one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">As to this request and refusal, the counsel for appellant suggests it was error only because the proximate cause was the backing of the wag\u00f3n over the slope, from a cause for which the defendant was not liable. If this was the only error, then the charge was unobjectionable. As to the evidence objected to, while it was technically erroneous, it was given as to an issue that counsel seemed to have agreed to make and litigate\u2014whether the timber was placed and used for a barrier or a sidewalk. The defendant claimed it was a sidewalk merely, put there for that, and used for that. It may be said to have been proper to show the timber was put there, and that the remark of the commissioner who put it there, at the time he did the act, may be regarded as a part of the res gestae of the placing of the timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We do not agree with the defendant that this accident was, as matter of law, one that \"could not reasonably have been apprehended or expected to occur. At most, this question was one of fact for the jury, and was left for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">This is the second trial of this \"case. It seems to be a proper case for the recovery of a verdict, and we hardly think the verdict last obtained should be set aside for merely technical errors, that very likely resulted in no injury to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">ROBSON, J., concurs. SPRING, J., concurs in result. McLENNAN, P. J., and KRUSE, J., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
