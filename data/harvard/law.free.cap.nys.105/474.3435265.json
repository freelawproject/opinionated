The summons'1 was served January 3, 1906. On January 18th, the defendant, Robert H.- McCurdy, appeared by attorney and demanded a copy of the complaint. The complaint was not served until July 30th, when it was returned with the ground of objection indorsed thereon. No further steps were taken until February 8, 1907, when the plaintiff\u2019s attorney served a notice of motion, returnable March 9th, for an order permitting service of the complaint, with the same force and effect as though service had been made within 20 days after service of the summons herein. The motion was based upon an affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, in which he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\u201cThat by reason of deponent\u2019s professional engagements and the care required in the preparation of the complaint (which is quite voluminous), he was unable to prepare and serve it within the time fixed therefor, viz., 20 days after the service of the summons herein upon this defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">He also stated that he had delayed making a motion for leave to serve the complaint until the determination of a demurrer to the complaint in an action against the Equitable Assurance Company involving substantially the same questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Section 783 of the Code of Civil Procedure permits the court, upon good cause shown, to relieve a party from the consequences of an omission to serve a pleading within the time allowed by section 479. Under this section, the burden was upon the plaintiff of making it appear to the court that there was a reasonable excuse for his neglect, and this he entirely failed to' do. The only excuse presented in the papers was the press of professional engagements during the 20 days following the service of the summons herein. There is no pretense that professional engagements prevented preparation or tender of the complaint until July 30, 1906, and no attempt was made to excuse his default after that date. It is clear that this vague and general statement of plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not furnish the basis for the exercise of judicial discretion, and was not sufficient to relieve the plaintiff from the consequences of his long-continued inaction. The plaintiff was guilty of great laches in making the motion, and for that reason, if no other, it should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur, except KELLOGG, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
