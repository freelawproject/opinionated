Upon these facts the trial justice awarded judgment for the plaintiff. From this judgment the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The plaintiff claimed to be the owner of a certain piano, which was in the possession of the defendant, the delivery of which the defendant refused to make to the plaintiff, upon demand for it being made. The piano in question was delivered to the defendant for storage by one Mary E. Williams, to whom the defendant issued its receipt. An agreement was offered in evidence, between the Apollo 'Company and Mary E. Williams, which was in effect a conditional sale of the piano by the Apollo Company to Mary E. Williams. The conditional sale agreement was assigned to the plaintiff in this action. A judgment roll in the action of Jacobs v. Williams was offered in evidence by the defendant. That action was brought to foreclose the plaintiff\u2019s lien upon said piano, and resulted in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, establishing his lien upon said piano, and for the sum of $295, \"and rendering judgment for the plaintiff for the amount thereof, and directing the sale of said piano to satisfy said lien. This action was within the prohibition of section 139 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1533, c. 580), and the court below was without jurisdiction. In the similar case of Samodwitz v. Karpf, 80 App. Div. 496, 80 N. Y. Supp. 704, the court, through Mr. Justice Jenks, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">\u201cThis action plainly arises upon the breach o\u00a3 a written contract for tlio conditional sale of personal property, and the relative relief and liability of the plaintiff and defendant in that forum must be measured and limited by tiie express provisions of the act which creates the court, establishes its powers, and limits its jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">See, also, Ginzburg v. De Silvestri, 42 Misc. Rep. 530, 86 N. Y. Supp. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The judgment is reversed, and the complaint dismissed, with costs to the appellant in this court and the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
