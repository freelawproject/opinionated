The case shows the final decree of divorce was entered on the 14th day of May, 1906, which required the defendant to pay the plaintiff $10 per week for the support and maintenance of the infant child of the marriage. On the 3d of January, 1907, a certified copy of said final judgment, with notice of entry, was personally served upon the defendant. At the same time a written demand for the payment of $330, the amount that had then accrued under the decree, was served upon the defendant. He paid nothing upon said demand. Thereupon a motion was made upon an affidavit of the plaintiff, verified on the 4th day of January, alleging that the defendant had given no security for the payment of the said alimony, and the said defendant has no property, real or personal, that could be reached in sequestration proceedings, that she \u25a0does not know of any security that the defendant could give for the payment of said alimony, and that sequestration proceedings and a receivership would be ineffectual to obtain payment of said alimony. The court denied the motion, stating that the failure to pay the alimony which accrued prior to the decree of divorce cannot be the basis of contempt proceedings; that there can be no willful disobedience of a direction of the court without knowledge of such direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">I think the learned court fell into error. The obligation to pay accrued upon the entry of the judgment. .The defendant was served with this judgment, and at the same time, with a demand for what had accrued from that time up to the date of the service of the copy of the judgment and the demand. This obligation to pay cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>enforced by execution, and, as sequestration proceedings are alleged to be useless, the only effective way is by proceedings as for contempt. If the learned court is right, then the accrued alimony from the time of the entry of the judgment to the time of the service thereof is gone. You cannot wipe out an obligation fixed by the judgment by a failure to serve a copy thereof for a length of time. That would be to put a premium on'divorce judgment debtors to keep themselves concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In Wool worth v. Woolworth, 115 App. Div. 405, 100 N. Y. Supp. &lt;805, it appeared that an order was made on the 26th day of January, 1905, requiring the defendant to pay the sum of $10 per week from the 17th day of September, 1904. On the 21st day of September, 1905, service of a copy of this,order and a demand was made on the defendant, which having been refused the court below adjudged the defendant in contempt for having refused and neglected to pay-to the plaintiff from September 17, 1904, until January 17, 1900. We held that the original order provided that $10 a week should be paid from the 17th day of September, 1904, and as the demand for payment was made on the 21st of September, 1905, we cut down the provision of the order of July 30, 1906, to the date of demand, the 25th day of September, 1905, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cWe'think that the fine afl.iuclged in this case must be limited to the amount due at the time the demand was made, as a demand is a necessary prerequisite in such contempt proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">This determination is inconsistent with the order appealed from, because a certified copy of that order was,not served \u00fantil the 21st day of September, 1905, but the requirement for payment related back to the time fixed in the order, which was the 17th of September, 1904; so here the time fixed by the judgment was the date of the entry. Alimony began to run then, and, while contempt proceedings could not be instituted until after that judgment was served, yet the moment it was served all the amount theretofore accrued became due and payable, and, a demand having been made for that and refused, contempt proceedings, which were the only ones under these papers, to collect the amount, were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the matter remitted to the Special Term for further proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
