The will directs a, certain mortgage to be paid off, and after that is done certain bequests are made, which the will directs shall abate proportionally if the income and interest from the estate is not sufficient to pay in full. Upon the death of Sara^h E. Sammis and James <em>Ackerly, </em>daughter and son of the testator, the defendants are directed to sell and dispose of his estate, or to do that if they d-\u00a1i'em it wise before their death, if eight years after the decease of testator, -which occurred July 9, 1894, aiid to pay certain legacies, which are again directed by the will to be made proportionally if the amount of the estate is mot sufficient to pay them in full. The plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the general! testamentary scheme of testator is so far unlawful that the validity of the/ power of sale given as a part of it depends upon the determination of a dtoubtful question of law, and that the title offered by defendants is therefore not marketable.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b78-6\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

Hascall v. King, 162 N. Y. 134, 56 N. E. 515, 76 Am. St. Rep. 302. The accumulations go on from the very start, for the trustees are directed, after paying debts and funeral expenses, \u201cto pay the interest and $500 a year principal, or as much more as my said trustees see fit, on the bond and mortgage on my property, till it is paid in full; to pay to my sister Martha Noyler, of Rahway,. N. J., the sum of $j|.,000 as soon as the rents and income will permit, and then to pay yearly to my son,\u201d etc. It will be seen that every other provision of th\u00e9 will is secondary to the clause creating the accumulations, which ate prohibited by statute, and therefore the principle of Hascall v. King must apply to that portion of the will. \"\\</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">But the will vests the title to the real estate in the defendant^, and, furthermore, it directs them to sell the same in their discretion* eight years after testator\u2019s death, which occurred July 9, 1894. The;contract of sale is dated August 3, 1906, and the limitation of time of sale, therefore, had expired. After such sale defendants are ordered to pay certain legacies in full or proportionately. The question of the validity of this will or its power is not raised by any heir. It is raised \u00a1by the plaintiff, who is one of the parties to said contract of sale. I am of the opinion that, after applying the principle of JJascall v. ing to this will, enough vitality and power are left in it, and, through t, power to thlp defendants, to make a valid contract of sale and to ive a marketable title to the plaintiff of the said premises, and there-ore this action ri,nnot be maintained. \\</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">JudgmentfKS\"tof,,efendants on submission of controversy/! without costs.
