The plaintiff has recovered a substantial verdict. The injuries alleged and covered by the testimony included an inguinal hernia. The plaintiff upon his direct examination testified that he \u201cnever had anything in his groin before the accident\u201d; that he \u201cnever had any\" trouble with his groin.\u201d Upon the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the plaintiff\u2019s wife she was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">\u201cQ. I will ask you if your husband didn\u2019t bring suit against Stutts, the butcher, in the year 1898, in which he claimed to be ruptured also? (Objected to. Objection sustained, and exception taken.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">If the plaintiff, prior to the accident, had asserted that he was suffering from hernia, I think it was competent to prove such declarations, on the theory that they might be regarded as inconsistent with his present testimony. The objection was general. The rule that such \u25a0evidence is not admissible, unless the attention of the witness sought to be discredited is called to the declaration, does not apply when that witness is a party. Blossom v. Barrett, 37 N. Y. 438, 97 Am. Dec. 747. If the objection was based upon the contention that the question did not call for the best evidence\u2014i. e., for \u25a0 the complaint itself\u2014it seems to me that the answer is that, if that fault had been specified, it might have been obviated. Height v. People, 50 N. Y. 393. Moreover, the question did not call for the contents of the complaint as such, but simply for a statement of the witness, which at most was made in writing. Non constat that the complaint was in a court wherein the pleadings could be oral.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">I think that the evidence was relevant for another reason. As the witness had testified on her direct examination that her husband before this accident never had a knot in his groin, or any trouble in his groin, nor had ever worn a truss, the question excluded bore upon her \u25a0credibility. If the question was admissible, it cannot be gainsaid that it was material. Indeed, the final and successful request of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was for an instruction that the defendant had produced no testimony of any injury of the plaintiff from any other source, or of any accident which would cause or tend to cause a rupture, except the accident in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">I \"advise a reversal and the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur, except HOOKER, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
