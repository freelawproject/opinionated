J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC3\">Plaintiff was a passenger on one of the defendant\u2019s overcrowded cars on the evening of May 30, 1904, and was thrown off by the conductor, and in that- manner received the injuries of which he complains. I say he was thrown off, on the assumption that that was the finding of the jury,, since the learned trial court charged the jury in effect that if the. conductor accidentally threw the plaintiff off, owing to 'the crowded condition 'of the platform, the fact would not of itself establish negligence on the part of the defendant. The finding of the jury is abundantly established by the evidence. The only place the plaintiff could find was on the edge of the rear platform, with his back to the steps, and the plaintiff and several witnesses testified that the conductor\u2019s act in pushing -the plaintiff off the car into'the street was accompanied by the expression, \u201cGet out of the way!\u201d I think the fact that the plaintiff was left lying in the street, ,the conductor refusing to stop the car, although requested to do so by the plaintiff\u2019s wife and other passengers, is some.indication that, the act was intentional, and not accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-18\">While there is some dispute as to the 'extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, the evidence fairly, establishes the following facts: The plaintiff was at the time 46 years of age, well, and healthy. He was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ordalmv 1 Adventist preacher. He was confined to his bed for six weelts, and to the house for two weeks more. Two of his ribs were broken. Both of his legs were injured, as was also his back and spine, as a rest It of which from the time of the accident to the time of the trial,. Iicady two years, he has had frequent fainting spells. One of his legs has swollen so as to require the use of an \"elastic protector. The knee joint has been permanently'injured functionally by laceration of the ligaments, and his physician testified that the injury to the spine was permanent. He is suffering from heart trouble, which he ascribes ito the accident; but of its origin there is no sufficient proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\">The verdict is for the sum of $200. It requires no discussion to demonstrate that the verdict is inadequate. If the plaintiff is entitled to recover at all, he is entitled to recover compensation. The sum of $lQo \u00a1dch remains after deducting the physician\u2019s bill is not corn-pen: Mtivv for the undisputed physical injuries inflicted, and for the pain, ;&gt; \u00ab Bering, and inconvenience necessarily involved, of the extent of which the evidence furnishes adequate proof. The order cannot be upheld even on the theory that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover at all; that is to say, on the theory that the verdict was a compromise in a case where there is reasonable doubt whether the plaintiff has fully established his cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Order .reversed, verdict set aside, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. .All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
