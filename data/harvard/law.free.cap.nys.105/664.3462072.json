The rule of the Code is positive, and the original order, being proper upon the facts before the court, should not have been vacated. Goldmark v. Electro-Galvanizing Co., 111 App. Div. 526, 528, 97 N. Y. Supp. 1078; McKeand v. Locke, 115 App. Div. 174, 100 N. Y. Supp. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the order for examination of defendant should be reinstated, and the motion to vacate denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
