The complaint contains the following allegations of negligence, among others: That the defendant did \u201coperate said automobile negligently and carelessly, by not giving the proper signals, and by not giving adequate, signals, and by running then and there at a dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>gerous rate of speed, * * * and by not then and there observing and obeying rules and regulations theretofore properly and. duly made and promulgated and then and there in force by the proper authorities having control of said highway and its use.\u201d The order appealed from requires the complaint to be made definite and certain by stating what were the proper signals, and the adequate signals, which defendant should have given and failed to give, the rate of speed at which he was running, and the rules and regulations referred to, and the proper authorities by whom they were promulgated, and when, how, and where said rules and regulations were properly and duly made and promulgated. The order also strikes out the complaint in default of compliance with its requirements.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b102-5\">Argued before SMITH, P.

Witherbee, Sherman &amp; Co., 88 App. Div. 181, 84 N. Y. Supp. 669, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Chase, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\u201cIt is better that the distinction between an order requiring a pleading to be made definite and certain and an order directing a bill of particulars should not be confused. 'When all that \u00e1 party to an action really wants is a more particular statement of his opponent\u2019s claim, for the purpose of narrowing the issues at the trial, or to prevent surprise, he should be required to make an application for a bill of particulars, and not be allowed to obtain an amended. pleading on the theory that the precise meaning or application of the allegation is not apparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the remedy by bill of particulars and the remedy to make a pleading definite and certain. Where the distinction clearly exists, however, it should be observed, even though the result of either application would be the same. Rouget v. Haight, 57 Hun, 119, 10 N. Y. Supp. 751; Jackman v. Lord, 56 Hun, 192, 9 N. Y. Supp. 200. One reason for observing the distinction is that a motion for a bill qf particulars may be opposed with affidavits; whereas, a motion to make a pleading definite and certain must be determined on the pleading alone. Another reason is that the insertion in a pleading of unnecessary details violates the rule of brevity, clearness, and conciseness, which is not only commendable, but is also commanded. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 481, 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">\u25a0The order herein confuses the proper distinction between the two motions. The allegations of the complaint as to the signals which the defendant failed to give and the rate of speed at which he was proceeding are not such as to be the subject of a motion to be 'made definite and certain. Not every indefinite or uncertain allegation in a pleading may be made the subject of such a motion, but only such an allegation as is so indefinite or uncertain \u201cthat the precise meaning or application thereof is not apparent.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 546. No one can fail to understand the \u201cmeaning\u201d of the-allegations as to the signals and the rate of speed, and the \u201capplication\u201d of those allegations to the cause of action here alleged is that they are, in and of themselves, evidence of negligence. If the defendant is entitled to the details of the facts .thus alleged, he should ask for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">I think, however, that the allegation in .the complaint as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>rules and regulations which defendant is claimed to have disregarded is not stated with sufficient definiteness and certainty. It is not apparent how such allegation demonstrates negligence; and hence it has no \u201capplication\u201d to the cause of action alleged, unless it further appears what such rules and regulations were and by what authorities they were promulgated. To that extent such allegations should be made definite and certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The order under review is much too drastic in directing that for a failure to comply with its provisions the entire complaint be stricken out. If the allegations required to be made definite and certain were stricken from the complaint, sufficient would remain to constitute a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The order should therefore be modified, so as to require that the complaint state specifically the rules and regulations therein referred to and the authorities by whom they were made and promulgated, and, on failure to comply with such requirement, the allegation as to such rules and regulations should be stricken from the complaint; and, as so modified, said order should be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
