Under such a special allegation the plaintiff may introduce any evidence to show that the defamatory sense was meant and understood. That is this case, for a defamatory meaning is alleged in the complaint. Except for that allegation, the word friend would have to be taken in its innocent sense. As it is, however, the plaintiff may prove, for instance, that the defendant had previously told Dr. Shubert that the plaintiff had had a paramour friend, or had been addicted to such friendc; and that would be evidence on which the jury could find that the \u201cfriend\u201d mentioned, and put in suspicious quotation marks in his letter, and made more suspicious by its society with the word \u201cfellow,\u201d was meant for the same, or the same kind of a friend, and that that was the meaning conveyed. Words which could not bear a defamatory meaning to people generally, may bear such a meaning to one tutored in that use of them. Odgers, p. 113. All this scarcely calls for the citation of authority. Taylor v. Wallace, 31 Misc. Rep. 393, 64 N. Y. Supp. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>It may not be amiss to note that as this is an action of -libel the words may be actionable without imputing unchastity, as would have to be the sense of them to make them actionable if only spoken.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, with costs, and demurrer overruled, with costs, with leave to the defendant to plead over on payment. All concur.</blockquote>\n<author id=\"b636-6\">HOOKER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaP\">If the words had been, \u201cThere is a fellow who used to be a paramour (or a lover) of the woman,\u201d it would have been libelous; but an accepted secondary meaning of \u201cfriend\u201d is \u201clover of either sex,\u201d and one province of quotation marks is to invite attention to other than the usual meaning of words. It is the province of the jury to determine the sense in which words have been used by the defendant, where they are capable of a construction which would make them actionable. Patch v. Tribune Association, 38 Hun, 368. What the defendant meant by the use of the word \u201cfriend\u201d in quotation marks is for the jury, arid the demurrer should be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
