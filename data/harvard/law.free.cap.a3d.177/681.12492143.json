Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.) (\"CJ\") \u00a7 11-107, different post-judgment interest rates apply to different types of judgments. Generally, under CJ \u00a7 11-107(a), except as provided otherwise, a post-judgment interest rate of 10% applies to all judgments. Meanwhile, under CJ \u00a7 11-107(b), a post-judgment interest rate of 6% applies to \"money judgment[s] for rent of residential premises[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This opinion consolidates two cases that require us to determine which of these two post-judgment interest rates applies where: a landlord sues a tenant for breach of contract based on a residential lease; the trial court enters judgment in the landlord's favor against the tenant; the judgment includes unpaid rent and other expenses; and the judgment does not delineate what portion thereof was comprised of unpaid rent, as opposed to the other expenses-such as late fees or the cost of repairs to the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In separate matters, Amber Ben-Davies and Bryione K. Moore (together, \"Appellants\") failed to pay rent. After Appellants vacated their apartments, their respective landlords initiated separate actions for breach of contract. The District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore County (\"the District Court\"), entered judgments in the landlords' favor against Appellants. The judgments did not delineate the portions thereof that were comprised of unpaid rent, as opposed to other expenses. Ben-Davies's landlord had sought the cost of replacing carpet in her apartment, and Moore's landlord had sought the costs of utilities, changing the apartment's lock, trash disposal, cleaning stained carpet, advertising, and various fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Samuel Blibaum (\"Samuel\") and Gary S. Blibaum (\"Gary\") of Blibaum &amp; Associates, P.A. (\"Appellee\"), a licensed debt collector, represented the landlords in the actions for breach of contract. After the District Court entered the judgments,\n   Appellee engaged in collections activity on the landlords' behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On Appellee's behalf, Gary sent Ben-Davies a letter in which he stated that she owed her landlord a certain amount. Appellee obtained a writ of garnishment of Moore's wages, and sent her a Judgment Creditor's Monthly Report. In both the letter that was sent to Ben-Davies, and the Judgment Creditor's Monthly Report that was sent to Moore, Appellee indicated that the applicable post-judgment interest rate was 10%. In other words, Appellee sought to apply the post-judgment interest rate of 10% under CJ \u00a7 11-107(a), which applies to all judgments unless provided otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (\"the U.S. District Court\"), Appellants filed separate complaints against Appellee. In the complaints, Appellants contended that, contrary to Appellee's position, the applicable post-judgment interest rate was 6%, not 10%. In other words, Appellants argued that CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) applied because the judgments against them constituted \"money judgment[s] for rent of residential premises [.]\" Appellants asserted that, by seeking to apply a post-judgment interest rate of 10%, Appellee violated the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act, and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ultimately, in each case, the parties filed a \"Joint Motion to Certify a Question of Law to the Maryland Court of Appeals,\" requesting that the U.S. District Court certify the following question of law to this Court:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Is the legal rate of post-judgment interest on a judgment awarded in a breach of contract action where the underlying contract is a residential lease ten percent (10%)[,] as stated in [CJ] \u00a7 11-107(a) [,] or is it six percent (6%) [,] as stated in\n   [CJ] \u00a7 11-107(b), which states that it is applicable to \"a money judgment for rent of residential premises,\" where the judgment in the breach of contract action does not specifically delineate what portion, if any, of the judgment was awarded for unpaid rent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the joint motions to certify, the parties noted that this was an issue of first impression. The U.S. District Court granted the joint motions to certify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before this Court, as in the U.S. District Court, Appellants contend that the applicable post-judgment interest rate is 6% pursuant to CJ \u00a7 11-107(b). Appellee responds that the applicable post-judgment interest rate is 10% pursuant to CJ \u00a7 11-107(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We conclude that, where a landlord sues a tenant for breach of contract based on a residential lease, and the trial court enters judgment in the landlord's favor against the tenant and the judgment includes damages for unpaid rent and other expenses, a post-judgment interest rate of 6% applies pursuant to CJ \u00a7 11-107(b). CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) unequivocally states that it applies to \"a money judgment for rent of residential premises[.]\" As such, CJ \u00a7 11-107(b)'s plain language establishes that it applies where, as here, a judgment is comprised of unpaid rent and other expenses that are due as a result of a residential lease. Nothing in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) renders it exclusively applicable to money judgments that are entirely comprised of unpaid rent. Stated otherwise, nothing in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) indicates that, for a post-judgment interest rate of 6% to apply, a judgment must consist solely of unpaid rent, and may not include expenses that are associated with the rent of residential premises. Additionally, nothing in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) indicates that it does not apply to actions for breach of contract between landlords and tenants. In addition to the plain language of CJ \u00a7 11-107(b), our holding is supported by CJ \u00a7 11-107(b)'s obvious purpose, which is to protect tenants by not subjecting them to a 10% post-judgment interest rate on money judgments for rent of residential premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Amber Ben-Davies v.

The lease named Hendersen-Webb, Inc. (\"Hendersen-Webb\") as the agent for the apartment building's owner. The period of the lease was from September 12, 2005 through September 30, 2006. The lease would automatically be renewed unless Ben-Davies or Hendersen-Webb provided notice, at least three months in advance, of an intent not to renew the lease. The rent was initially $635.00 a month. Ben-Davies paid a security deposit of $635.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Eventually, Ben-Davies vacated the apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a letter dated January 11, 2007, Hendersen-Webb's Supervisor of Collections advised Ben-Davies that she owed $2,728.09. Specifically, according to the Supervisor of Collections, Ben-Davies owed: an overdue balance\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of $893.62 as of October 9, 2006;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   $615.55 for the remainder\n   of rent in October 2006; $658.00 for rent in November 2006; $445.83 for rent from\n   December 1, 2006 through December 21, 2006, the day before Henderson-Webb leased the apartment to a new tenant; and $115.09 for replacing carpet in the apartment. Ben-Davies did not make any payments toward the $2,728.09 that Hendersen-Webb alleged was due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 7, 2007, in the District Court, Hendersen-Webb sued Ben-Davies, initiating\n   <em>\n    Henderson-Webb, Inc. v. Amber Ben-Davies\n   </em>\n   , No. 080400171172007 (Dist. Ct. Md.). The complaint named Samuel as Hendersen-Webb's counsel. Hendersen-Webb used the District Court's form for complaints in civil cases. The form included the following language: \"Clerk: Please docket this case as an action of ? contract ? tort ? replevin ? detinue[.]\" All of these checkboxes are blank; however, the checkbox that is next to the word \"contract\" has two typed \"Xs\" near it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the heading \"APPLICATION AND AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF JUDGMENT[,]\" the complaint stated, in pertinent part: \"Attached hereto are [ ] documents [that] contain sufficient detail as to liability and damage to apprise [Ben-Davies] clearly of the claim against\" her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the complaint, Hendersen-Webb alleged that Ben-Davies \"ow[ed] rent and [ ] caused additional expenses[,] which total $3[,]372.62.\" Hendersen-Webb sought $2,728.09 in damages, which represented the $3,372.62 in charges minus $644.53-which, in turn, represented Ben-Davies's $635.00 security deposit, plus $9.53 in interest. Hendersen-Webb also\n   sought $76.50 in pre-judgment interest, $409.21 in attorney's fees, and court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 19, 2007, the District Court entered judgment on affidavit in Hendersen-Webb's favor against Ben-Davies in the amount of $2,728.09, plus $76.50 in pre-judgment interest, $409.21 in attorney's fees, and $50.00 in court costs. The District Court ordered that there would be post-judgment interest at the legal rate. The judgment did not delineate what portion thereof was comprised of unpaid rent, as opposed to other expenses-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the cost of replacing carpet in the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the District Court entered judgment, Appellee engaged in collections activity on Hendersen-Webb's behalf. Ben-Davies did not make any payments toward the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 19, 2016-nine years after the District Court entered judgment-on Appellee's behalf, Gary sent Ben-Davies a letter in which he stated that the judgment's balance was $5,811.32.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This figure\n   was based on a post-judgment interest rate of 10%. Ben-Davies's counsel telephoned Gary, who confirmed that Appellee was seeking to apply a post-judgment interest rate of 10%. During a communication with Ben-Davies's counsel, Appellee offered to settle the judgment's balance for $3,500.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 5, 2016, in the U.S. District Court, Ben-Davies filed a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial against Appellee, initiating\n   <em>\n    Amber Ben-Davies v. Blibaum &amp; Assocs., P.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cv-02783-JFM (D. Md.). In the complaint, Ben-Davies contended that, contrary to Appellee's position, the applicable post-judgment interest rate was 6%, not 10%. Ben-Davies argued that, accordingly, the judgment's balance was\n   $4,918.92, not $5,811.32. Ben-Davies asserted that, by demanding a higher amount than was due, Appellee violated the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act, and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. Ben-Davies alleged that, as a result of Appellee's actions, she \"suffered from emotional distress, stress, anger[,] and frustration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On September 12, 2016, Appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss and a memorandum of law in support thereof, contending that the U.S. District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because Ben-Davies lacked standing. For purposes of claims under federal law, to have standing, a \"plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

In a Memorandum dated October 11, 2016, the U.S. District Court determined that Ben-Davies lacked standing, and dismissed the complaint. The U.S. District Court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Ben-Davies]'s conclusory allegation that she has suffered harm is not supported by her allegation that [Appellee] applied the incorrect rate of [post-judgment] interest, particularly in light of the fact[s] that she never paid a cent on the [judgment,] and that [Appellee] offered to settle [the judgment's balance] for less than [the amount that Ben-Davies] alleges was due.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 12, 2016, Ben-Davies filed a notice of appeal. In an unreported\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   opinion dated June 1, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (\"the Fourth Circuit\") vacated the U.S. District Court's judgment and remanded for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ben-Davies v.

The Fourth Circuit held that Ben-Davies had established injury in fact, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Ben-Davies alleged that she was a consumer, that [Appellee] acted as a debt collector, and that [Appellee] attempted to collect from her a debt arising out of a state court judgment by demanding payment of an incorrect sum based on the calculation of a [post-judgment] interest rate [that was] not authorized by law. This was not a case where the plaintiff simply alleged \"a bare procedural violation [of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act], divorced from any concrete harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   [ ],\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The rent was\n   $895.00 a month. Moore and Pompey paid a security deposit of $895.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 30, 2009, Moore and Pompey vacated the apartment.

According to the invoice, the $4,664.90 in charges were comprised of: $894.00 for rent in June 2009; $895.00 for rent in each month from July 2009 through September 2009;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   a $44.75 late fee for each month from June 2009 through August 2009; two $19.75 \"filing\" fees for June 1 and July 1; two $45.75 \"filing\" fees for June 2 and July 2;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   $252.00 for utilities from July 30, 2009 through September 30, 2009; $50.00 for changing the apartment's lock because Moore and Pompey did not return the keys; $146.65 for removing, and disposing of, six bags of trash; $120.00 for cleaning stained carpet; and $252.00 for advertising the apartment. According to a Collection Request dated September 2, 2009, in February and June 2009, Moore and/or Pompey made a total of $150.00 in payments, thus lowering the balance to $3,606.47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On March 23, 2012, in the District Court, Peak Management sued Moore and Pompey, initiating\n   <em>\n    Peak Mgmt., LLC v.

The District Court ordered that there would be post-judgment interest at the legal rate. The judgment did not delineate what portion thereof was comprised of unpaid rent, as opposed to other expenses-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the costs of utilities, changing the apartment's lock, trash disposal, cleaning stained carpet, advertising, and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After the District Court entered judgment, Appellee engaged in collections activity on Peak Management's behalf.

Appellants assert that nothing in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b)'s plain language indicates that CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) applies solely to actions in which a landlord seeks possession of the premises for failure to pay rent, as opposed to actions for breach of contract. Appellants contend that labeling an action as one for \"breach of contract\" is of no legal consequence to the applicable post-judgment interest rate, and does not change the circumstance that the judgment is comprised of unpaid rent that is due under a residential lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Appellants observe that, in 1980, the General Assembly increased the default post-judgment interest rate from 6% to 10%. Appellants argue that the General Assembly clearly intended to protect tenants in residential leases by not applying a 10% post-judgment interest rate for money judgments for rent of residential premises. Appellants assert that, because House Bill 1683-through which the General Assembly enacted CJ \u00a7 11-107's predecessor-did not originally include the word \"money,\" but was later amended to insert the word \"money\" immediately before the phrase \"judgment for rent of residential premises[,]\" this circumstance reinforces the conclusion that CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) applies to any action in which a landlord seeks money damages for rent of residential premises, not just actions in which landlords also seek possession of the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Appellee responds that the plain language of CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) demonstrates that it does not apply to judgments in actions for breach of contract, even if the damages include rental payments under a lease. According to Appellee, under\n   its commonly accepted definition, the word \"rent\" does not apply to money damages in an action for breach of contract. Appellee contends that, as used in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b),\n   the word \"rent\" means a payment that is made as part of an obligation that is coupled with an interest in land, and that is extinguished when a tenancy ends. Appellee argues that, accordingly, under CJ \u00a7 11-107(b), the word \"rent\" arguably includes only unpaid rent for the period when a tenant occupies the premises, and does not include unpaid rent for the period after the tenant vacates the premises. Appellee asserts that the word \"rent\" also excludes other components of the judgments in the instant cases-namely, late fees, utilities, and the costs of making repairs to the apartments, changing the locks, and advertising the properties. Appellee maintains that these components of the judgments are based solely on obligations under the leases, and thus are comprised of damages for breach of contract, not unpaid rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Appellee contends that CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) applies only in actions in which landlords seek possession of the premises-such as summary ejectment actions-because, in such an action, the tenant continues to occupy the premises, and thus remains obligated to pay rent. Appellee contends that there is no logical reason to apply a post-judgment interest rate of 6% to actions for breach of contract based on residential leases, while applying a post-judgment interest rate of 10% to actions for breach of contract based on other agreements. Appellee argues that nothing in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b)'s legislative history suggests that the General Assembly intended CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) to apply to a judgment obtained in an action for breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bottini v.

We do so on the tacit theory that the General Assembly is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant. When the statutory language is clear, we need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the General Assembly's intent. If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written. In addition, we neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words that the General Assembly used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute's meaning. If there is no ambiguity in the language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   If the language of the statute is ambiguous, however, then courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives, and the purpose of the enactment under consideration. We have said that there is an ambiguity within a statute when there exist two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. When a statute can be interpreted in more than one way, the job of this Court is to\n   resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   If the true legislative intent cannot be readily determined from the statutory language alone, however, we may, and often must, resort to other recognized indicia-among other things, the structure of the statute, including its title; how the statute relates to other laws; the legislative history, including the derivation of the statute, comments and explanations regarding it by authoritative sources during the\n   legislative process, and amendments proposed or added to it; the general purpose behind the statute; and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   In construing a statute, we avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   In addition, the meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which is appears. As this Court has stated, because it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (Citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Post-Judgment Interest Rates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"The right of a [plaintiff] to interest on a judgment did not exist at common law.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. v.

In other words, consistent with existing Maryland law under Article 3, Section 57 of the Constitution of Maryland of 1867, as well as the law of every other jurisdiction at the time, there would not be different post-judgment interest rates depending on the cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   House Bill 1683's bill file includes a handwritten list of amendments to House Bill 1683's original version, including the\n   following amendment: \"[I]nsert '(B) the legal rate of interest on a ^ money judgment for rent of residential premises shall be at the rate of 6 percent per annum on the amount of the judgment.' \" The word \"money\" appears above the word \"a\" and the caret (^).

Stated otherwise, CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) does not contain language that \"a money judgment for rent of residential premises\" is strictly, or only, for unpaid rent. We decline to add words to CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) to render it applicable only to money judgments that are comprised solely of unpaid rent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bottini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175037,12487782\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/450/177/\">\n    450 Md. at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174962,12175037,12487782,12487783\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/371/\">\n    147 A.3d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute[.]\" (Citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In contending that, as used in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b), the word \"rent\" refers only to money that a tenant owes a landlord for a period when the tenant occupied the premises, Appellee mistakenly focuses on the word \"rent\" in isolation. We agree, however, with the position of Civil Justice, Inc., the Maryland Volunteer Lawyers Service, and the Public Justice Center,\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   , that the phrase \"a money judgment for rent of residential premises\" indicates that CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) applies to money judgments that are related to rentals of residential premises. In the context of the phrase \"a money judgment\n   <strong>\n    for rent of residential premises\n   </strong>\n   [,]\" the word \"rent\" does not refer to a monetary sum, but instead unambiguously refers to the act of renting residential premises. By way of analogy, when a sign says \"apartment for rent,\" the word \"rent\" does not indicate the monetary sum that a tenant would owe each month; instead, the word \"rent\" indicates that the landlord is renting the apartment. In short, as used in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b), the word \"rent\" is synonymous with the act of renting and not the monetary sum that a tenant owes each month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Similarly, CJ \u00a7 11-107(b)'s plain language belies Appellee's contention that CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) does not apply to actions for breach of contract, and instead applies only to actions in which a landlord seeks possession of the premises. At the risk of stating the obvious, if the General Assembly had intended for CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) to apply only to actions in which a landlord seeks possession of the premises-namely, actions for distress for rent, summary ejectment actions, tenant holding over actions, and actions for breach of lease-the General Assembly easily could have stated as much. In 1974-six years before the General Assembly enacted CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b) -the General Assembly enacted, within Title 8 (Landlord and Tenant) of the Real Property Article, the statutes that govern actions for distress for rent (now RP \u00a7\u00a7 8-301 to 8-332 ), summary ejectment actions (now RP \u00a7 8-401 ), and tenant holding over actions (now RP \u00a7 8-402 ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1974%20Md.%20Laws%20329\">\n    1974 Md.

Four years later, in 1978-two years before the General Assembly enacted CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b) -the General Assembly enacted the statute that governs actions for breach of lease (now RP \u00a7 8-402.1 ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1978%20Md.%20Laws%201643\">\n    1978 Md.

Had the General Assembly intended for CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b) to apply only to actions in which landlords seek possession of the premises, and not to actions for breach of contract, the General Assembly could have specified that CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b) applied only to the legal rate of interest on a money judgment in an action pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 8-301 to 8-332, 8-401, 8-402, or 8-402.1 of the Real Property Article. Alternatively, the General Assembly could have specified that CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b) applied only in an action for distress for rent, a summary ejectment action, a tenant holding over action, or an action for breach of lease. The General Assembly did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   By way of contrast, CJ \u00a7 4-401(4), which governs the District Court's jurisdiction, provides in pertinent part, as follows: \"[T]he District Court has exclusive original civil jurisdiction in ...

The General Assembly, however, did not limit CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b)'s applicability to specific causes of action. Instead, the General Assembly made CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b) applicable to \"money judgment[s] for rent of residential premises[.]\" Simply put, nothing in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b)'s plain language renders it inapplicable to actions for breach of contract between landlords and tenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Although, as explained above, CJ \u00a7 11-107(b)'s plain language is unambiguous with respect to its applicability to \"money judgment[s] for rent of residential premises[,]\" we review its legislative history as \"a confirmatory process[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Lamone v.

Before the General Assembly enacted\n   CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107, the post-judgment interest rate for all judgments was 6%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 57 (\"The legal rate of interest shall be\n   <em>\n    six per cent per annum\n   </em>\n   , unless otherwise provided by the General Assembly.\" (Italics in original)). By enacting CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107, the General Assembly raised the default post-judgment interest rate to 10%,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(a), but retained the existing post-judgment interest rate of 6% for \"money judgment[s] for rent of residential premises[.]\" CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b). Nothing in the bill file of House Bill 1683-through which the General Assembly enacted CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107 -expressly explains why the General Assembly did not raise the post-judgment interest rate for money judgments for rent of residential premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   That said, CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b)'s obvious purpose was to protect tenants by not subjecting them to an increased post-judgment interest rate on money judgments for rent of residential premises. In other words, it is evident that the General Assembly carved out an exception to the default post-judgment interest rate of 10% for the benefit of residential tenants. Needless to say, the new default post-judgment interest rate of 10% would have been more burdensome on residential tenants than the existing post-judgment interest\n   rate of 6%. It is entirely logical for the General Assembly to have imposed a lower post-judgment interest rate on residential tenants, given that, if the District Court enters a money judgment for rent of residential premises, a tenant is likely to already be experiencing financial difficulties, which a higher post-judgment interest rate would only exacerbate. CJ (1980) \u00a7 11-107(b)'s obvious purpose of protecting residential tenants supports the conclusion that CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) applies where a money judgment is comprised of unpaid rent and other expenses that are due under a residential lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Indeed, we can fathom no rational explanation as to why, as Appellee posits, the General Assembly would have intended for CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) to apply to actions in which a landlord seeks possession of the premises, but not actions for breach of contract between landlords and tenants. At a minimum, it\n   would be inconsistent to subject residential tenants to a post-judgment interest rate of 10% in breach of contract actions between landlords and tenants for rent of residential premises, but protect residential tenants from the post-judgment interest rate of 10% in other actions between landlords and tenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Our holding in this case is fully consistent with our recent holding in\n   <em>\n    Lockett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165727\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/446/397/#p424\">\n    446 Md. at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165727\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/446/397/#p424\">\n    132 A.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this Court defined the word \"rent\" as used in RP \u00a7 8-208.1 (Retaliatory actions).

Significantly, however, this Court did not purport to define the word \"rent\" as it is used in the phrase \"money judgment for rent of residential premises\" in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b), or in any way indicate that the term \"rent\" applies solely to money judgments entered pursuant to RP \u00a7 8-401.

In other words, the analysis of the meaning of the word \"rent\" in CJ \u00a7 11-107(b) includes consideration of the meaning of the entire phrase \"money judgment for rent of residential premises\" and is not limited to ascertaining the definition of the word \"rent\" in isolation, or dependent upon the definition of the word \"rent\" in RP \u00a7 8-208.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Because the phrase \"money judgment for rent of residential premises\" encompasses the act of renting residential premises, it is not required that, in issuing judgments for rent of residential premises, the District Court delineate the portion of the judgment that is comprised of unpaid rent as opposed to other expenses for a post-judgment interest rate of 6% to apply pursuant to CJ \u00a7 11-107(b). As discussed above, CJ \u00a7 11-107(b)'s plain language contains no limitation of its applicability to money judgments that are comprised of unpaid rent and other expenses.
