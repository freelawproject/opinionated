For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's claims. The defendant was arrested following an extensive investigation by the Statewide Urban Violence Cooperative Crime Control Task Force (task force), which targeted the sale of illegal firearms and narcotics in the city of Bridgeport in 2012. The defendant was implicated in the investigation after he was involved in the sale of stolen guns and oxycodone pills to confidential informants in two separate controlled purchases in June and July, 2012. On May 22, 2013, the state filed an information charging the defendant with multiple offenses. Attorney Frederic Ury was appointed as the defendant's counsel on June 24, 2013, and represented the defendant throughout the majority of his pretrial proceedings. On February 19, 2014, Ury moved to withdraw his appearance, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. On February 26, 2014, the court granted Ury's motion to withdraw. On March 3, 2014, Attorney Miles Gerety filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant. A six-day jury trial commenced on July 15, 2014. Several members of the task force, and an alleged coconspirator, Serafettin Senel, testified. The defendant did not testify. On July 23, 2014, the defendant was found guilty on the counts tried to the jury and the count tried to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 28, 2014, the defendant filed a handwritten motion to dismiss Gerety as his counsel. In his motion,\n   the defendant alleged that Gerety assaulted him, coerced him into not presenting evidence or testifying at trial, and conspired with various other individuals to convict him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 17, 2014, the court granted Gerety's oral motion to withdraw. On October 21, 2014, Attorney Donald Cretella filed an appearance to represent the defendant with respect to sentencing. On January 26, 2015, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of eight years of incarceration, followed by five years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant's first claim on appeal is that the trial court violated his federal and state constitutional rights in denying his requests to personally possess a copy of the discovery items disclosed by the state pursuant to\n   Practice Book \u00a7 40-10. The defendant contends that \u00a7 40-10\"creates a presumption\" that he is not permitted to possess a copy of the state's disclosure in violation of his constitutional rights. The defendant asserts that his claim was adequately preserved by his attorneys' three \"motions to provide redacted reports to [him], which were denied by the trial court ....\" Alternatively, the defendant seeks review pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), as modified by\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The state argues that the defendant is not entitled to review of this claim because it is unpreserved and not constitutional in nature. We conclude that the defendant's claim was not properly preserved for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. On July 10, 2013, Ury orally\n   sought permission from the court to provide the defendant with a redacted copy of a police report. The court,\n   <em>\n    Devlin, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the motion. On May 28, 2014, Gerety asked for the court's permission to provide the defendant with a redacted copy of the state's disclosure. The court,\n   <em>\n    Blawie, J.\n   </em>\n   , deferred ruling on the motion until counsel had an opportunity to meet off the record to try and resolve the disclosure issue. On June 4, 2014, Gerety filed a motion for disclosure and production requesting that the state permit defense counsel to provide a copy of the state's disclosure to the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 40-10. On June 5, 2014, after conducting a hearing to determine \"whether or not the defendant should be entitled to have his own copies of the state's disclosure materials,\" Judge Blawie denied the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The record indicates that the defendant, through counsel, never framed his requests as a constitutional issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the requests contained any assertion that the defendant's constitutional rights to due process or the effective assistance of counsel entitled him to personally possess discovery documents. Therefore,\n   appellate review of his unpreserved claim is subject to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/\">\n    213 Conn. at 239-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Under this standard, [a defendant] can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate\n   harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491207\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/171/457/#p705\">\n    176 Conn.

Accordingly, this argument fails under the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . We therefore decline to review the merits of the defendant's constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant's second claim on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his requests\n   to personally possess a copy of the discovery items disclosed by the state pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 40-10. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. In denying Ury's oral motion to give the defendant a redacted copy of the police report, Judge Devlin stated, \"in other cases where I've authorized police reports to go into the correctional center, what they're really used for is to find out who the informants are, who the witnesses are, and sometimes those people are given a hard time. So, I don't permit that. [Ury] will go over the report with you, so you're fully informed about what the accusations are against you, what the police evidence is against you, but I'm not going to permit the actual physical copy of the report into the jail. I just don't do that because we have had bad situations come out of that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This issue was readdressed during a June 5, 2014 hearing on the defendant's motion for disclosure and production. Gerety stated to the court that the motion was \"driven by the defendant.\" Gerety also acknowledged that the decision to permit the defendant to possess discovery under Practice Book \u00a7 40-10 was \"largely [in] the court's discretion.\" Gerety represented to the court that he had visited the defendant in prison on \"numerous occasions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   During these visits, the defendant had the opportunity to read most of the disclosure but claimed that he had not finished reading it. Gerety also brought his laptop and reviewed a series of police videos with the defendant. Gerety stated that they \"spent hours going over line by line ... writing down the words that were said.\" The state objected to the defendant's motion, citing its interest in preventing disclosed materials from circulating in the jails. The state\n   also argued that this motion was merely an attempt to circumvent prior rulings made by the court, which denied the defendant's motion to remove counsel and to represent himself. The state further contended that the defendant would suffer no\n   prejudice because he \"had full access to ... the disclosure materials\" through his attorney. Further, the defendant admitted that he already possessed many of the documents through a Freedom of Information Act request. Judge Blawie denied the defendant's motion, finding that there had not been a sufficient change in circumstances to overturn Judge Devlin's prior ruling on the same issue. Judge Blawie, however, accepted an alternative proposed by Gerety, and the defendant was given the remainder of the day to review the state's disclosure in the courthouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We review the court's granting or denial of a discovery request for an abuse of discretion.
