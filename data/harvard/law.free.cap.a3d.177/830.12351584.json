Pozonsky was a commissioned judge of the Court of Common- Pleas of Washington County who presided over criminal- trials, juvenile delinquency hearings, \u2022 and also directed the rehabilitative disposition of drug offenders in that county\u2019s Drug Court, which he founded. Using his position as a jurist, he-directed police officers and court personnel to bring cocaine, which was evidence in the cases over which he was presiding, to an evidence locker in his courtroom; whereupon, for over a year, he stole quantities of this illegal drug from that locker and used it for his own recreational purposes, all while continuing to preside over criminal prosecutions and imposing sentences on defendants for committing crimes which he himself was -contemporaneously engaging in. After Pozonsky's illicit activities were discovered, he resigned his judicial commission and was convicted for his crimes. After considering all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding Pozonsky\u2019s egregious misconduct while a commissioned judge, and taking into account the mitigating evidence he offered, the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (\u201cDisciplinary Board\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) issued a unanimous report detailing its factual findings and its recommendation that he be disbarred. Because the evidence of record amply supports the Board\u2019s findings and corresponding recommendation of disbarment, we order Pozon-sky\u2019s disbarment to both protect the public and to preserve the integrity of the legal profession.</p> <p id=\"b864-4\" pgmap=\"864\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p> <p id=\"Atn\" pgmap=\"864\">Pozonsky was admitted to the bar of this Commonwealth in 1980, Thereafter, he maintained a private law practice, and, in 1984, he was elected to the position of magisterial district judge, a position he held for the next 13 years, while he also continued to practice law part-time. In 1997, the people of Washington County elected him a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of that county, and he assumed the bench in January 1998. For nearly all of the subsequent 14 years, while holding this judicial position, Pozonsky presided over the criminal trials of individuals alleged to have committed criminal offenses, including drug crimes, and, thus, was responsible for fashioning sentences for those found guilty of such offenses, as he deemed appropriate.</p> <p id=\"b864-6\" pgmap=\"864\">During his tenure as a jurist, Respondent also adjudicated juvenile delinquency cases, a number of which involved drugs. For the juveniles he adjudicated delinquent, he was required to tailor programs of supervision, care, and rehabilitation so that they could compensate the victim and community for the harm- which they caused, while also ensuring that they received necessary treatment services to overcome behavioral and substance abuse issues and developed sufficient competencies to become responsible and productive members of society.</p> <p id=\"b864-7\" pgmap=\"864(119) 865(64)\">Significantly, in 2005, Pozonsky created the Drug Court of Washington County, which he later supervised, and he presided over all cases processed through that court. By way of background, drug courts are used as an alternative to the conventional criminal prosecution process in appropriate cases involving drug-related crimes, or where offenders are coping with a drug addiction, in order to achieve the twin goals of reducing the incidence of drug-related crimes, and preventing recidivism by offenders. Employing principles of \u201ctherapeutic jurisprudence,\u201d these courts combine intensive judicial supervision, drug testing, and comprehensive treatment to assist offenders in overcoming the substance abuse problems that enmeshed them in the criminal justice system. See generally. The Honorable Peggy Fulton Hora et. al., Therapeutic Jurisprudence and the. Drug Treatment Court Movement: Revolutionizing the Criminal Justice System\u2019s Response to Drug Abuse and Crime in America, 74 Notre Dame L. Rev. 439 (1999). In Pennsylvania, drug courts comprise an integral part of the Commonwealth\u2019s multi-faceted system of problem-solving courts, a program which this Court has taken great pride in establishing and fostering.</p> <p id=\"b865-4\" pgmap=\"865\">Judge Pozonsky\u2019s role in the cases he handled in the Washington County Drug Court program was to lead a team. of professionals, which included a prosecutor, defense counsel, a treatment provider, a probation officer, a member of law enforcement, and a court coordinator, in cooperatively supporting and monitoring .the progress of. an offender afflicted with a substance abuse problem to ensure that he or she successfully overcame it. See Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, \u201cDrug Courts,\u201d available at http://www. pacourts.us/judicial-administration/court-programs/drug-courts (explaining the fundamentals of the operation of Pennsylvania drug courts). This process relies on a tightly structured treatment program tailored to the particular circumstances of the offender, and concomitantly necessitates strict adherence by the offender to the program requirements. Accordingly, Po-zonsky was required, in some instances, to enforce compliance by imposing sanctions on the offender, or, when those sanctions failed to alter the offender\u2019s behavior, removing him or her from the program and reinstituting regular criminal proceedings. Id.</p> <p id=\"b865-5\" pgmap=\"865\">Beginning sometime in late October or early November 2010, and continuing through January 2012, Pozonsky exploited his position as a judge, to steal powdered cocaine \u2014 an illegal controlled substance\u2014 that was the principal evidence in criminal or delinquency hearings held in his courtroom.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, he ordered state troopers who had seized cocaine which was to be used in the criminal prosecutions or juvenile adjudications over which he was scheduled to preside, as well as a court employee \u2014 his law clerk \u2014 to bring that evidence to his courtroom, where he stored it in an evidence locker in his chambers. He then surreptitiously and regularly removed quantities of this illicit substance from that locker when courtroom staff was not present, smuggled it opt of the courthouse, and used it at his home. Pozonsky attempted to conceal his thefts by substituting baking powder and other substances for the cocaine he had stolen and used.</p> <p id=\"b865-9\" pgmap=\"865(151) 866(11)\">In early 2012, Pozonsky issued an order directing the destruction of evidence from closed criminal cases he had presided over. That, and the manner in which other evidence stored in the evidence locker, was being. handled, generated: suspicion and concern from the Washington County District Attorney, Eugene Vittone, and the then-President Judge of that county, Debbie O\u2019Dell,, Seneca, These matters were referred to the Office of the Attorney General which began a formal criminal investigation of Pozonsky. The investigation resulted, inter alia, in the search of Po-zonsky\u2019s chambers by,the Pennsylvania State Police who retrieved all remaining evidence stored there on May 9, 2012. Po-zonsky resigned from the bench in June 2012, and resumed active status as an attorney; whereupon, he moved with his family to Alaska. While in Alaska, Pozon-sky secured a job as a workers\u2019 compensation hearing judge, which he held from October 8, 2012, until he resigned on December 7, 2012.</p> <p id=\"b866-4\" pgmap=\"866\">On October 13, 2013, the Attorney General filed a criminal information against Pozonsky in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County charging him with six separate criminal offenses related to his cocaine theft: violating the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7 1103(a),-an ungraded felony; committing theft by unlawful taking, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3921(a), graded as a first-degree misdemeanor; theft by failure to make required disposition of property, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3927(a), graded as a first-degree misdemeanor; obstructing the administration of law, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5101, graded as a first-degree misdemeanor; misapplication of entrusted property, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4113, graded as a first-degree misdemeanor; and possession' of a controlled substance, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(15), an ungraded misdemeanor.</p> <p id=\"b866-5\" pgmap=\"866\">On March 20, 2015, Pozonsky pleaded guilty to one count of theft by unlawful taking, obstructing administration of law, and misapplication of entrusted property and property of a government institution, all graded as second-degree misdemeanors. Four months later, on July 13, 2015, he was sentenced to 1 to 23 \u00bd months incarceration, followed by two years probation. Pozonsky ultimately served the minimum term of incarceration \u2014 one month\u2014 and successfully completed his term of probation.</p> <p id=\"b866-6\" pgmap=\"866\">Our Court issued an order on August 19, 2015 temporarily suspending Pozonsky\u2019s law license, in accordance with Pa,R.D.E. 214(d)(2). Following that action, ODC filed a Petition for Discipline, to which Pozon-sky filed a counseled answer. A disciplinary hearing was held on March 15, 2016 before a Hearing Committee comprised of three members of the Board. At this hearing, the ODC presented as evidence the aforementioned criminal information filed against Pozonsky, his plea agreement, his written and oral plea colloquies, the transcript of his sentencing hearing, and the order imposing his criminal sentence.</p> <p id=\"b866-8\" pgmap=\"866\">Pozonsky testified on his own behalf and recounted the details of his legal career, during which he was never subject to disciplinary proceedings. He acknowledged that he had used cocaine recreationally since the 1980s, including during his prior service as a magisterial district judge and during his tenure on the bench of the Court of Common Pleas, but he denied that he ever took the bench or adjudicated cases while under the influence of cocaine. Pozonsky further denied that he was addicted to cocaine at the time he began stealing from the evidence locker. But he admitted that he knew that the theft constituted a crime.</p> <p id=\"b866-9\" pgmap=\"866\">Pozonsky related that he first sought treatment for his cocaine use in May 2011; that he ceased using any controlled substances as of January 24, 2012; and that he remained drug free as of the date of the disciplinary hearing. Pozonsky additionally detailed his post-conviction community service activities, which included volunteering at a homeless shelter and various community drug abuse rehabilitation centers. Pozonsky also testified that he was completing a nine-week program to become a certified rehabilitation specialist.</p> <p id=\"b866-10\" pgmap=\"866(77) 867(145)\">Pozonsky characterized his conduct as \u201cnot appropriate,\u201d N.T. Disciplinary Hearing, 3/15/2016, at 32, and he admitted that he had besmirched the reputation of the Washington County Court of Common Pleas, the Commonwealth\u2019s judicial system, and his own reputation as a judge and a lawyer, as well as the reputation of other members of the bar. Pozonsky additionally introduced as exhibits 68 character letters from fellow attorneys, friends, coworkers, and members of the community which had been presented to the sentencing judge in the criminal proceedings against him. In these letters, the authors attested to Po-zonsky\u2019s good character in the community and as a judge. Pozonsky also submitted as mitigating evidence letters from three professional substance abuse counselors with whom he had received treatment, two from Washington County \u2014 Timothy Grealish and Rocco Ferri \u2014 and one from Alaska\u2014 Deborah Stamm. These letters detailed, inter alia, their observations regarding Pozonsky\u2019s addiction and his progress towards recovery. Pozonsky also introduced as an exhibit a newspaper article from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in which District Attorney Vittone is quoted as saying that no eases were affected because of Pozon-sky\u2019s theft of the cocaine, as well as a portion of the transcript of Pozonsky\u2019s sentencing hearing in. which the Office of the Attorney General did not dispute that assessment.</p> <p id=\"b867-5\" pgmap=\"867\">After the March 16, 2016 Committee hearing had concluded, at which neither party brought Pozonsky\u2019s employment in Alaska as a workers\u2019 compensation judge to the Committee\u2019s attention, the Committee discovered this fact via its own independent internet search\". The Committee then held a second hearing to explore this matter further, at which Pozonsky offered testimony to explain the circumstances of his application for that quasi-judicial position and his subsequent resignation. Although Pozonsky recalled that he disclosed the then-active criminal investigation to the officials in Alaska\u2019s Department of Labor who hired him, he stated that that investigation was not the reason for his resignation, but, rather, averred that he was asked to resign because his employer discovered that he was not deemed domiciled in Alaska at the tim\u00e9 of his application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pozonsky also presented evidence that he had passed the test required by the Pennsylvania Certification- Board and was now a certified recovery specialist. Both parties filed briefs, and the Hearing Committee issued a report on August 24, 2016 recommending .Pozonsky\u2019s disbarment from the- practice of law. .</p> <p id=\"b867-8\" pgmap=\"867\">The Committee observed that, because Pozonsky had pled guilty to multiple criminal offenses, grounds for discipline manifestly existed under Pa.R.D.E. 203(b)(1) (stating that conviction of a crime shall-'b\u00e9 grounds for discipline); thus, the only question it was required to determine was the appropriate discipline to impose. The Committee highlighted as mitigating factors in its choice of discipline the fact that Pozonsky had no prior record of misconduct as an attorney, and that he acknowledged his wrongdoing and demonstrated remorse. However, the Committee rejected Pozonsky\u2019s assertion that his addiction to cocaine should be considered as a mitigating factor under our Court\u2019s decision in Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Braun, 520 Pa. 157, 553 A.2d 894 (1989), in which we determined that expert psychiatric testimony establishing that an attorney\u2019s psychological condition was a causal factor in his misconduct was properly considered as mitigating evidence.</p> <p id=\"b867-9\" pgmap=\"867(48) 868(24)\">The Committee noted that Pozonsky did not introduce any evidence, either via expert testimony or through the character letters written on his behalf, which met the Braun standard for \u2022 mitigation \u2014 i.e.,' he failed to demonstrate a causal connection between his addiction and his actions. Because of the dearth of evidence establishing this requisite causal link, the Committee did not consider Pozonsky\u2019s addiction to.be a mitigating factor.</p> <p id=\"b868-4\" pgmap=\"868\">The Committee thus proceeded to examine other non -Braun mitigating evidence such as Pozonsky\u2019s lack of prior discipline, his efforts at addiction rehabilitation, his appearance at all- disciplinary hearings, his involvement in the community, and the breadth of the character evidence reflected in the letters written on his behalf. While recognizing this evidence, the Committee found that it. did not mitigate the imposition of discipline given what it considered to be Pozonsky\u2019s \u201cegregious conduct.\u201d Disciplinary Board Hearing Committee Report, 8/24/16, at 7.</p> <p id=\"b868-5\" pgmap=\"868\">Specifically, the -Committee found that the' dishonesty exhibited by Pozonsky, both in stealing and using the cocaine evidence while a sitting judge, and then failing to disclose his employment in Alaska during the disciplinary proceedings, was so serious in nature that it constituted an aggravating factor which weighed heavily against him. Regarding his theft and use of the cocaine, which as noted was evidence in the very proceedings over which he continued to preside, the. Committee opined:</p> <blockquote id=\"azg-dedup-1\" pgmap=\"868\">This was not a situation where [Pozon-sky] bought drugs on the street or anywhere else on his own personal time, with regular clothes on, giving the appearance that he is a drug buyer/user like the next person. This is. a situation where [Pozonsky] was dressed in his black robe, being addressed as \u201cJudge\u201d or \u201cYour Honor\u201d on a daily basis in the Criminal Division of the Court of Common Pleas. Appearing in this manner, he addressed other like-minded individuals who were addicted to drugs in the Drug Court program, since he was the sitting judge and, after looking upon them in judgment and sentencing them to a term of imprisonment or probation, took their drugs that were submitted into evidence and used them himself. The hypocrisy is astounding.</blockquote> <p id=\"b868-8\" pgmap=\"868\">Disciplinary Board Hearing Committee Report, 8/24/16, at 8. The Committee found that the level of dishonesty evidenced by this conduct negated what Pozonsky had accomplished over the. course of his legal career and undermined the integrity of the legal system. The Committee noted that Pozonsky\u2019s acceptance of the judicial position in Alaska, while he knew he was being criminally investigated, was another example of his dishonest conduct that further undermined the integrity of the legal system. The. Committee unanimously recommended his disbarment.</p> <p id=\"b868-9\" pgmap=\"868\">Pozonsky filed exceptions to the Hearing Committee\u2019s report and recommendation and a brief in support thereof, to which ODC responded. After review, the Board adjudicated the matter at its regular meeting and unanimously recommended Pozon-sky\u2019s disbarment.</p> <p id=\"b868-10\" pgmap=\"868(119) 869(9)\">Because Pozonsky\u2019s criminal convictions were \u201cincontrovertible evidence of his professional misconduct,\u201d the Board viewed its sole task to be to recommend to our Court the appropriate discipline, recognizing that the \u201crecommended discipline must reflect facts and circumstances unique to the case, .including circumstances that are aggravating .or mitigating.\u201d Disciplinary Board Report and Recommendations, 12/21/2016, at 7. The Board reviewed the mitigating evidence offered by Pozonsky at the disciplinary hearing, which,- as indicated above, included his lack of prior discipline, his denial of using drugs while on the bench, his assertion that his drug use did not compromise the cases he was adjudicating, his treatment efforts, his community service, his cooperation with the ODC, and the many character letters from community members.</p> <p id=\"b869-4\" pgmap=\"869\">The Board found, however, that this mitigating evidence had to be weighed against the following aggravating circumstance:</p> <blockquote id=\"azy-dedup-1\" pgmap=\"869\">[A]t the time of the misconduct, [Pozon-sky], held a position of responsibility and authority and had a high public profile. It is disturbing irony that [Pozonsky], who was the creator, supervisor and sitting judge of the Washington County drug court, sat in judgment of and imposed sentence on individuals who engaged in drug-related criminal acts, after which [Pozonsky] took the drugs that were submitted into evidence and used them himself.</blockquote> <p id=\"b869-5\" pgmap=\"869\">Id. at 9.</p> <p id=\"b869-6\" pgmap=\"869\">The Board found significant Pozonsky\u2019s status as an elected judge at the time of his crimes, a position the Board viewed as creating a high expectation of his integrity as an attorney because he was entrusted with the task of protecting the public. Significantly, the Board noted that, in Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Cappuccio, 616 Pa. 439, 48 A.3d 1231, 1240 (2012), discussed at greater length infra, our Court emphasized that an. attorney\u2019s status as a public official may properly be regarded as aggravating any misconduct he or she engages in while holding that position.</p> <p id=\"AQpV\" pgmap=\"869\">Although acknowledging that the Hearing Committee found that Pozonsky\u2019s action in taking the position in Alaska was a further demonstration of his dishonesty, and, thus, an aggravating factor warranting discipline, the Board determined that it was not necessary to consider this evidence. The Board reasoned that Pozon-sky\u2019s, criminal conduct while .serving as judge was so egregious that, standing alone, it warranted his disbarment, as \u201c[a] judge\u2019s misconduct speaks directly to the integrity of the legal system by placing the reputation of those tasked with serving and protecting the public at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Disciplinary Board Report and Recommendations, 12/21/2016,' at 10.</p> <p id=\"b869-10\" pgmap=\"869(180) 870(33)\">The Board also considered persuasive the fact that other attorneys had been disbarred for committing criminal acts while holding judicial office. See Disciplinary Board Report at 11-12 (citing Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Rolf Larsen, 19 DB 2003 (Disciplinary Board Report filed 6/23/2006; Supreme Court order filed 11/30/2006) (disbarring former Supreme Court Justice for obtaining prescription medication for his depression using the names of other individuals, even\u2018though Disciplinary Board recommended a three-year suspension); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Michael Joyce, 47 DB 2009 (Disciplinary Board Report filed 2/10/2012; Supreme Court order filed 6/14/2012) (disbarring former Superior Court judge for federal convictions of mail fraud and related offenses arising out of an automobile accident); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. David Murphy, 188 DB 2010 (Disciplinary Board Report filed 5/4/2012; Supreme Court Order filed 1/30/2013) (disbarring former magisterial district judge for forging 64 signatures on nominating petitions in his reelection campaign); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Thomas Nocella, 152 DB 2013 (Disciplinary Board Report filed 6/5/2015; Supreme Court Ord\u00e9r filed 10/20/2015) (disbarring attorney for \u00bfthical violations committed while a candidate for judicial office, which included concealing prior court sanctions and disciplinary actions taken against him from the judicial \u00bfvaluation commission which was rating him for judicial office)).</p> <p id=\"b870-4\" pgmap=\"870\">By contrast, the Board found inapposite cases in which other public officials holding non-judicial offices were not disbarred for criminal acts they engaged in while holding those positions. See Disciplinary Board Report at 12-13 (discussing Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Preate, 557 Pa. 4, 731 A.2d 129 (1999) (attorney received five-year suspension for accepting illegal campaign contributions while district attorney and later as Pennsylvania Attorney General and filing false election reports to conceal that behavior), and Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Eilberg, 497 Pa. 388, 441 A.2d 1193 (1982) (suspension imposed on attorney who received proceeds from his law firm\u2019s representation of a client in a matter before a federal agency while the attorney was a sitting U.S. Congressman, a violation of federal law for which he was convicted)). The Board distinguished these cases on the basis that the public officials therein, while having a high public profile, were not judges, who, by contrast, are \u201cheld to a heightened standard.\u201d Disciplinary Board Report and Recommendations, 12/21/2016, at 13. The Board thus concluded with respect to Pozonsky that only disbarment would maintain the integrity of the legal profession.</p> <p id=\"Au3T\" pgmap=\"870\">After the Board\u2019s Report and Recommendation was transmitted to our Court, Pozonsky requested oral argument, which our Court granted and held on April 4, 2017. Neither party has submitted new briefs to our Court, but, instead, both parties presently rely on their briefs submitted to the Disciplinary Board.</p> <p id=\"b870-6\" pgmap=\"870\">II. Analysis</p> <p id=\"b870-7\" pgmap=\"870\"> Our Court conducts de novo review of all attorney disciplinary matters; however, \u201cthe findings' of the Hearing Committee and the Board are guidelines for judging the credibility of witnesses and should be given substantial deference.\u201d Cappuccio, 48 A.3d at 1236. In attorney disciplinary proceedings, the ODC bears the burden of proof of establishing an attorney\u2019s misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence. Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Preski, 635 Pa. 220, 134 A.3d 1027, 1031 (2016). Because discipline \u201cis imposed on a case-by-case basis, we must consider the totality of facts presented, including any aggravating or mitigating factors.\u201d Id. However, even though each attorney disciplinary matter must be resolved according to its unique facts and circumstances, our Court nevertheless endeavors to maintain consistency in disciplinary matters \u201cso that similar misconduct is not punished in radically different ways.\u201d Id. (quoting Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Lucarini, 504 Pa. 271, 472 A.2d 186, 190 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b870-8\" pgmap=\"870(120) 871(9)\"> Under our Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, an attorney\u2019s criminal conviction furnishes a basis for the imposition of discipline. Pa.R.D.E. 203(b)(1). However, our Court has not adopted a per se rule that requires automatic disbarment for every instance of attorney misconduct which results in a criminal conviction. In re Melograne, 585 Pa. 357, 888 A.2d 753, 757 (2005). Instead, in determining the proper measure of discipline, which is not intended to be punitive in nature, we consider whether the discipline imposed will fulfill the primary purpose of the disciplinary process, which is the protection of the public, the preservation of the integrity of the courts, and the deterrence of unethical conduct. Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Czmus, 586 Pa. 22, 889 A.2d 1197, 1203 (2005).</p> <p id=\"b871-5\" pgmap=\"871\"> Pozonsky\u2019s first and central claim is that disbarment is not the appropriate sanction for his conduct, and he requests the imposition of a retroactive suspension \u201cfor an appropriate period.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s Brief at 30. Principally, Po-zonsky claims that his disbarment is not warranted in light of the mitigation evidence which he presented, focusing primarily on what he characterizes as the \u201coverwhelming\u201d character evidence introduced through the numerous letters submitted on his behalf. Id. at 23. Pozonsky contends that this character evidence, when considered in conjunction with other mitigating factors such as his lack of prior discipline, and his record of community and public service, which he maintains is more significant than that which was presented in Eilberg and Preate, establishes that he is not wholly unfit to practice law, and, thus, should not be disbarred.</p> <p id=\"b871-6\" pgmap=\"871\">ODC counters by emphasizing that criminal conduct by a judicial official warrants the sanction of disbarment because a judge plays such an integral role in the process of the administration of justice that misbehavior while acting in a judicial capacity negatively reflects on his or her qualifications to practice law. ODC also highlights that, even in Nocella, a case where an attorney committed election law violations associated with running for election to judicial office, our Court imposed the sanction of disbarment, despite the Board\u2019s recommendation of a suspension due to weighty mitigating factors. See ODC Brief at 7 (enumerating Nocella\u2019s litany of mitigating circumstances, including his wife\u2019s sudden affliction with paraplegia and blindness necessitating that he become her primary caregiver, his daughters\u2019 resultant .development of psychiatric and physical problems, his father\u2019s placement in hospice care, and his mother\u2019s diagnosis of breast cancer): ODC avers that Pozonsky presented no mitigation evidence of equivalent magnitude.</p> <p id=\"b871-9\" pgmap=\"871\">ODC also contrasts the circumstances of Larsen with the present matter, noting that our Court ordered disbarment in that case, disregarding the recommendation of the Disciplinary Board that he receive a three-year suspension, for Larsen\u2019s act of obtaining prescription drugs from his physician to treat his medical condition by having them prescribed to others in an effort to protect his privacy. ODC stresses that Pozonsky, on the other hand, had no legitimate claim to use. the cocaine which he stole, and that he additionally knew he was breaking the law at\u2019the time he took it. Thus, ODC characterizes Pozonsky\u2019s act of breaking the law as being solely motivated by his desire to use cocaine.</p> <p id=\"b871-10\" pgmap=\"871(47) 872(79)\"> It is well settled that, when an attorney holds a judicial or other public office, misconduct that he or she engages in which compromises the proper function of that office requires this Court to strongly consider disbarment as an appropriate disciplinary action. Melograne, 888 A.2d at 757. Misconduct of a lawyer \u201cacting in an official capacity as a judge may constitute grounds for disbarment because untrust-worthiness or. infidelity in one office shows-untrustworthiness or infidelity in the other.\u201d Id. at 756; see also Rule of Professional Conduct -8.4, comment (\u201cLawyers holding public office assume legal responsibilities. going beyond those of .qther citizens. A lawyer\u2019s abuse of public office can suggest an inability to fulfill the .professional role of lawyers.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b872-4\" pgmap=\"872\">Upon review, we find Pozonsky\u2019s grievous conduct far outweighs the mitigation evidence he offered. As a commissioned judge of the Cpurt of Common Pleas of Washington County, Pozonsky swore an oath to the people of the Commonwealth that he would discharge the duties of his office \u201cwith fidelity,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The most sacrosanct of his many duties was to obey the Constitution and the laws of this Commonwealth. Instead of adhering to his oath and faithfully upholding the law, however, Pozonsky flouted this paramount duty and used both the great powers of his judicial office, and the processes of the criminal justice system itself, to perpetrate serious drug-related crimes.</p> <p id=\"b872-5\" pgmap=\"872\">For over a year, Pozonsky willfully exploited his position as a judge to effectuate the theft of cocaine that was the principal evidence in criminal or delinquency hearings held in his courtroom by ordering law enforcement and court personnel to bring that cocaine to a repository under his control so that he could easily and secretively plunder it at will-. As the deputy attorney general who prosecuted this case noted, Pozonsky \u201cturned the courthouse or courtroom into his stash house, and, basically made law enforcement his private suppliers of cocaine.\u201d N.T. Sentencing Hearing, 7/13/15, at 5 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 4 to Disciplinary Board Hearing, 3/15/2016). This shocking and willful abuse of his office demonstrates Pozonsky\u2019s contemptuous disrespect for the very rule of law itself.</p> <p id=\"b872-8\" pgmap=\"872\">The opprobrious nature of Pozonsky\u2019s behavior was compounded by the fact that he was the sole jurist responsible for the operation and administration of Washington County\u2019s Drug Court program, which, paradoxically, he founded and implemented. That responsibility required Pozonsky, in. conjunction with other professionals who treat and supervise drug offenders, to make a careful assessment of defendants who were accused of crimes related to their drug use or dependency, and to tailor an appropriate sentence which incorporated an appropriate therapeutic regimen to help them overcome their substance abuse problems. The linchpin of this evaluation and sentencing process is the capacity of the jurist to undertake an honest assessment of the depth of a defendant\u2019s drug addiction and make a reasoned determination of what rehabilitative and supervisory measures are necessary to assist the defendant in the recovery process, and to protect society from further criminal activity. However, .Pozonsky\u2019s ongoing theft and. use of illegal drugs, while simultaneously publicly pretending to honestly and conscientiously devise appropriate sentencing and treatment plans for those appearing before him, seriously damaged the integrity of this process, rendering it, in essence, a sham and a farce.</p> <p id=\"b872-9\" pgmap=\"872(60) 873(246)\">Pozonsky, through his arrant criminal behavior, also seriously transgressed the essential duty of a judge to conduct himself or herself \u201cin a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d Code of Judicial. Conduct 1.2. In our democratic society, public confidence in the judiciary is the cornerstone of the people\u2019s regard for the legitimacy of its decisions, and a high degree of public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process is therefore essential to ensure that court decisions -will be respected by the people. See In re Franciscus, 471 Pa. 53, 369 A.2d 1190, 1194 (1977) (\u201cIf the judicial system of this Commonwealth fails to maintain a high standard of professional ethics and propriety, then we can expect little faith and confidence to be plac\u00e9d in our proceedings by the members of the practicing bar or the public\u201d). When a judge\u2019s actions undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the honesty of the judiciary,' it is not only that institution which suffers; indeed, our entire system of government, which depends upon the people\u2019s respect for the law, is damaged. See In re Bruno, 627 Pa. 505, 101 A.3d 635, 675-76 (2014) (quoting Summers v. Kramer, 271 Pa. 189, 114 A. 525, 527 (1921) (\u201cUnder\" our system of government by law, the business of the court should [ ] always be so conducted as to command the respect of the people [Tjhese requirements are almost or quite\u2019as essential-as the judicial system itself, if the stability of the government, under that system, is to be maintained.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted)); Preski, 134 A.3d at 1033 (\u201cPublic trust is an indispensable prerequisite to the effective administration of government. When a public official violates that trust, he or she undermines the integrity of the entire system.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b873-5\" pgmap=\"873\">As the Hearing Committee and the Board both recognized, Pozonsky\u2019s conduct was of such an egregious nature that it could not help but severely diminish the public\u2019s confidence in our judiciary as an institution whose members scrupulously adhere to their sacred duty to ensure that the Constitution 'and the laws of this Commonwealth are faithfully applied. At- the time he was committing his crimes, Pozon-sky had served in the judicial system for 26-years, 14 years as a magisterial district judge and then 12 years as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and, therefore, he should have been keenly aware of his obligation to maintain the public\u2019s confidence in the judicial system and the rule of law, as well as the incontrovertible fact that his actions would serve to -betray that confidence. \"</p> <p id=\"b873-7\" pgmap=\"873\">This impact on the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the judicial system must be accorded significant weight in evaluating Pozonsky\u2019s fitness to practice law. The public must be assured that ah attorney licensed by our Court has the utmost respect for the public institutions which serve them and which' they support through their tax dollars. The public must also have utter confidence that an attorney, when' practicing law, will strive to have these \"institutions function as they were intended, so as to advance not only their individual interests, but also the general\" welfare. When an attorney holding public office has shown Pozonsky\u2019s extraordinary level of disrespect for the .integrity \"of the judicial\u2019\"and legal systems, and the rule of law, the public cannot have any confidence that he is fit to represent their interests and carry out the duties of the legal profession. We, therefore, conclude that Pozonsky\u2019s wanton disregard for'the law, the judicial system, and the public, while holding judicial office, is, as the Hearing \"Committee and .the Board found, a compelling aggravating factor warranting his disbarment.</p> <p id=\"b873-8\" pgmap=\"873(60) 874(102)\">The mitigating factors cited by Pozon-sky \u2014 his lack .of prior disciplinary history and community service; his expressions of remorse; the contention that none of the cases before him were affected by his crimes; the. numerous character letters presented at his criminal sentencing hearing, as well as our recognition of Pozon-sky\u2019s establishment of the Drug Court program and its positive effects on individuals\u2019 lives who successfully completed treatment in that program \u2014 must, of course, be taken into account.by our Court as they were by the lower tribunals. Moreover, we take notice of Pozonsky\u2019s commendable efforts to address his addiction during the pen-dency of his criminal and disciplinary proceedings, as well as his current plans to assist others afflicted, with similar substance abuse addictions as a certified recovery specialist. However, we find these factors, though laudatory, simply do not outweigh the momentous gravity of Pozon-sky\u2019s use of his judicial office to commit crimes.</p> <p id=\"b874-4\" pgmap=\"874\">Specifically regarding. Pozonsky\u2019s contention that none of the cases before him were affected by his conduct, it is precisely because he used his position as a judge to perpetrate his crimes, and then chose to continue to preside over the cases of the people being prosecuted for possessing and using the very drugs he, in turn, stole, that we accord it little significance. See Rule of Judicial Conduct 2.3 (\u201cA judge shall perform the duties of judicial office ... without bias or prejudice.\u201d). Likewise, while Pozonsky deserves much credit for establishing the Drug Court program in Washington County, as the jurist in charge of that program, he was uniquely situated to appreciate the connection between drug use and criminal behavior and, thus, he, more than most, should have recognized the harm his conduct' would cause.' Yet, rather than seek treatment for himself, as he ordered for the participants in the program, he elected to steal drug evidence and abuse it. In making this choice, he made a mockery of the very principles on which the program was founded, and severely undermined its efficacy and legitimacy in the eyes of the public, thereby undermining the objectives that he sought to accomplish- with its founding. Having personally tarnished the impact of his pri- or good works in starting and implementing this program, we reject Pozonsky\u2019s status as its founder as mitigation.</p> <p id=\"b874-6\" pgmap=\"874\">Our Court has not hesitated to disbar attorneys when they have engaged in gross misconduct subverting the fair administration of justice, despite the presence of significant competent mitigating evidence, because of our recognition that this type of misconduct is of such corrupting magnitude that it is inimical to the proper functioning of our judicial system. In Cappuccio, we ordered the disbarment of an attorney who, while a chief county deputy district attorney, furnished alcohol and marijuana to minors, and had sexual relations with one of them on 12 separate occasions. We did so even though the attorney presented expert psychological testimony that he suffered from an adjustment disorder and sexual identity difficulties, as well as. other evidence as to his good reputation, his expressions of remorse, and his rehabilitative efforts after his misconduct. While acknowledging -this mitigation evidence, we discounted its impact on the appropriate discipline, particularly since the expert testimony did not meet the Braun standard. Further, even though the attorney had presented additional -mitigating evidence such as a lack of prior disciplinary history, cooperation, acceptance of responsibility, expressions of remorse, and intensive counseling to address psycholog-. ical problems, we nevertheless found the fact that the attorney\u2019s status as a public official enabled him to commit his crimes far eclipsed these mitigating factors and necessitated his disbarment:</p> <blockquote id=\"b874-7\" pgmap=\"874(37) 875(69)\">Respondent\u2019s position as a Chief Deputy District. Attorney aggravates the misconduct, particularly in light of the facts here. At the time Respondent was engaging in his ongoing criminal conduct by endangering the welfare of minors and corrupting the morals, his public persona was that of a law enforcement figure in the county, prosecuting members of the public for similar crimes. In our view, any sanction short of disbarment in these circumstances threatens the integrity of the legal system; undermines our very serious duty to protect the public, and fails to give appropriate weight to Respondent\u2019s status as a public official.</blockquote> <p id=\"b875-4\" pgmap=\"875\">Cappuccio, 48 A.3d at 1241.</p> <p id=\"b875-5\" pgmap=\"875\">In Czmus, our Court disbarred an attorney who willfully concealed the fact that he had previously worked as a physician and committed acts of serious malpractice which led to his medical license revocation, as well as falsified his work history on his applications to the bar of both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. We did so despite his introduction of Braun mitigation evidence showing that he suffered from psychiatric disorders which were causally related to this misconduct, and character references from practicing attorneys. We determined that such fraudulent conduct subverted the truth-determining process of the Board of Law 'Examiners by interfering with its ability to accurately determine if he possessed the character and fitness required to practice law. We considered this conduct to be so egregious that it warranted disbarment \u201cto protect the integrity of the profession and judicial tribunals.\u201d Czmus, 889 A.2d at 1203-04.</p> <p id=\"b875-6\" pgmap=\"875\">In In the Matter of Renfroe, we ordered the disbarment of an attorney because of his conviction for bribery of a witness, despite expert testimony that his \u201clong term and \u2018severe\u2019 drug addiction caused his professional misconduct and criminal behavior,\u201d 695 A.2d at 402, and evidence that he had undertaken significant rehabilitation efforts to address this addiction after his release from prison. We did so because the attorney\u2019s actions had undermined the ability of the judicial system to fairly render decisions; '</p> <blockquote id=\"AIgg\" pgmap=\"875\">Fair adjudication is predicated upon the ability of courts to arrive at the truth.\u2019It is further predicated upon the confidence that courts will make their decisions based on that truth. If instead, courts are foreclosed from arriving at the truth because attorneys subvert the truth determining process, then justice cannot be administered.</blockquote> <p id=\"b875-10\" pgmap=\"875\">Id. at 404.</p> <p id=\"b875-11\" pgmap=\"875\">The imposition of the sanction of disbarment in this matter is further supported by our decision in In re Melograne, which involved the disbarment -of a judge who also used his office to' commit serious crimes which undermined the integrity of the judicial system. Attorney Melograne, who was a magisterial district judge,- conspired with employees of the Allegheny County Court of Common.Pleas to fix the outcome of cases in exchange for bribes. Our Court did not hesitate to disbar him, given that such reprehensible conduct \u201cstruck at the very core of the judicial system.\u201d Melograne, 888 A.2d at 757. We took such action despite considerable mitigating evidence as to his prior lack of discipline, the completion of his criminal sentence, and letters from distinguished members of the legal profession recommending that he be permitted to practice law.</p> <p id=\"b875-12\" pgmap=\"875\">Herein, Pozonsky\u2019s criminal conduct, like the conduct of the attorneys in these cases, corrupted the most basic tenets and principles on which our judicial system is founded, and sabotaged its fundamental adjudicatory processes. The mitigation evidence in this case offered by Pozonsky is far outweighed by this aggravating factor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b876-3\" pgmap=\"876\"> We next turn to Pozonsky\u2019s argument that the Hearing Committee erred by disregarding the evidence he presented which he claims established a causal connection between his drug addiction and his crimes. As examples of such evidence,-Po-zonsky quotes three letters written by attorneys and submitted on his behalf at the time of his sentencing in his criminal prosecution:</p> <blockquote id=\"b876-4\" pgmap=\"876\">I would like to state that I do not condone or excuse Paul\u2019s actions. However, I do know that the crimes Paul committed are a direct result of this disease and addiction and Paul not taking care of himself before all else. I do know first and foremost that this disease can take away our humanity, our ability to think and do the right thing, and, most of all take away everything we love and cherish.

Pozonsky maintains that all of these letters demonstrate that his criminal actions were the result of his addiction and contrary to his character.</p> <p id=\"b877-4\" pgmap=\"877\">ODC.responds that the Hearing Com-\u2019 mittee properly recognized that Pozonsky had the burden of proving a causal connection between his addiction and his misconduct pursuant to Braun. However, ODC points out that Pozonsky himself admitted he was not addicted to cocaine at the time he began stealing from the evidence locker, and he \u201cprovided no evidence either through his own testimony or in the evidence from any of those who treated him, that there was any connection between an addiction and his willful violation of the criminal law.\u201d ODC Brief at 8. Thus, ODC asserts that Pozonsky is not entitled to mitigation on this basis.</p> <p id=\"b877-5\" pgmap=\"877\">In evaluating this.claim, we briefly review the standards our Court utilizes in determining whether evidence of a psychological or substance abuse problem constitutes mitigating evidence in a disciplinary proceeding. The seminal case in this area is Braun, wherein an attorney stole money from a client\u2019s estate which resulted in disciplinary proceedings. The attorney underwent an examin\u00e1tion by a licensed psychiatrist who diagnosed him with neurotic depression. At his disciplinary hearing, the attorney presented the testimony of that' psychiatrist as well as another who had treated him years earlier for the same condition. The Board found that the attorney\u2019s psychiatric condition was a factor in causing his misconduct.</p> <p id=\"b877-6\" pgmap=\"877\">After review of the evidence, our Court adopted the recommendation of the Board based on-our conclusion that the expert psychiatric evidence supported the Board\u2019s finding that the attorney\u2019s neurotic condition \u201cwas a causal factor in producing the several elements of his professional misconduct,\u201d and, thus, was properly considered by the B oard as a 'mitigating factor in recommending a suspension, rather than recommending disbarment. Braun, 553 A.2d at 895.</p> <p id=\"b877-8\" pgmap=\"877\"> In Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Monsour, 549 Pa. 482, 701 A.2d 556 (1997), our Court ruled that an attorney who was seeking mitigation from disbarment on the .basis of his alcoholism was required under Braun to \u201cestablish by clear, and convincing evidence that alcoholism was a causal factor in his misconduct.\u201d Id. at 559. Likewise, an attorney .seeking mitigation under Braun f\u00f3r a mental illness must prove causation by clear and convincing evidence. Office of Disciplinary Conduct v. Quigley, 161 A.3d 800, 808 (Pa. 2017).</p> <p id=\"b877-9\" pgmap=\"877\">Our Court has never held that lay opinions alone, are sufficient to establish that 'an addiction or mental illness was the cause of an attorney\u2019s misconduct. Indeed, recent decisions of our Court have emphasized the critical role of exp\u00e9rt testimony in establishing such a causal link. See Czmus, 889 A.2d at 1203 (\u201cThe Disciplinary Board may consider as potential mitigation an expert\u2019s opinion establishing \u00e1 causal connection between the misconduct and an underlying mental infirmity.\u201d); Cappuccio, 48 A.3d at 1241 (refusing to consider attorney\u2019s psychiatric condition as causing the attorney\u2019s misconduct since he \u201cdid not present expert testimony meeting the Braun standard\u201d for mitigation).</p> <p id=\"b877-10\" pgmap=\"877(51) 878(138)\">As Disciplinary Counsel highlights, Po-zonsky presented no expert testimony to the Disciplinary Board establishing that he had an addiction to cocaine, or any other psychiatric disorder, which caused him to engage in his thefts and personal use of drug evidence. In a treatment \u201cProgress Report\u201d written by Counselor Stamm, who treated Pozonsky in Alaska after he had committed his crimes, she made a general diagnosis that, at the time she was treating him, Pozonsky had a prior cocaine addiction. However, nowhere therein did she express any opinion that Pozonsky\u2019s addiction caused him to engage in the criminal behavior for which he was being disciplined. See Progress Report, Disciplinaiy Board Hearing, 3/15/2016 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 72). Similarly, the letters from counselors Grealish and Ferri, who also treated Pozonsky, did' not express any opinion that Pozonsky\u2019s cocaine addiction caused him to commit his crimes. In sum, because these letters did not establish a causal connection between Pozonsky\u2019s addiction to cocaine and his prior criminal acts, they did not meet the Braun standard, and, thus, they are not a competent basis to mitigate Pozonsky\u2019s discipline. Czmus-, Cappuccio.</p> <p id=\"b878-4\" pgmap=\"878\">In the letters from attorneys and friends submitted to the trial court at the time of Pozonsky\u2019s sentencing, the writers expressed their own personal opinions that Pozonsky\u2019s criminal acts were the result of his cocaine addiction because his actions were out of character. However, our Court has never endorsed the novel conclusion that letters from an attorney\u2019s personal friends or other attorneys, who are untrained in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, or substance abuse treatment, are in and of themselves, sufficient to meet the Braun standard. To the contrary, this Court has always relied on expert testimony under Braun to establish that a psychiatric condition or addiction caused the misconduct for which an attorney is being disciplined. Consequently, we will not draw the inference that Pozonsky\u2019s addiction to cocaine was the causal factor in his criminal conduct based solely on the bald, con-clusory opinions provided by attorney acquaintances and friends who, though well meaning, are nevertheless manifestly unqualified to render such a professional opinion.</p> <p id=\"b878-6\" pgmap=\"878\">Moreover, and importantly, drawing such an inference in this instance is particularly inappropriate because Pozonsky himself disclaimed during his disciplinary hearing that he was addicted when he began to steal drugs from the evidence locker, and he did not claim that any of his subsequent thefts of cocaine were caused by an addiction. In'response to the question of whether he was addicted to cocaine at the time he began his thefts, Pozonsky answered, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was.\u201d N.T. Disciplinary Hearing, 3/15/16, at 53. We interpret this statement, made with hindsight and years after the events in question, as a straightforward disavowal that addiction was the motivating factor which caused him to begin stealing the cocaine. Additionally, Pozonsky admitted that he knew he was committing a theft of\u2019 evidence at the time, indicating he was not laboring under any misapprehension as to the criminal nature of his conduct because of an addiction. Id. Pozonsky\u2019s own concessions resolve the question of causation.</p> <p id=\"b878-7\" pgmap=\"878\">III. Conclusion</p> <p id=\"b878-8\" pgmap=\"878(122) 879(23)\">In this matter, we find no basis to impose a sanction other than disbarment. There are few transgressions which more seriously undermine the public\u2019s confidence and trust in the integrity of their judicial system, and which are as offensive to the high standards and principles which other members of the bench and bar strive so faithfully to uphold in the performance of their duties, than those committed by Pozonsky. His conduct as a judge has demonstrated his unfitness for the practice of law, and only the sanction of disbarment\u2014 the most severe condemnation available to us \u2014 can fulfill our Court\u2019s duty to protect the public, as well as vindicate the compelling interest other members of the bench and bar have in ensuring that their -peers maintain the public\u2019s respect and confidence in the legal profession through honorable conduct.</p> <p id=\"b879-4\" pgmap=\"879\">We order that Pozonsky be disbarred from the practice of law in this Commonwealth.

In the Matter of Renfroe, 548 Pa. 101, 695 A.2d 401, 403 (1997). By contrast, an attorney who is disbarred has no expectation of the right to resume practice, and, to obtain reinstatement at the end of the five-year period, he or she must instead show that the magnitude of the breach of trust which resulted in his or her disbarm\u00e9nt \u201cwould permit the resumption of practice without a detrimental effect upon the integrity and standing of the bar or the administration of justice nor subversive of the public interest.\u201d Office of Disciplinary Counsel v.

Neither Preate nor Eilberg, relied on by Po-zonsky, compels a different result. In Preate, a majority of our Court, over two dissents, suspended Ernest Preate, the former Attorney General of Pennsylvania, for five years. Attorney General Preate accepted nearly $20,000 in campaign contributions from video pokef machine operators while a district attorney of Lackawanna County and as Attorney General, and then failed to disclose them on his campaign finance reports. In Eilberg, Joshua Eil-berg was a Congressman who was also a partner in a law firm. On behalf of a client, his partners directly lobbied another member of Congress to intervene on a matter being handled by a federal agency, Although Eilberg did not himself participate in these, lobbying activities, he, nevertheless, received a check from his partners for a share of the fees paid by the client for his partners' efforts, which was a violation of federal law. He, like Preate, received a five-year- suspension, These cases therefore differ from the instant matter in one critical.aspect: the degree of severity of the attorney misconduct. That is,\u2019 unlike Pozon-sky, neither Preate nor Eilberg directly used the powers of their public offices in order to commit their crimes.</p> </footnote> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b879-7\" pgmap=\"879\">JUSTICE BAER,</author> <p id=\"AE0W\" pgmap=\"879\">Concurring</p> <p id=\"b879-8\" pgmap=\"879\">Without hesitation, the majority imposes the most severe sanction of disbarment, concluding that \u201c[tjhere are few transgressions which more seriously undermine the public\u2019s confidence and trust in the integrity of their judicial system, and which are as offensive to the high standards and principles which other members of the bench and bar strive so faithfully to uphold in the performance of their duties, than those committed by [Respondent, Former Judge Paul Michael Pozonsky].\u201d Op. at 846. While I in no way condone the actions of Respondent, who founded and supervised Washington County\u2019s Drug Court and subsequently stole cocaine from the courtroom\u2019s evidence locker for his personal use, I find this disciplinary case much more challenging to resolve.</p> <p id=\"b879-9\" pgmap=\"879\">My difficulty lies in Respondent\u2019s decision not to present mitigation .evidence in the form of a mental health expert to establish the causal connection between what I perceive to be his drug addiction and his misconduct. See Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Braun, 520 Pa. 157, 553 A.2d 894, 895-96 (1989) (requiring evidence of a causal connection between the psychiatric disorder and the attorney\u2019s misconduct to establish mental health mitigation evidence in a disciplinary case). As-a result of this omission, neither the lower tribunals nor the majority opinion considered Respondent\u2019s cocaine addiction as a mitigating factor. Interpretation of the governing precedent of this Court compels me to join the majority\u2019s conclusion that to prove legally cognizable mental health mitigation evidence in a disciplinary case, a respondent must present a mental health expert to establish the causal link between the attorney\u2019s mental disability and his misconduct. Considering,' as I believe I must, this evidentiary vacuum, I am constrained to agree with the majority that the delicate weighing of Respondent\u2019s transgressions against the other substantial evidence of mitigation, tips'the' scalds towards imposition of the sanction of disbarment.</p> <p id=\"b879-11\" pgmap=\"879(164) 880(168)\">Initially, I find it imperative to dispel any notion that there is a per- se rule requiring disbarment when a judicial officer is convicted of a crime. See Report and Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board, 12/21/2016, at 11 (stating that \u201c[p]rior similar cases support, the conclusion that. criminal conduct by a judicial officer warrants .disbarment\u201d). Instead,- it is well-settled that because this Court imposes attorney discipline on a case-by-case basis, we must consider the totality of the facts presented, including both aggravating and mitigating factors, Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Quigley, 161 A.3d 800, 807 (Pa. 2017), rather than dispensing disciplinary sanctions by per se rule. An attorney\u2019s position as an elected judicial officer does not alter this Court\u2019s individual assessment of all circumstances surrounding the attorney\u2019s criminal conviction. \u2018Moreover, application of a per se disbarment rule would eliminate the critical -inquiry of whether the criminal conviction renders the particular judicial officer unfit to practice law. See Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Cappuccio, 616 Pa. 439, 48 A.3d 1231, 1238-39 (2012) (holding that \u201cthe primary function of the attorney disciplinary system is not punitive in nature, but is to determine the fitness of an attorney to continue the practice of law and maintain the integrity of the legal system[;]\u201d the objective is to protect the public and the courts from attorneys who are unfit to practice law). Accordingly, while this Court strives for consistency in disciplinary sanctions so that sanctions for similar misconduct are not imposed in \u201cradically different ways,\u201d Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Preski, 635 Pa. 220, 134 A.3d 1027, 1031 (2016) (citing Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Lucarini, 504 Pa. 271, 472 A.2d 186, 190 (1983)), disciplinary cases are fact-intensive and each case, regardless of the nature of the position held by the attorney, must be examined independently with consideration being given- to the misconduct and the unique aggravating and mitigating factors.</p> <p id=\"b880-3\" pgmap=\"880\">That being said, I agree that an attorney\u2019s position as a public officer serves as an aggravating, but not dispositive, factor in a disciplinary matter. See Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Cappuccio, 48 A.3d at 1240 (holding that \u201cthe fact that a lawyer holds a public office, or serves in a public capacity, as- here, is a factor that properly may be viewed as aggravating the misconduct in an attorney disciplinary matter\u201d); In re Melograne, 585 Pa. 357, 888 A.2d 753, 756 (2005) (holding that \u201cthe judge\u2019s role is so intimate a part of the process of justice that misbehavior as a judge must inevitably reflect upon -qualification for membership at the bar\u201d). Consistent with this jurisprudence, I agree with the majority\u2019s determination that Respondent\u2019s criminal conduct is aggravated by the fact that he was serving as a common pleas court judge when the illegal acts took place. In addition, Respondent\u2019s commission of the criminal conduct while serving as a member of the judiciary undoubtedly established a serious-violation of the public trust as he was sitting in judgment of individuals wlio were committing drug offenses, while he, himself, was engaging in similar conduct. This specific criminal behavior would warrant the most severe sanction of disbarment in the absence of significant mitigation evidence.</p> <p id=\"b880-5\" pgmap=\"880\">It cannot be ignored, however, that Respondent presented extensive evidence of mitigation including his current recovery from his cocaine addiction and the detailed efforts he has made to rebuild his life, including the performance of community service for organizations such as the Washington-City Mission (a homeless shelter), the Sunlight Club (a recovery house that hosts drug and alcohol meetings), the Washington County Drug and Alcohol Commission, and Zero Six Eight (an organization assisting former- convicts in starting new businesses). Further, Respondent submitted sixty-eight character witness letters from family members, friends, and pastors; individuals who had worked with him such as former law clerks, secretaries, and court administrators; individuals who had practiced before him including assistant district attorneys, members of law enforcement, and private attorneys; and individuals- who had completed successfully the drug treatment court program that Respondent had administered. See Respondent\u2019s Exhibits 1-69. These letters established \u25a0 that Respondent had served the people of his district with distinction both as a-magisterial district judge and a common pleas court judge, highlighting his administration of the first drug court program in Washington County. Rer spondent further submitted evidence establishing that none of his criminal behavior affected the -outcome of any case. See. Respondent\u2019s Exhibits 73 and 74.</p> <p id=\"b881-4\" pgmap=\"881\">Considering this evidentiary record, I find it ironic that the therapeutic justice that Respondent dispensed to the numerous drug-addicted criminal defendants that came before him, many of whom he led to the path of recovery, is not so readily available to him in this disciplinary matter, particularly considering that his misconduct involved the theft of the very drug to which he was addicted. Respondent\u2019s failure to present the requisite expert testimony establishing the causal connection between his addiction and criminal conduct may have arisen from an inability to comprehend the gravity of his disability, as occurs with many individuals struggling with addiction. For example, when asked directly at the disciplinary hearing whether he was addicted to cocaine at the time he began taking the drugs from the evidence locker, Respondent stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was.\u201d Notes of Testimony, 3/15/2016, at 53. Contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation of this statement as a \u201cstraightforward disavowal that addiction was the motivating factor which caused him to begin stealing the cocaine,\u201d Majority Opinion at 846, when examined in the context of Respondent\u2019s testimony as a whole, as well as the evidence of his subsequent treatment and recovery from addiction, I find that this statement merely reflects that Respondent did not realize he had an addiction problem when his misconduct began.</p> <p id=\"b881-5\" pgmap=\"881\">I view as more probative than Respondent\u2019s clouded personal assessment, the testimonials of those people closest to him, who.observed the obvious nexus- between Respondent\u2019s cocaine dependency, and his theft of the cocaine. See e.g. Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 5 (statement of Shawn M. Stevenson, Esquire, opining that \u201cthe crimes [Respondent] committed are a direct result of this disease of addiction\u201d); Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 7 (statement of Joseph H. Fox, Esquire, indicating that \u201c[w]e know that addiction crosses all age,.gender and socioeconomic lines and Judge Pozonsky simply fell victim to a condition which he was, at the time, unable .to control\u201d); Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 33 (statement of Victor M, DiBattista, Esquire, opining that Respondent\u2019s - criminal behavior was \u201ccompletely out of character\u201d and that Respondent had \u201csuccumbed to the same evil from which he sought to protect others\u201d); Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 34 (statement of family friend, Michael E. DeSimone, indicating that Respondent\u2019s criminal behavior was out of character and resulted from his addiction); Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 38 (statement of Bob Brady, Esquire, indicating that Respondent\u2019s addiction was an illness, not a behavior born in criminality, which led to his misconduct); Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 41 (statement of friend,. David Valli-na, indicating that Respondent\u2019s criminal conduct was \u201ca direct result of a disease, a sickness, from which he is currently recuperating\u201d); Respondent's Exhibit 48 (statement of friends, David and Mona Ma-talik, indicating that \u201c[i]t is unfortunate that [Respondent\u2019s] personal troubles with addiction led to the termination of the good he was doing for others\u201d); and Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 58 (statement of Kenneth J. Horoho, Jr., Esquire, indicating that Respondent\u2019s criminal behavior was an aberration caused by an addiction that Respondent has proactively addressed and corrected). -</p> <p id=\"b881-7\" pgmap=\"881(74) 882(49)\">Indeed, Respondent presented medical evidence- of his addiction through a progress report prepared by licensed professional counselor Deborah E. Stamm, who had \u25a0 treated Respondent after the criminal acts had been committed. See Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 72 (indicating a general diagnosis that Respondent had a cocaine dependency that was in sustained partial remission). In my view, this testimony came just shy of satisfying the Braun' standard as it established Respondent\u2019s cocaine addiction and the misconduct at issue involved the theft of that particular drug. Neither Counselor Stamm, nor the other two counselors who treated Respondent for his addiction and submitted correspondence on his behalf, however, rendered the medical conclusion that Respondent\u2019s addiction caused his criminal behavior.</p> <p id=\"b882-4\" pgmap=\"882\">Accordingly, notwithstanding the probative nature of the various testimonials in support of Respondent, after much thought, as stated, I must agree with the majority that mental health expert testimony'is necessary to establish the requisite causal connection between Respondent\u2019s mental disability of addiction and his transgressions. If we were to hold otherwise, our. disciplinary system could be compromised by the myriad of distinct and novel scenarios, which attorn\u00e9ys could parade, without medical foundation, as mental health mitigation evidence to mitigate the severity of their disciplinary violations.</p> <p id=\"b882-5\" pgmap=\"882\">In summary, I conclude that, through his own misconduct, Respondent has lost everything he once had. Had persuasive Braun evidence been presented linking his cocaine addiction to his misdeeds, perhaps the lower tribunals or even the majority would have opted for the maximum suspension of five years, rather than disbarment. Personally, I believe that Respondent\u2019s ultimate triumph over his addiction and his contributions to the Drug Court and to the various community organizations he served are worthy of something. However, that value does not tip the scale away from imposition of disbarment, absent appropriate Braun evidence.</p> <p id=\"b882-6\" pgmap=\"882\">Justice Donohue joins this concurring opinion.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
