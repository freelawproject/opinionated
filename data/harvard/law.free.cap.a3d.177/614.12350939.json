Korrey is hereby suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia for a period of three months, stayed in favor of a six-month period of probation. To the extent respondent attempts to challenge the imposition of reciprocal discipline by relit-igating the discipline imposed by the State of Nevada, such a challenge is improper in reciprocal disciplinary proceedings, see In re Zdravkovich, 831 A.2d 964, 969 (D.C. 2003) (\u201cPut simply, reciprocal discipline proceedings are not a forum to reargue the foreign discipline\u201d). Further, many of respondent\u2019s due \u2018 process arguments are based on Nevada law and have been re- . solved by the Nevada Supreme Court and this court will not review that court\u2019s interpretation of its own law. See In re Williams, 3 A.3d 1179 (D.C. 2010).</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
