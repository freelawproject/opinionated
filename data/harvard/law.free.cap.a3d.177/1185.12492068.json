The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in (1) denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence and (2) denying his motion to allow an expert witness to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 14, 1996, the defendant shot and killed Terri Horeglad, who was a passenger in a car that had stopped at the intersection of Fairfield and Iranistan Avenues in Bridgeport. The defendant was twenty years old at the time. He subsequently was arrested, charged and, following a jury trial, convicted of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. On September 19, 1997, the trial court sentenced the defendant to fifty years imprisonment. On October 21, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence.

The defendant claimed that his sentence had been imposed in an illegal manner because the sentencing judge did not grant him a competency hearing to determine whether he could stand trial and aid in his own defense. Seeking to introduce the testimony of a psychologist relevant to his mental state at the time of the crime, he also filed a motion to allow an expert to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After argument on May 25, 2016, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Devlin, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence on the basis that\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Graham,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   apply only to individuals who were under the age of eighteen at the time of the crime. The court then denied as moot the defendant's motion to allow the expert to testify. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to correct an illegal sentence on the ground that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and its progeny apply only to the sentencing of juveniles. The defendant does not dispute that, at least literally, the jurisprudence applies to juveniles. He claims, however, that the rationale underlying the cases is applicable equally to sentencing of adults whose mentalities at the time of the crime were similar to those of juveniles. He asserts that the trial court misconstrued his argument as relying on the precise holding of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   when it, in fact, was based on the \"brain science\" underlying that case. At oral argument before this court, the defendant clarified that he was claiming that his sentence was illegal because he was not afforded a competency hearing. He asserted that he was relying on\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   only to show that he should have been given a competency hearing because his mind had not fully developed at the time of the crime. The state contends that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and its progeny do not apply to the defendant because he was older than eighteen at the time of the crime. We agree with the state and note further that the trial court did not misconstrue the defendant's argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We begin with the relevant standard of review and legal principles. \"We review the [trial] court's denial of [a] defendant's motion to correct [an illegal] sentence under the abuse of discretion standard of review....

Few categories of claims qualify for consideration under that exception.

Our courts have determined that sentences of\n   <em>\n    juveniles\n   </em>\n   may qualify, in limited circumstances, if the vicissitudes of youth have not adequately been considered at sentencing. The line, however, has been brightly drawn at eighteen, and we are not free to ignore that bright line.

The defendant, in this case, did not set forth a colorable claim for relief. Consequently, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the defendant's motion to correct. Further, because the trial court lacked jurisdiction, it did not err in precluding the testimony of the defendant's expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The defendant also claims that the court erred in (3) precluding him from presenting his psychological evaluation report and a study on racial disparity as to sentencing, (4) failing to consider that he was a first-time felon and other mitigating factors, (5) failing to vacate his sentence on the ground that the same judge had presided over his probable cause hearing and his trial, and (6) failing to afford him his rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Our conclusions with respect to claims one and two are dispositive of claims three and six. Claims four and five are not properly before us because the defendant did not raise them in the trial court.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Boyd\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303921\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/707/#p757\">\n     295 Conn. 707\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 757-58,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=992%20A.2d%201071\">\n     992 A.2d 1071\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010), cert. denied,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5912852,5928215,6033563,5995690,6008114,12457415,12457416,12457417,12457418,12457419,12457420,12457421,5972558,12457422,12457424,12457425,12457426,12457427,12457428,12457423,6024281,6020963,6021867,5933038,5987313,6010358,5948408,6015357\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/1224/\">\n     562 U.S. 1224\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457322,12457323,12457423,12457424,12457425,12457426\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1474/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 1474\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457421,12457422,12457423,12457424,12457425,12457426,12457427,12457428\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/179/314/\">\n     179 L.Ed.2d 314\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011).

[t]he defendant also requests a competency hearing and a hearing/test to see if at [any time] was the defendant competent enough to stand trial and aid in his defense of this murder charge.\" He concluded that motion by stating, \"if you have two defendants who are both charged with the same murder and they both shot the victim to death. But one defendant was [eighteen] years old, and the other defendant is [seventeen] years old and both are sentenced to [sixty] years. How can you give one parole and the other no parole, when brain science supports the fact that neither defendant's brain's frontal lobe was not fully developed?\" At oral argument before this court, however, the defendant claimed that the lack of a competency hearing itself rendered his sentence illegal.
