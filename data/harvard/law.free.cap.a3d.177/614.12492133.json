Korrey is hereby suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia for a period of three months, stayed in favor of a six-month period of probation. To the extent respondent attempts to challenge the imposition of reciprocal discipline by relitigating the discipline imposed by the State of Nevada, such a challenge is improper in reciprocal disciplinary proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zdravkovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090555\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/964/#p969\">\n    831 A.2d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 969 (D.C. 2003) (\"Put simply, reciprocal discipline proceedings are not a forum to reargue the foreign discipline\"). Further, many of respondent's due process arguments are based on Nevada law and have been resolved by the Nevada Supreme Court and this court will not review that court's interpretation of its own law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290494\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/3/1179/\">\n    3 A.3d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 2010).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
