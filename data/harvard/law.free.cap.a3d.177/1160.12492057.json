App. 622</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491386\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/172/837/\">172 A.3d 837</extracted-citation> (2017), is granted, limited to the following issues:</p><p id=\"p-7\">\"1. Did the Appellate Court properly hold that (a) special defenses to a foreclosure action must 'directly attack' the making, validity, or enforcement of the note or mortgage, and (b) counterclaims in a foreclosure action must also satisfy the 'making, validity, or enforcement' requirement? See Practice Book \u00a7 10-10.</p><p id=\"p-8\">\"2. If the Appellate Court properly addressed the issues in the first question, did it properly hold that alleged postorigination misconduct concerns a plaintiff's 'enforcement' of a note or mortgage only if the plaintiff breaches a loan modification or other similar agreement that affects the enforceability of the note or mortgage?</p><p id=\"p-9\">\"3. If the Appellate Court properly addressed the issues in the first and second questions, did it properly hold that the defendants' allegations of the plaintiff's misconduct and breach relating to a 'received' 'immediate modification' did not amount to an allegation that the plaintiff had agreed to a 'final, binding loan modification' that affected the plaintiffs ability to enforce the note or mortgage?\"</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
