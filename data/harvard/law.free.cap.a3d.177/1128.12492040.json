The defendants, three groups of individuals and entities involved in the 2007 involuntary psychiatric hospitalization of the plaintiff, John Doe,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which reversed the trial court's rendering of summary judgment in their favor. They claim that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that (1) the requirement in \u00a7 52-593a(b) that a marshal shall endorse under oath on the return of service the date on which process was delivered to him or her, is directory, rather than mandatory, and (2) there existed a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the plaintiff had delivered the process to a marshal within the applicable limitation period. We conclude that \u00a7 52-593a(b)\n   does not preclude a plaintiff from proving timely delivery of process to the marshal by means other than the statutorily prescribed method. We further conclude that there existed a genuine issue of material fact as to whether timely delivery was made. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff was hospitalized involuntarily for psychiatric observation in May and June, 2007. Subsequent to his release, he brought this action against multiple individuals and entities, alleging various wrongful conduct in connection with the hospitalization and the events preceding it. The defendants named in the complaint include (1) a therapist who previously had treated the plaintiff and the therapist's employer (medical defendants), (2) the town of West Hartford, its chief of police and certain members of its police department in their official and individual capacities (town defendants), and (3) Hartford Hospital, the Institute of Living and various psychiatric professionals who were involved in the plaintiff's commitment and treatment (hospital defendants).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that the allegedly wrongful acts at issue occurred between May 22 and June 8, 2007, and that, for purposes of this appeal, a three year statute of limitations applied to the plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff's former counsel, A. Paul Spinella, finalized a complaint and executed a summons on May 19, 2010. The defendants were served with these documents by State Marshal John R. Griffin on June 9, 2010, a date that was one or more days beyond the expiration\n   of the relevant limitation period, depending on the particular wrongful act alleged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   More than\n   three years later, the hospital defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming, inter alia, that the plaintiff's claims against them were time barred. They attached as an exhibit Griffin's return of service indicating that service had occurred on June 9, 2010. The town defendants filed a similar motion as to certain claims, also appending Griffin's return of service. The plaintiff opposed these motions, arguing, inter alia, that the claims at issue were not time barred because the summons and complaint had been delivered to Griffin on May 20, 2010, thereby satisfying the requirements of \u00a7 52-593a. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Because Griffin's return of service did not include an endorsement of the date of delivery as required by \u00a7 52-593a(b), the plaintiff instead included an affidavit executed by Griffin wherein Griffin attested that the summons and complaint had been delivered to him on May 20, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, the defendants deposed Griffin, which revealed that he had no independent memory or record of the date on which he had received the summons and complaint from Spinella. Rather, upon request, he simply had executed an affidavit prepared by Spinella, assuming that the delivery date identified therein was correct. Subsequent to the deposition, the hospital defendants and the town defendants filed motions to strike the paragraph of Griffin's affidavit in which he averred that the summons and complaint had been delivered to him on May 20, 2010. Therein, they argued that Griffin's averment was not based on his personal knowledge but, rather, on inadmissible hearsay. The\n   trial court denied the motions to strike,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   but indicated, nevertheless, that it would disregard Griffin's affidavit when ruling on the summary judgment motions. The court further allowed that the plaintiff could submit an affidavit from Spinella in lieu of Griffin's affidavit, and that the defendants would be permitted sixty days in which to depose Spinella in regard to the facts and circumstances underlying his averments in that affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Contemporaneous with the trial court's ruling, Spinella signed an affidavit in which he attested that, at the time he represented the plaintiff in this matter, he had been \"acutely aware of the statute of limitations,\" he had executed the summons with the complaint attached on May 19, 2010, and Griffin had retrieved those documents from Spinella's law office on May 20, 2010. After deposing Spinella, the hospital defendants and the town defendants filed motions to strike his affidavit and supplemental memoranda in support of their earlier motions for summary judgment, providing to the court a transcript of the deposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   They contended that Spinella's affidavit should be stricken because his deposition testimony had revealed that it was based on inadmissible hearsay and speculation, was \"self-serving\" and lacked credibility. The plaintiff filed a response, claiming that Spinella's deposition testimony demonstrated that he had a clear and detailed personal recollection of the relevant\n   events. In a memorandum of decision, the trial court, after reviewing the\n   deposition testimony, concluded that Spinella's statement that the summons and complaint were retrieved by Griffin on May 20, 2010, was based on hearsay rather than personal knowledge and, therefore, would be disregarded for purposes of deciding the summary judgment motions. Specifically, it reasoned, Spinella did not personally deliver the process to Griffin or see Griffin retrieve it; rather, he merely had received oral confirmation from third parties that the process had been picked up. In light of that ruling, the medical defendants sought and received permission to move for summary judgment on the basis that the claims against them, too, were time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court granted all of the defendants' motions for summary judgment, in three separate memoranda of decision, concluding in each that the claims at issue were time barred. Specifically, it reasoned, the plaintiff had not met his burden of producing admissible evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the summons and complaint had been delivered to Griffin prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, such that \u00a7 52-593a would apply to save the causes of action. The plaintiff's appeal to the Appellate Court followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court, in a subsequent articulation, reiterated that portions of Spinella's deposition testimony constituted hearsay evidence that would be inadmissible at trial and that Spinella had not personally witnessed Griffin retrieving the process. Otherwise, the court reasoned, Spinella had no actual recollection of the events in question occurring on the specific date of May 20, 2010, the day he had identified as the date of delivery in his affidavit. Moreover, according to the court, in light of various surrounding circumstances, the more reasonable inference was that delivery was untimely. In the court's view, Spinella's deposition testimony was \"loose and equivocal\" and, therefore, lacked\n   probative value. \"In sum,\" the court concluded, \"none of the proffered evidence was sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating that the requirements of ... \u00a7 52-593a had been satisfied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that Spinella's deposition testimony, even without taking into account the portions identified as hearsay, sufficiently had raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the summons and complaint were delivered to Griffin on May 20, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487769\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1083/#p375\">\n    168 Conn.

The Appellate Court further rejected the defendants' claim, raised as an alternative ground for affirmance, that Griffin's failure to certify, on the return of service, the date on which the documents were delivered to him was fatal to the plaintiff's appeal because such certification is a mandatory prerequisite to invoking the remedial protection of \u00a7 52-593a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487769\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1083/#p375\">\n    Id., at 377-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1083/#p375\">\n    147 A.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This certified appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants claim that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the trial court's judgment in their favor because the requirement of \u00a7 52-593a(b) that a\n   marshal endorse, on the return of service, the date on which process was delivered to him or her, is a mandatory prerequisite in order to invoke the protection of the statute, and Griffin failed to fulfill that requirement. They claim further, in the alternative, that the admissible evidence before the trial court was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the summons and complaint were delivered to Griffin prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. We will address these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendants claim that the trial court's judgment in their favor should be affirmed because Griffin failed to comply with the endorsement requirement of \u00a7 52-593a(b). According to the defendants, that requirement is a mandatory prerequisite for the plaintiff to invoke the remedial extension of the statute of limitations afforded by subsection (a) of the statute. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendants' claim presents an issue of statutory construction. When we are called upon to construe a statute that is implicated by a summary judgment motion, our review is plenary.

In the defendants' view, the legislature's use of the word \"shall,\" in delineating this requirement, is unequivocal evidence of its intent that the requirement is mandatory, rather than directory. Moreover, the defendants contend, the Appellate Court's conclusion to the contrary ignored subsection (b) of the statute and rendered it \"meaningless.\" According to the defendants, the \"evidentiary morass with which [the trial court] was confronted four years after the fact\" was exactly the type of situation that the legislature, in enacting subsection (b), must have intended to avoid.

See\n   <em>\n    Teresa T.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ragaglia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3593949\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/272/734/#p746\">\n    272 Conn. 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 746,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20A.2d%20428\">\n    865 A.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (if \"provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As to the legislative history of \u00a7 52-593a, our research reveals that it consists of only a few stray comments by lawmakers that do not concern subsection (b) and, therefore, is unhelpful. Regarding the applicable legislative scheme, the placement of \u00a7 52-593a among a number of provisions that extend or toll statutes of limitations under various circumstances; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-590 through 52-595 ; underscores its remedial purpose and counsels that it should not be given an overly restrictive construction that would defeat its curative goal. Additionally, permitting a plaintiff to prove timely delivery of process to a marshal by means other than the statutorily directed endorsement would not result in an unjust windfall but, rather, assuming that timeliness could be shown by other evidence, simply would enable the plaintiff to take advantage of a protection that the legislature sought to provide to him, at no expense to the opposing party. Finally, although we agree with the defendants that ensuring that a marshal\n   fulfills the statutory endorsement requirement is, to some degree, within the control of a plaintiff, we nevertheless disagree that this circumstance is enough to overcome the other considerations weighing in favor of a conclusion that the endorsement requirement is directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Insofar as the defendants contend that a conclusion that \u00a7 52-593a(b) is directory rather than mandatory will render that provision \"meaningless,\" we disagree. To the contrary, we expect that the vast majority of parties seeking the extension of time for service afforded by \u00a7 52-593a(a) will continue to comply with the endorsement requirement to avoid the expense and uncertainty attendant to proving compliance by alternative means. We further disagree that the difficulties of proof presented by this case, without more, are evidence that the legislature intended to make endorsement of the delivery date by the marshal mandatory. Those difficulties are as readily attributable to the defendants' choice to wait more than three years to challenge the timeliness of this action, during which time one witness died and the memories of others faded, as they are to the absence of an endorsement by the marshal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the endorsement requirement of \u00a7 52-593a(b) is directory rather than mandatory. Consequently, the defendants' claim that the absence of an endorsement on the return required summary judgment in their favor is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendants claim next that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the trial court's rendering of summary judgment in their favor because the plaintiff failed to submit admissible evidence that was adequate to\n   establish a genuine issue of material fact concerning the applicability of \u00a7 52-593a. Specifically, they claim, the evidence was insufficient to create a factual question as to whether process was delivered to Griffin within the three year limitation period. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant. As previously indicated, Spinella executed an affidavit averring that the summons and complaint were delivered to Griffin on May 20, 2010, and, thereafter, the defendants deposed Spinella\n   to learn the facts and circumstances surrounding that delivery and the source of Spinella's knowledge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The deposition, if credited, revealed the following salient points: (1) although the events in question had occurred more than four years prior, Spinella had a distinct recollection of them because the plaintiff had been an \"enormously demanding\" and memorable client, and Spinella considered the overall circumstances to be \"extraordinary\"; (2) Spinella's law office used Griffin exclusively for serving process in 2010, and there was a set routine whereby Griffin would be telephoned and the papers would be left on a particular counter for him to retrieve; (3) at the time Spinella prepared and executed the summons and complaint, which had required some last minute revisions, he was acutely aware that the statute of limitations for the plaintiff's claims was due to expire within a day or so, creating \"a lot of concern\" and urgency to get the papers to Griffin; (4) Spinella's office manager, whose work area was located near the counter on which documents were left for pickup, typically was responsible for telephoning Griffin to retrieve those documents when a matter was urgent, and Spinella had asked her to do so in this instance; (5) the\n   documents were placed on the counter for pickup by Griffin; (6) although Spinella was not present when Griffin picked up the summons and complaint, he requested, and later received, oral confirmation from his office staff, likely the office manager, that the documents had been retrieved; (7) thereafter, Spinella checked back and personally observed that the documents no longer were present on the counter; (8) Spinella subsequently spoke to Griffin, who also confirmed that the pickup had occurred; and (9) the office manager had died, making her unavailable to confirm Spinella's recollections of the events in question. Moreover, Griffin, at his deposition, had not testified about confirming with Spinella, after the fact, that he had retrieved the process from the counter on May 20, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Appellate Court, after reviewing Spinella's deposition testimony, concluded that it sufficiently had raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether process had been delivered to Griffin on May 20, 2010, as Spinella had attested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Hartford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487769\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1083/#p375\">\n    168 Conn.

The court discussed most of the foregoing circumstances in its opinion, but also indicated that, even absent consideration of the pickup confirmations that Spinella claimed he had received from third parties, the deposition evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference of a May 20, 2010 delivery.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487769\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1083/#p375\">\n    Id., at 375-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487769\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1083/#p375\">\n    147 A.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendants claim that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the admissible portions of Spinella's deposition testimony gave rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to the timeliness of this action. They argue first that the court should not have considered that testimony when ruling on their summary judgment\n   motions, because it was submitted solely for the purpose of supporting the motions to strike Spinella's affidavit as lacking in personal knowledge. Alternatively, the defendants contend that Spinella's\n   testimony had no probative value because the trial court found it to be loose and equivocal, and, further, it was speculative and conjectural in that Spinella neither witnessed Griffin's retrieval of the process nor had a true recollection of that retrieval occurring on the specific date of May 20, 2010. Additionally, in the defendants' view, the evidence does not support an inference that delivery to Griffin was timely but, rather, supports the opposite inference, as the trial court reasoned. Finally, the defendants claim, to the extent that there were factual disputes over the applicability of the statute of limitations, it was for the trial court to resolve them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff,\n   in response, contends that the Appellate Court properly considered Spinella's deposition when reviewing the summary judgment ruling, and that the contents of that deposition were adequate to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the timeliness of this action.

Then, if the plaintiff claims the benefit of a provision that operates to extend the limitation period, \"the burden ... shifts to the plaintiff to establish a disputed issue of material fact in avoidance of the statute.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%20726\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In these circumstances, it is \"incumbent upon the party opposing summary judgment to establish a factual predicate from which it can be determined, as a matter of law, that a genuine issue of material fact [as to the timeliness of the action] exists.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Iacurci\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sax\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20786\">\n    313 Conn. 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20A.3d%201145\">\n    99 A.3d 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Consistent with this framework, once the defendants established that they had been served beyond the three year limitation period applicable to the claims against them, the burden shifted to the plaintiff to produce evidence sufficient to raise the factual issue of whether the summons and complaint had been delivered to Griffin by May 22, 2010, the last day before the statute of limitations expired, so as to make available the extra thirty days for service permitted by \u00a7 52-593a that would render the action timely. We conclude that the plaintiff satisfied that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To begin, we reject the defendants' claim that Spinella's deposition was not part of the record that the Appellate Court should have considered when\n   reviewing the trial court's rulings on their summary judgment motions because the defendants submitted that deposition only in support of their motion to strike Spinella's affidavit in opposition to summary judgment. As a factual matter, the defendants' claim is incorrect. Specifically, the document to which the transcript of Spinella's deposition was appended was\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   a motion to strike and a memorandum in support of summary judgment. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Nowhere in that document did the defendants purport to limit the use of the transcript, and, in any event, it is not clear that they would be warranted in doing so. See Practice Book \u00a7 13-31(a) (providing that \"any [admissible] part or all of a deposition\" submitted in court proceedings \"may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof\"). Additionally, it is clear from the trial court's articulation of its rulings on the summary judgment motions, wherein the court extensively references and evaluates the deposition testimony, that that\n   court did in fact consider it, although it ultimately found it not compelling. Because the deposition transcript clearly was before the trial court when it ruled on the summary judgment motions, and it informed that court's rulings, the defendants' contention that it should not have been considered in connection with the review of those rulings is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Next, we agree with the plaintiff that the trial court, in granting the defendants' summary judgment motions, was inordinately focused on whether he could show that process had been delivered to Griffin on the specific date of May 20, 2010. Although that was a proper inquiry for purposes of deciding the motion to strike, in which Spinella had attested to that particular day as the date of delivery, the question implicated by the motions for summary judgment was more general, namely, whether there was evidence that process had\n   been delivered to Griffin\n   <em>\n    at any time prior\n   </em>\n   to the expiration of the earliest possible statute of limitations on May 22, 2010. Regardless of whether Spinella, four years after the events in question, had a recollection of the specific date on which the events had occurred, he claimed vehemently that he recalled the date to be \"a day or so\" prior to the impending expiration of the statute of limitations, a circumstance of which, at the time, he was acutely aware, and that that awareness had led to a sense of urgency in his office to get the process to Griffin. This testimony, if credited, would lend support to a finding that delivery had occurred in a timely fashion, regardless of whether Spinella definitively could identify the specific date of delivery. Accordingly, we reject the defendants' contention that the testimony was too speculative to defeat summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Additionally, we disagree with the defendants and the trial court that Spinella's deposition testimony was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the timely delivery of process because Spinella did not personally call Griffin or witness him retrieving the documents from the counter on which, Spinella testified, they had been left for pickup \"a day or so\" before the statute of limitations was set to expire. When deposed, Spinella explained the routine that his office typically followed when it urgently needed Griffin to pick up documents for service, and he indicated, by citing facts within his personal knowledge, that routine had been set in motion. Specifically, he knew that the summons and complaint, which were dated May 19, 2010, had been placed on the counter from which pickup by Griffin typically occurred, and that he had instructed his office manager to call Griffin to retrieve them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Spinella's statements, if believed by a fact finder, are suggestive of an inference that Griffin, who regularly\n   served papers for Spinella's office, was summoned by the officer manager as usual and, thereafter, arrived to pick up the documents as requested. \"Testimony as to the habit or practice of doing a certain thing in a certain way is evidence of what actually occurred under similar circumstances or conditions.... Evidence of a\n   <em>\n    regular practice\n   </em>\n   permits an inference that the practice was followed on a given occasion.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Birkhamshaw\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Socha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20453\">\n    156 Conn.

Code Evid. \u00a7 4-6 (\"[e]vidence of ... the routine practice of an organization is admissible to prove that the conduct of ... the organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the ... routine practice\").

As previously indicated, Spinella was asked to testify about matters that had occurred more than four years earlier and, while unable to recall certain details with precision, he claimed to remember the broader outline of the events in question due to certain memorable aspects of the case. Although he had no real memory of specific dates, he consistently recalled that the pertinent events had occurred \"a day or so\" before the statutory deadline. Regardless of the generality of this averment, if it is believed, it does tend, to some degree, to support a finding of timely delivery. Moreover, to the extent Spinella expressed himself in uncertain fashion over the course of his deposition, that circumstance would go to the weight of his testimony, but does not deprive it of all probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   By dismissing the testimony out of hand, the trial court, in essence, made an improper credibility determination when ruling on a summary judgment motion.

Regarding this claim, the trial court, in its articulation, observed that Griffin did not serve the seventeen defendants until June 9, 2010, twenty days after Griffin purportedly had retrieved the process from Spinella's office. In the court's view, this delay was inconsistent with Spinella's testimony that there was an urgent need to comply with the statute of limitations that he was aware was soon to expire. According to the court, service on this date was \"not indicative ... of an overwhelming concern\" with an impending expiration date, but, rather, \"highly unusual, and unexplained.\" The court concluded that the cited circumstance \"directly undercuts the inference\" of a May 20, 2010 delivery date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Suffice it to say, any number of competing inferences may be drawn from the fact that Griffin served the defendants on June 9, 2010, a day that, if \u00a7 52-593a applies, as the plaintiff contends, still was ten days shy of the expiration of the extended limitation period. When the evidence in a summary judgment record reasonably\n   is susceptible to competing inferences, it is improper for a trial court, in ruling on the summary judgment motion, to choose among those inferences.\n   <em>\n    Suarez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dickmont Plastics Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"759930\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/99/#p107\">\n    229 Conn. at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=639%20A.2d%20507\">\n    639 A.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dacey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Bar Assn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"509717\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/170/520/#p540\">\n    170 Conn. 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=368%20A.2d%20125\">\n    368 A.2d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) ;\n   <em>\n    United Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Urban Redevelopment Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1595176\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/158/364/#p379\">\n    158 Conn. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=260%20A.2d%20596\">\n    260 A.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969).

We conclude, nevertheless, that, to the extent that the Appellate Court did so, that impropriety essentially was harmless. Specifically, as we explain hereinafter, we agree with that court that, even absent consideration of the portions of Spinella's deposition that the trial court held were inadmissible hearsay, there was enough evidence in the remaining portions of the deposition to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether process had been delivered to Griffin on May 20, 2010. Although the defendants suggest, throughout their brief, that the trial court determined that the entirety of Spinella's deposition testimony, for various reasons, was inadmissible, our review of the court's decisions discloses that that ruling was limited to the portions of the deposition that constituted hearsay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Consequently, we need not reach the plaintiff's claims that certain additional evidence also contributed to create a genuine issue of material fact. That evidence was not considered by the Appellate Court, and the plaintiff did not submit it to the trial court until he filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment ruling, a motion that the trial court denied. The plaintiff challenged that ruling on appeal, but the Appellate Court did not consider that challenge.\n    <em>\n     Doe\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     West Hartford\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487769\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1083/#p375\">\n     168 Conn.
