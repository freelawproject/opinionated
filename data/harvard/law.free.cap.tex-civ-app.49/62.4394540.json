The' court shall determine whether it had jurisdiction over the person of the defendant upon which it has power'to decree specific performance, and in considering this question the court shall consider and treat the record as though defendant had formally filed written pleas to the jurisdiction, negativing all the subdivisions of 1 Sayles\u2019 Texas Civil Statutes, art. 1194; if the court decides it has jurisdiction it shall file further conclusions as hereinafter set forth; but if it decides it has no jurisdiction, it' shall decree that suit be dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s cost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-14\">\u201cSecond. The court shall decide whether this suit was rightfully brought in Jefferson County, Texas, as though defendant had fully .pleaded it was brought\u2022 in the wrong county, under Sayles\u2019 Civil Statutes, art. 1265. If the court decides it is properly brought in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Jefferson County, it shall file other conclusions hereinafter provided for; if it decides it is not properly brought in Jefferson County, the suits shall be dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s cost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cThird. Should the court decide under the two foregoing clauses it has jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties to this suit, it shall then conclude, as a matter of law, whether the letters copied in clause \u2018Third\u2019 of the agreed facts, together with plaintiff\u2019s tender and deposit of the $1000 constitute a contract for the conveyance of-the land. If yea, the court shall enter its decree of specific performance in plaintiff\u2019s behalf, and after deducting all court costs therefrom, order the balance of the One Thousand Dollars on deposit, to be paid to defendant, or his attorneys of record. \u25a0 If the court holds said letters and tender do not constitute a contract, it shall decree that plaintiff take nothing by his suit, and the defendant go hence without day, and recover of plaintiff all costs,- and that after payment of the court costs the balance remaining of the $1000 deposited by plaintiff shall be returned to him, or his attorney of record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201cFifth. Either party against whom the court may so decide, may except to the conclusions of law and decree of the court, and appeal or sue out writ of error therefrom, and the decree shall note such exceptions and notice of appeal and all said questions herein agreed upon shall be determined by any and all Appellate Courts to which such appeal or writ of error is taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cSixth. This agreement shall constitute the statement of the facts, and the questions of law to be determined, on any and all trials of this case, whether by appeal or otherwise, when approved by the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">This agreement was signed by the attorneys for the parties and was approved and ordered filed by the District Judge. The trial judge adopted the agreement as his findings of fact, and concluded therefrom, as matters of law, in effect, that by reason of the undisputed facts in reference to the residence of the parties, the service had upon defendant, and the nature of the relief sought, the court had jurisdiction to entertain the cause; that as the nature and purpose of the suit was, primarily, to adjudicate between the parties the title to the land in question, to the extent of divesting the same out of the one- and vesting it in the other, the proceeding was not wholly <em>in personam, </em>but one <em>quasi in rem, </em>and that as to a defendant residing without the State the suit could be maintained in the county in Texas of plaintiff\u2019s residence; that the correspondence between the parties set out in the agreement constituted a contract between them mutually binding upon them for the sale and purchase of the land. Accordingly judgment was entered decreeing specific performance of the contract, and directing that the $1000 deposited by appellee in the registry of the court as the agreed purchase price of the land be delivered to appellant after the cost of the proceeding should be deducted therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">By his first assignment of error appellant \u25a0 complains that the court, under the agreed statement of facts, erred in the conclusion of law that it had jurisdiction over the person of defendant to require him to specifically perform the alleged \u2022 contract for the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>veyance of the land, in that: (1) The suit being for specific performance of an alleged contract to convey land, and not for the land itself, was a suit <em>in personam </em>and not <em>in rem. (2) </em>Being a suit <em>in personam </em>and not <em>in reni, </em>and the defendant being a resident of the District of Columbia, and beyond the jurisdiction of the court, he could not, by service upon him in his domicile, be required to appear and defend such suit in. the District Court of Jefferson County, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">By his proposition following the assignment appellant urges that, being a resident of and having been served in the city of Washington, D. C., and not within the State of Texas, and this being a suit <em>in personam, </em>and not <em>in rem, </em>the court had no jurisdiction over the person of defendant and erred in so holding; that, being without jurisdiction over the person of defendant, it was further error to refuse to dismiss the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">At the very threshold of our investigations we are confronted with the inquiry, is a suit, having for its purpose the enforcement of a contract to convey land a proceeding <em>in personam </em>or is it a suit <em>in rem? </em>This question seems to be answered by the adjudications in this State. The case of Miller v. Rusk, 17 Texas, 170, like the case under investigation, was a suit for specific performance, the difference between the two being that in that case one citizen of Texas sued another citizen of this State in the county in this State of plaintiff\u2019s residence; whereas in this case a citizen of Texas sues a nonresident of the State, in the county of plaintiff\u2019s residence. In the base cited the defendant claimed the right to be sued in his domicile, and the court, speaking through Judge Wheeler, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cIt is the right of the defendant to be sued in the county of his residence, subject only to exceptions enumerated in the statute. (Hart. Dig., art. 667.) The exception which is relied on to take the present case out of the operation of the general rule is the last in the enumeration of exceptions in the statute, and is thus expressed: \u2018In case where the recovery of land, or damages thereto, is the object of the suit, in which cases suit must be instituted where the land or a part thereof is situated.\u2019 Is the present case within the exception? We think clearly not. It is not a suit, the \u2018object\u2019 of which is \u2018the recovery of land, or damages thereto.\u2019 But it is a \u2022 suit to compel the specific execution of a contract to convey, or make title to land, without reference to the possession or injury to the possession or estate. By the decree for title or the execution of a valid legal conveyance the sole object of the suit will have been consummated. It looks to nothing beyond the specific performance of a contract to make title; and manifestly has not, for its object, either the recovery of land or damages thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">\u201cThe \u2018recovery of land\u2019 manifestly has reference to the possession; and \u2018damages thereto\u2019 as manifestly has reference to an injury to the possession, or to the freehold or estate; and not, as the argument of the appellant assumes, damages for the breach of the contract to make title. Where the latter is the object the suit is merely personal; the recovery <em>in personam, </em>fixing only the personal liability of the party contracting, not affecting the right of property or pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>session of the land contracted to be conveyed, and must be brought in the county of the defendant\u2019s residence. So in the present case, a decree would operate only a convejrance of the legal title, and should be binding upon the defendant personally to the extent of the obligation of his contract. It would not affect the possession of the land. And in the case supposed by counsel, of the inability' of the defendant to make title, and a subsequent recovery in damages, it would not be for damages to land in any sense, but damages for the breach of contract; and there would be the same necessity to sue in the county of defendant\u2019s residence as in any other case of a suit for the breach of contract. Where the suit is upon the contract, whether it be to compel the specific performance of it or to recover damages for its breach, it is not a suit for the 'recovery of land or damages thereto,\u2019 and consequently is not within the exception and rule of the statute, which requires the suit to be brought within the 'county where the land lies, though it is not the county of the defendant\u2019s residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-3\">\u201cIt is not perceived that there is really any more foundation in the principle, for holding that the case is within the exception and that suit must be brought in the county where the land lies, where it is for the specific performance, than where it is for the rescission of a contract for the sale of land; and in the latter case we have heretofore decided that it is not within the exception. (Morris v. Runnels, 12 Texas, 175.) In an analogous case, lately decided at Galveston, the same opinion was maintained as to the scope and extent of the exception. (Hearst v. Kuykendall, 16 Texas, 327.) The court did not err in sustaining the plea to the jurisdiction, and the judgment is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">So far as we have been able to ascertain, this case has never been overruled or modified, and is the law in this State today, thus making the present suit an action <em>in personam, </em>and not <em>in rem. </em>Hearst v. Kuykendall, 16 Texas, 327; Cavin v. Hill, 83 Texas, 73. This being true, did the court err in not dismissing the suit? It will be noted by the agreement it was provided that, \u201cThe court shall determine whether it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant upon which it has power to decree specific performance, and in considering this question the court shall consider and treat the record as though defendant had formally filed written pleas to the jurisdiction, negativing all the subdivisions of 1 Sayles\u2019 Texas Civil Statutes, art. 1194. . . . This agreement shall constitute the statement of facts and questions of law to be determined on any and all trials of this cause, whether by appeal or otherwise. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Giving full force and effect to the agreement, we must treat the questions raised by the assignment as if the formal plea to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of defendant had been filed in the court below. The suit being <em>in personam, </em>the defendant being a nonresident of Texas, and service being had on him at his domicile, and there having been no levy of an attachment upon property belonging to him situated in this State, no valid judgment could have been rendered against him. (Scott v. Streepy, 73 Texas, 547; Franz Falk Brewing Co. v. Hirsch, 78 Texas, 192), unless he voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>appeared and submitted hims.elf to the jurisdiction of the court. Did he by his appearance for the purpose of pleading <em>in limine </em>to the jurisdiction of the court waive his exemption of his nonresidence? This question, we think, must be answered in the affirmative. In York v. The State, 73 Texas, 651, it was held that an appearance in the courts of this State by a nonresident defendant served with citation without the State, even though such appearance be expressly declared to be limited to the sole purpose of presenting a plea to the jurisdiction of the court over his person, is a waiver of his immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of this State by reason of- his nonresidence and service without the State and has the effect to perfect such service. St. Louis, A. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Whitley, 77 Texas, 128; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Hanna, 81 Texas, 487; Fairbanks v. Blum, 2 Texas Civ. App., 479. It is true that when the court overruled the plea to the jurisdiction the appellant had the right, on motion, <em>to </em>have the case carried over <em>to the </em>next term for trial upon its merits, but no such motion was made, and indeed it would appear from the agreement of the parties, that it was contemplated, in case the court refused appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court should then proceed with the trial. Central &amp; M. Ry. v. Morris, 68 Texas, 57. It follows, therefore, the court did not err in refusing to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">This brings us to a consideration of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, which urges that the court erred in the conclusion of law that the letters set forth in the agreed statement of facts constituted a contract upon which the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of specific performance, in that such letters do not constitute an unconditional and unqualified contract to convey on the part of the defendant, nor an unconditional and unqualified agreement to accept the conveyance on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Appellant, in support of the assignment, contends that the facts do not prove a contract enforcible in law for two reasons: (1) Because there was no consideration paid by plaintiff to defendant, and at most the papers only make a <em>nudum factum. </em>(2) Because the language of defendant in his letter of December 13, shows he did not intend to make a proposition to convey, but reserved the title, and was merely tentatively holding out inducement for further negotiations for a better offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In the view we take a consideration of the contention first above stated is unnecessary. We are of the opinion that the language of appellant\u2019s letter of December 13, showed no present intention to convey the land, and therefore reserved title in himself. Were we to disjoin the concluding sentence so as to make it read: \u201cI may be willing to take $1000 for the land,\u201d the question would certainly be resolved in defendant\u2019s favor; but if we leave out this sentence, save the amount, and only construe its concluding paragraph, \u201cif you are willing to pay this price, please let me know and I will write you acceptance of the deal,\u201d'it is nearly equally certain, when plaintiff accepted, the construction would be in favor of plaintiff. The whole correspondence evidences that both parties believed the land to be oil bearing, the proposed purchaser desiring to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>it, the owner fencing for better terms; the former calling himself a \u201ccrank\u201d for still having confidence in the supposed oil field, the latter stating his ignorance of developments, but asserting confidence in his ability to make a \u201cbig showing\u201d if he had time; the would-be purchaser offering $65 per acre; the owner declining the offer but saying, \u201cI may be willing to take $1000 . . . and if you are willing to pay this price let me know and 1 will write you acceptance of the deal,\u201d from all of which we are forced to the conclusion that the alleged proposition was not such a contract as bound Lucas to make a deed to Patton for the land upon the acceptance by the latter of the terms, and tender of the price suggested, as could be enforced in an action for specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">If, however, there were any doubt upon the question, the subsequent correspondence between the parties, which is undisputed and was introduced in evidence as part of the agreed- statement of facts, would remove the doubt, for when Patton wrote to Lucas that he would pay $1000 for the land, the latter, in his letter of January 13, 1906, promptly declined to accept the money and execute the deed, saying: \u201c. . . I beg to say that in my letter of the 13th ultimo, I said \u2018that I may be willing to take $1000 \u25a0 for the land,\u2019 but after mature consideration^ and in view of a possible oil strike in the future, would say, I am not willing to accept the money. You ' are on the ground and in far better position than I am here, to judge of the land value there, hence you will recognize the fitness of my remark.\u201d Watkins Land &amp; Mortgage Co. v. Campbell, 100 Texas, 542. If Lucas had intended an unqualified offer to take $1000 for the land, would he have said: \u201cI may be willing,\u201d etc.? We think not. The sentence can not be divided as it is inseparably interwoven. The offer to accept was necessarily connected with the qualifying words, \u201cI may be willing to take;\u201d and as thus construed, and taken in connection with Lucas\u2019s own explanation of his meaning, not only shows no intention to make a binding contract, but reserven to himself the right to refuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause remanded with the instruction, if upon another trial no further material testimony bearing upon the issue of the contract sought to be \"enforced be offered, to enter judgment or direct a verdict for appellant Lucas.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
