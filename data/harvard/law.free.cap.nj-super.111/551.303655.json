Tt is well settled that one may testify to one\u2019s own age. <em>State v. Huggins, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>43, 44 (Sup. Ct. 1912), aff\u2019d 84 <em>N. J. L. </em>354 (E. &amp; A. 1913), irrespective of the consideration that the fact of age is one of the essentials that must be established as an element of the crime. <em>State v. Girone, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>498, 499 (Sup. Ct. 1918). The victim\u2019s testimony as to her age is sufficient, even where there is no corroboration. <em>State v. Calabrese, </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>312, 315 (Sup. Ct. 1924), aff\u2019d <em>p. c. </em>100 <em>N. J. L. </em>412 (E. &amp; A. 1924); and see 1 <em>Wharton, Criminal Evidence </em>(12th ed. 1955), \u00a7 264 at 599, and 2 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>(3d ed. 1940), \u00a7 667 at 785-786. Although the trial judge did not specifically instruct the jury that it had to find as an element of the crime that the victim was 14, he did read the statute and the indictment, both of which specifically indicated that the girl had to be between the ages of 12 and 16 for defendant to be found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Defendant next contends that the so-called <em>Donohue </em>charge on circumstantial evidence should have been given. See <em>State v. Donohue, </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>381, 390 (1949). The charge on circumstantial evidence accorded with the rule in <em>State v. Mayberry, </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>413, 436-437 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Finally, defendant raises as plain error the trial judge\u2019s failure to charge flight, claiming that flight was a \"most significant\u201d phase of the case. There was no such request to charge, nor was there any objection to the failure to so charge. Aside from the fact that the proofs do not point to flight, as it is well understood in the law, it was to defendant\u2019s advantage that flight not be charged. Had such a charge been given, the jury could have inferred that the flight was done with a consciousness of guilt and in an effort to avoid an accusation based on that guilt. See <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>209, 328-239 (1964). Accordingly, we find no plain error, <em>i. e., </em>an alleged legal impropriety affecting defendant\u2019s substantial rights and of a sufficiently grievous nature to have the clear capacity to bring about an unjust result. <em>State v. Gardner, </em>51 <em>N. J. </em>444, 456 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
