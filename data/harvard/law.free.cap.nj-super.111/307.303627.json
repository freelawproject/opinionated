A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ADl\">Plaintiffs appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of their application for an order granting a counsel fee and costs against defendant Home Insurance Company (Home) out of the sum which that company collected under the medical payment subrogation clause contained in the policy which it issued to plaintiff Michael Klacik.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Agatha Klacik was involved in an automobile accident with defendant Kovacs while operating the automobile owned by her husband Michael. Under the terms of the policy issued to Michael, Agatha became entitled to reimbursement from Home of reasonable medical and dental expenses not exceeding $1,000, up to one year from the date of the accident. She was reimbursed for $973.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Plaintiffs thereafter instituted an action for personal injuries and property damage against Kovacs which was settled by their attorney for $33,000. After the settlement, plaintiffs obtained an order to show cause in the action, under which they sought disbursal of the $33,000 to include an award of counsel fee and costs to their attorney on the entire settlement, including the $973 payable to Home Insurance Company. The insurance company was thus made a defendant in this action and is respondent on this appeal. The trial court ruled that Home was entitled to the full amount of $973 under its policy, and entered the order here under appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We observe at the outset that neither the policy nor any other agreement granted plaintiffs\u2019 attorney the right to an attorney\u2019s fee or costs out of the funds payable to Home under its subrogation rights. Plaintiffs do not contest the company\u2019s right to subrogation under the policy but argue that a counsel fee and costs should have been allowed out of the $973 by analogy to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-40 in workmen\u2019s compensation matters. Specifically, they ask for one-third of the $973 plus $200 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The question here involved is of novel impression in this jurisdiction. There are, however, cases involving this issue in other jurisdictions which express contrary views. One, as expressed in <em>Illinois Automobile Ins. Exch. v. </em>Braun, 280 <em>Pa. </em>550, 124 <em>A. </em>691, 36 <em>A. L. R. </em>1262 (Sup. Ct. 1924), is that insureds are not entitled to have deducted from the amount duo an insurer under a subrogation clause the counsel fees and expenses incurred in litigation against the tortfeasor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>* * * What a party lias to expend in tlie securing of a judgment is never regarded as something to be added to that which is recovered. Even technical costs were not recoverable at common law; they are solely the creature of statute. There being no statute, nor part of the contract which covers such expenses, the insured is not entitled to them. [124 <em>A., </em>at 693-694]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The same result was reached in <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Scott, </em>116 <em>Ga. App. </em>633, 158 <em>S. E. </em>2d 295 (Ct. App. 1967); <em>John Wanamaker, New York, Inc. v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>228 <em>N. Y. </em>192, 126 <em>N. E. </em>718 (Ct. App. 1920); <em>Pontiac Mut. County Fire &amp; Lighting Ins. Co., v. Shiebley, </em>279 <em>Ill. </em>118, 116 <em>N. E. </em>644 (Sup. Ct. 1917); <em>Cary v. Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>83 <em>Conn. </em>690, 78 <em>A. </em>426 (Sup. Ct. Err. 1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">More recently the Supreme Court of Arkansas in <em>Courtney v. Birdsong, </em>437 <em>S. W. </em>2d 238 (1969) came to the same conclusion, although a prior Arkansas decision in <em>Washington Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Hammett, </em>237 <em>Ark. </em>954, 377 <em>S. W. </em>2d 811 (Sup. Ct. 1964) seems to have come to an opposite result. These two decisons are probably distinguishable, however, because the court in <em>Courtney </em>based its decision on an express agreement to repay executed by the insured to the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Generally, the cases espousing the Pennsylvania view base their holding on the lack of a contractual relationship between the attorney and the subrogated insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The opposite view, to the effect that reimbursement of the insurer under a subrogation right should be made after the deduction of a <em>pro rata </em>share of the reasonable cost of the insured\u2019s efforts to recover its claim, is best expressed in <em>United Services Automobile Association v. Hills, </em>172 <em>Neb. </em>128, 109 <em>N. W. </em>2d 174, 2 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 1422 (Sup. Ct. 1961). There the Nebraska Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\"><em>*&gt; </em>* * Where the holder of the subrogation right does not come into the action, whether he refuses to do so or acquiesces in the plaintiff\u2019s action, but accepts the avails of the litigation, he should be subjected to his proportionate share of the expenses thereof, including attorney\u2019s fees. [172 Neb. at 133, 109 N. W. 2d at 2 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d, at 1428]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The rule laid down in the Nebraska ease is said to be the majority rule. 44 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Insurance, </em>\u00a7 1846, at 773. Jurisdictions supporting this view include <em>Washington Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Hammett, (Ark.) </em>above; <em>Forsyth v. Southern Bell Tel. and Tel. Company, </em>162 <em>So. </em>2d <em>916 </em>(Fla. Ct. App. 1964); <em>North River Ins. Co. v. McKenzie, </em>261 <em>Ala. </em>353, 74 <em>So. </em>2d 599, 51 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 687 (Sup. Ct. 1954); <em>General Exchange Ins. Corporation v. Driscoll, </em>315 <em>Mass. </em>360, 52 <em>N. E. </em>2d 970, 973 (Sup. Jud. Ct. 1944); <em>Svea Assur. Co. of Gothenburg, Sweden v. Packham, </em>92 <em>Md. </em>464, 48 <em>A. </em>359 (1901). See also, Annotations 2 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 1441, 1443 (1965); 51 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 697, 719 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The insurance contract before us contains no provision for fees and costs in its provisions dealing with subrogation. The company\u2019s rights, as set forth in the contract, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">In the event of any [medical] payment under coverage C of this policy the Company shall be subrogated to all the rights of recovery therefor which the insured person or anyone receiving such payment may have against any person or organization and such person shall execute and deliver instruments and papers and do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights. * s'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">It is elementary that the juristic effect of a contract is governed by the expressed intention of the parties. In the absence of any overriding public policy, \u201cit is the function of a court to enforce it as written and not to make a better contract for either of the parties.\u201d <em>Kampf v. Franklin Life Ins. Co., </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>36, 43 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Public policy here, however, is in equipoise. Home clearly never had an obligation to sue Kovacs; it did not employ plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, participate in the proceedings or settlement, or specifically direct plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to represent it in the Kovacs matter. Principles of the attorney-client relationship thus would appear to militate against charging Home. This is the view espoused by the minority rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">In the absence of statute, rule of court or contract, the mere accrual of benefits to a third party does fiot entitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>an attorney to recover any compensation from those benefited. <em>Cohen v. Fair Lawn Dairies, Inc., </em>86 <em>N. J. Super. </em>206, 212 (App. Div. 1965), aff\u2019d 44 <em>N. J. </em>450 (1965); 7 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Attorneys at Law, </em>\u00a7 205, at 166; Annotation 78 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 318, 324 (1961). Hence the reference by plaintiffs to the workmen\u2019s compensation statute is inapposite. However, had Home caused the Klaciks to incur expense in settlement or had there been a default in an obligation to defend the Klaciks, public policy would dictate the imposition of legal fees. <em>Verhagen v. Platt, 1 N. J. </em>85, 92 (1948); <em>Gerhardt v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>291, 300 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">We conclude that the more equitable rule is that espoused by the majority in <em>United Services Automobile Association v. Hills, </em>above. Clearly, had Home decided to insttiute its own action, or intervene in the action instituted by plaintiffs against Kovacs, it would have been required to incur expenses including an attorney\u2019s fee for such action. To establish an artificial rule which would provide an insurer with the right to sit back and permit its insured to proceed with an action, expecting to share in the avails of that proceeding without the burden of any of the expense, occurs to us to be anomalous.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The arrangement between plaintiffs and their attorney was for him to receive one-third of any recovery obtained from Kovacs. The one-third counsel fee should be figured on the gross recovery, including the amount to be reimbursed to Home Insurance Company. Thus, Home\u2019s reimbursement will be reduced by one-third.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Plaintiffs have also requested that the amount to be reimbursed to Home be further reduced by the sum of $200 for expenses. The record is barren of any basis for the amount asked for expenses and, accordingly, we cannot pass on their reasonableness. We remand to the trial court for ascertainment of the proportion of expenses to be paid out of the amount to be reimbursed to Home, which proportion should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>not exceed the amount which the gross reimbursement to he paid to Home bears to the total recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Eeversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
