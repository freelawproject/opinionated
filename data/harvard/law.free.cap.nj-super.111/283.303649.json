Jones appeals from a judgment in favor of defendant Leo Stess following the granting of defendant\u2019s motion for involuntary dismissal at the close of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">On September 12, 1966 plaintiff visited the office of defendant, a licensed chiropodist (podiatrist), for the purpose of having her \u201cfeet, her nails and her calluses taken care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>of.\u201d Defendant had been treating her for a number of years and knew that she suffered from diabetes. In a portion of his deposition which was offered in evidence he stated that he had specifically noted that fact on his office record card, by underlining the word \u201cdiabetic\u201d in red ink. He gave as the reason for this the fact that \u201cdiabetic patients are special patients to be considered with care\u201d \u2014 they \u2018fiiave to be watched more closely,\u201d \u201cas a precaution against infection or injury.\u201d He added, \u201cwe don\u2019t work too close with diabetic patients\u201d and agreed that \u201cyou don\u2019t want to unintentionally cut a diabetic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">On the day in question, after soaking plaintiff\u2019s feet in a whirlpool bath, defendant began clipping her toe nails. When he reached the groat toe of her left foot he, in some manner, clipped the inside of her toe. When she jerked her foot back because it hurt, he allegedly said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Jones, but those kids have upset me. They have been in here all afternoon * * (she had previously heard two boys talking and \u201ckidding around\u201d with the doctor). She felt pain in the toe but after he had applied a red substance to it she was permitted to return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">By the next day the pain was worse. Two days later continued pain in the toe caused her to consult Dr. Wales, her personal physician. When she did not respond to his treatment he referred her to Dr. Slobodien, a surgeon, who observed an area of infection on the inside of the left big toe. Subsequent x-rays indicated that the infection had penetrated into the bone below. Dr. Slobodien ordered plaintiff admitted to Perth Amboy General Hospital where, on October 31, 1966, her condition was diagnosed as osteomyelitis of the toe, and an operation was performed which consisted of removing the nail and curetting the osteomyelitic area of the distal phalanx. When the infection persisted plaintiff was readmitted to the hospital on December 26 at which time, because diabetic gangrene had set in, her entire toe was amputated. When the condition continued to spread she underwent three more operations, the last, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>amputation, extending to hex mid thigh. With the final amputation the infection was contained and healing took place. Eventually, an artificial leg was fitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">There was medical testimony from Dr. Wales as to the existence of causal relationship between the cutting of the toe by defendant and the resultant loss of plaintiff\u2019s left leg. Dr. Slobodien testified that \u201cdiabetics have problems with regard to healing, particularly with infection.\u201d As to the reasons for this he stated, \u201cBasically, one of them is that the blood vessels are older than the individual is, and the second is that because of the fluctuating sugar levels in the body, infection itself tends to recede more slowly than it would in individuals without diabetes.\u201d He added that, \u201c[DJiabetes affects blood vessels in the body, primarily arteries of the middle size. Because these vessels are involved, the blood flow through these vessels is diminished,\u201d and \u201c[I]n order to have proper healing, [w]hat you want is an adequate blood flow to the area as much as possible, and in diabetics this flow is decreased.\u201d He opined that the diminished blood flow would affect the lower extremities most severely.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Dr. Wales was in substantial accord. With reference to the extremities he testified, \u201cGreat care must be used in taking care of these areas because any type of trauma can precipitate an infection in the toe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the court granted defendant\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal on the ground that plaintiff was required, but had failed, to adduce expert testimony as to the standard of care required of defendant, and whether there had been a deviation from that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The sole question presented by the present appeal is whether the foregoing testimony was sufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>ease, and thus require defendant to put in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\"> In passing upon defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court was required to consider the proofs in the light most favorable to plaintiff, and to accord her the benefit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>most favorable inferences reasonably to be drawn from them. <em>Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>128, 132 (1961). Applying that standard to the present case, we are satisfied that plaintiff\u2019s proofs presented a jury question, and that the dismissal was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">As a chiropodist, licensed pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45 :5\u20141 <em>et seq., </em>defendant was required to possess that degree of knowledge and skill usually pertaining to other members of his profession. <em>Cf. Hull v. Plume, </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>511 (E. &amp; A. 1944). See Annotation, \u201cLiability of Chiropodist for Malpractice,\u201d 80 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 1278 (1961). In the rendition of his professional services, he was required to exercise that degree of care, knowledge, and skill ordinarily possessed and exercised in similar situations by the members of his profession. <em>Cf. Fernandez v. Baruch, </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>127 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\"> In general, in a malpractice action the patient is required to establish that defendant\u2019s treatment fell below the standards established and recognized in the profession in which defendant was engaged. Ordinarily, the question of what those standards demanded of defendant, or whether he had deviated therefrom, is to be established by expert testimony. <em>Carbone v. Warburton, </em>22 <em>N. J. Super. </em>5 (App. Div. 1952), aff\u2019d 11 <em>N. J. </em>418 (1953); <em>Ayers v. Parry, </em>192 <em>F. </em>2d 181 (3 Cir. 1951), <em>cert. </em>den. 343 <em>U. S. </em>980, 72 <em>S. Ct. </em>1081, 96 <em>L. Ed. </em>1371 (1952), reh. den. 344 <em>U. S. </em>849, 73 <em>S. Ct. </em>49, 97 <em>L. Ed. </em>660 (1952), 344 <em>U. S. </em>916, 73 <em>S. Ct. </em>337, 97 <em>L. Ed. </em>707 (1953), 345 <em>U. S. </em>961, 73 <em>S. Ct. </em>941, 97 <em>L. Ed. </em>1381 (1953). However, a well recognized exception dispenses with the need for such testimony where the facts are such that it may be said, looking at it in the light of the \u201ccommon knowledge and experience\u201d of laymen, that there has been a lapse from the standard. <em>Steinke v. Bell, </em>32 <em>N. J. Super. </em>67, 69 (App. Div. 1954); <em>Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, supra, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>at 141; <em>Martin v. Perth Amboy General Hospital, </em>104 <em>N. J. Super. </em>335, 342 (App. Div. 1969); <em>Becker v. Eisenstodt, </em>60 <em>N. J. Super. </em>240, 246 (App. Div. 1960); <em>Ayers v. Parry, supra, </em>192 <em>F. </em>2d at 184-185. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>also Annotations, \u201cNecessity of Expert Evidence to Support an Action for Malpractice against a Physician or Surgeon,\u201d 141 <em>A. L. R. </em>5, 12, 24, 29 (1942), 81 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 597, 608, 641 (1962); \u201cLiability of Dentist to Patient,\u201d 83 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 7, 78, 89 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><em>Becker v. </em>Eisenstodt, supra, involved the use of a caustic solution in a patient\u2019s nose by a plastic surgeon while <em>Steinke v. </em>Bell, supra, involved the removal of the wrong tooth by a dentist. In <em>Sanzari v. </em>Rosenfeld, supra, where the patient died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage allegedly caused by aggravation of her hypertensive condition brought about by the injection of Epinephrine, an anesthetic solution, into her gums by a dentist, Justice Proctor referred to the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d exception as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">Ordinarily, the common knowledge doctrine is applied in a malpractice case after the plaintiff proves his injury and a causally related act or omission by the defendant. The effect of applying this doctrine is to allow the jury to supply the applicable standard of care and thus to obviate the necessity for expert testimony relative thereto. In other words, application of the doctrine transforms the case into an ordinary negligence case where, as mentioned above, the jury, from its fund of common knowledge, assays the feasibility of possible precautions which the defendant might have taken to avoid injury to the plaintiff. The basic postulate for application of the doctrine therefore is that the issue of negligence is not related to technical matters peculiarly within the knowledge of medical or dental practitioners. [34 <em>N. J. </em>at 141-142]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In holding, based on the manufacturer\u2019s brochure which had indicated that the drug was contraindicated for patients suffering from hypertension, that the dismissal at the end of plaintiff\u2019s ease was error, he concluded, \u201cWe believe that it was within the common knowledge of laymen that a reasonable man, including a dentist, who knows a drug is potentially harmful to a certain type of patient should take adequate precaution before administering the drug or deciding whether to administer it.\u201d 34 <em>N. J. </em>at 143. Compare <em>Ayers v. </em>Parry, <em>supra, </em>where a claim of malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>based upon damage to nerve roots during spinal anesthesia was held to require expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In <em>Ayers v. Parry </em>the court referred to <em>Vergeldt v. Hartzell, </em>1 <em>F. </em>2d 633 (8 Cir. 1924), as an example of the type of case not requiring expert testimony. In its factual pattern that case closely resembles the present one in that there the dentist\u2019s drill slipped when he momentarily turned his head toward the instrument table, whereas here the instrument slipped because the chiropodist had been upset by the boys. In <em>Vergeldt, </em>the Circuit Court of Appeals, in reversing the dismissal of the action by the trial judge, pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">The theory of plaintiff\u2019s allegation and brief in support thereof is, not that the defendant\u2019s treatment or operation was unprofessional or below standard or that the defendant was unskillful in his work, but that the defendant was negligent and failed to observe reasonable care while performing the operation, and by reason thereof an untoward act occurred producing a positive and independent injury, [at 6351</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In holding that the case was for the jury, the court quoted extensively from <em>Evans v. Roberts, </em>172 <em>Iowa </em>653, 660, 154 <em>N. W. </em>923, 926 (Sup. Ct. 1915). In that case, while the surgeon was operating for the removal of adenoids, the instrument slipped and wounded the plaintiff. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">What may be the rule where the sole question is upon the treatment of the diseased part, and whether it was in accordance with approved and medical standards, we need not here decide, for, as we have already noted, this is not a case of that kind. The jury hero did not have to consider whether the method of the defendant in removing the adenoids was correct or scientific, hut whether the unintentional wounding of plaintiff\u2019s tongue was occasioned by lack of reasonable care on his part. This, it would seem very clear, involves no question of science or necessarily of expert knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">In the light of the proofs, we incline to the view that the present case falls within the ambit of <em>Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, Steinke v. Bell </em>and <em>Vergeldt v. Hartzell. </em>The medical testimony was adequate to sustain a finding that plaintiff suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the amputation of a substantial portion of her left leg by-reason of an infection which she sustained through the breaking of her skin by defendant on the day in question. Defendant knew plaintiff was a diabetic and acknowledged the need for extra care in working on the feet of diabetics. The issue of his responsibility in tort for her condition did not depend on whether the method utilized by him was correct or scientific, but whether his unintentional wounding of her was occasioned by the lack of reasonable care on his part. Whether, <em>inter alia, </em>the instrument being used by him slipped because he was \u201cupset\u201d bj*- the previous actions of the two boys in his office, and whether in view of his upset condition, he should have given plaintiff another appointment, or waited until his upset condition had subsided, were questions which the jury was competent to resolve without expert testimony.
