In the Municipal Court defendant in error sued plaintiff in error for breach of contract in failing to accept and pay for certain corporate stock purchased. Besides denying the breach of contract claimed, plaintiff in error presented a counter claim for loss of profit sustained because defendant in error had failed to deliver certain corporate stock it had sold to plaintiff in error. Upon a trial before court and jury there was a verdict for $302.04 returned in favor of defendant in error, and a judgment was rendered upon that verdict. Plaintiff in error now prosecutes this writ to reverse that judgment.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-5\" pgmap=\"18\">Both parties are corporations and are stock brokers dealing in stocks not listed on any stock exchange.

We beg to state evidently you misunderstood our statement over the telephone yesterday as regards holding the 2000 shares over for you until tomorrow. We did not refuse such request and as far as we can recall, no such request was made of us; in fact we were unable yesterday to secure a definite statement as to the time of payment of our draft. We did say, however, that we could not hold the matter open indefinitely and we do not understand on what grounds you expect us to do so. The relations between you and your clients are not of interest to us; our contract is with you and constitutes a cash sale. Tour refusal to honor our draft upon presentation is a repudiation of the contract and your view of calling this deal off, upon our refusal to hold the matter open for a further length of time, is considerably out of line.</p><p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-5\" pgmap=\"22\">We regret that you presumed delivery would be made Saturday and we must state definitely that we did not lead you to make any such presumption and are not responsible for the results of such a presumption.

He offered them to brokers and sent out letters. He tells us he saw or wrote to about twenty-five or thirty persons. He, later, somewhat stultifies himself and weakens his testimony by asserting he knew the market price through trades and offers made and then, when forced upon cross-examination, admitting he knew of none. However, on October 9, 1907, he sold these 2000 shares to one Frank H. Petrie, for ten cents per share. This, he testified, was the best and only offer he could get through all his efforts. With reference to the 2000 shares additional, as he testified, defendant in error obtained an option from one Eubly for those at sixteen cents per share, but this option was never availed of. The two Eubly transactions, the sale and the option, do not seem to have been given very much consideration by counsel as tending to show value of the stock.</p><p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\" pgmap=\"24\">Mr. Quinlen, on behalf of plaintiff in error,' testified that the plaintiff in error was in business as broker in stocks and bonds and that this stock bought from defendant in error was bought for and on behalf of one Backus, a customer, and not for the plaintiff in error itself.</p><p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\" pgmap=\"24\">The court instructed the jury orally, inter alia, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\" pgmap=\"24\">\u201cThere is a point at issue here in reference to whether or not this 4000 shares was one sale or whether it was two separate sales, the defendant claiming that it was one single transaction, and that it was not required to pay for the first 2,000 shares until the second 2,000 shares should have been delivered.</p><p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\" pgmap=\"24\">\u201cIf you find that it was one single transaction, that the defendant should not pay for the same until the whole of the stock should have been delivered, then the refusal of the defendant to pay for the first 2,000. until the second 2,000 had been delivered would be justified under the law. But, on the other hand, if you find under the terms of this agreement, a communication between the parties, the defendant was to pay for the first 2,000 shares when it was delivered, then the refusal of the defendant to pay for this 2,000 shares when delivered would be a complete justification for the plaintiff in refusing to deliver the other 2,000 until the first 2,000 was paid for.</p><p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-9\" pgmap=\"24(8) 25(37)\">\u201cMr. Booth, attorney for defendant in error: Will the court instruct the jury that even if they did find, as the defendant contends, that the sale was 4,000, that would not justify the defendant in refusing to accept the second tender of 2,000 shares? .</p><p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\" pgmap=\"25\">\u201cThe Court: No, I think that is a correct statement of the law. The defendant would not be justified in refusing to accept the second 2,000 shares of stock under any conditions shown by the evidence in this case.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-6\" pgmap=\"25\">Lee, Lee &amp; Schucharot, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-7\" pgmap=\"25\">Sherman M. Booth, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b25-8\" pgmap=\"25\">Mr. Justice Chytraus</author> <p id=\"A4\" pgmap=\"25\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b25-9\" pgmap=\"25\">It is perfectly clear that here there were two contracts, each for the sale of 2,000 shares of stock.</p> <p id=\"b25-10\" pgmap=\"25\">Plaintiff in error claims error in the judgment because both parties are corporations and were not, therefore, authorized to purchase and own corporate stock, and, consequently, the whole transaction was illegitimate. That is rather an unconscionable defense ; yet, if supported by law and evidence, the court would be obliged to sustain it. But here it appears, with reference to the 2,000 shares first sold, that both corporations were merely acting as brokers or agents in buying and selling. They acted for undisclosed principals. There was no intent or purpose on the part of either party to become the owner of corporate stock; hence, the rule of law invoked is not here applicable.</p> <p id=\"b25-11\" pgmap=\"25\">As to the 2,000 shares sold first it must be conceded that, upon the record, the evidence is sufficient to prevent our disturbing the verdict of the jury for including in their verdict the difference between the purchase price of 17 1/2 cents and the price of 10 cents at which those shares were sold.</p> <p id=\"b25-12\" pgmap=\"25(19) 26(134)\">The point that there is a lack or insufficiency of competent evidence in respect to proof of damage is not well taken. The stock involved was unlisted stock which has no recognized value upon any general stock market or exchange but, therefore, the plaintiff in a suit upon a broken contract of purchase is not without remedy. Prima facie, at least, the fair cash value thereof can be established by testimony of one dealing in such stocks and who qualifies himself as Grieb, the witness herein, qualified himself. Plaintiff in error made no effort to show that the fair cash value was other or different from what Grieb testified it was, and the plaintiff in error had a full and fair opportunity of so doing. By his testimony, in this respect, Grieb covered the time from the return of the stock until the day of sale, October 9, 1907.</p> <p id=\"AQ6\" pgmap=\"26(242) 27(18)\">With reference to the 2,000 shares additional, the evidence does not show the defendant in error to have lost 17 1/2 cents per share. The defendant in error cannot, as a mere broker in the transaction, justify a verdict for the difference between the purchase price of the plaintiff in error, viz.: 17 1/2 cents, and the price of 10 cents at which the other shares were sold to Petrie. According to the evidence the defendant in error was not acting as a broker in this transaction but was seeking to \u201cscalp\u201d a profit by itself making a purchase of Eubly, the owner, who was willing to sell at 16 cents and then selling to plaintiff in error, who was willing to buy at 17 1/2 cents. This we hold the defendant in error, as a corporation, could not do ; for we understand the law to be that a corporation may not exist for the purpose of buying and selling corporate stock for its own use. The ordinary rule is that a corporation cannot become a stockholder in another corporation unless such power is given by its charter. Dunbar v. American Telegram Company, 224 Ill. 9. In the case at bar defendant in error did not show itself to possess such charter power. The law of this state prohibits defendant in error from making or availing itself of the transaction with reference to the 2,000 additional shares and plaintiff in error is not and never was obligated to aid or enable defendant in error to carry it out.</p> <p id=\"b27-4\" pgmap=\"27\">The instruction of the trial court first quoted above is erroneous, because the two transactions of sale and purchase were independent, not interdependent. The question whether or not they were so, being a question of construction or interpretation of a contract, was a question for the court and not for the jury. Gettys v. Marsh, 145 Ill. App. 291. The instruction last above quoted, relating to the 2,000 additional shares, is also erroneous. It practically amounts to a direction of a verdict in favor of defendant in error, except in amount, so far as those shares are concerned.</p> <p id=\"b27-5\" pgmap=\"27\">What has already been said disposes of the counterclaim made for damages because defendant in error did not deliver stock purchased.</p> <p id=\"b27-6\" pgmap=\"27\">The judgment of the Municipal Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b27-7\" pgmap=\"27\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
