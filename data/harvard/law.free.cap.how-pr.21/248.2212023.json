Plestero, (3 <em>Wend., </em>538,) which has been confirmed by subsequent decisions, <em>(Johnson </em>agt. <em>Hunt, </em>23 <em>Wend., 87,) </em>would seem to be conclusive upon the question, whether our courts will recognize or enforce a right or title acquired under a foreign bankrupt law, or foreign bankrupt judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">The case of <em>Abraham </em>agt. <em>Plestero </em>was certainly very broad in its repudiation of foreign bankrupt proceedings, and went much further than the case of <em>Holmes </em>agt. <em>Remsen, </em>(20 <em>John.,) </em>but I think it must be deemed conclusive authority for saying, that had the defendant raised the question by demurrer, or on the trial, it must have been held that the plaintiffs could not maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The complaint shows that the assignment or transfer under which the plaintiffs claim, was not a voluntary assignment or transfer, but was under an assignment or transfer made under or by force of a judicial proceeding or decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">But the defendant did not raise the question by demurrer, nor on the trial. The record of judgment before us does not show that any such objection was taken on the trial, nor indeed any of the proceedings on the trial, except the rendering the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Can the defendant then present the question to the general term by this appeal, when we must assume that he sat silent at the circuit and permitted the trial to go on and end in a verdict against him, without raising the question ? 1 think he cannot. <em>(See Pope </em>agt. Dinsmore, 8 <em>Abbott, </em>429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">If the question should be looked upon rather as a question of jurisdiction than of title, yet the defendant, by his silence, could waive the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The defendant was not compelled to raise the question by demurrer, he could have done so at the trial, but it will not do to let him sit silent at the trial, and raise the question for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">In my opinion the judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b256-11\">Clerke, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adj\">I concur, except that I do not think the defendant could raise the question at the trial after having failed to demur. If he demurred, it should be under sub. 2 of sec. 144; but sec. 148 says, if the objection is not taken by demurrer (or answer,) defendant shall be deemed to have waived the same, except only the objection to the jurisdiction of the court <em>(under sub. </em>1 o/\" \u00a7 144,) and the objection that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action <em>(under sub. </em>6 <em>of ^ </em>144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
