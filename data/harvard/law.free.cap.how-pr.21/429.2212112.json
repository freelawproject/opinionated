If it was not in the city of New York, then the copies should have been left with the person in whose possession the goods were found. The return is clearly defective. The officer should have stated the place of residence specifically, but if not specifically, at least, that it was within the county of New York. The service having been improperly made, the justice acquired no jurisdiction, and the judgment is invalid. ( <em>Watts </em>agt. <em>Willett, 2 Hilton, </em>212; <em>Rosenfield </em>agt. <em>Howard, </em>15 <em>Barb., </em>547.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The return is also defective, in not stating specifically whether such copy was or was not personally served upon the defendant as required by the statute. It follows, inferentially, that if a defendant cannot be found a personal service has not been made, but stating a fact inferentially, and stating it specifically, are very different modes of doing that duty. The legislature have required the latter, and, in my view of the statute, intended that it should form a part of the return. However this may be, the judgment, for the reasons assigned, must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
