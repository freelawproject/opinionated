The Code, by requiring this expense \u201c to be paid by the parties,\u201d absolutely, without any provision that either may reclaim, in any event, the sum paid, disposes of the question hy whom the expense is to be borne. The object of incurring it is not the relief of the court alone. The parties are benefited, not only by a saving of time at the trial, but by a saving of labor and expense in the preparation of a case or exceptions and amendments thereto, if either moves for a new trial. In <em>Arnoux </em>agt. <em>Callendar </em>the same decision is made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
