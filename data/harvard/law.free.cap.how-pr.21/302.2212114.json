The cause was tried before Justice Robertson and a jury. Under the charge of the court a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs. The complaint set forth that the plaintiffs are a corporation for dealing in ice in the city of New York and elsewhere; that the defendant had been in the habit of purchasing ice from them; that at different times between the 24th day of July, 1858, and the 1st day of January, 1859, he had bought and had delivered to him, in the aggregate from them, ice to the value of $4,501.55, and that he was still indebted to the plaintiffs in that amount, as he has admitted. The defendant in his answer admitted that he had purchased quantities of ice from the plaintiffs, but denied that the amounts and sums mentioned are correct, and put the plaintiffs to prove the same. The defendant also set up as a distinct defence, and by way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>counterclaim: 1st. That in the fall of 1856 he was a memher of a partnership or association in the city of New York, existing under the laws of the state, by the name of \u201c The . Independent Ice Company;\u201d that by the by-laws of said company no member shall sell out his interest in it either without the consent of the shareholders, each and every of \u25a0 them, or without purchasing the interest of such members as would dissent from his doing so; that while said bylaws were in force all the members of the Independent Ice Company, except the defendant and one other person, sold their shares in the same to the New York Ice Company, without the consent and in spite of the protest of the defendant against the proceeding ; that the members of the New York Ice Company were formerly members of the Independent Ice Company, and are now plaintiffs in this action; that at the time of the said sale of the Independent Ice Company\u2019s stock the defendant held of it $21,802.50, and that amount was the market value of it; that by reason of said sale the stock became worthless; that no stock of the plaintiffs\u2019 company had ever been issued to him (the defendant) in lieu of the stock held by him of the Independent Ice Company; but that stock of the New York Ice Company had been issued to every member of the Inde-' pendent Ice Company, except the defendant; and that the stock of the plaintiffs\u2019 company is not worth near as much as the stock of the Independent Ice Company was at the time of said unauthorized sale. 2d. As another defence, (the 3d one in the complaint) the defendant alleged that the said sale having been effected, and the plaintiffs having constituted themselves a company from the Independent Ice Company, and in the manner aforesaid, commenced doing business; that the defendant\u2019s business being to buy ice at wholesale, and to sell the same at retail, he, in the summer of 1857, in order to fulfil the contracts he had made with his customers, found it necessary to purchase ice of the plaintiff\u2019s company; that they contracted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>agreed to sell to him, on credit, all the ice he would require for the purpose aforesaid; that in violation of their said contract, on the 12th day of May, 1858, they refused for three days to supply him with ice\"; that he, the defendant, for that reason failed to supply his customers with ice; that reports as to said failure injurious to his business were spread about; that, consequently, many of his customers refused to be supplied thereafter with ice by him; and that, by reason of said reports, and the refusal of the said plaintiffs to perform their contract, he had suffered damage to the amount of $10,000. 3d. As another defence, that in the month of January, 1857, he was employed by the plaintiffs\u2019 company, and rendered services to them, the value and expense of which were $174.38, and, therefore, that he demanded judgment for <em>$3,600.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">The plaintiff's, by their reply, put in issue all the allegations of the answer in relation to ceasing for the three days to supply him with ice. They alleged, that prior to the 12th day of June, (May) 1858, the defendant had agreed with the plaintiffs\u2019 company that he would not sell ice to a certain class of persons known to be customers of other ice dealers; nor to sell ice to any one at an under price; that the defendant violated said agreement in both particulars, and did so after he had received notice from one of the plaintiffs to refrain, or that the company would sell him n\u00ae more ice. The plaintiffs admitted that they employed the defendant to do some work at New Rochelle, but denied that the work done was worth the sum claimed ($176.38.) The jury, under the charge of the court, rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs for $4,895.96. No exceptions were taken to the charge; nor is it set forth in the case; the exceptions on which the case comes from below arise upon the rulings of the court during the course of the trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-7\">Andrews, Colby &amp; Thompson, <em>for appellants, </em>argued the following exceptions taken :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>1st. To the ruling of the court in excluding all evidence in regard to the counterclaim set forth in the second allegation in the answer, on the ground that a counterclaim could be set up on a claim for unliquidated damages arising on a contract different from that on which the action was brought. (4 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>285; <em>Code, \u00a7 </em>150, <em>and case of Merrill </em>agt. <em>Salmons.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-5\">2d. To the exclusion of evidence going to show the damage occasioned to the defendant by the stoppage of his supply of ice; the effect of it; and the preceding mentioned ruling having been to wholly deprive the defendant of the benefit of the counterclaim set forth in the third subdivision of his answer, as well as to deprive him of the benefit of the first and second counterclaims, which latter, it is argued, arose out of the same contract as that for which the action was brought, and is a proper subject for a counterclaim <em>(Mayor, &amp;c., </em>agt. <em>Malie, </em>3 <em>Kern., </em>161; <em>La Farge </em>agt. <em>Halsey, </em>1 <em>Bos., </em>171;) and it was further maintained that the plaintiffs admitted the defendant\u2019s right to present his claim in form of a counterclaim, by replying to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-6\">3d. To the admission of a witness\u2019 testimony made from and based on non-original entries in plaintiffs\u2019 ledger. Various other points were taken by the counsel for the defence, which need not be here cited, as they are referred to particularly, and at length, in the decision of the court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-7\">Mr. Merrill, <em>for respondents.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b311-8\">By the court, Hoffman, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">I. The counsel for the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs had not proved the sale and delivery of the ice; the motion was denied and an exception taken. The plaintiffs had proved that the defendant had called, and had gone over the figures of the bills, with the secretary of the company, anji had admitted them to be, in the main, correct; the sum total of the balance was $4,507, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>and some cents. He stated that there was no objection to the bill; this was in September, 1858. Before the arbitrators, also, there was no dispute as to the amount of the bill. This exception is clearly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">II. The plaintiffs\u2019 'counsel objected to any evidence in regard to the first counterclaim, which is set forth in the second allegation of the answer. The court sustained the objection, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the ruling of the court. Whatever cause of action could by possibility have arisen to the defendant, upon the facts stated in this counterclaim, would arise against his associates in the former company, or partnership, as individuals, and upon a breach of their contract with him. This took place in the fall of 1856. In another part of his answer he states that the plaintiffs contracted to sell ice to him, to enable him to perform his engagements, involving thereby the admission that he contracted with them to purchase ice. Thus the case is one of an alleged demand, against several individuals, formerly partners with the defendant, offered to be applied in extinction of a demand by a corporation with which he has dealt, because some, or most of the corporators, were members of the former association. The learned judge was clearly right in his ruling upon this point. <em>(Peabody </em>agt. Bloomer, 3 <em>Abb. R., </em>353.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The rulings connected with the third clause of the answer, being the second counterclaim, gave rise to the most of the defendant\u2019s exceptions. Upon the examination of Mr. Thorp, president of the company, he was asked by the defendant\u2019s counsel if the company had stopped the delivery of ice to Parker at one time, and was answered they had; and was again asked by the same counsel why he stopped delivering ice to Parker. The witness replied that an explanation was necessary; that there was a custom of the trade by which \u201c we\u201d agreed to sell at certain prices. The counsel of the defendant objected^to testimony on the subject of customs of the trade; the court overruled the objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tion, and directed the witness to give the proposed explanation ; and the counsel for the defendant excepted to it. The witness stated that Parker, with others, had agreed to sell at certain prices, and upon failing to do so there was a certain penalty. Parker broke the agreement, and the penalty was the cutting off of his supply of ice. There was a board to try such cases, and Parker appeared at the board. The evidence elicited by the defendant\u2019s own question is, therefore, in substance, that Parker had entered into an agreement which he had violated, and this justified the stoppage of the ice; that there was a board or body constituted to inquire into such matters, and he recognized it. In truth, there is nothing of evidence as to custom proper stated by the witness. So in regard to the exception as to the terms of the arrangement between the dealers having been made known to Parker, and of a committee trying causes of a breach of such arrangement, and other exceptions of a similar nature. Parker entered into the arrangement, became a party to the conditions, and brought a complaint himself. By an express contract he submitted not only to the conditions, but to the mode of ascertaining the violation of them. All testimony, therefore, under this head, was rightly admitted. Other exceptions go to the refusal of the judge to admit questions as to how many wagons the defendant was employing in his business when the ice was stopped; to what contracts he then had for the delivery of ice; what was the effect upon his business generally, and as to his loss of customers. \u00b0 Testimony as to the amount of ice he received from day to day from the company, and testimony as to the retail price at which he sold it to his customers were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">There is one general view which renders the consideration of these several exceptions in detail unnecessary. There was no evidence sufficient to justify a finding that the defendant knew of, and agreed to be bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>rules as to encroaching upon other seller\u2019s rights, and as to underselling, and that he had violated them. The issue was raised in the reply. We are to assume that the judge charged properly as to all the points in issue; hence that this was submitted to the jury to answer; and we think the verdict has answered that the plaintiffs were warranted in stopping the ice, because we think that no allowance has been made to the defendant on account of this counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The verdict was for the sum of $4,895.96; the balance adjusted and proven as of the first day of January, 1859, was $4,507.55 ; the interest to the tenth day of November, as deposed to, was $584.36, making an aggregate of $5,093.89. There is an error in the figures as to the interest, probably, which, however, is of no importance. It is not beyond a doubt that the amount claimed for services and disbursements at New Rochelle, by the defendant, was allowed; the reply admits the services, contesting the value only; the claim was proven at $173.50 ; in the answer it is stated at $174.38. If the jury deduct this $174.38 from the principal of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, $4,507.55, and computed interest on the balance from January 1st, 1859, to the 10th day of November, 1860, the sum will differ, by my computation from the verdict, by a sum less than two dollars of excess, being $4,897.50. The counsel of the plaintiffs states in his points, that this counterclaim was allowed in the computation, and we think this was the case. The jury, then, could not have allowed anything for the counterclaim, arising from the stoppage of the ice ; and if so, must have rejected it, because the demand was not established. It is to be regretted that the case has not so much of the charge of the judge, as to these points, as would have removed all ambiguity from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Another and remaining exception to be noticed relates to the reference made by the witness to the ledger. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>only to refresh, by his own entries, his memory as to the aggregate amount of the ice furnished; the amount or balance which he thus ascertained was stated to the defendant ; the accounts were shown him, and the sum admitted to be due. The exception cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
