The questions in themselves were pertinent to the subject matter of inquiry, and proper, provided the party interrogated was bound to respond. Trapp declined to answer more specifically than he had done, on the ground that he could only be inquired of as to the fact whether he was indebted to, or had property belonging to the judgment debtor; and that a general answer upon those points was all that could be required of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel now applies to the county judge upon the report of the referee, showing the above facts, for an order requiring the said David Trapp to show cause why he should not be punished as for a contempt in his refusal to answer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-10\">R.

There can be no doubt of the power of the court to punish as for a contempt disobedience of its orders in these proceedings; it is a power incident to the due administration of justice, and essential to the enforcement of the statute under Avhich these proceedings are had. This poxver Avas inherent, in a general sense, to judicial tribunals prior to the passage of the Code, and it is expressly conferred by the Code. <em>(See </em>\u00a7302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The question, then, to be determined, is whether there has been a willful disobedience in this case, b)r the party refusing to make a more <em>particular </em>and <em>specific </em>answer. In other Avords, had the plaintiff\u2019s counsel a right to examine this party as to the particular business transactions and relations between him and the judgment debtor? If the object of the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 294, xvas to enable a creditor to seek out the property of a dishonest debtor, strip it of the covering of an equally dishonest confederate or friend of the debtor, and expose it to the process of execution, then it xxmuld seem an idle ceremony to provide only for a general answer on the part of a party alleged to haxm property of, or to be indebted to the judgment debtor, and constitute such party the sole judge of both the law and the fact in the case. I-am inclined, liOAvever, to think that such Avas not the object of the legislature, but that it AA'as to provide for cases, by this section, xvliere a third party had property of the judgment debtor, or xvas indebted to him, and did not deny or dispute such fact upon being-required to \u201canswer concerning the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">It will be perceived that the provisions of ^\u00a7292 and 294 are essentially different. By the former it is prox-ided that \u201ceither party may examine xvituesses in his behalf,\u201d and the judgment debtor \u201c may be examined in the same manner as axvitness.\u201d By the latter it is simply provided that the third party \u201c shall answer concerning the same,\u201d i. e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>his alleged indebtedness, &amp;c. Had this section, like \u00a7 292, provided that the third party should be examined \u201c in the same manner as a witness,\u201d or that \u201ceither party might examine witnesses in his behalf,\u201d then it would seem more clear that it was intended that the allegation of the creditor was to be traversed, and the question of fact settled by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">I think it will be seen by reading carefully \u00a7\u00a7 294, 297 and 299 in connexion, that \u00a7 294 was intended to provide for such cases only, where the allegation of the creditor is undisputed by the third party; by \u00a7 297, it is provided that the judge may order any property of the judgment debtor, not exempt from execution in the hands of himself or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied towards the satisfaction of judgment; but this power conferred by \u00a7 297, of summarily disposing of the property of third persons is modified and limited by \u00a7 299, which provides, \u201c if it appear that the person or corporation, alleged to have property of 'the judgment debtor, or indebted to him claims an interest in the property adverse to him or denies the debt, such interest or debt shall be recoverable <em>only </em>by the receiver, &amp;c.\u201d Hence, it will be seen that if the third party deny the allegation of the creditor, the power of the court so far as he is concerned is at an end, except to forbid by order a transfer or disposition of such property or interest, until the receiver may commence and prosecute an action to judgment and execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">In this case David Trapp denies the indebtedness, or that he has property, &amp;c.; the referee or county judge had no right to try this disputed claim. (See <em>People </em>agt. <em>Hulbert, 1st Code R., N. S., </em>75.) It could only be tried in an action by the receiver. <em>(Catlin </em>agt. <em>Doughty, </em>12 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>457; <em>Sherwood </em>agt. <em>N. Y. City R. R. Co., id., </em>136.) And if the court could not try it, why further investigate it ? No purpose is to be answered so far as the proceedings before the county judge is concerned. He can make no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>order under \u00a7 297, no matter how well he may be convinced that the claim of the third party is unfounded or how untruthful the denial of the debt, he is foreclosed by \u00a7 299, from further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">But it may be claimed that the creditor is entitled to a rigid examination of the third party and to establish by his oath if he can, the allegation of the creditor of indebtedness, &amp;c., and to show fraud in the transactions between the parties ; that the claim of the third party is fictitious, and his denial of indebtedness false. I think this claim answered by the suggestions I have already made; if the examination of the party is desired with a view to its use in an action to be prosecuted by the receiver, such object could have been attained by calling him as a witness, in the proceedings against the judgment debtor, under \u00a7 295. On an examination under this latter section, <em>as a </em>witness, he would not have been excused from answering fully, because he set up a claim to the property. (See <em>Sanford </em>agt. <em>Carr, </em>2 <em>Abb., </em>462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">This latter section I think was intended to aid the creditor in discovering the property of a fraudulent debtor by allowing a full and rigid examination <em>as a witness, </em>of any person the creditor might have reason to suspect, was concealing the property of the debtor, or indebted to him; but I am inclined to think that such is not the object of \u00a7 294, but that a party examined under it, can only be required to answer concerning his alleged indebtedness to the judgment debtor, and as to the fact whether he has property belonging to him, and a general denial on oath of both propositions is all that can be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">I therefore deny the motion; but as the question is a new one, and not free from doubt, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
