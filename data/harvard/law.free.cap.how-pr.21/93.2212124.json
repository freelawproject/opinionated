Part of the goods were sent by plaintiffs to Ingalls <em>&amp; </em>Shepard, the builders, at Sullivan, Maine; part were delivered to riggers in Boston, and part were delivered to the vessel -while lying in the city of Boston. The question on the trial before the referee was, whether the defendant or Ingalls &amp; Shepard made the contract of purchase with the plaintiffs. Did the plaintiffs sell the goods and give credit for the same to Ingalls <em>&amp; </em>Shepard, or to the defendant ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-7\">G.

The referee excluded the evidence, it being admitted that the plaintiffs had been duly notified to produce the books, and the plaintiffs stating that the books were then on their way to the place of trial; and asking that the examination of the witness be suspended until the books arrived. The examination of the witness was suspended until the following Monday, when the plaintiffs produced certain books, as their ledger, sales-book or day-book, memorandum or order book. The examination of the witness Ingalls, being then resumed, he was asked to look at the books produced and point out the one examined by himself and Phipps at the time he had spoken of. The witness selected the ledger and said he thought that was the one. He was then asked to look at page 111, and say if he had seen that account before. The witness said that was not the account he saw. He was then asked to look at the sales-book. He said he did not recognize the account he saw. He was then asked and answered several questions about the account he saw, which it is not important to specify particularly; and was then asked this question\u2014 \u201c Against whom was the account made out?\u201d The plaintiffs objected to this question as asking for the contents of the books, when the books were present. The referee overruled the question and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">I think the witness should have been permitted to answer the question, and that the referee erred in overruling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Considering the question being litigated between the parties, it was of course material to the defendant to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>that the plaintiffs' had in their books: charged the goods to Ingalls. &amp; Shepard, and not to the defendant; at all events to show to whom they had charged the goods. The production of the books, and the testimony of Train, that the books produced were all the books of the plaintiff, certainly did not estop the defendant from showing that at a certain time there was an account in one of their books by which the goods were charged to Ingalls. &amp;' Shepard, and not to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The defendant, certainly was not bound by the' production of the books, so that he could not show tliat. there were other books; or that the account at page 111 of the ledger produced was at one time without the name of the defendant at. its heading.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">If Ingalls had sworn that by the account which he saw the goods were charged to Ingalls <em>&amp; </em>Shepard, and not to the defendant, .the referee might not have believed him, or might have supposed that he was mistaken; but that does not affect the question of the admissibility or pertinence of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Without examining' any other exception taken by the defendant,. I think that the judgment should be reversed and a. new trial ordered, on the ground that the question to Ingalls was improperly overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
