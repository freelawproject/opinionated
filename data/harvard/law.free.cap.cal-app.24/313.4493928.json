The views of the judge, thus expressed from the bench, cannot be construed, as an order granting the application; and until the order is in fact made, there is no action on the part of the court, and the expressed views of the judge are as much subject to change as though they were unuttered.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b345-6\">Id.\u2014Function op Mandamus\u2014Review op Error.\u2014It is not the function of a writ of mandate to review error.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-7\">APPLICATION for Writ of Mandate to be directed to the Superior Court of Los Angeles County and Fred H.

Upon the hearing of the motion, the judge from the bench expressed the view that the application so made by plaintiff should be granted, and directed plaintiff\u2019s attorney to prepare and submit an order for the issuance of an execution, stating that he would sign the same. Thereafter the court refused to make such order, but instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>on January 8, 1914, as shown by the return of respondent, made its order denying the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The petition for the writ must be denied. The views of the judge expressed from the bench as to plaintiff\u2019s rights cannot be construed as an order granting the motion. It appears to be petitioner\u2019s contention that, since the judge announced from the bench that in his opinion plaintiff was entitled to the order asked for, he should have adhered to the opinion so expressed. What the judge said from the bench, since it did not constitute the order of the court, was immaterial. We have repeatedly held that the opinion of a judge filed in a case, where inconsistent with the findings or other action of the court, is not part of the record or entitled to consideration in determining questions brought up on appeal. So here, until the order was in fact made, there was no action on the part of the court, and the expressed views of the judge were as much subject to change as though they had remained unuttered.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">By making the order denying plaintiff\u2019s application the court acted upon the same. Whether the ruling be erroneous is immaterial, for, since it is not the function of a writ of mandate to review error <em>(Gesford </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>114 Cal. 466, [46 Pac. 383]), conceding its existence, no relief can be had in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The application is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Conrey, P. J., and James, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on June 8, 1914.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
