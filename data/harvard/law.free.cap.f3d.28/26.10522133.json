His complaint asserts a myriad of alleged violations of his civil rights and requests over $100 million in damages, all resulting from the investigation, epnviction, and sentencing of Stephenson in federal court for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The district court noted that Stephenson\u2019s complaint constituted an attack on the fact or length of his confinement and, as such, concluded that Stephenson\u2019s exclusive initial remedy for such a challenge was a collateral attack on his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The court held that, to the extent that Stephenson\u2019s complaint raised any civil rights claims, it would be held in abeyance, reserving to Stephenson the right to move to reopen the ease within the six months following the exhaustion of his post-conviction remedies. Stephenson now appeals from that order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The law on exhaustion of habeas corpus remedies has changed since the district court ruled. In <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), the Supreme Court held that, in order to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction, or for \u201charm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,\u201d a prisoner must show that the conviction or sentence has been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. The Court analogized such a claim to the tort of malicious prosecution, one element of which is \u201cthe termination of the prior criminal proceeding in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at, 114 S.Ct. at 2371.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\"><em>Heck </em>was a civil rights suit brought by a state prisoner, whereas Stephenson is a federal prisoner whose habeas remedies lie, not under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, but 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In <em>Spina v. Aaron, </em>821 F.2d 1126, 1127-29 (5th Cir.1987), however, we held that, for purposes of a civil rights action implicating the validity of a conviction, there should be no distinction between state and federal prisoners and that the analysis of a federal prisoner\u2019s <em>Bivens-type </em>action which implicated his conviction \u201cshould parallel the analysis used to evaluate state prisoners\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims.\u201d Therefore, if the district court was correct in determining that Stephenson\u2019s claims implicated his conviction, <em>Heck </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">Stephenson\u2019s civil rights action does constitute a challenge to the fact or length of his confinement. In particular, his action alleges that: law enforcement officials violated his constitutional rights when they were investigating him; he was held without an indictment; his court-appointed counsel rendered ineffective assistance; the district court illegally indicted and sentenced him; and all of the named defendants conspired to violate his constitutional rights, obstruct justice, commit mail fraud, common-law fraud, violate RICO, and engage in \u201cout law [sic] conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">In fact, Stephenson concedes that the basis of his action is a challenge to the \u201cconstitutional validity of his Federal Court conviction and confinement.\u201d The plain language of Stephenson\u2019s brief and complaint establishes that his action falls directly within the strictures we enunciated in <em>Spina.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-16\">The law of this Circuit that such civil rights actions be dismissed without prejudice and the running of the applicable statute of limitations tolled while the plaintiff was exhausting state remedies, <em>see Rodriguez v. Holmes, </em>963 F.2d 799, 804-05 (5th Cir.1992), is no longer applicable. Under <em>Heck, </em>\u201cthe statute of limitations poses no difficulty while the state challenges are being pursued, since the \u00a7 1983 claim has not yet arisen.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 114 S.Ct. at 2374. Therefore, because <em>Heck </em>dictates that a cause of action seeking damages under \u00a7 1983 for an unconstitutional conviction or sentence does not accrue until the conviction or sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>has been invalidated, <em>see id, </em>there is no longer a need to dismiss such actions without prejudice and to toll the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Because Stephenson cannot establish the elements of a <em>Bivens </em>action until his conviction has been declared invalid or otherwise impugned as set out in <em>Heck, </em>the district court\u2019s order holding the case in abeyance is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for dismissal with prejudice. <em>See Heck, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014 - \u2014, 114 S.Ct. at 2372-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Stephenson\u2019s additional motions \u2014 seeking leave to withdraw a petition for a writ of mandamus, and seeking to compel the appel-lees to respond to his brief in the instant case \u2014 are also DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-16\">. Because it alleges civil rights violations by federal defendants, however, the action is construed as one brought pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 </em>U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\">. An order holding a plaintiffs civil rights complaint in abeyance pending the exhaustion of state remedies is appealable under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Johnson v. State of Texas, </em>878 F.2d 904, 905-06 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
