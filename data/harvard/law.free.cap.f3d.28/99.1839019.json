Based on the amount of the controlled substance involved and Frazier\u2019s prior felony drug conviction, the district court imposed a twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). On appeal, Frazier contends that the district court erred in calculating his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">Frazier was convicted of possessing 441 grams of a substance that was 37 percent methamphetamine. The statute applied by the district court calls for a twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence for defendants with a prior felony drug conviction who possesses with intent to distribute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKh\">100 grams or more of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers or 1 kilogram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). Frazier maintains that he was found guilty of possessing a \u201cmixture or substance,\u201d containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, weighing less than 1 kilogram total; therefore, he argues, the provision does not apply to him. The government counters that Frazier was in possession of 163 grams of methamphetamine (the amount of the drug in the substance Frazier possessed, calculated by multiplying its weight by its purity), a quantity in excess of the 100-gram threshold of the statute. The district court agreed with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-17\">Although this court has not directly confronted an argument similar to Frazier\u2019s, three other circuits have. The First Circuit dealt with an analogous problem of statutory interpretation in <em>United States v. Stoner, </em>927 F.2d 45 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 129, 116 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991). <em>Stoner </em>involved another provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 imposing a five-year mandatory minimum for convictions involving 10 grams or more of methamphetamine, or 100 grams or more of a mixture. The defendant was convicted of distributing 82.9 grams of a substance containing 28.45 grams of methamphetamine. <em>Stoner, </em>927 F.2d at 46. The defendant contended that the statute contemplated applying the mandatory minimum only if 10 grams of <em>pure </em>methamphetamine was involved; if the drug was in any type of mixture \u2014 regardless of the proportion of methamphetamine in that mixture \u2014 he argued that the mixture must weigh more than 100 grams for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the statute to apply. <em>Id. </em>The court pointed out that acceptance of the defendant\u2019s position would lead to anomalous results. For example, an offender with 95 grams of pure methamphetamine could add four grams of baking soda and escape the mandatory minimum, whereas a second offender with only 10 grams of the pure drug would be subject to a more severe penalty. The First Circuit rejected the \u201cinference that Congress intended to offer an inducement to the offender with ten to 99 grams of methamphetamine to add a tiny amount of a dilutant and thereby escape the mandatory penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the court found, \u201can individual is subject to the mandatory sentence if he commits an offense involving either 10 grams of the drug \u2014 however it is found \u2014 or 100 grams of a mixture containing any detectable amount of the drug, even if that is less than 10 grams.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Aside from the fact that the instant case involves a larger amount of methamphetamine, it is indistinguishable from <em>Stoner. </em>Frazier criticizes the First Circuit\u2019s rationale by claiming that the statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, stating plainly that the total weight of a mixture must exceed one kilogram for the mandatory minimum to apply. Frazier\u2019s reading of the statute, however, requires replacing the phrase \u201c100 grams or more of methamphetamine\u201d with \u201c100 grams or more of <em>pure </em>methamphetamine.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather than resting on the statute\u2019s clear language, Frazier\u2019s construction requires a judicial rewriting that we decline to undertake. Frazier possessed 163 grams of methamphetamine; this conduct falls within the statute\u2019s bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Two other circuits have adopted the <em>Stoner </em>rationale. <em>United States v. Alfeche, </em>942 F.2d 697 (9th Cir.1991) (involving the same statutory provision at issue in the instant case); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 879-80 (4th Cir.) (involving the statutory provision at issue in <em>Stoner), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 351, 121 L.Ed.2d 266 (1992). In addition, we have relied on these eases in a different context. In <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>6 F.3d 735 (11th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1234, 127 L.Ed.2d 577 (1994), we interpreted the term \u201cpure methamphetamine\u201d' as it was used in a now-amended sentencing guideline. Citing the <em>Stoner </em>line of cases, we concluded that the quantity of \u201cpure methamphetamine\u201d was to be determined through multiplying the purity of the mixture by its weight. <em>Carroll, </em>6 F.3d at 746. This conclusion parallels our holding in this case: \u201c100 grams of methamphetamine,\u201d as used in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii), refers to 100 grams of the drug however it is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">In light of the statutory language, we find Frazier\u2019s arguments regarding statutory construction, congressional intent, and the rule of lenity to be without merit. We uphold the district court\u2019s imposition of the 20-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-5\">.
