Federal agents also monitored and recorded conversations that took place inside the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Based in large part on the fruits of the electronic surveillance, a Federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Gennaro Angiulo (defendant)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with \u201cconspiring to engage in racketeering activities, among them, conspiring to murder and being [an] accessor [y] before the fact to the murder of Angelo Patrizzi,\u201d and substantive violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962 (c) and (d)(1988). The substantive violations alleged, inter alla, that the defendant conspired to murder Angelo Patrizzi and that the defendant was an accessory before the fact to Patrizzi\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The case was tried to a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The jury convicted the defendant. The Federal judge sentenced the defendant to forty-five years in prison and fined him $120,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">After the Federal trial, a grand - jury sitting in Essex County indicted the defendant on charges of conspiracy to murder, and of being an accessory before the fact to the murder of Angelo Patrizzi.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment arguing that the prior Federal prosecution barred the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cepulonis, </em>374 Mass. 487 (1978). A judge in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Superior Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The defendant sought interlocutory relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.). A single justice of this court reserved and reported the case to the full bench. We affirmed the motion judge\u2019s decision in part, allowing the Commonwealth to prosecute the defendant on the charge that he was an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree; and we reversed in part, dismissing the conspiracy count on double jeopardy grounds. <em>Angiulo </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>401 Mass. 71 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Accordingly, the defendant was tried as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree. See G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2 (1990 ed.). The trial took place in December, 1987. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The judge sentenced the defendant to a term of life imprisonment. Asserting a number of errors, the defendant appealed. The appeal was entered in the Appeals Court. We took the case on our own motion. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">First, we summarize the relevant evidence. In 1978, Joseph Porter, Angelo Patrizzi\u2019s half-brother, was shot to death. Porter\u2019s body was found in a stolen automobile in Revere. Patrizzi believed that two individuals, Frederick Simone and Cono Frizi, were responsible, for the murder. Patrizzi resolved to kill Simone and Frizi to avenge his half-brother\u2019s death. News of Patrizzi\u2019s intention, however, reached Simone and Simone\u2019s associates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Simone and his associates planned a preemptive strike; Patrizzi would be killed before he killed Simone or Frizi.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">For some period of time up to January 26, 1981, Patrizzi had been incarcerated for criminal offenses unrelated to the present case. On January 26, Patrizzi was transferred to a half-way house. While a resident of the half-way house, Pa-trizzi was \u201cemployed\u201d at Surf Auto Body in Revere. At trial, the director of the half-way house testified that Patrizzi\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>transition back into society did not proceed smoothly. He recalled a day in February, 1981, when Patrizzi was visibly upset and carried on in a manner that disturbed the other residents and the staff. In response, the director summoned Patrizzi to a meeting where he attempted to calm Patrizzi. In response to the director\u2019s queries, Patrizzi responded, as told by the director, \u201cThey killed my brother .... I\u2019ve got to get them.\u201d On March 3, 1981, the director listed Patrizzi as being on \u201cescape status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On March 11, 1981, the FBI intercepted a conversation, which occurred at 98 Prince Street, among the defendant, Samuel Granito, and Simone. The conversation reveals that the defendant knew about Patrizzi\u2019s intentions as well as the plot to kill Patrizzi. Granito and Simone told the defendant that they had unsuccessfully attempted to kill Patrizzi on two occasions. Granito and Simone also told the defendant that Patrizzi had been given money, gold, clothing, and a \u201cno-show\u201d job at Surf Auto Body so they would know of his whereabouts. Nonetheless, Patrizzi had disappeared. The defendant expressed his displeasure that the plan to kill Pa-trizzi had gone awry and demanded an explanation as to how he had eluded them. Later, the defendant affirmed the need to kill Patrizzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">On March 12, 1981, the FBI intercepted a conversation, which also occurred at 98 Prince Street, between the defendant and another associate, Ilario Zannino. During the conversation, the defendant told Zannino about his conversation with Granito and Simone. The defendant asked Zannino to assist with the Patrizzi \u201cproblem.\u201d The defendant, having been previously informed that Patrizzi was hiding in the South Boston section of Boston, told Zannino that he would give him Patrizzi\u2019s telephone number when he received it. Zannino expressed some concern: he wanted to make sure that he \u201chit\u201d the right man. Zannino said he knew \u201cwhat to do\u201d after he acquired Patrizzi\u2019s telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">On April 3, 1981, the FBI intercepted a conversation of Zannino and two associates, Ralph Lamattina and Johnny Cincotti. The conversation took place at 51 North Margin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Street. Referring to Patrizzi, Zannino told Lamattina and Cincotti that Patrizzi had been \u201cclipped\u201d and his body put in a trunk. Zannino cautioned the men to keep silent about this development.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">On June 11, 1981, Lynn police found Patrizzi\u2019s body in the trunk of an automobile. The Lynn police officer who discovered the body testified that Patrizzi had been \u201chog-tied.\u201d Patrizzi\u2019s legs were bent from his knees up to his buttocks. A rope was tied around his ankles. It extended up his back and was knotted around his neck. The rope was \u201cfairly\u201d taut. The officer testified that Patrizzi\u2019s body was found inside a sleeping bag. Four or five strands of rope were tied around the sleeping bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The medical examiner conducted an autopsy on June 13, 1981. He identified Patrizzi\u2019s corpse through medical and dental records and reported the cause of death as asphyxia due to strangulation by ligature. Patrizzi had been dead at least two weeks prior to the autopsy. The medical examiner could not determine the exact date or time of death because of the degree of decomposition of the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The defendant raises numerous issues on appeal. We consider only those issues that are dispositive or which may recur at a new trial and provide additional facts as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">1. <em>Jurisdiction and scope of review. </em>After sentencing, the judge advised the defendant of his right to appeal citing G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28 (1990 ed.). The defendant\u2019s appeal originally was entered in the Appeals Court. In his brief, filed in the Appeals Court prior to transfer of the case to this court, the defendant argued that he is entitled to appellate review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1990 ed.). The defendant claims that \u00a7 33E applies, notwithstanding his conviction as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree, because he is a defendant in a \u201ccapital\u201d case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as that term is used in \u00a7 33E. The defendant argues \u00a7 33E applies because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>he could have been indicted and tried on the underlying substantive felony, murder in the first degree, see G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.), and because he is subject to the same punishment as one who has been convicted of murder in the first degree as a principal, see G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2 (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E, vests exclusive appellate jurisdiction in capital cases in this court. The scope of review mandated by \u00a7 33E is broader than that available to a defendant in a noncapital case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cullen, </em>395 Mass. 225, 228 (1985). If the defendant is a \u201ccapital\u201d defendant as the term is used in \u00a7 33E, then he is entitled to a standard of review considerably broader than that to which he would otherwise be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We proceed to consider whether the defendant, convicted as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree, is a \u201ccapital\u201d defendant as that term is used in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We begin with the statute. Section 33E defines a capital case as \u201ca case in which the defendant was tried on an indictment for \u2018murder in the first degree and was convicted of murder in the first degree.\u201d Given such a case, the General Court has directed us \u201cto review the \u2018whole case\u2019 to determine whether the verdict is \u2018against the law or the weight of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 741, quoting G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. On such a finding, the statute empowers us to \u201c \u2018order a new trial or . . . direct the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt,\u2019 if the interests of justice so require.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741-742. As we have stated, the \u201cuniquely thorough review of first degree murder convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>is warranted by the infamy of the crime and the severity of its consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744. One convicted of murder in the first degree is subject to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2 (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We hold that the statute cannot be interpreted reasonably to exclude from its sweep a defendant indicted and convicted as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree. General Laws c. 274, \u00a7 3, provides, in pertinent part, \u201cWhoever counsels, hires or otherwise procures a felony to be committed may be indicted and convicted as an accessory before the fact ... or may be indicted and convicted of the substantive felony . . . .\u201d If the Commonwealth prosecuted the defendant for murder in the first degree, as it could have, and a conviction resulted, the defendant would be a capital defendant within the meaning of \u00a7 33E. The issue as to the applicability of \u00a7 33E in this case arises solely because the Commonwealth opted to prosecute the defendant as an accessory before the fact and not for the substantive offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">If we were to decide that \u00a7 33E applies only to those defendants convicted of murder in the first degree as principals, then the Commonwealth\u2019s decision to prosecute the defendant as an accessory rather than for the substantive crime would adversely affect the defendant\u2019s appellate rights. It is unlikely that the General Court intended such a construction. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169, 174 (1985) (court resolves doubts as to statute\u2019s meaning in favor of criminal defendant). Moreover, the purposes underlying the need for plenary review under \u00a7 33E are no less present in a case where the defendant is charged as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree. See G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2 (an accessory before the fact \u201cshall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of the principal felon\u201d). Finally, we find further support in <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>352 Mass. 702, 704 (1967), where we held that one convicted as an accessory before the fact to murder had committed a capital crime for the purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant\u2019s court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude that the defendant is a capital defendant within the meaning of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Accordingly, we consider his appeal in view of the requirements set forth in \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">2. <em>Grand jury proceedings. </em>The defendant presses three arguments concerning the validity of the indictment and the conduct of the grand jury proceedings. We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">a. <em>Sufficiency of evidence. </em>On two occasions prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the grand jury did not receive sufficient evidence to find probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160 (1982). On each occasion, the motion judge, who was not the trial judge, denied the motion. The defendant claims that the motion judge erred. The defendant argues, in essence, that the quantum of evidence introduced to the grand jury was insufficient to support probable cause. Thus, the defendant argues that the indictment was \u201cfatally defective, and all subsequent proceedings taken in reliance upon the indictment were void.\u201d <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 572, 574 (1973). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 163, we h\u00e9ld that where a grand jury receives no evidence of criminality on the part of the accused, the indictment must be dismissed. In so holding we stated that \u201cat the very least the grand jury must hear sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused . . . and probable cause to arrest him. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>This evidentiary threshold serves to protect the innocent \u201cagainst unfounded criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>Lataille </em>v. <em>District Court of E. Hampden, </em>366 Mass. 525, 532 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 163 n.6. Otherwise stated, indictment only on probable cause \u201cis justly regarded as one of the securities to the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive public prosecutions.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>8 Gray 329, 344 (1857).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">We have reviewed the minutes of the grand jury proceedings. We conclude that the grand jury heard sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of probable cause. See <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 450-453 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 163. The grand jury had a transcript of tapes which recorded the defendant\u2019s conversation with his associates in which there was an abundance of evidence of probable cause to believe that he was an accessory before the fact to murder. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">b. <em>The Federal prosecutor. </em>Mr. Ernest S. DiNisco, an assistant United States attorney, had worked on the Federal government\u2019s case against the defendant. DiNisco was familiar with both the videotapes and audio tapes which were the cornerstone of the Federal case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>897 F.2d 1169, 1176 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 845 (1990). As the Commonwealth\u2019s case rested on some of the same recordings, the Commonwealth enlisted DiNisco\u2019s assistance to facilitate presentation of its case to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">At some point prior to trial, DiNisco was appointed and sworn as a special assistant district attorney. The date of DiNisco\u2019s appointment is not clear from the record. The assistant district attorney informed the judge that DiNisco had been sworn prior to presentation of the evidence to the grand jury. Documentary evidence, in the form of a notice of appointment, indicates that DiNisco\u2019s appointment was effective April 17, 1987, a date after the grand jury had adjourned. The notice of appointment limited the scope of DiNisco\u2019s responsibility to the prosecution of Gennaro Angi-ulo, Ilario Zannino, Frederick Simone, and Samuel Granito.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The grand jury convened on December 3, 1986. The assistant district attorney spoke first: \u201cGood morning, members of the Grand Jury. For the record . . . I\u2019m an Assistant District Attorney h\u00e9re in Essex County. And aiding me in the presentation of this investigation is Special Assistant District Attorney Ernest DiNisco, who is also a special attorney with the Justice Department.\u201d The grand jury heard testimony from two witnesses. The assistant district attorney questioned the first witness. DiNisco questioned the second witness. Based on the testimony, the grand jury indicted the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The defendant argues that DiNisco\u2019s presence was unauthorized and, therefore, his indictment is void and his conviction must be overturned. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pezzano, </em>387 Mass. 69, 72-73 (1982), we stated that \u201cthe presence of an unauthorized person before a grand jury will void an indictment. . . . Th[e] principle is based \u2018upon the fundamental conception that proceedings before the grand jury must be in secret.\u2019 . . . This rule of secrecy imposed on the hearings and deliberations of the grand jury derives from two significant considerations. The first is a decision to \u2018save individuals from notoriety unless probable cause is found against them and an indictment is returned and disclosed. . . . The second ... is to shield grand jury proceedings from any outside influences having the potential to \u2018distort their investigatory or accusatory functions. . . .\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>410 Mass. 1, 5-8 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Rule 5 (c) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 850 (1979), provides: \u201cAttorneys for the Commonwealth who are necessary or convenient to the presentation of the evidence, the witness under examination, the attorney for the witness, <em>and such other persons who are necessary or convenient to the presentation of the evidence may be present </em>while the grand jury is in session\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Conflicting evidence exists in the record concerning the timing of Mr. DiNisco\u2019s appointment as a special assistant district attorney. Thus, we shall assume that his appointment was not effective at the time of the grand jury proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>402 Mass. 333, 342 (1988). Nonetheless, DiNisco\u2019s presence is permitted under rule 5 (c) as a person \u201cnecessary or convenient\u201d to the presentation of evidence. Additionally, the defendant has failed to direct us to evidence tending to support the conclusion that DiNisco\u2019s presence compromised the truth-seeking function of the grand jury proceedings. Our review of the minutes of the grand jury proceeding has revealed no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The defendant also argues that DiNisco should not have participated in the grand jury presentation because he was, at all relevant times, an assistant United States attorney. The defendant claims that DiNisco\u2019s presence served to taint the grand jury proceedings because DiNisco owed his allegiance to a \u201cdifferent sovereign\u201d \u2014 the Federal government. The defendant argues that the responsibility to press a criminal indictment belongs only in the hands of officers of this Commonwealth who are agents of the people. See art. 5 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument erroneously assumes that DiNisco, and not an agent of the people of the Commonwealth, controlled the presentation of the evidence in defendant\u2019s case to the grand jury. It is clear from the minutes of the proceedings that DiNisco\u2019s role was to assist and to aid the chief prosecutor because of his familiarity with the evidence. At no point can it fairly be said that DiNisco directed or controlled the grand jury presentation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass. 188, 205-206 (1971), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 910, and sub nom. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 914 (1972). So long as control of the case remained with a duly authorized member of the executive branch, here the assistant district attorney, and absent a showing of prejudice or manifest injustice resulting from DiNisco\u2019s participation, his participation was permissible. This result would be no different if DiNisco was in fact simultaneously serving as assistant United States attorney and as special assistant district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">c. <em>The tape recordings. </em>The grand jurors did not hear the tape recording the FBI produced during its surveillance. Rather, an FBI agent, who had identified the voices on the recordings and prepared a transcript, read portions of the transcript to the grand jury. The FBI agent testified that the transcript fairly and accurately represented the words spoken on the recordings. The FBI agent also testified that inaudible portions of the recordings were so designated in the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The defendant asserts that the judge erred in denying the motion to dismiss the indictment due to the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to inform the grand jurors of the \u201cdegraded\u201d quality of the tape recordings or to play them for the grand jurors. The defendant asserts that this failure served to impair the integrity of the grand jury proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, supra. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass. 615, 620 (1986), we stated: \u201cIn certain instances, the failure to disclose known information may impair the grand jury proceedings. For example, presentation of a defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements recorded in a police report, distorted by the intentional failure to disclose the defendant\u2019s exculpatory comments interspersed in that report, impaired grand jury proceedings and required dismissal of the indictment in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 448-449 (1984).\u201d We went on to say: \u201cTo sustain a claim that the integrity of the grand jury proceeding has been impaired, not only must the evidence have been given with the knowledge that it was false or deceptive, but the false or deceptive evidence must probably have been significant in the view of the grand jury and must have been presented with the intention of obtaining an indictment.\u201d <em>Mayfield, supra </em>at 621. See <em>id. </em>at 637 (Liacos, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Such is not the case here. Assuming, arguendo, that the Commonwealth intentionally withheld the disputed information,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the defendant has not shown that this information would have been significant in the view of the grand jury. The absence of additional information concerning the quality of the recordings did not tend to distort the incriminating nature of the evidence the grand jury had before them. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, supra </em>at 449. The integrity of the grand jury proceedings was not impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">3. <em>Change of venue. </em>On three occasions prior to trial, the defendant moved for a change in venue. On appeal, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>fendant urges us to hold that the denial of these motions rendered nugatory his constitutional right to an impartial jury trial. The defendant argues that the prejudice of the jury should be presumed because such a high percentage of the members of the venire were disqualified due to their \u201cknowledge\u201d of the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As such a high percentage of the venire members demonstrated a disqualifying prejudice, defendant argues, the reliability of the claims of impartiality of the empaneled jurors should be drawn into question. There was no error in the rulings on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We begin by noting that \u201ca change in the place of trial . . . should be ordered with \u2018great caution and only after a solid foundation of fact has been first established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonomi, </em>335 Mass. 327, 333 (1957), quoting <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>208 Mass. 162, 180 (1911). \u201cThe existence of pretrial publicity'does not alone indicate that an impartial jury cannot be empanelled.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>388 Mass. 98, 108 (1983), citing <em>Dobbert </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 302-303 (1977). The question, properly framed, is \u201cwhether there are \u2018any indications in the totality of the circumstances that [the defendant\u2019s] trial was not fundamentally fair.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 109, quoting <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 799 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The defendant advances an argument in which he urges us to presume prejudice in the venire because forty-two per cent of the venire was excused. We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to attribute the prejudice of some to the otherwise impartial jurors. Review of the transcript reveals no rational basis for such a conclusion. We note that, while forty-seven persons were disqualified due to their \u201cknowledge\u201d of the defendant, the source of the knowledge was not common.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">For example, one prospective juror was excused because he was related by marriage. Prospective jurors were excused be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>cause a family member had attended school with the defendant\u2019s child or knew of him. A prospective juror was excused because she knew a person who was a police officer and doubted her ability to consider, on an equal footing, testimony offered to rebut that of a police officer. One prospective juror was excused because he felt that the victim got what he deserved, while another was excused because he could not have convicted the defendant. Some prospective jurors had learned of the defendant not from recent publicity but from parents or friends, and were thereby predisposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Given the varied reasons for the partiality we cannot say that the raw number of disqualifications, in itself, causes us to question the impartiality of the qualified jurors. It is clear from the totality of the circumstances that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was not compromised due to the judge\u2019s failure to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a change in venue. The defendant has fallen far short of meeting his burden of showing that he was \u201cgenerally and substantially prejudged\u201d such that \u201cit was practically impossible to empanel an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonomi, supra </em>at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">4. <em>The Massachusetts wiretap statute. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in failing to suppress<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the fruits of the Federal surveillance because he was not served with a complete copy of all the recordings thirty days prior to trial pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 O 1 (1990 ed.) (discovery provision). Section 99 O 1 provides in pertinent part: \u201c[I]n any criminal trial where the commonwealth intends to offer in evidence any portions of the contents of any interception or any evidence derived therefrom the defendant shall be served with a complete copy of each document and item which make up each application, renewal application, warrant, renewal order, and return pursuant to which the information was obtained.\u201d If the defendant is not served with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>specified document and items, the intercepted communication and any evidence derived therefrom are rendered illegally obtained and are inadmissible. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The defendant does not dispute that thirty days prior to trial he received copies of all the tapes the Commonwealth intended to use as evidence against him. Rather, the defendant argues that he is entitled to receive <em>all </em>the recordings made during the Federal surveillance as a condition precedent to the admission in evidence of any portion of the recordings. The defendant argues that \u00a7 99 O 1 applies to the surveillance conducted by the Federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">While we reserved our opinion on a similar issue in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Picardi, </em>401 Mass. 1008 (1988), we now consider whether the discovery provision of the wiretap statute is applicable to interceptions made by the Federal government, authorized by order of a Federal court. We are persuaded that \u00a7 99 O 1 does not apply to such evidence. We interpret \u00a7 99 O 1 to apply only to evidence obtained pursuant to the application, warrant, renewal application, and return provisions of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 F-M. Our conclusion follows from the statute which provides, \u201c[T]he defendant shall be served with a complete copy of each document and item which make up each <em>application, renewal application, warrant, renewal order, and </em>return\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 O 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">As the General Court defined each of the emphasized terms in c. 272, \u00a7 99 F-M, we assign the definition of each of the emphasized terms to \u00a7 99 O l.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, defendant is entitled to documents and items which comprise each application, renewal application, warrant, and return filed, issued, or requested pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 F-M. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>application in the present case was submitted, the warrant issued, the renewal granted, and return made pursuant to Federal law, it necessarily follows that the discovery provisions of the statute do not apply.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>District Attorney for the Plymouth Dist. </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>386 Mass. 218, 224-225 (1982). As the recordings were lawfully obtained under Federal law, we know of no basis under the statute which would entitle the defendant the automatic right to discover copies of <em>all </em>the recordings made during the Federal surveillance in circumstances where he had received discovery of all recordings which were to be offered in evidence. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">5. <em>The admissibility of Zannino\u2019s statements of April 3, 1981. </em>During the trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence, in the form of a tape recording, of a conversation Ila-rio Zannino had with two associates on April 3, 1981. The essence of the conversation, drawn from the transcript of grand jury proceedings is presented in the margin.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant objected to Zannino\u2019s statements as hearsay. The judge admitted Zannino\u2019s statements as statements made by a joint venturer in furtherance of a joint enterprise. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 543 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>370 Mass. 703, 708-709 (1976), we stated the well-settled rule that \u201cout-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>court statements by joint criminal venturers are admissible against the others if the statements are made \u2018both during the pendency of the cooperative effort and in furtherance of its goal.\u2019 \u201d This exception does not apply after the criminal enterprise has ended, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 71 (1986), but does apply where the joint venturers are acting to conceal the crime that formed the basis of the enterprise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 709-710 &amp; n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The defendant contends that the joint venture had ended at the time Zannino made the statements in issue. On this basis, the defendant argues that Zannino\u2019s statements are unreliable hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 340 (1983) (reliability derives from continuation of joint enterprise).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Efforts on the part of a joint venturer to conceal the occurrence of the enterprise\u2019s unlawful purpose or to effect an escape warrant the inference that the joint venture continued through the time the statements were made. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 709-710. Absent a circumstance such as where the declarant had been incarcerated at the time the statement was made, as was the. case in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, supra </em>at 71, or where the declarant has been apprehended before the statement had been made, as was the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dahlstrom, </em>345 Mass. 130, 132 (1962), we cannot say that the joint venture had terminated at the time the statements were made. The relationship of the defendant and the declarant as revealed through conversations intercepted on March 12, 1981, and the circumstances in which the statements at issue were made, give us little difficulty concluding that the judge was within his discretion in ruling that there was \u201c[a]n adequate probability of the existence of ... [a continuing] common venture . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, supra </em>at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The defendant argues that Zannino made the statements only to boast or brag of the incident. The defendant\u2019s argument that Zannino\u2019s discourse was nothing more than bragging is untenable. The defendant and Zannino had previously discussed the \u201cproblem\u201d that Patrizzi was causing them. Zannino stated he knew \u201cwhat to do\u201d on receipt of information revealing Patrizzi\u2019s whereabouts. At an unknown point in time Patrizzi was killed. The defendant will not be heard to say that Zannino was not attempting to limit the flow of information concerning a situation he had previously discussed and which remained undiscovered at the time he made the statements in issue. Zannino\u2019s statements may have been boastful but in this instance the boast masked a desire to conceal the fact of the killing and the identity of the killers. As this end served to benefit both Zannino and the defendant, this overlap of interests \u201ctends in some degree to assure\u201d that Zannino\u2019s statements are minimally reliable. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">6. <em>Anonymous jury. </em>We come now to the two interrelated errors committed at trial which require us to conclude that we must reverse the conviction and order a new trial. These errors involve the use of an anonymous jury, and, as will be explained, were compounded by the conduct of an examination by the trial judge of some members of the jury during the course of the trial in the absence of the prosecutor, defense counsel, and the defendant. The relevant facts pertaining to the empanelment of an anonymous jury are these.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Prior to summoning the venire, the Commonwealth moved for empanelment of an anonymous jury. The Commonwealth argued that an anonymous jury was necessary as a precautionary measure \u201cto insure that the jurors are free from intimidation, threats, or corrupt attempts to influence or purchase their votes.\u201d The Commonwealth, however, did not seek to sequester the jury. Without written opinion, the motion judge granted the motion over the defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">At the outset, the judge adopted the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that jurors not be told of their anonymity to avoid the possibility that they would draw any adverse inference against the defendant. Thus, he gave no instruction to the jurors to draw no inference adverse to the defendant from the fact (then unknown to the jurors) of their anonymity. The judge did, however, authorize all prospective jurors to complete a six-page questionnaire pertaining to their background.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Both parties used the responses to these questions to frame their voir dire inquiry and to exercise peremptory challenges. During voir dire the judge questioned each prospective juror and permitted both the Commonwealth and defense counsel an opportunity for further questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>During the course of the trial, a court officer reported to the judge that several jurors had complained that the defendant was giving them the \u201cwhammy\u201d or \u201cevil eye.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Some of the jurors said they felt intimidated by the defendant and believed that he was writing down information about them. In response to this occurrence the judge interviewed each juror in chambers after discussing the matter with counsel. The purpose of the interviews was to learn of the reported conduct and assess the impartiality of the jurors. Each juror was interviewed individually. Neither the defense counsel nor the prosecutor was present during the interviews. The court stenographer was present during each interview and a transcript of the proceedings was made available to counsel immediately after the interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">During the course of the interviews, the judge discussed the alleged incident and told the jurors that he often sees defendants writing notes during trial and that the defendant\u2019s actions could be explained given his interest in the proceedings. The judge also told most of the jurors that their identities were concealed as a matter of standard operating procedure in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judge concluded each interview after determining that the juror being interviewed remained impartial given the circumstances. After concluding the interviews the judge reported to counsel that the matter was of \u201cno consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The defendant argues that the judge erred in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to empanel an anonymous jury. The defendant\u2019s argument has three aspects. First, the defendant argues that empaneling an anonymous jury tainted the presumption of innocence, thereby infringing on his due process right to a fair trial. Second, the defendant argues that the complained-of procedure impaired his right to exercise his peremptory challenges, thereby infringing on his right to an impartial jury. Third, the defendant argues that the use of an anonymous jury violated G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 66 (1990 ed.),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which provides: \u201cA prisoner indicted for a crime punishable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>with death or imprisonment for life, upon demand by him or his counsel upon the clerk, shall have a list of the jurors who have been returned. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We agree that the defendant, charged as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree and punishable with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, is a member of the class to whom the subject statute is addressed. The Commonwealth has cited no other capital cases in the nation where the defendant stood trial in front of an anonymous jury, and we have been unable to locate any. The Federal courts that have approved the use of an anonymous jury have expressly noted that \u201cin capital cases, the law requires the disclosure of the names and addresses of prospective jurors . . . before trial. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3432.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scarfo, </em>850 F.2d 1015, 1023 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 910 (1988). In the Commonwealth, this rule is embodied in G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">We conclude that the words \u201clist of the jurors\u201d in \u00a7 66 include prospective jurors\u2019 names and addresses for several reasons. First, such construction accords with the plain meaning of these words. Next, the history of \u00a7 66 reveals that its drafters intended that jurors\u2019 names be given to defendants in capital cases. Like its Federal counterpart \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3432 (1988) \u2014 \u00a7 66 is derived from the English practice of providing a list of jurors to the defendants in certain capital cases. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>379 Mass. 564, 575 &amp; n.4 (1980). In turn, this English practice was codified in a statute expressly requiring that these defendants receive \u201ca list of the witnesses that shall be produced on the trial for proving the . . . indictment, and of the jury, mentioning the <em>names, profession, and place of abode of the said witnesses and </em>jurors\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Logan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>144 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>U.S. 263, 305 (1892), quoting the statute of 7 Anne, c. 21, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Moreover, under established principles of statutory construction, we presume that the Legislature does not intend \u201cto enact a barren and ineffective provision.\u201d <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 189 (1969). See <em>O\u2019Shea </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>345 Mass. 175, 179 (1962). To conclude that the information given to the defendant at trial was sufficient to comply with the mandate of \u00a7 66 would render this statute a virtual nullity because of the common law rule which is an inherent part of the law governing jury challenges. \u201cConcomitant to the use of both peremptory challenges and challenges for cause must be the implied right to use reasonable means to gather information which will aid the parties in the intelligent exercise of challenges toward the constitutionally mandated goal of a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, supra </em>at 577. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>604 F.2d 121, 142 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 907 (1980), citing <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202 (1965) (\u201cA criminal defendant is entitled, under the law, to a fair and impartial jury. To be sure, there must be sufficient information elicited on <em>voir dire </em>to permit a defendant to intelligently exercise not only his challenges for cause, but also his peremptory challenges, the right to which has been specifically acknowledged by the Supreme Court . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">There appears no doubt that the drafters of \u00a7 66 intended to give defendants charged with crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for life, or their counsel, the additional right to obtain the names and addresses of those who would sit in their judgment. The facts of the present case readily illustrate the rationale for this rule: trial counsel has complained that he was unable to determine whether he had had previous encounters with the son of a prospective juror who worked for the district attorney\u2019s office, and with the husband of a prospective juror who worked as a police officer. While compelling reasons might justify withholding this information in other contexts, \u00a7 66 clearly mandates that the extreme nature of the punishment meted out in such cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>warrants the disclosure of the names and addresses of the jurors.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Like its Federal counterpart, \u00a7 66 \u201cis mandatory . . . and failure to allow defendant its benefits [is] plain error.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>442 F.2d 346, 348 (5th Cir. 1971). See <em>Logan, supra </em>at 304 (\u201cthe words of the existing statute are too plain to be misunderstood\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Although the judge\u2019s failure to follow the mandate of \u00a7 66 requires the reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction, we nonetheless discuss the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims primarily because we deem it appropriate to outline the circumstances in which a trial judge may allow the empanelment of an anonymous jury. The need to give trial judges guidance in the future in regard to crimes not involving life imprisonment warrants this discussion. Thus, we address also the trial judge\u2019s failure to handle the anonymous jury issue in accordance with the mandates of Federal constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution embodies the notion, reaching back to Roman law, that a \u201cshield of innocence surrounds a defendant on trial.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>757 F.2d 1359, 1363, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>474 U.S. 819 (1985), citing <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 432, 453-454 (1895). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>This so-called \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d is \u201ca basic component of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice.\u201d <em>Estelle </em>v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 503 (1976). In Estelle, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a State may not \u2014 consistent with the presumption of innocence \u2014 create trial conditions that affect the jurors\u2019 perception of the defendant unless there is a substantial government interest in doing so. <em>Id. </em>at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The empanelment of an anonymous jury triggers due process scrutiny because this practice is likely to taint the jurors\u2019 opinion of the defendant, thereby burdening the presumption of innocence. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 1364. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vario, </em>943 F.2d 236, 239 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 882 (1992); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tutino, </em>883 F.2d 1125, 1132 (2d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1081 (1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scarfo, </em>850 F.2d 1015, 1023-1025 (3d Cir. 1988). The due process clause precludes the empanelment of an anonymous jury at a criminal trial unless anonymity is necessary to protect the jurors from harm or improper influence. See <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 1365. Henceforth, we shall require that no anonymous jury is to be empaneled in the courts of the Commonwealth unless the trial judge has first determined on adequate evidence that anonymity is truly necessary and has made written findings on the question. Further, the due process clause requires that reasonable precautions be taken to minimize the effect of the jurors\u2019 anonymity on their perception of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Scarfo, supra </em>at 1025.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Federal appellate courts have upheld various methods of minimizing the effect of anonymity on the jurors\u2019 minds. Some trial judges chose to conceal the security reasons that prompted the court to withhold the jurors\u2019 names. One trial judge, for instance, told the jurors that they would remain anonymous so as to prevent the media from interfering with their privacy. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 1365 n.l. Other judges thought it best to reveal to the jurors that their anonymity was designed to protect them and their families from the possibility of harm or improper influence. These judges, however, added extensive instructions calculated to impress upon the jurors that no inference should be drawn with respect to the culpability of the defendant. See, e.g., <em>Scarfo, supra </em>at 1026-1028. No comparable curative instructions were given to the jury in this case at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Under due process principles, if jurors become aware of their anonymity \u2014 as happened in the present case \u2014 the judge must take affirmative measures to protect the due process rights of the accused. The judge did not mention anonymity until certain jurors complained that the defendant was \u201cgiving them the evil eye.\u201d At that time, the judge conducted individual conferences with the jurors.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>of these conferences, some of the jurors indicated that they already knew that their names had been withheld. On hearing this information, the judge did not inquire into the source of the jurors\u2019 knowledge. Specifically, the judge did not attempt to ascertain whether the jurors had heard of their anonymity through the numerous newspaper reports that surrounded the trial.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If that were the case, the jurors were likely to have been aware of the actual reason for their anonymity. They would, then, have inferred that the judge attempted to hide his belief that the defendant posed a threat to their safety when he made the (inaccurate) statement that anonymity is standard procedure. On these facts, it is evident that the judge did not handle the issue of the jurors\u2019 anonymity with the reasonable care required by the due process clause.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Last, we hold that the judge also erred when he barred the defendant and his counsel from the voir dire that followed the \u201cwhammy\u201d incident, thereby compounding the prejudice caused by the mishandling of the anonymous jury issue.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cWhen a judge conducts an inquiry about a consequential matter, such as alleged serious misconduct of jurors, there is a requirement, deriving from the constitutional right of confrontation, that the defendant and his counsel be present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bobilin, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 415 (1988), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robichaud, </em>358 Mass. 300, 301-303 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 843 n.1 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>22 Mass.

But, just so there\u2019s a record of it, it\u2019s denied at the moment until I get a feeling as to what issues are going to be presented once I start talking with these jurors.\u201d Counsel objected again to anonymity during jury selection, pointing out that this practice prevented him from exercising fully-informed challenges with respect to a juror whose son worked for a district attorney\u2019s office and to a juror whose husband was a police officer. The defendant, therefore, preserved his right to appeal the allowance of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to withhold the jurors\u2019 names and addresses. See J.R.

The defendant\u2019s argument was straightforward: he argues in his brief that, by its plain terms, G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 66 (1990 ed.), entitled him to a list of prospective jurors. \u201cA brief should be no longer than is necessary to convince and persuade the panel of the position taken and a request for relief ... An attorney should not prejudice his case by being prolix. He should make his points and conclude. Conciseness creates a favorable context and mood for the appellate judges.\u201d J.R. Nolan, Appellate Procedure, <em>supra </em>at 11, \u00a7 24. The defendant\u2019s brief, which raised numerous claims of error, was generally concise and terse. The entire section on jurors\u2019 anonymity spanned approximately two pages. The heading of the section indicated that the defendant would argue both constitutional and statutory violations. After describing the relevant facts, the body of the section devoted about two and one-half paragraphs to legal arguments. One paragraph argued that jurors\u2019 anonymity is constitutionally prohibited when it creates an unreasonable burden on the presumption of innocence, and cited to a seminal case addressing this issue. In another paragraph, the defendant\u2019s brief addressed the issue of peremptory challenges and presented the uncomplicated argument that \u00a7 66 \u2014 which the defendant reproduced in an addendum \u2014 \u201crequires that the list of potential jurors be made available to the defendant.\u201d Finally, a concluding paragraph stated that the \u201cprocess employed here violated our statutory scheme and the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to a fair jury trial and the presumption of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In this context, it is clear that the defendant made more than a mere passing reference to his statutory argument. Cf. <em>Karen Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Li-zotte, </em>396 Mass. 143, 148 n.7 (1985). In spite of the compressed style of his appellate brief, the defendant properly presented his \u201ccontentions . . . and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on.\u201d Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). It is our duty to address the defendant\u2019s claim notwithstanding the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to respond to it. See <em>Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Nonaka, </em>414 Mass. 187, 191 (1993) (principle of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>argued by litigant but not addressed in opponent\u2019s brief dispositive of case).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The United States Code contains a similar statute which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA person charged with treason or other capital offense shall . .' . be furnished with a . . . list of the veniremen . . . stating the place of abode of each venireman . . . .\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3432 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In a colloquy with the trial judge, trial counsel and the district attorney discussed the possibility that jurors\u2019 names and addresses be given only to the parties\u2019 attorneys.

The dissent overlooks the fact that the judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to withhold the jurors\u2019 names, thereby making it futile \u2014 and indeed highly improper \u2014 for the defendant to request a list of prospective jurors from the clerk. The law traditionally does not require litigants to make a futile demand in order to preserve their rights. Cf. <em>Pupecki </em>v. <em>James Madison Corp., </em>376 Mass. 212, 218 (1978) (shareholder\u2019s demand that corporation itself bring suit is prerequisite to shareholder\u2019s derivative suit unless such demand would be futile).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The dissent misconstrues the Federal decisions dealing with juror anonymity. These decisions do not stand for the proposition that, in every individual case, the court must balance \u201cthe government\u2019s interest in safeguarding jurors and preserving the integrity of the judicial process with the defendant\u2019s interest in avoiding erosion of the presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 535. Rather, the Federal courts have used a method known in the law as \u201cdefinitional balancing,\u201d whereby a seminal decision \u2014 such as <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>757 F.2d 1359 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>474 U.S. 819 (1985) \u2014 articulates a substantive rule which itself strikes the desired balance between the competing interests at stake. See Nimmer, The Right to Speak from Times to Time: First Amendment Theory Applied to Libel and Misapplied to Privacy, 56 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>L. Rev. 935, 942 (1968). See also Aleinikoff, Constitutional Law in the Age of Balancing, 96 Yale L.J. 943, 948 (1987). This rule may be applied in subsequent cases without additional balancing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Drawing on the competing interests which the dissent describes, the Federal courts clearly have set forth the substantive rule of constitutional law governing juror anonymity: First, the trial judge must make a finding of necessity (which was not made in the present case). Next, the trial judge must take reasonable precautions to minimize the burden on the presumption of innocence occasioned by jurors\u2019 anonymity (which, as the text of this opinion describes, the judge failed to do). See <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 1365. For cases applying this rule without additional balancing, see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vario, </em>943 F.2d 236, 239 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1036 (1992); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tutino, </em>883 F.2d 1125, 1132 (2d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1081 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\">We note that the judge never made a finding that the defendant actually attempted to intimidate the jurors by making eye contact with them. In a colloquy that preceded the individual conferences, the judge explained that a television set in the courtroom prevented his observing the defendant. Defense counsel indicated that he did not notice the defendant \u201cin any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>untoward way making any kind of views around the courtroom to the jury or anyone else.\u201d Counsel also suggested that his associate be asked to state for the record whether he had observed any such incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The judge, however, rejected this offer. The judge stated that he would order the removal of the television set and tell the defendant that, \u201cany askew looks and I\u2019ll have his head.\u201d The judge explained that he would assuage the jurors\u2019 fears by telling them that most defendants write down notes during their trial, but that such notes could not contain jurors\u2019 names because anonymity is the standard procedure. The defendant objected to telling the jurors of their anonymity and moved for a mistrial. The defendant also suggested that the judge delay any action until the prosecutor could review a case on jurors\u2019 anonymity which the prosecutor said contained potentially helpful curative instructions. The judge replied, \u201cWell, he\u2019s not going to tell you too much.\" The judge then denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, denied the defendant\u2019s request that he be present during the individual conferences, and stated that he would provide a transcript of these proceedings so that any errors could be corrected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We note that, in the course of jury empanelment, a prospective juror disclosed that she and other members of her panel had discussed an article that appeared in the Salem News. Trial counsel informed the judge that this article appeared on the front page of the newspaper and reported that an anonymous jury would be empaneled in order to prevent threats to jurors and their families. Counsel requested that the judge determine whether the panel members knew of their anonymity, but the judge denied this request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\">These facts also underscore the need for trial judges to give carefully designed instructions relative to jurors\u2019 anonymity both at the start of trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>and as a part of their instructions. See, e.g., <em>Scarfo, supra </em>at 1026-1028. Moreover, it should be noted that in both <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Scarfo, </em>cases which did not involve a capital offense and on which the dissent relies heavily, the jurors were sequestered at the outset of trial. The jury in this case were not sequestered. In light of these differences, the judge\u2019s failure to make a finding of necessity \u2014 which was made both in <em>Scarfo </em>and in <em>Thomas </em>\u2014 is not a factor to be glossed over.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The failure to allow the defendant to attend a proceeding in which the judge inquires into a consequential matter is not reversible error per se. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>412 Mass. 267, 287 n.14 (1992), and cases cited. We disagree with the dissent\u2019s contention that we obfuscate the issue whether the erroneous exclusion of the defendant from the voir dire proceedings in the present case constitutes by itself reversible error. <em>Post </em>at 540-541.

This theoretical support for the <em>Robichaud </em>court\u2019s decision remains sound. See generally Annot., 33 A.L.R.4th 430, 434-435 (1984). Moreover, notwithstanding the overruling of <em>Medcoff </em>by the Michigan Supreme Court, see <em>post </em>at 544, the principles set forth in <em>Robichaud </em>have remained an integral part of Massachusetts law. See <em>Martino, supra </em>at 284-287, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In <em>Martino, supra </em>at 284-286, decided just over one year ago, we cited <em>Robichaud </em>for the proposition that the defendant had the right to attend a proceeding in which the trial judge questioned a juror about a \u201cserious problem\u201d which she felt had arisen during trial. (This proceeding disclosed that the juror\u2019s grandfather\u2019s murder conviction was not reported in her juror questionnaire form, and we held that the erroneous exclusion of the defendant did not warrant reversal primarily because the defendant had agreed to the course of action taken by the trial judge.) In the present case as well, the <em>Robichaud </em>rule gave the defendant the right to attend a proceeding in which serious problems relating to the jurors were to be discussed. We shall adhere to our court\u2019s long-standing tradition of jurisprudential independence and we reaffirm the principles expounded in <em>Robichaud </em>and its progeny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The Commonwealth\u2019s attempt to draw a parallel between the present case and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Senati, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 307 (1975), is misplaced. In <em>Senati, </em>the defendant forfeited his right to be present at his trial by repeatedly refusing to obey the judge\u2019s order that he return to the dock and refrain from shouting accusations that police officers had lied. The defendant in the present case did not display such unrelenting determination not to comply with courtroom decorum. Should a defendant engage in inappropriate conduct in such circumstances, a judge is not without power to take such remedial action as may be necessary. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 344 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b547-7\">Nolan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiV\">(dissenting, with whom Lynch, J., joins).

The court then discusses two aspects of the anonymous jury \u201cerror,\u201d the burden on the presumption of innocence and the statutory challenge. The court reserves most of its fire for the statutory challenge, concluding that the judge\u2019s failure to comply with the statute was error. I disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion on each issue and dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">1. <em>G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 66. </em>The court is in error when it says that \u201c[t]he defendant argues that the use of an anonymous jury violated G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 66.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 523. The defendant raises no such argument and makes only a passing reference to the subject statute in his brief. The \u201cso-called\u201d argument is reproduced in full as follows: \u201cOur statutory scheme for the trial of life felonies requires that the list of potential jurors be made available to the defendant. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 66.\u201d Not only is the statement incorrect, as I shall discuss below, but it falls far below what is required to raise an appellate argument in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Apart from our directive under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1990 ed.), our appellate jurisdiction in this case is limited to those arguments raised by the defendant in his brief. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). \u201cAn argument on an issue . . . shall require more than a mere passing reference.\u201d J.R. Nolan, Appellate Procedure 158 (1991). See <em>Karen Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>396 Mass. 143, 148 n.7 (1985) (Liacos, J.) (one sentence treatment of issue is \u201cinsufficient appellant argument\u201d), quoting <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Banks, 377 Mass. 909, 909 (1979). Given these pronouncements, and the presence of only a mere passing reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u00a7 66 in the defendant\u2019s brief, I conclude that the defendant waived the argument, assuming he had one to waive.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth did not cite the statute or respond to this \u201cphantom\u201d argument in its brief. A response was not necessary. The defendant did not raise the argument. Thus, the court reverses a conviction of being an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree on the basis of an argument the defendant neither raised, nor briefed, nor argued in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">For the purposes of argument, I shall assume that the defendant preserved the issue below and raised it in his brief. The court is wrong to conclude that the defendant was entitled to the list of jurors. I begin with the statute, which provides: \u201cA prisoner indicted for a crime punishable with death or imprisonment for life, upon demand by him or his counsel upon the clerk, shall have a list of the jurors who have been returned . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 66. The statute expressly provides that the defendant or his counsel must first demand the list from the clerk before he is entitled to receive it. Neither the defendant nor his counsel ever demanded the list from the clerk.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant waived his rights to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The court relies on an analogous Federal statute, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3432 (1988), which provides: \u201cA person charged with treason or other capital offense <em>shall ... be furnished </em>with a copy of the indictment and a list of the veniremen . . . stating the place of abode of each venireman . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). The court analogizes G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 66, to the Federal statute and declares, \u201cLike its Federal counterpart \u00a7 66 \u2018is mandatory . . . and failure to allow de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>fendant its benefits [is] plain error\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). <em>Ante </em>at 526. While the Federal statute is plainly mandatory, as evidenced by the word \u201cshall,\u201d the same cannot be said of \u00a7 66. A judge\u2019s obligation to provide the list to the defendant under \u00a7 66 is expressly conditioned on the defendant\u2019s demand for the list. Absent a demand from the defendant, a judge is not obligated to provide the list. The State statutory scheme is clear: No demand, no list; no demand, no error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the defendant\u2019s failure to demand the list and assert his statutory rights is not error and relief is not warranted under \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">2. <em>Presumption of </em>innocence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the court\u2019s discussion on the presumption of innocence is dictum, I take issue with it. The court opines that the procedures the judge employed in empaneling an anonymous jury violated the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law. To this end, the court concludes, shall I say, that the empanelment of an anonymous jury im-permissibly burdened the presumption of innocence. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">First, the court fails to address the competing interests at stake and then fails to balance the competing interests in its scantily reasoned due process analysis. In spite of this, the court issues directives to the trial court on the management of anonymous juries in the future. I am at a loss to understand how the court can say what the due process clause requires based on the facts of this case without first conducting the requisite balancing test and setting forth its reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>and conclusions. Even more troubling is the court\u2019s willingness to elevate \u201cguidelines\u201d which other courts have articulated for the use of anonymous juries to the rule of law. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tutino, </em>883 F.2d 1125, 1132 (2d Cir. 1989) , cert. denied, 493 U.S. 910 (1990), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>757 F.2d 1359, 1365 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States, 474 </em>U.S. 819 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"AME\">The Federal pronouncements on the due process implications of empaneling an anonymous jury are clear \u2014 \u201calthough the presumption of innocence is of significant importance, and is protected by the due process clause . . . there is no <em>per se </em>rule that it may not be burdened.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>757 F.2d 1359, 1364 (2d Cir. 1985). Accordingly, the Federal courts have balanced the government\u2019s interest in safeguarding jurors and preserving the integrity of the judicial process with the defendant\u2019s interest in avoiding erosion of the presumption of innocence when called on to analyze a due process claim arising from the empanelment of an anonymous jury. <em>Id. </em>at 1365. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gotti, 111 </em>F. Supp. 224, 227 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (balance integrity of judicial process against preserving presumption of innocence); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>743 F. Supp. 134, 137 (E.D.N.Y. 1990) (balancing competing interests); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edmond, </em>730 F. Supp. 1144, 1145 (D.D.C. 1990) (court must balance interests of criminal justice system against defendants\u2019 interests), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tutino, supra </em>at 1132-1133, and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scarfo, </em>850 F.2d 1015, 1022-1023 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 910 (1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>664 F. Supp. 861, 862 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (balance government\u2019s interest in safeguarding jurors with defendants\u2019 interest in avoiding erosion of presumption of innocence). To be sure, a practice burdening the presumption of innocence calls for \u201cclose judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 1363, citing <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 504 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">To this end, the court\u2019s opinion is noteworthy for what it does not say. The court chooses to ignore the substantial government interest underlying the Commonwealth\u2019s request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>empanelment of an anonymous jury \u2014 protecting the jurors and their families from violence, actual or threatened, and shielding the jurors from the potential taint of external influence, thereby preserving the integrity of the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In support of its motion for the empanelment of an anonymous jury, the Commonwealth cited a number of Federal cases involving reputed members of organized crime in which the courts looked with approval on the use of anonymous juries. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra. </em>The Commonwealth argued that the defendant was connected with organized crime and was as \u201cdangerous\u201d as the defendants in the Federal cases cited. The Commonwealth further pointed to threats to the judicial system and an incident of jury tampering that had occurred during the defendant\u2019s Federal trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commonwealth concluded its argument quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 1362: the defendant faced serious charges which leave him \u201clittle to lose by tampering with witnesses or obstructing the trial.\u201d As the judge allowed the motion without written opinion, it is safe to assume that it was a combination of these factors that formed the basis of his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">I am satisfied that three facts, the jury tampering which occurred during the defendant\u2019s Federal trial, the defendant\u2019s link with organized crime,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the severity of the pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>alty facing the defendant, taken together, justified the judge\u2019s decision to empanel an anonymous jury. In my view, the judge properly responded given his \u201c \u2018heavy responsibility\u2019 ... to preserve the impartiality of the jury,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>379 Mass. 564, 574-575 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 794 (1977), and the significant government interests at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The court makes much of the fact that the judge did not make written findings in support of his decision to empanel an anonymous jury. <em>Ante </em>at 527 &amp; n.21. The court\u2019s reliance on this issue is a stalking horse. In the celebrated case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>604 F.2d 121, 133-134, 137 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 907 (1980), the trial judge decided sua sponte to empanel an anonymous jury. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Melendez, supra </em>at 136. Nonetheless, the <em>Barnes </em>court upheld the judge\u2019s decision to empanel an anonymous jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit expressly rejected a defendant\u2019s challenge to a judge\u2019s decision to empanel an anonymous jury based on the judge\u2019s failure to issue written findings supporting his decision to empanel an anonymous jury. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Eufrasio, </em>935 F.2d 553, 574 (3d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Idone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>502 U.S. 925 (1991). In so holding, the <em>Eufrasio </em>court noted that the judge in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scarfo, supra, </em>also failed to issue written findings when granting the government\u2019s motion for an anonymous jury. <em>Id. </em>at 574. On appeal, the <em>Scarfo </em>court, like the <em>Eufrasio </em>court, upheld the use of the anonymous jury despite the absence of written findings supporting the judge\u2019s decision. While a judge is advised to reduce to writing his or her reasoning supporting a decision to empanel an anonymous jury, a failure to do so is not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>I turn now to the burden on the presumption of innocence. The court\u2019s field of vision is narrowed to this point. The court declares that \u201c[u]nder due process principles, if jurors become aware of their anonymity \u2014 as happened in the present case \u2014 the judge must take affirmative measures to protect the due process rights of the accused.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 528. The court wrongly assumes that the presumption of innocence is necessarily burdened and \u201cthat anti-defendant bias is the only possible, or even the most likely, reaction\u201d to suspect when jurors know of their anonymity. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scarfo, supra </em>at 1026. While the court offers no evidence to support its conclusion, there is empirical evidence demonstrating that empaneling an anonymous jury does not work to a defendant\u2019s detriment, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>754 F. Supp. 202, 202-203 (D.D.C. 1990), wherein the court discusses cases in which anonymous juries have acquitted defendants. Indeed, as the <em>Scarfo </em>court wrote: \u201cPredicting juror responses to the anonymity practice is pure speculation.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] A juror who fears a defendant\u2019s retaliation might be more apt to return a guilty verdict despite such fears rather than because of them. ... If, however, anonymity dispels apprehension, it serves the ideal of dispassionate judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scarfo, supra </em>at 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The inquiry, however, does not stop here. For one must consider <em>all </em>facts that bear on the issue of the magnitude of the burden on the presumption of innocence, either positively or negatively, to determine the net effect. This leads to the next point of error which I assign to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The court suggests, <em>ante </em>at 528, that the judge in the present case took no precautions to minimize the burden on the presumption of innocence. This aspect of the court\u2019s opinion is misleading. The judge protected the due process rights of the accused. First, most of the jurors learned of their anonymity from the judge. After informing the jurors of their anonymity, the judge probed the impartiality of each juror. In each and every case, the juror responded that he or she could remain impartial given the circumstances. Further, the judge gave a detailed instruction on the presumption of innocence while charging the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The court makes much of the fact that the judge failed to ascertain how some of the jurors had learned of their anonymity. <em>Ante </em>at 529. The court misses the point. The crucial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>issue is the continuing impartiality of the jurors \u2014 a fact that the judge properly studied and addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Applying the balancing test and weighing the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in safeguarding both the jurors and the integrity of the judicial process against the defendant\u2019s interest in preserving the presumption of innocence, I conclude that the scale tips heavily in favor of the Commonwealth. This conclusion comports with numerous opinions of the United States Supreme Court which have not ignored the harsh realities of criminal trials and have upheld the use in certain circumstances of practices that might otherwise impermissibly burden the presumption of innocence. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 344 (1970) (defendant appearing bound and gagged before the jury permissible in certain extreme circumstances); <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>475 U.S. 560, 569 (1986) (presence of uniformed State troopers in courtroom did not burden presumption of innocence given need). \u201cThe law as to jury selection is not so unbending that it cannot, or should not, be accommodated to the realities of modern day trials . . .\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnes, supra </em>at 142-143. \u201cRecognizing that jurors are quite aware that the defendant appearing before them did not arrive there by choice or happenstance, we have never tried, and could never hope, to eliminate from trial procedures every reminder that the State has chosen to marshal its resources against a defendant to punish him for allegedly criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Hol-brook </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>475 U.S. 560, 567 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">3. <em>Juror interviews. </em>As to the alleged error involving the ex parte examination of the jurors, the court writes, \u201c[W]e hold that the judge erred when he barred the defendant and his counsel from the voir dire that followed the \u2018whammy\u2019 incident, thereby compounding the prejudice caused by the mishandling of the anonymous jury issue.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 530. This is obfuscation. It is not clear whether the ex parte incident was, in and of itself, error warranting reversal or merely an incident that compounded the prejudice resulting from empaneling an anonymous jury. I assume that it was error and express my views accordingly. The court misreads our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>precedent and wrongly concludes that the \u201cwhammy\u201d incident was of consequence, thereby necessitating the defendant\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>470 U.S. 522 (1985), the United States Supreme Court considered a case remarkably similar to the present case. <em>Gagnon </em>involved four codefend-ants. \u201cDuring the afternoon recess on the first day of trial the District Judge was discussing matters of law in open court with the [defendants], their respective counsel, and the Assistant United States Attorney, outside the presence of the jury. The bailiff entered the courtroom and informed the judge that one of the jurors . . . had expressed concern because he had noticed [defendant] Gagnon sketching portraits of the jury. Gagnon\u2019s attorney admitted that Gagnon had been sketching jury members during the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The trial judge then stated that he wanted to see the juror in his chambers to assess the juror\u2019s impartiality in light of the events. Gagnon\u2019s attorney was present during the voir dire. Neither the defendants, nor counsel for the other defendants, were present during the voir dire. The judge discussed the incident with the juror and concluded the meeting after eliciting from the juror his willingness to continue as an impartial juror. After the jury returned guilty verdicts on the counts charged, each of the four codefendants claimed that the judge violated their constitutional right to an impartial jury in excluding them from the voir dire. The Supreme Court, in a per curiam decision, rejected the defendants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The Court wrote, \u201cThe encounter between the judge, the juror, and Gagnon\u2019s lawyer was a short interlude in a complex trial; the conference was not the sort of event which every defendant had a right to personally attend .... [The defendants] could have done nothing had they been at the conference, nor would they have gained anything by attending. . . . Indeed, the presence of Gagnon and the other [defendants], their four counsel, and the prosecutor could have been counterproductive. [The juror] had quietly expressed some concern about the purposes of Gagnon\u2019s sketching, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the District Judge sought to explain the situation to the juror. The Fifth Amendment does not require that all parties be present when the judge inquires into such a <em>minor occur</em>rence.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Id. </em>at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Since the Court\u2019s ruling applied equally to the defendants whose counsel were not present at the voir dire, <em>Gagnon </em>is forceful authority for the argument that the \u201cwhammy\u201d incident in the present case is not a matter of consequence. Remarkably, however, this court does not cite <em>Gagnon </em>nor make any attempt to distinguish it from the present case. The similarities between the \u201cwhammy\u201d incident and the events in <em>Gagnon </em>are too striking to be ignored. The court offers no support for its conclusion that the \u201cwhammy\u201d incident is a matter of consequence in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the <em>Gagnon </em>incident was a \u201cminor occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Rather than addressing <em>Gagnon, </em>this court bases its decision on the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. To this end, the court relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robichaud, </em>358 Mass. 300 (1970). On this point the court comes out from the shadows, and errs, blinded by the light of its own decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">As a threshold matter, <em>Robichaud </em>is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Robichaud, </em>the defendant filed a motion for a mistrial after the close of evidence and before closing arguments. A hearing on the motion was held in the judge\u2019s lobby. The defendant, Robichaud, was not present at the hearing. Defense counsel objected to the court\u2019s allowing the hearing to proceed without the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">In support of the motion, the defendant produced two witnesses who testified that they had heard three of the jurors discussing his case at a local restaurant and heard them express their opinion that all of the defendants on trial were guilty. Two of the three jurors testified, admitting that they had discussed the case but denying that they had expressed such an opinion. The trial judge concluded that the jurors stood, impartial and denied the motion. The defendant was convicted, and appealed claiming that the trial judge erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>by conducting the hearing in his absence. This court agreed, and reversed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Four distinctions between <em>Robichaud </em>and the present case warrant a different result from that which we reached in <em>Robichaud. </em>-First, <em>Robichaud </em>concerned the defendant\u2019s exclusion from a hearing on a motion for a mistrial. The issue in the present case involves an ex parte voir dire of jurors stemming from claims of alleged misconduct by the defendant. Second, <em>Robichaud </em>involved two related questions, the continuing impartiality of the jurors <em>and </em>the merits of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The present case involves only the issue of the impartiality of the jurors. Third, the charges involved in <em>Robichaud </em>centered on a question of alleged misconduct by three jurors. The issue in the present case arose due to alleged misconduct of the defendant. Fourth, in <em>Robichaud, </em>the judge conducted a hearing and heard the testimony of four individuals to determine the veracity of the complaint. In the present case, the judge did not conduct the interviews to determine whether the defendant was giving the jurors the \u201cwhammy,\u201d but, rather, to insure that the jurors could be impartial, thereby safeguarding the defendant\u2019s right to trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">These distinctions warrant a different outcome from that which this court reached in <em>Robichaud. </em>The defendant does not have a right to be present at all stages of the proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacDonald (No. 1), </em>368 Mass. 395, 398-400 &amp; n.3 (1975). The guiding principle is that due process requires that the defendant be allowed to be present \u201cto the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence.\u201d <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 108 (1934). See K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1591 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">On the basis of this test, the defendant\u2019s presence during the interviews \u201cwas not required to ensure fundamental fairness or a \u2018reasonably substantial . . . opportunity to defend against the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>470 U.S. 522, 527 (1985), quoting <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 115. The defendant\u2019s presence at the interviews would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>been counterproductive. The jurors would not have openly and freely discussed the alleged incident had the defendant or his counsel been present. Considering \u201cthe justice or injustice of [the] exclusion ... in the light of the whole record,\u201d <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 115, the judge steered a prudent course in excluding the defendant and defense counsel from the interviews, and then, after completing the interviews, making the transcript of those interviews available to them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bobilin, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 415 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">While the court relies on <em>Robichaud, </em>the <em>Robichaud </em>court relied almost exclusively on a Michigan case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Medcoff, </em>344 Mich. 108 (1955). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robichaud, supra </em>at 302-303. The <em>Robichaud </em>court noted that <em>Medcoff </em>was \u201cthe only case found to be directly on point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Robichaud </em>court quoted at length from the <em>Medcoff </em>opinion, agreed with its reasoning, and adopted it in support of the so-called <em>Robichaud </em>rule. <em>Id. </em>at 302-303. The Michigan Supreme Court overruled <em>People </em>v. <em>Medcoff, supra, </em>in <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>400 Mich. 527, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Cargile </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>434 U.S. 967 (1977), and announced a new, less restrictive rule under which the defendant in this case could not possibly prevail. Thus, this court\u2019s decision is based on <em>Robichaud, </em>which is based on <em>Medcoff, </em>which has been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant does not raise one argument on appeal that warrants reversing his conviction. The court\u2019s decision tests the limits of interpolation, extrapolation, not to mention logic, justice, and the rule of law. The jury have spoken and the verdict deserves to stand. As the court concludes otherwise, I dissent.

The defense counsel, however, never pressed his demand on the clerk as required by statute. The defendant\u2019s reference during a motion argument to the need for names and addresses falls short of the statutory demand requirement. To use the court\u2019s phrase, <em>ante </em>at 524, \u201csuch construction accords with the plain meaning of these words.\u201d Further, I did not find a single reference to the subject statute in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\">I pause to cite two Federal cases that support the proposition that failure to comply with the \u201cmandatory\u201d Federal statute is not always reversible error, see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>63 F.2d 136, 137 (D.C.
