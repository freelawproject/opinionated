In her action for declaratory and injunctive relief, the plaintiff, Jean Murphy, challenges the constitutionality of the fee provisions of \u00a7 11 A. We hold that the challenged portions of \u00a7 11A violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The relevant facts are these. William Murphy, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, worked as an employee of A.A. Busch &amp; Co. of Massachusetts, Inc., until August of 1991. At that time, Murphy suffered a myocardial infarction for which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>hospitalized. Alleging that his heart condition arose from his employment, Murphy filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the Department of Industrial Accidents (department). On March 19, 1992, while his\u2019case was still pending, Murphy died of a heart attack. The plaintiff moved to amend her late husband\u2019s claim to include herself as a party and to request survivorship benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31 (1990 ed.). On June 25, 1992, an administrative judge of the department held a \u201cconference\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 28, in the course of which Murphy presented her case with the assistance of an attorney. On July 17, 1992, the judge issued an order denying Murphy\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Murphy then filed a verified complaint in the Superior Court by which she commenced the present case. She also filed an affidavit stating that she wished to obtain a hearing with the department in order to challenge the administrative judge\u2019s conference order. Murphy asserted that she wanted to proceed with the assistance of counsel but did not have the financial means to meet the filing fee required by \u00a7 11A as a prerequisite to obtaining a hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Murphy sought a decla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ration that the fee requirement of \u00a7 11A deprived her of the equal protection of the laws and violated her fundamental rights to seek legal redress for grievances and to proceed with the assistance of an attorney. In addition, Murphy requested a preliminary injunction precluding the department from implementing and enforcing the filing fee provisions of \u00a7 11 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">On July 29, 1992, a judge in the Superior Court, after a hearing, denied Murphy\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. Murphy petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court for interlocutory relief pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118 (1990 ed.). On September 11, 1992, the single justice ordered the department to accept Murphy\u2019s claim of appeal as timely for a nominal fee of $1. The single justice also granted \u201cthe petitioner leave to take an interlocutory appeal to a full panel of [the Appeals Court] with respect to the propriety of the single justice\u2019s order reducing the administrative appeal fee and to the issues presented to the single justice by the petition, including the issue of the constitutionality of that provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 30.\u201d We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Our workers\u2019 compensation act, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1-86, as amended through St. 1991, c. 398 (Act), is a \u201chumanitarian measure\u201d which the Legislature first enacted in 1911 (St. 1911, c. 751) in response to strong public dissatisfaction with the remedies provided by traditional tort actions. L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 1, at 2 (2d ed. 1981). See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). The Act is based on the legislative judgment that \u201chuman loss directly arising out of commercial and industrial enterprises\u201d is part of the operating cost of a business. <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 592 (1982), quoting <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 496 (1916). See <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 180, 183 (1932). The Act applies only to employees who come within its ambit. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24. The Act requires that participating employees waive their right to sue in tort for work-related injuries. <em>Id. </em>In return, the Act gives these employees the possibility of obtaining compensation for loss of wages or earning capacity caused by a work-related injury, regardless of the fault of their employers or the foreseeability of harm. See <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra; Akins\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 562 (1939); <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, supra. </em>See also G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 30, 31, 34, 34A, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>In 1991, the Legislature chose to overhaul the procedures by which injured workers (claimants) may seek compensation under the Act. See St. 1991, c. 398. As amended, the relevant portions of the Act establish four distinct procedural stages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Act provides for an initial informal conciliatory proceeding in which the claimant and his or her employer\u2019s insurer must cooperate with a conciliator in an effort to settle the case. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10. See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.08 (1993).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the claimant and the insurer do not reach an agreement, they may elect to submit the case to binding arbitration. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 10B. If arbitration is not sought, the unresolved claim is referred to the Industrial Accident Board (board) of the department. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 10, 10A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The referral of a claim to the board triggers the second stage of the process: a \u201cconference\u201d before an administrative judge of the department. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10A. See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10 (1993). The conference procedure was enacted (St. 1971, c. 974) to allow the board \u201cto expedite compensation claims without the necessity of a full hearing.\u201d <em>Assun-cao\u2019s Case, </em>372 Mass. 6, 9 (1977). At the conference, the parties must \u201cidentify the issues in dispute\u201d and \u201cproduce a summary of any anticipated testimony.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A (l).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The parties may also make oral arguments and submit evidence such as reports of injury, affidavits, or medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>records. Within seven days after the conference, the judge must issue a written order stating whether and to what extent relief should be granted. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10A (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">A party aggrieved by the judge\u2019s order may trigger the third stage of the review process: a \u201chearing\u201d of his or her claim. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11. See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.11 (1993). If the aggrieved party\u2019s claim involves a disputed medical question, an \u201cimpartial medical examiner\u201d must be appointed. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The impartial examiner must evaluate the claimant\u2019s condition and set forth his or her findings in a report.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At the hearing, the report constitutes prima facie evidence of the disputed medical issues. <em>Id. </em>The parties may not submit additional reports or depositions of other physicians \u201cby right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the administrative judge may authorize the submission of such additional evidence if warranted by \u201cthe complexity of the medical issues involved or the inadequacy of the report submitted by the impartial medical examiner.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>judge, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, then renders a decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Section 11A requires that claimants wishing to proceed to this evidentiary hearing with the assistance of counsel pay the filing fee as a prerequisite to obtaining access to the hearing if they need an \u201cimpartial medical examination.\u201d Further, \u00a7 11A imposes the filing fee on claimants who hired an attorney to assist in the presentation of their claim at the conference stage of the process even if they discharge the attorney prior to the evidentiary hearing. See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.11 (1) (c) (1993) (\u201cpayment of the requisite filing fee is required to perfect the appeal when a party represented by counsel at Conference discharges said counsel and thereafter appeals the Conference Order\u201d). The filing fee is justified by the need to \u201cdefray the cost of the [impartial] medical examination.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Murphy argues that the legislative classification distinguishing between claimants represented by counsel and those proceeding without legal representation violates the equal protection clause and art. 11. Murphy urges us to hold that the filing fee infringes on a claimant\u2019s \u201cfundamental\u201d rights to obtain relief and to proceed with the assistance of counsel. Thus, she claims, we should review this legislation under a standard of \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d Murphy argues that, because the classification is not \u201cprecisely tailored to serve a compelling state interest,\u201d we should declare it unconstitutional. Further, Murphy asserts, even if the classification does not infringe on a fundamental right, we should declare it uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>stitutional because it is not rationally related to any legitimate State interest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The department argues in response that the challenged classification merely \u201cregulates economic activity\u201d and does not infringe upon a fundamental right. The department asserts that the filing fee provisions of \u00a7 11A are an integral part of the legislative effort to establish a less litigious workers\u2019 compensation system. The department claims that the imposition of the filing fee only on claimants proceeding with the assistance of counsel is rationally related to the State\u2019s interest in deterring frivolous appeals, in defraying the cost of the impartial medical examination, and in exempting pro se claimants from the filing fee requirements. In these circumstances, the department concludes, the fee provisions survive equal protection scrutiny.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The equal protection clause provides that no State shall \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d This language essentially mandates that \u201call persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\u201d <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). The standard of review used to evaluate the constitutionality of a legislative classification under the equal protection clause varies with the nature of the challenged legislation. \u201cThe general rule is that legislation is presumed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440. See <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 649-650 (1977).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In the present case, we hold that the challenged classification does not survive constitutional scrutiny even under the minimal, rational basis standard of review. Therefore, we need not decide whether, as Murphy argued, the classification infringes on fundamentally protected constitutional rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">A State may not impose additional burdens on a class of litigants in an arbitrary or capricious manner. See <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56, 77 (1972). See also <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>486 U.S. 71, 83 (1988). In <em>Lindsey, </em>the United States Supreme Court struck down an Oregon statute requiring that tenants seeking to appeal from an eviction order post a bond equal to twice the amount of rent expected to accrue during the appellate process. The Court rejected the claim that this statute was rationally related to the State interest in deterring frivolous appeals. <em>Lindsey, supra </em>at 74-79. \u201cThe claim that the double-bond requirement operates to screen out frivolous appeals is unpersuasive,\u201d the Court stated, \u201cfor it not only bars nonfrivolous appeals by those who are unable to post the bond but also allows meritless appeals by others who can afford the bond.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78. The Court also rejected the claim that the bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>requirement was rationally related to the State interest in insuring landlords against loss of rent during the appellate process. The amount at which the State set the bond, the Court held, was not calculated to reflect litigation costs incurred by landlord-appellees or actual rent accrued during the appellate process. Rather, the Court stated, \u201cThe discrimination against the poor who could pay their rent pending an appeal but cannot post the double bond is particularly obvious. For them, as a practical matter, appeal is foreclosed, no matter how meritorious their case may be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79. The Court concluded that the statute singled out a class of litigants for \u201carbitrary and irrational\u201d treatment, thereby violating the equal protection clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed the rule that a State may not single out a class of litigants in an arbitrary and irrational fashion. <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>involved a challenge to a Mississippi statute imposing a 15% penalty on litigants who unsuccessfully appeal from a money judgment. The State of Mississippi argued that the statute expressed its interest in deterring frivolous appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 81. The Court ruled that, unlike the Oregon statute in <em>Lindsey, </em>the Mississippi statute was rationally related to the asserted State interest. The Court ruled that imposing a 15% penalty on unsuccessful appellants from money judgment was a reasonable attempt to deter frivolous appeals. The Court noted that alternatives to the statute \u2014 such as individualized determination of frivolousness or posting of bond \u2014 would either prolong the appellate process (the very evil which the statute sought to remedy) or bear no relation to the value of the underlying suit. The Court noted also that the 15% penalty applied only to judgments that were affirmed without modifications and was a \u201cmodest additional assessment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83-84. Therefore, the Court held, the statute was less likely to deter bona fide appeals than the Oregon statute struck down in <em>Lindsey. </em>In these circumstances, the statute was \u201creasonably tailored to achieve the State\u2019s legitimate ends\u201d and did not \u201csingle out a class of appellants in an arbitrary and irrational fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>at 85. Cf. <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 651 (1977) (upholding imposition of bond on medical malpractice plaintiffs on ground that Legislature may have found that bulk of frivolous malpractice litigation caused by plaintiffs rather than defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Like the Supreme Court of the United States, this court has upheld statutory schemes that impose additional burdens on a particular class of litigants only if such schemes are rationally related to a legitimate legislative purpose. In <em>Old Colony R.R. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>309 Mass. 439, 447 (1941), this court rejected an equal protection challenge to a statute requiring persons owing a real estate tax in excess of $1,000 to pay such tax as a prerequisite to seeking an abatement. \u201cThose paying taxes in less than this amount,\u201d the court explained, \u201ccomprise [ ] all the small taxpayers of the Commonwealth, including many who [have] no taxable realty other than their homes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201csocial and economic conditions of such taxpayers,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cmay be different from that of those whose realty holdings represent large investments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The different socio-economic conditions of the two classes of litigants, the court concluded, provided the rational basis for treating such classes in a different fashion. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 180, 190, 193 (1932) (upholding statute awarding litigation costs to employees prevailing in workers\u2019 compensation case but not to successful insurers in part because legislative classification was premised on differences in litigants\u2019 socioeconomic conditions).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>In the present case, we are unable to ascertain any rational basis for the imposition of a filing fee only on litigants proceeding with the assistance of counsel. We do not dispute that the Legislature has a legitimate interest in reducing the costs of an administrative proceeding. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kras, </em>409 U.S. 434, 445 (1973); <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56 (1972); <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 486 (1970). The Legislature also may enact laws seeking to deter frivolous appeals. See <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., supra. </em>Additionally, the Legislature may lower the cost of litigation for financially disadvantaged litigants. Cf. <em>Paro, supra </em>at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The relationship of the presently challenged classification to any of these goals, however, is \u201cso attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.\u201d <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985). The department has not offered, nor can this court discern, any rational basis to conclude that imposing an additional financial hurdle on claimants proceeding with the assistance of counsel may deter frivolous appeals. The challenged classification may achieve the opposite result. Attorneys are trained to evaluate the merits of a particular case. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 270 (1970). Attorneys have less of a personal stake in the outcome of a litigation than their clients. Attorneys are bound by the rules of professional conduct to provide their clients with competent legal services. Pro se litigants, on the other hand, often lack the legal training necessary to evaluate legal issues, particularly those complex issues that may arise in the specialized field of workers\u2019 compensation. Pro se litigants also are more likely to be guided by the perceived injustice of having been denied compensation for injury than their attorneys would be. We see no reasonable basis to conclude that imposing a fee on claimants assisted by a trained and objective professional might deter frivolous ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>peals. The challenged fee provision creates an incentive for claimants who have less information and a higher stake in the outcome of a case to challenge adverse determinations regardless of the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We also perceive no rational basis to conclude that only claimants proceeding with the assistance of counsel should be held responsible for the cost of the impartial medical examination. The attorney\u2019s fee provisions of the statute establish a fee schedule whereby a successful claimant\u2019s attorney ordinarily is entitled to a statutory fee paid by the insurer at the conclusion of the case. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A. See also <em>Rival\u2019s Case, </em>383 Mass. 172 (1981). The challenged fee requirement, on the other hand, requires claimants who engage an attorney to disburse money early in the proceeding as a prerequisite to asserting their rights. The burden imposed on financially disadvantaged workers, who may be able to defer compensation of their attorneys until resolution of their claim but may not afford the fee, is particularly obvious. See <em>Lindsey, supra </em>at 79. See also <em>English </em>v. <em>New England Medical Ctr., Inc., </em>405 Mass. 423, 428 (1989) (rational basis standard of review encompasses consideration of \u201cdegree of harm to the affected class\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">More fundamentally, we see no rational basis to impose the entire cost of the impartial medical examination on claimants who proceed with the assistance of an attorney.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such a classification assumes that these claimants have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>higher ability than pro se claimants to defray the costs of the medical examination. However, as the attorney\u2019s fee scheme of the workers\u2019 compensation act itself recognizes, an injured worker\u2019s decision to retain counsel bears no relation to the worker\u2019s financial means. In these circumstances, the classification merely penalizes claimants who choose to engage counsel and singles out these claimants for \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d treatment. <em>Lindsey, supra. Bankers Life, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5S\">We do not lightly undertake to invalidate a statute under the rational basis standard. A party challenging the constitutionality of a legislative enactment bears the heavy burden of .overcoming the presumption of constitutionality that is the starting point for courts reviewing statutes under the rational basis standard. See <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>supra. </em>See also <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 650 (1977). This standard, however, is not a \u201ctoothless\u201d one. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>427 U.S. 495, 510 (1976). Where the plaintiff demonstrates that a challenged classification lacks any rational basis to a legitimate State interest, we must declare such classification unconstitutional. Therefore, we hold that the fee provisions of \u00a7 11A violate the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Many years ago Chief Justice Rugg, in <em>Bogni </em>v. <em>Perotti, </em>224 Mass. 152, 156-157 (1916), stated clearly the fundamental constitutional principle on which we rely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cIt is an essential element of equal protection of the laws that each person shall possess the unhampered right to assert in the courts his rights, without discrimination, by the same processes against those who wrong him as are open to every other person. The courts must be open to all upon the same terms. No obstacles can be thrown in the way of some which are not interposed in the path of others.

The Attorney General further notified us that the department has promulgated new regulations that effectively eliminate the filing fee requirements in cases that involve the death of an employee. Accordingly, the present appeal no longer involves a live controversy. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>403 Mass. 370, 380 (1988). We note that, although the single justice granted Murphy leave to take an interlocutory appeal to a full panel of the Appeals Court, Murphy already had obtained the relief she sought from the single justice. While the department had the right to appeal the single justice\u2019s order because it was \u201caggrieved\u201d by that order, the department did not file its own notice of appeal. See G.

The parties \u2014 as well as several amici curiae \u2014 have fully briefed this issue. The parties have informed us that similar constitutional challenges to \u00a7 11A are currently pending in the Superior Court and have urged us to resolve this controversy in the present case. In these circumstances, we think it desirable to reach the merits of the case \u2014 notwithstanding the lack of a live controversy \u2014 so as to further the public interest.

L. c. 152, as amended. We do not, however, express any opinion on the adequacy of these procedures. Murphy does not argue that she has been deprived of benefits as a result of a procedurally deficient system; on the contrary, she is seeking access to the procedures provided by the system. While procedural due process cases become relevant to our discussion to the extent that they allude to such issues as the role of counsel in a judicial or administrative proceeding, we confine our discussion to the issue whether the imposition of a filing fee on claimants represented by lawyers but not on pro se claimants is constitutionally valid under the Federal and the State Constitutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"AG2\">This \u201crational basis\u201d standard of review does not apply when a statute classifies by race, alienage, or national origin. Courts will closely scrutinize statutes involving such suspect classifications and uphold only statutes that are \u201csuitably tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\" <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985). Statutes that penalize the exercise of a constitutionally-protected individual right also call for a heightened standard of review. See, e.g, <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>Union Free School Dist.

In <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Wrentham, </em>398 Mass. 550, 558 (1986), for example, we rejected an equal protection challenge to the $100,000 limitation on damages recoverable against the Commonwealth under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. We reasoned that protecting public funds from unlimited liability is a legitimate legislative purpose. We also upheld a $20,000 statutory limit on damages recoverable against charitable organizations. <em>English </em>v. <em>New England Medical Ctr., Inc., </em>405 Mass. 423, 430 (1989). In <em>English, </em>we examined carefully not only the \u201cpurpose to be served by the statute,\u201d but also the \u201cdegree of harm to the affected class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428. We acknowledged the hardship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>imposed by the statute on tort litigants whose injuries may far exceed the statutory cap, but we held the cap to be reasonably related to the State\u2019s legitimate interest in preserving charitable assets. <em>Id. </em>at 430.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States has stated that \u201c[tjhe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 270 (1970), quoting <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 68-69 (1932). \u201cCounsel can help delineate the issues, present the factual contentions in an orderly manner, conduct cross-examination, and generally safeguard the interests of the [client.]\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra </em>at 270-271. As was already noted, we review the constitutionality of \u00a7 11A under a rational basis standard, and therefore do not reach today the issue whether the right to engage counsel is \u201cfundamental\u201d for purposes of equal protection analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Nonetheless, we note that \u201cthe harm to the members of the disadvantaged class\u201d occasioned by the fee provisions of \u00a7 11A also includes the substantial burden which those provisions place on the ability of a workers\u2019 compensation claimant to be heard with the aid of skilled counsel. <em>English, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>supra </em>at 429, quoting <em>Cleburne, supra </em>at 452 (Stevens, J., concurring). \u201c[C]haracterizing the tests to be applied to determine the constitutional validity of legislation as \u2018reasonable relation\u2019 and \u2018strict scrutiny\u2019 is a \u2018shorthand for referring to the opposite ends of a continuum of constitutional vulnerability determined at every point by the competing values involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>English, supra </em>at 428-429, citing <em>Marcoux </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>375 Mass. 63, 65 n.4 (1978).

First, there is no evidence that this practice is customary among attorneys handling workers\u2019 compensation claims. Next S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 5, DR 5-103 (B), as appearing in 382 Mass. 779 (1981), provides that an attorney may not advance litigation costs to a client unless \u201cthe client remains ultimately liable.\u201d This rule prohibits an attorney from advancing litigation costs if the attorney has no expectation of recovering such costs, the rationale being that an attorney may not acquire an interest in the subject matter of the litigation if such interest hinders the attorney\u2019s exercise of independent professional judgment.
