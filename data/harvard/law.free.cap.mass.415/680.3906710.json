We conclude that there was no reversible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>error and that the defendant is not entitled to relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">To put the issues in perspective, we provide a brief outline of evidence that the jury reasonably could have believed. In the afternoon of November 14, 1985, the body of the victim was found behind a medical building in Lowell. He had been killed by compound fractures of his skull. The victim, who was seventy-five years old, had delivered alcoholic beverages for a Lowell package store. The defendant and others knew that the victim carried substantial amounts of money in order to cash checks for customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Investigation led the police later that day to premises in Lowell where they found the defendant with others. The defendant voluntarily went to the Lowell police station where during the night he was questioned about his activities on November 14. He agreed to be tested for traces of blood. Chemical tests showed traces of blood on his hands, at his forehead hairline, on the soles of his jogging shoes, and elsewhere. Blood traces found on the defendant\u2019s clothes were of the same blood type as the victim\u2019s and not that of the defendant. Barbara Peaslee, who had been at the Lowell premises where the police found the defendant, testified that the defendant had said, before the police arrived, that he had robbed someone and thought that he and an accomplice had killed the person. Although the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was circumstantial, there was an ample basis for submitting the case to the jury, and the defendant does not contend otherwise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">1. The defendant first challenges the denial of his motion to suppress the statements that he made to the Lowell police on November 14-15. He argues that his constitutional rights were denied by a false and misleading answer that a Lowell police officer gave to the defendant\u2019s question about what a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>portion of the Miranda warning meant. The defendant contends that the answer amounted to trickery and deception.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Lowell police Inspector David Tousignant testified on direct examination that, after the defendant read his Miranda rights aloud from a card, Tousignant asked him if he had any questions. The defendant asked Tousignant to explain what was meant by the statement that anything he might say may be used against him. Tousignant testified that he had replied as follows: \u201cI explained to him that we wanted to get a statement. We would like a written statement from him. That at some point when you go to court I would testify that I took whatever statement he gave us that was taken that night in our office.\u201d The defendant then signed the Miranda card, gave a statement, and consented to submit to tests for the presence of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The further testimony of Tousignant is instructive in assessing the defendant\u2019s claim. On cross-examination of the officer, defense counsel returned to the question of Miranda rights and asked how Tousignant had explained to the defendant the meaning of \u201cAnything you say may be held against you.\u201d Tousignant replied: \u201cI told him that what I wanted, or what we wanted was to get a statement to the best his knowledge [sz'c] of his day\u2019s activities. That anything that he tells us, which will be recorded and signed by him, at some future date can be used in court. Somebody would testify in court if, in fact, if we go to court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Nothing that Tousignant told the defendant was erroneous. Tousignant\u2019s answer on direct examination as to what he had told the defendant was not, however, a complete disclosure of the consequences of the giving of a statement to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>police. His answer on cross-examination was substantially more complete.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> What the officer said was not deceptive. Nor does the evidence indicate any intent to trick the defendant. The evidence fully warrants the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">2. When, in the course of cross-examination of Tousignant at trial, defense counsel asked him if he had taken notes of his November 14-15 interview of the defendant, Tousignant said that he had.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A judge had allowed the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion that the Commonwealth preserve all notes concerning the defendant. Tousignant testified that he did not have the notes of the November 14-15 interview with him. When counsel asked where the notes were, the prosecutor objected, and the judge conferred with counsel at the bench. Defense counsel said that he wanted to look at the notes to see if they were consistent with a filed police report. The prosecutor objected to conducting discovery in front of the jury. The judge ruled that defense counsel could not pursue the issue through the witness. The judge did not rule that the defendant was not entitled to production of Tousignant\u2019s notes. Defense counsel, however, made no such demand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The defendant argues that his cross-examination of Tousignant was impermissibly restricted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>382 Mass. 119, 125 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 516, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 935 (1987). The November 14-15 interview was important because the defendant made arguably inculpatory statements and because of the evidence of the presence of occult blood. We shall assume that the defendant was entitled to see any notes of that interview (see <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 108-109 [1980]), but we cannot say that the judge abused his discretion in limiting cross-examination on the subject when he did, where the witness had testified that he did not have the notes with him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>407 Mass. 663, 672 (1990). Nor is it possible on the record before us to determine, in fulfilment of our obligations under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, whether the defendant was significantly prejudiced by the failure of defense counsel to press for the production of the notes that Tousignant said he had taken.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">3. The defendant argues that the judge improperly restricted his attempt to show the bias of Paula Fournier, a prosecution witness who had testified that she had heard the defendant say that the victim carried a lot of cash and would be easy to rob. During the defendant\u2019s direct testimony, defense counsel asked about a conversation between Fournier and the defendant. In response to \u201cWhat did you do?,\u201d the defendant testified, \u201c[Fournier] was arguing about the rent and how she was trying to prolong paying the rent [to the defendant\u2019s mother]. My mother was arguing with her and she called my mother a slut.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The prosecutor objected, and the judge sustained the objection, telling the jury to disregard the answer as hearsay. The judge\u2019s striking of the answer was correct because it was not responsive. The problem was not, however, hearsay. It seems reasonably clear that the defendant\u2019s purpose was to show the witness\u2019s bias, not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>prove the truth of what she said. The defendant did not, however, seek admission of the evidence limited to the question of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The defendant had a constitutional right to present evidence of bias through any competent means. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316-317 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 153 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 394, 397 (1985). There was no error because the testimony showing bias was properly struck as not responsive to the questions asked. We have considered whether, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, there is a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in the failure of counsel to straighten out the admissibility of the bias evidence that we have just discussed. The fact of Fournier\u2019s bias was shown in other evidence and, therefore, the absence of the excluded evidence was not significantly prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, supra </em>at 154-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">4. The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s failure to give a requested instruction concerning the special care that the jury should apply in examining the testimony of an immunized witness, Barbara Peaslee, who testified to incriminating statements by the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Tousignant testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>had told Peaslee in December, 1985, and in February, 1986, that, if she was withholding information about the death of the victim, she could be charged as an accessory after the fact to murder. He told her, and she testified that she understood, that, if she gave him a truthful account of what happened, she would not be charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The defendant argues that the judge was obliged to give an instruction directed to the promise not to prosecute Peas-lee if she testified truthfully. We have found unfair prejudice in the manner of presentation to a jury of a written plea agreement in which the Commonwealth promised a particular sentencing recommendation in exchange for truthful testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 262-263 (1989). That case involved an arguable inference that the Commonwealth was vouching for the witness\u2019s truthfulness. <em>Id. </em>at 262. That is not true in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, ante </em>424, 427 (1993). There are other distinctions. The judge\u2019s instruction on credibility, including references to witnesses\u2019 interests in the outcome of the case and to their possible bias, was sufficient in the circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 739-740 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">5. The defendant next argues that the judge failed to give the jury sufficient guidance for deciding whether they could consider incriminating statements attributed to the defendant. The judge properly charged that any such statement could be considered only if the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant made the statement voluntarily. The judge added that the jury should consider the defendant\u2019s age, experience, and intelligence as well as the circumstances under which the statements were made. There was no objection to the charge, nor was there any request for a fuller exposition of the factors that might bear on the voluntariness issue. The defendant contends that the judge erred by not referring specifically to additional elements, such as the defendant\u2019s emotional stability, his physical and mental condi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>tian, and the details of any interrogation, including the recitation of Miranda warnings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 413 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>388 Mass. 846, 856-857 (1983). Although the instruction appropriately might have contained more detail, it was correct. We discern no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in the scope of the charge on voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">6. Finally, the defendant challenges the admission of testimony concerning what he said and did during a portion of the November 14-15 interview in the Lowell police station. After the defendant had tested positive for occult blood and had given what appeared to the police to be doubtful responses in explanation of the test results, Inspector Edward Murphy of the Lowell police department told the defendant that the reason he had blood on him was because he had been at the murder scene and assisted in the murder. The defendant, according to Tousignant, \u201ckind of dropped his head.\" Then Murphy said, \u201c[D]id you know when you set up the old guy ... for the robbery that they were going to murder him?\u201d According to Tousignant the defendant \u201chad his head drop like that. Just said no,\u201d and \u201c[s]hook his head like that.\u201d Then the defendant shot up and sat straight up and said, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t have anything to do with any murder or robbery.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The defendant argues that the testimony should not have been admitted because it permitted an inference of an admission of guilt from the defendant\u2019s silence after he had received Miranda warnings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>386 Mass. 54, 59 n.5 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszew-ski, </em>363 Mass. 311, 316 (1973), <em>S.C., </em>391 Mass. 123 (1984). We reject the argument because the defendant\u2019s response, dropping his head, saying no, pausing, and then denying involvement, was not necessarily an admission by silence but rather could be seen collectively as an admission by word and deed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>397 Mass. 440, 442 (1986). At the least, the challenged evidence was admissible as an equivocal response to an accusation of guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>394 Mass. 567, 570-571 (1985). If the defendant had merely hung his head and paused, and had not also said \u201cno,\u201d his response would not have been admissible as an equivocal response. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>371 Mass. 462, 477 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument continues, challenging, as compounding error, the admission, without objection, of Tousig-nant\u2019s testimony concerning what next happened at the November 14-15 interview. After the defendant had sat up in his chair and said that he did not know anything about a murder, Tousignant told the defendant that he did not believe him. The defendant, Tousignant testified, became \u201cnoticeably nervous.\u201d The defendant then said, in response to a question, that he did not want to give a statement of the truth of what happened that day and that he did not want to talk any more at that time. The defendant challenges the admission of Tousignant\u2019s statement of opinion that he did not believe the defendant and argues that Tousignant\u2019s testimony invited the jury to infer guilt from the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Tousignant\u2019s statement, in the course of a police interview, that he did not believe the defendant is not the same as the testimony of a witness at trial who impermissibly expresses an opinion about the credibility of another witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>394 Mass. 702, 706 (1985). On the other hand, such a charge of untruthfulness, standing alone, would not be admissible, and the probative value of the fact of the defendant\u2019s nervousness is so insubstantial that it would have been better if the evidence had not been admitted, if there had been an objection.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, even if the charge and the defendant\u2019s response were inadmissible over objection, admission of the evidence did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">There is no implication of guilt to be found simply because a person, who had received Miranda warnings, decided that he wanted to terminate a police interview. Where, however, the evidence is that the decision to terminate followed a question whether that person wanted to give the police a truthful statement as to what happened on the day of a murder, an inference of an admission of guilt might be found in the decision to exercise one\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, supra </em>at 59-62 (barring use of pre-arrest silence for impeachment of defendant). The evidence should not have reached the jury. The defendant did not object, however, to the testimony, did not move that it be struck, and did not seek a curative instruction. Considering that any inference of an admission of guilt was not strong, that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was substantial, and that this testimony was a brief event in the course of a long trial, we conclude that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s decision to terminate the interview does not pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>sent a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, supra </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>410 Mass. 425 (1991), this court upheld the conviction of Raymond Harmon of murder in the first degree of the victim. The circumstances of the victim\u2019s death are stated more fully in that opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 426.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">We shall assume that the defendant was in custody and that hence Miranda warnings were required. We shall also assume that defense counsel adequately preserved all aspects of this issue for appellate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">It is unfortunate that the motion judge simply adopted the facts stated in the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition to allowance of the motion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkesworth, </em>405 Mass. 664, 669-670 (1989). On the other hand, the defendant concedes that what happened was uncontradicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The defendant did not testify in support of his motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Tousignant\u2019s testimony was not consistent with what he had testified to during the hearing on the motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s statements. There, on both cross-examination and redirect examination, Tousignant said that he had not taken any notes of the November 14-15 interview. He said that he had taken notes only of a November 19-20 interview of the defendant. He produced those notes at the suppression hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\"> The defendant makes no claim that the prosecutor improperly failed to produce the notes at any earlier time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The defendant filed a motion for a new trial after his appeal had been entered in this court. A single justice remanded the motion to the Superior Court for consideration and decision. Thereafter, an amended motion for a new trial was filed and denied by the trial judge. Although a notice of appeal from that denial was filed, no argument is presented to us challenging that denial. The matter of Tousignant\u2019s notes of the November 14-15 interview was not pursued in the motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Immediately after this testimony, a somewhat similar exchange occurred. The defendant gave another nonresponsive answer, when asked what Fournier had said to him. He testified that she then started kicking him. The judge struck the answer on the prosecution\u2019s objection. The evidence of kicking would have been admissible to show bias in response to a question properly directed to the fact of the kicking. There was no such question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The defendant properly saved his appellate rights on this issue. The judge denied the written request during a charge conference and stated that the defendant\u2019s exception was saved. It was thus established at the charge conference that the judge would not give the requested instruction. The defendant, therefore, was not obliged to repeat his objection after the charge was given. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hollinger, </em>553 F.2d 535, 541-543 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>Las Vegas Merchant Plumbers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>United States, </em>210 F.2d 732, 744-745 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 817 (1954). Contra <em>United States </em>v. <em>Parisien, </em>574 F.2d 974, 976 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 850 (1978). Cf. <em>Bowley </em>v. <em>Stotler &amp; Co., </em>751 F.2d 641, 647 (3d Cir. 1985); <em>Fey </em>v. <em>Walston &amp; Co., </em>493 F.2d 1036, 1047 (7th Cir. 1974). Contra <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, </em>877 F.2d 1106, 1109-1110 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 965 (1989) (notwithstanding whatever happened before charge to jury, objections to charge have force only if made after charge). The defendant in effect did comply with the requirement, stated in Mass. R. Crim. P. 24 (b), 378 Mass. 895 (1979), to object to the failure to instruct as requested. Cf. <em>Stepakoff </em>v. <em>Kantar, </em>393 Mass. 836, 839-840 (1985) (trial judge approved procedure by which he said party\u2019s rights would be preserved). Nothing occurred between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>time of the judge\u2019s decision not to give the requested instruction and the conclusion of the charge to alter the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The trial judge, who was not the motion judge, did not conduct a voir dire on the admissibility of this evidence. He based his decision to admit this evidence on material before the motion judge. We, therefore, recite the evidence of this incident presented at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Murphy\u2019s testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress was different in detail but substantially the same. He testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Defense counsel: \u201cDid you ask [the defendant] a question pertaining to setting up this robbery attempt?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The Witness: \u201cYes. I asked him if he would just not talk and listen to me for a second so I could ask him a question. And I asked him: \u2018Did you ever think that when this set up was planned that this was what would happen to this man?\u2019 I pointed at the picture. He put his head down. He hesitated for the first time during all our conversations. He hesitated. He shook his head and said, \u2018no.\u2019 Then he hesitated another very short time and he picked his head and said: \u2018But I wasn\u2019t at the murder scene. I didn\u2019t do a murder. I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The testimony probably came as a surprise to defense counsel because, at the hearing on the motion to suppress, Tousignant did not testify, as questions would have led him to do, to his statement of disbelief of the defendant or concerning the defendant\u2019s nervousness. No motion to strike the officer\u2019s testimony was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\">It is true, however, that testimony concerning a defendant\u2019s demeanor is admissible in various circumstances.
