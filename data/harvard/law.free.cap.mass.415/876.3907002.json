(Clean Harbors), relief from a judgment ordered by this court and entry of a new judgment in Clean Harbors\u2019 favor. We granted the board\u2019s application for direct appellate review and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Clean Harbors commenced this litigation in 1987, seeking a declaration that it was not required to obtain a site assignment pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150B (1990 ed.), for a hazardous waste treatment and storage facility it was then operating in Braintree. A judge in the Superior Court ruled that the requirements of G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150B, were not applicable because Clean Harbors was a facility in operation before the statute became effective, and granted summary judgment in favor of Clean Harbors. <em>Clean Harbors of Braintree, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Braintree, </em>409 Mass. 834, 835 (1991) <em>{Clean Harbors I). </em>On appeal, we held that \u00a7 150B applied to Clean Harbors and ruled that, in order to continue operations, Clean Harbors must apply for and receive a site assignment from the board. <em>Id. </em>at 838. In response to the board\u2019s motion for entry of a final judgment after rescript, a Superior Court judge ordered Clean Harbors to file an application with the board for a site assessment pursuant to \u00a7 150B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before the site assignment proceedings were com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>pleted, however, the Legislature amended G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150B, by providing in relevant part that G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 150A and 150B, \u201cshall not apply to any hazardous waste facility . . . which was licensed as such ... as of May first, nineteen hundred and eighty.\u201d St. 1992, c. 23, \u00a7 18 (the amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Relying on the amendment, Clean Harbors filed a motion in the Superior Court on April 29, 1992, seeking relief from the Superior Court judgment and a stay of any further site assignment proceedings before the board. The board opposed Clean Harbors\u2019 motion, arguing that the amendment was unconstitutional, and that it did not apply to Clean Harbors. After a hearing, a judge of the Superior Court allowed Clean Harbors\u2019 motion and ordered entry of a new judgment declaring that Clean Harbors was not required to obtain a site assignment under \u00a7 150B.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">1. The board first argues that the amendment violates arts. 48 and 63 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. The board is a municipal agency of the town of Braintree. In <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>390 Mass. 604, 610 (1983), we recognized a \u201clong-standing and far-reaching prohibition on constitutional challenges by governmental entities to acts of their creator State.\u201d We have followed this rule in a variety of contexts. See <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>The Governor, 407 </em>Mass. 377, 386 <em>(1990) </em>(Liacos, C.J., concurring) (municipality cannot challenge constitutionality of State statute based on its enactment as \u201coutside\u201d section of the general appropriation act); <em>Trustees of Worcester State Hosp. </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>395 Mass. 377, 380 (1985) (takings claim barred since governmental entities cannot challenge constitutionality of State statutes); <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra </em>(agency not permitted to bring due process and equal protection claims). We conclude, therefore, that the board\u2019s claims under arts. 48 and 63 are barred by the same prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>relied on in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra. </em>\u201cAgencies, which are creations of the State, may not challenge the constitutionality of State statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610, citing <em>Newark </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 192, 196 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">2. The board reads G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 7L (1990 ed.), as invalidating the amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We again pass over the question \u201cwhether \u00a7 7L is an unlawful attempt by one Legislature to dictate to subsequent Legislatures the manner in which constitutionally permissible legislative processes may work.\u201d <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>411 Mass. 238, 247 (1991). Although part of St. 1992, c. 23, made appropriations for the expenses of the Commonwealth, the amendment itself made no appropriation of any sort. In <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, supra, </em>we considered a challenge to an outside section of the fiscal year 1992 budget (St. 1991, c. 138). Although portions of the statute obviously made appropriations for the Commonwealth, we read the requirements of \u00a7 7L as applying to the outside section rather than the appropriations act as a whole. Proceeding in the same manner we conclude that \u00a7 7L does not apply to the amendment, since that law makes no appropriation whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">3. The board next argues that the amendment violates the doctrine of separation of powers articulated in art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. In <em>LaGrant </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>403 Mass. 328, 331 (1988), we held that \u201cagencies . . . have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a State statute when it is alleged that the statute represents legislative encroachment on judicial power in violation of art. 30.\u201d We, therefore, address the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In <em>Clean Harbors I, </em>we construed G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150B, as it was originally enacted and, \u201c[ajfter examining the statutory history of local site assignment provisions,\u201d held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>\u00a7 150B applied to the Clean Harbors facility. <em>Id. </em>at 835. We also declined to read a \u201cjudicially manufactured grandfather clause\u201d into \u00a7 150B. <em>Id. </em>at 838. Subsequent to our decision, the Legislature responded by amending \u00a7 150B, and by stating that \u00a7 150B should not apply to facilities that were licensed as of May 1, 1980. We are therefore presented with a statute enacted subsequent to our decision which was based on the court\u2019s perception of legislative intent. While the amendment effectively nullified our decision in <em>Clean Harbors I, </em>it was not impermissible under art. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Two recently decided cases explain why this is so. In <em>Massachusetts Wholesalers of Malt Beverages, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>409 Mass. 336 (1991) <em>(Mass. Wholesalers I), </em>we interpreted the \u201cbottle bill,\u201d as originally enacted, and held that unclaimed \u201cdeposits\u201d belonged to the bottlers and distributors. Thereafter, the Legislature amended the bottle bill, making it clear that bottlers and distributors were to hold the unclaimed deposits in separate accounts on behalf of consumers and, if abandoned, on behalf of the Commonwealth. <em>Massachusetts Wholesalers of Malt Beverages, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 411, 412 (1993) <em>(Mass. Wholesalers II). </em>In <em>Mass. Wholesalers II, </em>we held: \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 right to the deposits created under the original bottle bill, as interpreted in <em>Mass. Wholesalers [I], supra, </em>does not translate into a similar right to these deposits under, the bottle bill, as now amended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417. We noted: \u201c[Wjhatever interpretation we might give would not affect the Legislature\u2019s power to amend or clarify the statute, giving it whatever interpretation the General Court might desire.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Answer of the Justices, </em>375 Mass. 790, 793 (1978). Just as the Legislature properly amended the bottle bill to accomplish what it originally intended after our decision in <em>Mass. Wholesalers I, </em>the Legislature could also properly amend \u00a7 15 0B to accomplish what it had originally intended, as no rights had vested under our decision in <em>Clean Harbors I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">4. The board next argues that the amendment violates \u00a7 8 of art. 89 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Commonwealth (Home Rule Amendment).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A municipality has standing to assert this claim. See <em>Mayor of Boston </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>384 Mass. 718, 719 (1981) (city and mayor challenged appropriations under Home Rule Amendment); <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 48 (1977) (town challenged statute under Home Rule Amendment). We shall assume without deciding that a board of a municipality has such standing as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The Home Rule Amendment preserves the right of municipalities to self-government in \u201clocal matters,\u201d but preserves the Commonwealth\u2019s right to legislate with respect to State, regional, and general matters. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, supra </em>at 244. \u201cTo this particular end, the Home Rule Amendment is to be narrowly construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Legislature may act on matters of State, regional, or general concern, even though the action may have special effect on one or more individual cities or towns. <em>Id. </em>at 245. <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, supra </em>at 50. <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>356 Mass. 775, 787-788 (1969). In <em>Opinions of the Justices, supra </em>at 788, a majority of the Justices opined that legislation for a multi-purpose stadium, a third vehicular tunnel, a Worcester toll road, and an arena was \u201cat least regional and ha[d] some Statewide effect.\u201d In <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, supra </em>at 50, this court held that \u201csewer systems, with their effect on water quality in a particular area, are a matter of State, regional, or general concern.\u201d In <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, supra </em>at 245, we were concerned with legislation providing for the transfer of control over the Suffolk County house of correction and held: \u201c[T]he transfer legislation predominantly concerns State, regional, and general matters and, while the legislation has some special effect on Boston\u2019s penal institutions department, that effect neither diminishes its broader purpose nor serves to make the Home Rule Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>ment applicable.\u201d It follows from this line of cases that the waste treatment performed at the Clean Harbors facility is certainly a matter of State, regional, and general concern. We, therefore, conclude that the amendment does not violate the Home Rule Amendment, even if the amendment applies only to the hazardous waste treatment facility in Braintree.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">5. The board next argues that Clean Harbors does not fall within the provisions of the amendment. The amendment provides that G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150B:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">\u201cshall not apply to any hazardous waste facility exempt from the licensing requirements of chapter twenty-one C, which was lawfully organized and in existence on May first, [1980], or to any hazardous waste facility which was licensed as such by any division of the [Department of Environmental Protection] as of May first, [1980].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">It is not disputed that Clean Harbors is not exempt from the licensing requirements of c. 21C. Therefore, to fall within the terms of the amendment, the Clean Harbors facility must have been licensed as a hazardous waste facility on May 1, 1980. The board claims that, since the statute in effect on May 1, 1980, required licensing of the \u201cperson\u201d operating the facility, and not the \u201cfacility\u201d per se, no hazardous waste facility could have been \u201clicensed as such\u201d on May 1, 1980. See G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 58, repealed by St. 1979, c. 704, \u00a7 1. G. L. c. 21C, inserted by St. 1979, c. 704, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>\u201cOur task is to interpret the statute according to the intent of the Legislature, as evidenced by the language used, and considering the purposes and remedies intended to be advanced.\u201d <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 574, 577 (1984). A statute should not be construed in such a way as to make it a nullity when a sensible construction is readily available. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>400 Mass. 444, 453 (1987). The amendment was clearly enacted in response to our decision in <em>Clean Harbors I, supra, </em>in order to exclude hazardous waste facilities like Clean Harbors in existence as of May 1, 1980, from the site assignment requirement of \u00a7 150B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assuming that all such facilities operate pursuant to licenses granted to \u201cperson [s]\u201d under the statute in effect at the time, the board\u2019s argument would render the amendment a total nullity. A more sensible construction, however, exists in the plain language of the amendment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The amendment states that \u00a7 150B shall not apply \u201cto any hazardous waste facility . . . which was licensed as such by any division of the department as of May first, [1980].\u201d The parties do not dispute that Clean Harbors fits the definition of \u201cfacility.\u201d G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150B. G. L. c. 21D, \u00a7 2 (1990 ed.). See <em>Clean Harbors I, supra </em>at 836. In addition, the board acknowledges that as of May 1, 1980, the Brain-tree facility was licensed under G. L. c. 21. That the 1980 license was issued to a company whose structure or owner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>ship may have been different from Clean Harbors is immaterial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">6. Clean Harbors relied on Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (5) and 60 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), in its motion seeking relief from the judgment in the Superior Court. The Superior Court judge discussed rule 60 (b) (5), but apparently allowed Clean Harbors\u2019 motion under rule 60 (b) (6).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board argues that neither rule warranted relief from the prior judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">We agree that \u201c[rjule 60 (b) (6) permits a court to relieve a party from final judgment where there is a post-judgment change in the law having retroactive application.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hutton Group, </em>795 F. Supp. 1307, 1316 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Matarese </em>v. <em>LeFevre, </em>801 F.2d 98, 106 (2d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 908 (1987) (postjudgment change in law having retroactive application may in special circumstances constitute extraordinary circumstance warranting vacation of judgment under rule 60 [b] [6]). However, rule 60 (b) (5), which permits the court to relieve a party from a final judgment where \u201cit is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application,\u201d also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>contemplates relief from a judgment as a result of a later change in the law such as when a statute is amended. <em>Wallace Clark &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Acheson Indus., Inc., </em>394 F. Supp. 393, 395 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 976 (1976). We conclude, therefore, that it is of no significance whether the judge granted relief under rule 60 (b) (5) or (6). In either case his action was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-11\">The judgment was entered on October 30, 1991.
