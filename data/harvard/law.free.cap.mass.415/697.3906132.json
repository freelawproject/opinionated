Campbell, was convicted of presenting false financial reports concerning the financial condition of the Greenfield Minor League (league), of which she was treasurer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The league was a baseball <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>league for young boys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute under which she was convicted, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 92 (1990 ed.), subjects to criminal liability \u201c[wjhoever wilfully and with intent to defraud makes or publishes, or causes or permits to be made or published in any way whatever, any book, prospectus, notice, report, statement, exhibit, advertisement or other publication of or concerning the affairs, financial condition, property or assets of any <em>corporation, joint stock association, partnership or individual . . . </em>(emphasis added).\u201d G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 92. Campbell admits that she wilfully presented inaccurate financial reports on various occasions throughout her tenure, from 1980 to 1988. The sole question before us is whether the then unincorporated league fell within the ambit of c. 266, \u00a7 92, that is, whether it was a partnership.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Campbell moved for a required finding of not guilty on the ground that the Commonwealth had failed to present any evidence that the league was one of the entities covered by \u00a7 92. The judge denied the motion. Campbell appealed and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We hold that the Commonwealth failed to present evidence that the league was a partnership (or any of the other entities covered by the statute), and therefore, that the motion for a required finding of not guilty ought to have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Our conclusion rests on the meaning of the word \u201cpartnership\u201d in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 92. We begin by reciting the well-settled principle that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintolo, ante </em>358, 359 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>387 Mass. 702, 706 (1982), and cases cited. The Uniform Partnership Act, G. L. c. 108A (1990 ed.) (UPA), defines a \u201cpartnership\u201d as \u201can association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.\u201d G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 6 (1). The Commonwealth presented no evidence and makes no argument that the league satisfies this statutory definition. Additionally, the judge, in his instructions, affirmed that the jury \u201care considering an organization not carried on as a business for profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The Commonwealth argues that neither the UPA\u2019s definition of partnership nor the common law definition of partnership, developed prior to the adoption of the UPA, applies to G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 92.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, the Commonwealth contends, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\u201cpartnership\u201d must be defined \u201cnonstatutorily,\u201d and by its \u201ccommon definition.\u201d This so-called \u201cnonstatutory\u201d definition of \u201cpartnership\u201d is \u201can association of persons working toward a common goal.\u201d According to the Commonwealth, the league meets this definition because the league\u2019s officers, coaches, assistant coaches, and managers worked toward the desired goal of teaching young men baseball through which they would develop \u201cideals of good sportsmanship, honesty, loyalty, courage and reverence leading to healthy adult lives\u201d (citing art. 2 of the league\u2019s Constitution). In denying Campbell\u2019s motion for a required finding, the judge agreed with the Commonwealth\u2019s formulation. He stated: \u201cI think the intent of the statute is to prevent publishing of false statements, to someone who is a member of an association, or a society or something like that . . . .\u201d Additionally, during deliberations, the judge responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to the jury\u2019s questian whether \u201cthe \u2018for profit\u2019 [component is] necessary to qualify an association as a partnership?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Both the Commonwealth and the judge relied on a definition of partnership that was mistakenly broad. \u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose. ... We derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meaning from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). Because we must construe the meaning of a criminal statute, we note again: \u201cIt is a well-established proposition that criminal statutes are to be construed narrowly. We have stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>that \u2018[w]e must resolve in favor of criminal defendants any reasonable doubt as to [a] statute\u2019s meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>409 Mass. 284, 286 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169, 174 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In 1907, when the Legislature enacted c. 266, \u00a7 92 (St. 1907, c. 383), \u201cpartnership\u201d was well understood as descriptive of a legal, business-for-profit relationship. See <em>Esta-brook </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>192 Mass. 499 (1906); <em>McMurtrie </em>v. <em>Guiler, </em>183 Mass. 451 (1903); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>156 Mass. 412 (1892); <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>16 Gray 274 (1860). While the word \u201cpartner\u201d has also been known to describe other kinds of relationships, as diverse as husband and wife or two people who dance together, see Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1648 (2d ed. 1959), we must credit the Legislature, in drafting a criminal statute, to have considered the well-settled legal meaning of the term it chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The Commonwealth argued in opposition to Campbell\u2019s motion for a required finding that, if the Legislature had intended to include an organization like the league, there was no term other than \u201cpartnership\u201d to describe it. We cannot agree. The Legislature could have used the term \u201cvoluntary association,\u201d as it did in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 58 (1990 ed.), which was enacted in 1884 (St. 1884, c. 174), prior to G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 92 (and under which Campbell was charged, but found not guilty, see note 1, <em>supra). </em>It could have used the term \u201corganization,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cclub,\u201d or \u201cgroup united for a common purpose,\u201d any of which would have described the league more accurately than \u201cpartnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The record reflects, in the Commonwealth\u2019s words, that the league was \u201can association of individuals organized for the purpose of teaching young boys sportsmanship and life skills through baseball.\u201d There was no evidence that the league was organized as a profit-making venture.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>this is a necessary component of a \u201cpartnership\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 92.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On review of a motion for a required finding, the issue is \u201cwhether the evidence offered by the Commonwealth, together with reasonable inferences therefrom, when viewed in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to persuade a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armand, </em>411 Mass. 167, 169 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 686 (1979). The evidence presented in this case failed to show that the league was one of the entities covered by G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 92. Therefore, even though the evidence may have been sufficient to permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Campbell knowingly presented false financial reports, her actions did not violate the statute and her motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>391 Mass. 157, 158-160 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and a finding of not guilty is to be entered on remand to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-15\">Campbell was acquitted on two other counts charged in the indictment. Count II charged her with larceny from a voluntary association. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 58 (1990 ed.). Count III charged her with larceny of property (money) of a value of more than $250. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (1990 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The league was incorporated after the events giving rise to the indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The Commonwealth did not argue, and the trial judge did not instruct the jury, that the league qualified as a \u201ccorporation\u201d or \u201cjoint stock association.\u201d Therefore, when the trial judge instructed the jury, he omitted the terms \u201ccorporation\u201d and \u201cjoint stock association\u201d from his reading of the statute, and retained the terms \u201cpartnership\u201d and \u201cindividual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">His description of what may constitute a partnership is discussed more fully later in this opinion. He did not elaborate on the term \u201cindividual.\u201d The Commonwealth now attempts to argue that the league, as well as being a partnership, was an individual, and that the jury could have so found. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument is that the common dictionary definition of \u201cindividual\u201d includes a person, and that G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 Twenty-third (1990 ed.), states that, \u2018\u201c[pjerson\u2019 . . . shall include corporations, societies, associations and partnerships.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s reasoning is not persuasive. Since the term \u201cindividual\u201d is used in \u00a7 92, alongside the terms \u201ccorporation,\u201d \u201cjoint stock association,\u201d and \u201cpartnership,\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s substitution of the c. 4, \u00a7 7 Twenty-third, definition of \u201c[pjerson\u201d for \u201cindividual\u201d would result in \u00a7 92\u2019s being partially redundant because the definition the Commonwealth urges for \u201cindividual\u201d would repeat some of the words already in \u00a7 92 explicitly. Such a view would add to \u00a7 92 the words \u201ccorporation, joint stock association, partnership or <em>corporation L societjy], association ] </em>and <em>partnershipf </em>/\u201d (emphasis supplied). We think it implausible that the Legislature intended such surplusage. See <em>International Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., 392 </em>Mass. 811, 813 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Moreover, the Commonwealth indicated clearly at trial that it was proceeding solely on the question of partnership. In opposing Campbell\u2019s motion for a required finding, the assistant district attorney stated: \u201cYour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Honor, there is no question in my mind that if the Motion for Required Finding on the count is not to be allowed, that it will be on the basis that what we are dealing with is a partnership under the statute as its [j/c] worded . At a sidebar conference after the judge had charged the jury, defense counsel noted his objection to the definition of partnership and the assistant district attorney stated: \u201cMay I make a suggestion at this juncture? And that is that rather than go through each of those kind of organizations, <em>that the Court direct the jury only to look at the partnership definition and to ignore the </em>others?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\">The UPA was enacted fifteen years subsequent to the enactment of G. L. c. 266 (St. 1922, c. 486, \u00a7 1). The common law definition of partnership, well developed through case law, and clearly stated by this court in decisions during the decade preceding the adoption of G. L. c. 266, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\u00a7 92, contained the same basic requirements as the UPA definition. For example, in <em>McMurtrie </em>v. <em>Guiler, </em>183 Mass. 451 (1903), this court stated that: \u201c[TJhere seems to be an agreement of the authorities that where persons associate themselves together to carry on a joint business for their common benefit, to which each contributes either property or services, and the profits arising therefrom are to be shared between them, the essential elements of a contract of partnership are made out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, and cases cited. See <em>Estabrook </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>192 Mass. 499, 502-503 (1906).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The Commonwealth never addresses who the \u201cpartners\u201d are that form the alleged \u201cpartnership.\u201d Under the Commonwealth\u2019s definition, it seems that the officers, team managers, coaches, parents, players, and fans all share in the common purpose. To suggest that all of these people were partners in the partnership and thus liable for its debts and entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>share of its assets further reveals the weakness of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\">The Commonwealth relies on <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Bogoff, </em>402 Mass. 650 (1988), in which we held that \u201ceven if the arrangements at issue fall short of a textbook joint venture, they are sufficiently similar to such an endeavor to create a fiduciary relationship . . . similar to that which exists among parties to a joint venture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, quoting <em>Shain Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 4, 11 (1982). We did not hold in that case, as the Commonwealth seems to believe, that the arrangement at issue <em>was </em>a joint venture; rather, we held that it resembled a joint venture so closely that we felt justified in recognizing a fiduciary relationship among the members. Additionally, <em>Zimmerman </em>involved a question of civil liability and not, as here, a question of construing a statute for purposes of criminal liability. Finally, we note that the facts in <em>Zimmerman </em>came a lot closer to the \u201ctextbook\u201d definition of joint venture than the facts here come to the \u201ctextbook\u201d definition of partnership.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
