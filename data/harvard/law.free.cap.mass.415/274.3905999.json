We only discuss facts and legal questions not addressed in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>On June 8, 1990, the Boston Herald published an article about the picketing of the Massachusetts Democratic party\u2019s convention by a Springfield police union. The article\u2019s headline read: \u201cGOP: SUPPORTERS OF SILBER BEHIND SPRINGFIELD ACTION.\u201d The article stated that Republican party officials charged that \u201csupporters of Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Silber, including Senate President William Bulger, were behind the police demonstration that disrupted last weekend\u2019s Democratic State Convention.\u201d The article explained that the Republican party itself \u201cfaced a Democratic Party lawsuit alleging they were behind the disruption.\u201d The article quoted Alexander Tennant, who was described as the \u201cGOP State Committee Executive Director,\u201d as saying: \u201cIt will become clearer and clearer that the Republican Party had nothing to do with this and that there was a conspiracy. . . . There is a lot of discussion that Billy Bulger was involved in this. We\u2019re still gathering facts.\u201d The article added that Tennant \u201coffered no proof to back up the allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">After citing vehement denials of Tennant\u2019s allegations by spokesmen for Bulger and Silber, the article stated that \u201cTennant appeared on radio talk shows yesterday and made cryptic references to a \u2018Chuck Stuart\u2019 wrinkle in the convention saga. In this case, the suggestion is that the Democrats \u2014 now seen in some quarters as the victims of a GOP Watergate-style dirty trick \u2014 in the end will be revealed as the perpetrators. According to the theory advanced by Ten-nant \u2014 and mentioned widely on Beacon Hill \u2014 Kenneth Lyons, a Silber supporter and head of the National Association of Government Employees, served as the intermediary between the Silber campaign and the Springfield Police union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">On June 14, 1990, the plaintiffs commenced the present case in the Superior Court. Their complaint set forth arguments which essentially parallel those which they advanced in <em>Lyons I. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint named News Group Boston, the publisher of the Boston Herald newspaper, two of its reporters (Connolly and Miga), and Tennant. Tennant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>subsequently counterclaimed against Lyons for abuse of process, violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6 (/) (1990 ed.). All defendants moved for summary judgment on the libel counts pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The plaintiffs also moved for partial summary judgment on these counts. On October 29, 1992, a Superior Court judge denied all of these motions except for that of Miga.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge then reported to the Appeals Court \u201cthe correctness of [his] interlocutory orders denying the aforesaid motions for summary judgment.\u201d We granted the parties\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We hold that the challenged statements could be understood only as expressions of opinion and reasonably could not be construed to state facts. See <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Boston Magazine Co., </em>380 Mass. 336, 339 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The article plainly cautioned the reader that the allegedly defamatory statements constituted a \u201ctheory,\u201d a word connoting \u201cabstract knowledge\u201d or \u201cspeculation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2371 (2d ed. 1959). The article confirmed this message by stating that the proponent of the theory \u201coffered no proof to back up the allegations.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The challenged statements appeared in an article devoted to setting forth two alternative theories with respect to the picketers\u2019 motives. Finally, the challenged statements were uttered in the midst of a political controversy, an occasion where readers expect heated debate and self-serving assertions. See <em>Lyons I, supra </em>at 264.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>For the same reasons as in <em>Lyons I, </em>we hold that these expressions of opinion were based on disclosed or \u201cassumed\u201d nondefamatory facts and did not imply undisclosed defamatory facts. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 (1977). In addition to the disclosed facts described above, the article relied on the following assumed facts. Silber needed to obtain 15% of the delegates\u2019 vote at the convention in order to qualify for the party\u2019s primary ballot; before the convention, uncertainty had reigned with respect to Silber\u2019s ability to garner these votes; the picketing threatened to cancel the convention, an occurence which might have eliminated the 15% requirement. These facts had been reported in the Boston Globe article which the plaintiffs challenged in <em>Lyons I </em>as well as and in various other news reports. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 713 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 940 &amp; 962 (1988) (challenged cartoon relied on facts stated in article published on previous day). In addition, these facts form the very basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Herald article and Tennant\u2019s statements defamed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The allowance of this motion is not before us today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">As we did in <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., ante </em>258 (1993), we assume for the sake of argument that the challenged statements were defamatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Tennant was quoted as plainly stating that he was \u201cstill gathering facts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Like the Boston Globe\u2019s quoted comparison of the picketing to the Sandinistas\u2019 practices, the references in the article challenged here to Charles Stuart and to the Watergate scandal \u2014 as well as the characterization of the picketing as \u201cNazi strong-arm methods\u201d \u2014 amounted to nothing more than nonactionable verbal abuse.
