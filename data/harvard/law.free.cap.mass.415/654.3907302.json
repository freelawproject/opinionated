There was a directed verdict in favor of defendant Dr. Shellito, which has not been appealed. In response to special verdict questions, the jury found that the remaining defendants were not negligent and that the plaintiff had given informed consent to the performance of the colonoscopy. Judgment entered dismissing the entire action against all of the defendants. A motion for a new trial was denied. The plaintiff appeals arguing that the judge erred in his jury instructions by: (1) failing to provide the proper standard of care for the jury to follow in assessing the defendants\u2019 conduct; and (2) refusing to instruct the jury concerning the plaintiffs right to refuse treatment by students or medical personnel under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E (1990 ed.). We transferred the case here on our own motion and now conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The jury could have found the following facts. The plaintiff suffers from colonie polyps which cause periodic bleeding and require annual or semi-annual colonoscopy examinations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the recommendation of the plaintiff\u2019s cardiologist, the plaintiff utilized the surgical clinic at MGH for periodic follow up of his colonie polyps. Through the surgical clinic, the plaintiff underwent colonoscopies in 1980, 1982, 1983, and 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">On September 13, 1985, his cardiologist again referred the plaintiff to the surgical clinic where the plaintiff was examined by Dr. Jonathan Woodson. Dr. Woodson determined that a repeat colonoscopy would be appropriate, obtained the plaintiff\u2019s written consent to the colonoscopy, and scheduled the procedure. The consent form contained a handwritten note indicating that Dr. Woodson had discussed the inherent risks of the colonoscopy including the potential for perforation of the colon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Woodson did not discuss the fact that residents or fellows would be involved in the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The plaintiff was admitted to MGH on September 29, 1985, in preparation for his colonoscopy. He testified that he did not receive any writing, brochure, or printed document informing him of his rights as a patient. The following day, the procedure was performed in the surgical endoscopy unit by Dr. Dougherty and Dr. Schmidt, members of the west surgical service.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The plaintiff claims that the defendants did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>not inform him of their respective status as a resident and a fellow.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Dr. Dougherty testified that, although he could not recall specifically whether he had informed the plaintiff that he was a resident, he stated that he routinely introduced himself as a \u201cresident on Dr. Rattner\u2019s service.\u201d Dr. Schmidt introduced himself as the physician assisting Dr. Dougherty. Dr. Dougherty had graduated from medical school in 1984 and was in his second year of residency training in general surgery at MGH.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the months of September and October of 1985, Dr. Dougherty was assigned to the surgical endoscopy unit. Prior to performing the plaintiff\u2019s colonoscopy, Dr. Dougherty had participated in eight colonoscopies, completing four, while four were finished by Dr. Schmidt. Dr. Schmidt had completed his residency and had elected to pursue a one and one-half year fellowship with six months of this extra time to be spent in the area of surgical endoscopy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Before assuming the responsibility for the plaintiff\u2019s colonoscopy, Dr. Schmidt had participated in 137 colonoscopies.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Dr. Dougherty initially operated the hand controls of the colonoscope inserting it into the plaintiff\u2019s rectum and passing it into his sigmoid colon. Dr. Schmidt observed Dr. Dougherty through the teaching lens and instructed him on how to proceed. When Dr. Dougherty determined that he could not safely pass the colonoscope beyond the junction of the rectum and sigmoid colon (approximately four to six inches from insertion), Dr. Schmidt took control and finished the procedure. Dr. Shellito signed the operative report.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>cording to the defendants, the colonoscopy was uneventful. The plaintiff was discharged from MGH the following day without evidence of complications. On October 4, 1985, however, the plaintiff returned to MGH by way of ambulance complaining of abdominal pain. A perforation was found in the mid-portion of his sigmoid colon (approximately ten to twelve inches into the colon) requiring surgical repair and subsequently extensive rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">1. <em>Standard of care applicable to residents and fellows. </em>The plaintiff contends that the defendants held themselves out to be specialists in colonoscopy by their appearance, introduction as physicians, and performance of the colonos-copy. As such, the plaintiff argues that these factors mandated a jury instruction that the defendants\u2019 conduct should be held to the standard of the average qualified physician engaging in the practice of colonoscopy.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The evidence was undisputed that Dr. Dougherty inserted the colonoscope into the plaintiff\u2019s rectum and passed it into the sigmoid colon for approximately four to six inches and that the perforation occurred at ten to twelve inches into the colon. Thus there was no evidence establishing a causal link between Dr. Dougherty\u2019s manipulation of the colonoscope and the plaintiff\u2019s perforation. The jury\u2019s finding in favor of Dr. Dougherty, therefore, was compelled by the plaintiff\u2019s failure to establish that the physician\u2019s conduct caused his injuries regardless of the standard of care to be applied. <em>Forlano </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>393 Mass. 502, 507-508 (1984), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s expert, Dr. Oscar Martinez, testified that, despite Dr. Schmidt\u2019s completion of a residency program and partial completion of a fellowship program, he did not have the training or experience in colonoscopy to act as a qualified supervisor. On cross-examination, Dr. Martinez agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>a statement published by The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy regarding the standards of training and practice minimally required for endoscopic experience before being competent to do them independently as being fifty procedures. Dr. Martinez also testified that he was competent himself independently to perform colonoscopies after completing 100 procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The defendants\u2019 expert, Dr. John A. Coller, testified that perforation of the colon is an inherent risk in a colonoscopy. He would anticipate that a fellow such as Dr. Schmidt, who had participated in 137 colonoscopies, would be a competent teacher. He further testified that Dr. Schmidt\u2019s education, training, and the number of procedures performed would qualify him independently to perform colonoscopies and to supervise a second-year resident.</p>\n<p id=\"Amq2\">Since the opinion of Dr. Martinez concerning Dr. Schmidt\u2019s lack of skill and training related only to his lack of experience as a supervisor, there was no evidentiary basis for finding that he lacked the skill and experience to operate the scope or that he lacked the skill of the average qualified physician specializing in the field of surgical endoscopy. As to both Dr. Dougherty and Dr. Schmidt, therefore, there was no evidentiary basis for the requested instruction. In these circumstances, the judge was not wrong in refusing to give the instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>396 Mass. 499, 504 (1986); <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>241 Mass. 195, 196 (1922); J.R. Nolan, Civil Practice \u00a7 706, at 655-656 (2d ed. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">2. <em>Informed consent under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E, to refuse treatment by a resident or a fellow. </em>The plaintiff requested that the jury be instructed that G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E, required that the plaintiff be informed of his right to refuse to be treated by students or other facility staff and that, if any of the defendants failed so to inform the plaintiff, such failure constituted negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">In a separate memorandum on requests for jury instructions and motions for directed verdicts, the judge ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u201cThe case at bar is a medical malpractice claim, not a claim for vindication of the rights created by sec. 70E. The court rules that, in the context of this case, that statute, upon reflection and analysis, does not create for a patient rights regarding the appropriate standard of medical care or to informed consent greater than is provided by the common law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">\u201cIn particular, it does not expand the definition of what is \u2018material\u2019 that a physician should disclose. The analysis continues to be, first, what information did the physician possess, or reasonably should have possessed relating to the risks and alternatives (which is a matter for expert testimony); and second, what part of that information he reasonably should have recognized as material and shared with his patient, which is a matter which the jury can decide without expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\u201cIn this case the risk was of perforation or damage to the wall of the colon. The degree of risk was a matter of conflicting expert testimony. But the degree of risk relates only to whether it was material to disclose it. No party disputes that it was material to disclose the risk of perforation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201cEveryone agreed at trial that unskillful performance of a colonoscopy is not a \u2018risk\u2019 in the sense of a risk benefit analysis material to a decision on informed consent. The court does not read the law of informed consent to require a physician to raise the possibility with a patient that he might perform the operation unskillfully. If the jury finds that the procedure was performed unskillfully under the appropriate legal standard so as to perforate or injure the wall of the patient\u2019s colon the patient will prevail in any event. Insofar as a failure to provide informed consent is malpractice, entitling one to recover, it is to cover those situations where there was no other malpractice, but rather the actual occurrence of an untoward event which was a material risk, which occurred, (not because of negligence), and which should have been disclosed and consented to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>\u201cThe jury will be instructed consistently with the foregoing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The judge was not obligated to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">General Laws c. Ill, \u00a7 70E, provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery patient . . . shall be provided by the physician in the facility the right ... to refuse to be examined, observed, or treated by students or any other facility staff without jeopardizing access to . . . medical care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">First the plaintiffs request was not pertinent because the procedure in question was not performed by students, but by physicians. The plaintiff advances no reasonable argument that the words of the statute \u201cor other facility staff\u2019 were intended to include fully licensed physicians. That issue, therefore, is not before us. On this basis alone the judge was correct in refusing to give the requested instruction. Furthermore, in order to recover for a physician\u2019s failure to obtain informed consent, the plaintiff must show not only that the physician failed to disclose material information to the patient, but also that the physician\u2019s failure in this regard is causally related to the patient\u2019s injury. <em>Halley </em>v. <em>Birbiglia, </em>390 Mass. 540, 548 (1983). <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Ctr., </em>387 Mass. 152, 155 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">We are content that Dr. Dougherty\u2019s conduct could not have been found to be causally related to the plaintiffs injury. Therefore, no error could arise in the claim against him even if, assuming arguendo, the requested instruction was required. \u201cAn unrevealed risk that should have been made known must materialize, for otherwise the omission, however unpardonable, is legally without consequence.\u201d <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Ctr., supra </em>at 157-158, quoting <em>Canterbury </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>464 F.2d 772, 790 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1064 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Even if we assume that there was an obligation on Dr. Schmidt\u2019s part to disclose his experience, the plaintiffs cause is not advanced. According to undisputed expert testimony, a physician is competent to perform and supervise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>colonoscopy procedures after having performed at least fifty of them. There was evidence that Dr. Schmidt had participated in 137 colonoscopies prior to the plaintiff\u2019s procedure. The evidence warranted finding Dr. Schmidt qualified as an experienced physician and the jury found no negligence on his part. No error arises from the judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury as requested on G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Endoscopy is the insertion of a semi-flexible tube (scope) into various cavities of the body for the purpose of diagnosis, examination, or medical treatment.

He further testified that no one at the clinic or in the hospital informed him of the risk of being injured during the colonoscopy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The west surgical service was divided into three teams, each team consisting of a senior resident, junior resident, and an intern.

The judge ruled that Dr. Shellito\u2019s participation in the procedure was nothing more than to be available if the other physicians needed assistance or advice and not a retroactive acceptance of responsibility for the procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
