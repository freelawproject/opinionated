We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">This dispute arises in the context of a collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiff, Bay State Gas Company (Bay State), and the defendant union Local No. 273, Utility Workers Union of America (union). The agreement provides that the parties may arbitrate disputes arising under its terms. The agreement also stipulates that employee dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>charges must be for proper cause. In September, 1991, Bay State discharged several employees, including George Potvin and William Blandin, Sr., who are also defendants in this case. The union filed grievances pursuant to the labor agreement, claiming that Potvin and Blandin were discharged without proper cause. The grievances were then submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In June, 1992, Bay State directed a notary public to issue and to serve summonses on Potvin to appear in the Blandin discharge hearing, and on Blandin to appear at Potvin\u2019s hearing. Bay State claims that each defendant has information material to the other\u2019s case. Neither defendant, however, complied with the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In both cases the summonses were issued by a notary public and not by the arbitrator presiding over the hearing. It appears that the arbitrator in Potvin\u2019s hearing stated that he was not involved with the summons and, furthermore, had no authority to issue any such subpoena. Neither arbitrator sought judicial enforcement of the summonses issued on behalf of Bay State.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">On September 4, 1992, Bay State filed in the Superior Court Department an \u201cApplication for Enforcement of Summonses to Appear as Witnesses in Labor Arbitration.\u201d A Superior Court judge granted the application for enforcement of both summonses on September 18, but stayed the order for seven days pending the defendants\u2019 appeal. The defendants then filed a petition for a stay in the Appeals Court. A single justice of the Appeals Court entered an order on October 14, 1992, extending the judge\u2019s stay for the duration of the appeal. The Superior Court judge issued a final judgment granting Bay State\u2019s application for enforcement on December 9, 1992, and the defendants filed a timely appeal. We then transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The relationship between two Massachusetts statutes constitutes the crux of this dispute. On one hand, Bay State relies on G. L. c. 150C (1990 ed.), which governs collective bargaining agreements to arbitrate, and G. L. c. 233 (1990 ed.), which sets forth procedures for summoning witnesses in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>civil, criminal, and special tribunal proceedings, for its authority to apply for enforcement of the summonses. The defendants, on the other hand, argue that (1) neither statute cited by Bay State provides for judicial enforcement of summonses issued in labor arbitrations, and (2) even if judicial enforcement is available, Bay State failed to comply with statutory requirements. We agree with the defendants, but do not go as far as to say that a summons issued by an <em>arbitrator </em>rather than a <em>party </em>is likewise unenforceable under Massachusetts law. That issue is not before the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We begin with G. L. c. 150C, the Massachusetts labor arbitration statute, inserted by St. 1959, c. 546, \u00a7 1, to make \u201cwritten collective bargaining agreements to arbitrate enforceable,\u201d and to establish \u201cefficient, fair, and uniform procedures for the conduct of arbitration under such agreements and for resolving questions relating to the validity of resulting awards.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 418, 423 (1985). The defendants point out, quite accurately, that c. 150C does not expressly provide for (nor for that matter does it expressly prohibit) judicial enforcement of subpoenas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In sharp contrast, the Legislature, just one year later, enacted G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 7 <em>(a), </em>as appearing in St. 1960, c. 374, \u00a7 1, which deals with commercial arbitration and which expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>provides for judicial enforcement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This provision parallels \u00a7 7 of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (1988).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Roberto Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Burnham-Manning Post \u00a71105 Veterans of Foreign Wars, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 400, 403 (1964). Such language is absent from c. 150C. If the Legislature has intentionally omitted a provision from a statute, no court may then reintroduce it. <em>Boylston Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Tahanto Regional School Dist., </em>353 Mass. 81, 84 (1967). We discern no persuasive reasons for doing so here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Bay State concedes that c. 150C fails to provide a mechanism for enforcement of summonses. However, G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 5 <em>(b), </em>declares that \u201cparties shall have the right . . . to present evidence material to the controversy,\u201d and Bay State asserts that G. L. c. 233 provides the mechanism to compel such evidence. Section 1 of c. 233 states that \u201ca notary public . . . may issue summonses for witnesses in all cases pending before . . . arbitrators.\u201d This language is clear and unambiguous. See <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>260 Mass. 460, 465-466 (1927). \u201c[Wjhere the statutory language is clear, the courts must impart to the language its plain and ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 537 (1992). In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a statute\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning is conclusive as to legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>We may presume, therefore, that the Legislature intended to allow witnesses to be summonsed to appear at arbitration hearings. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Dana, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Unfortunately for Bay State, even if we assume that c. 233 applies to <em>labor </em>arbitrations, the statute plainly does not authorize either <em>party </em>to apply for judicial enforcement of a summons. Rather, the statute states that a court may compel the attendance of witnesses \u201cupon application of a <em>tribunal </em>authorized to summon but not to compel the attendance of witnesses\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 10. An arbitration panel is considered a \u201ctribunal\u201d for purposes of c. 233. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Dana, supra </em>at 464-465.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this case, neither arbitrator joined Bay State\u2019s application for enforcement; hence, the application fails to satisfy the requirements of c. 233, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Thus, Bay State\u2019s application for enforcement of the two summonses fails to find support in either G. L. c. 150C, or G. L. c. 233, Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Superior Court and vacate the order to enforce the two summonses.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\">This case concerns only summonses issued by a party in a labor arbitration. We note, however, that enforcement of a summons issued by an arbitrator would be consistent with Federal and State policies which promote arbitration as a viable alternative to litigation. Without the power to compel the attendance of witnesses, an arbitrator\u2019s fact-finding capability is severely limited. See <em>Wilkes-Barre Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Newspaper Guild of Wilkes-Barre, Local 120, </em>559 F. Supp. 875, 878 (M.D. Pa. 1982), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Specifically, c. 150C provides that the Superior Court may compel or stay labor arbitrations, \u00a7 2; assist in selecting arbitrators, \u00a7 3; order prompt scheduling, \u00a7 5; permit correction of awards, \u00a7 8; and confirm, vacate, or modify awards, \u00a7\u00a7 10-12. Parties may file an appeal pursuant to \u00a716. These provisions are similar to the corresponding text in G. L. c. 251 (1990 ed.), and the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (1988). <em>Roberto Constr.

L. c. 233, \u00a7 10, operate to avoid collateral litigation. By authorizing only the arbitrator to petition to enforce a summons, the statute prevents parties from impeding the progress of the arbitration. The parties must first persuade the arbitrator that the evidence they seek is necessary for proper settlement of the dispute. If a party believes that its rights have been substantially prejudiced by the arbitrator\u2019s actions, that party may apply to the Superior Court for modification or vacation of the arbitrator\u2019s award.
