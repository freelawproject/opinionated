L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.), which seeks dismissal of certain criminal charges on the ground of double jeopardy. At issue is whether the Commonwealth may prosecute the plaintiff (hereinafter, defendant) on charges which he contends are based on the same conduct that resulted in his being adjudged in contempt for violating a protective order issued under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7 (1990 ed.) (Abuse Prevention Act). We conclude that the judgment of contempt does not bar the Commonwealth from prosecuting the defendant on the pending charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>In December, 1990, as a result of proceedings initiated by the defendant\u2019s wife, a judge in the Ayer Division of the District Court Department issued a series of protective orders under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7, ordering inter alla, the defendant to refrain from abusing his wife and to remain away from her household. The orders were effective through March 24, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In February, 1991, as a result of proceedings initiated by the defendant\u2019s girl friend, a judge in the same court issued orders that the defendant refrain from abusing his girl friend and immediately leave and remain away from her household. These orders were effective until February 25, 1992.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On December 11 and 12, 1991, two criminal complaints were issued charging the defendant with assault and battery on his wife, and with violating a protective order and making criminal threats against his girl friend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the arraignment in the Ayer District Court, a judge held a contempt hearing to decide whether the defendant\u2019s conduct, as alleged in the criminal complaints, violated the protective orders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>fendant\u2019s wife, his girl friend, and a man who lived with the defendant testified. The judge found the defendant in contempt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">At the sentencing hearing the following day,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> defense counsel asked, \u201cYour honor, we are in agreement, then, that what took place yesterday was a civil contempt proceeding?\u201d The judge responded, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think I have much trouble with that. . . . What occurred yesterday was a contempt proceeding under the specific statutory grant of [G. L. 209A] that authorizes a court to consider whether or not a defendant under a restraining order is in contempt of that order.\u201d Defense counsel then restated his question, \u201cAnd therefore it\u2019s a civil proceeding. Correct?\u201d To which the judge responded, \u201cI\u2019m not going to characterize it. It may well be. It certainly didn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not a criminal proceeding, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s being conducted specifically under a statutory grant.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>After further discussion with both defense counsel and the assistant district attorney, the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u201cAnd having heard the evidence and having made the findings that I have made, I do find this defendant in civil contempt. And in accordance with that, and as the only means I have of assuring the enforcement of this Court\u2019s orders, I\u2019m committing him to the common jail for a period of thirty days. He may \u2014 he may post the sum of $5,000 cash . . . with the clerk of this court. And the condition of the posting of that cash will be, that he will have absolutely no contact whatsoever with either woman in this case, directly or indirectly, at the risk of the forfeiting of that $5,000 cash and a further review of whether there is a new contempt. In other words, he\u2019s being.committed for thirty days. He can purge himself of that contempt by posting the $5,000 cash with the clerk\u2019s office on the conditions that I have sought to identify here this morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">When defense counsel objected to the \u201camount of the bail of $5,000 cash,\u201d the judge responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">\u201cOh, it\u2019s not bail. . . . I\u2019m committing him in and finding him in civil contempt and I\u2019m committing him for a term of thirty days to the common jail. I\u2019m going to permit him to purge himself of that contempt by posting in the clerk\u2019s office $5,000 cash money ... the strict condition of which is that he\u2019s to have no contact directly or indirectly with the women involved in this case. If he posts the $5,000 cash and he\u2019s prepared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>come before the Court and make the representation that he understands the conditions and will abide by them, I will purge him of the contempt. Short of that, he stands committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The defendant was incarcerated from December 18, 1991, to January 16, 1992. On February 11, 1992, after electing a first instance jury trial, resulting in the transfer of the criminal complaints to the Lowell District Court jury session, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaints on the ground of double jeopardy. A judge in that court denied the motions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, a petition was filed with a single justice of this court under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking a stay of the defendant\u2019s trial and dismissal of the charges. One single justice granted a stay on April 27, 1992; another single justice reserved and reported the matter to the full court on October 27, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">1. The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against three distinct abuses: a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for the same offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>414 Mass. 343, 346 (1993). It is the third of these abuses that we are concerned with here. If the judge below was exercising his authority in a nonpunitive, noncriminal manner, there was no \u201cpunishment\u201d in the constitutional sense that would involve the double jeopardy clause. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Feiock, </em>485 U.S. 624, 640-641 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>In order to determine whether the judge below imposed punishment, we focus on the sanction imposed on the defendant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 447 (1989). <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Feiock, supra </em>at 636.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">\u201c \u2018If it is for civil contempt the punishment is remedial, and for the benefit of the complainant. But if it is for criminal contempt the sentence is punitive, to vindicate the authority of the court.\u2019 <em>Gompers </em>v. <em>Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Co., </em>221 U.S. 418, 441 (1911). The character of the relief imposed is thus ascertainable by applying a few straightforward rules. If the relief provided is a sentence of imprisonment, it is remedial if \u2018the defendant stands committed unless and until he performs the affirmative act required by the court\u2019s order,\u2019 and is punitive if \u2018the sentence is limited to imprisonment for a definite period.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 442. If the relief provided is a fine, it is remedial when it is paid to the complainant, and punitive when it is paid to the court, though a fine that would be payable to the court is also remedial when the defendant can avoid paying the fine simply by performing the affirmative act required by the court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Feiock, supra </em>at 631-632.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">When we apply these rules to the instant case, it is clear that the sanction imposed on the defendant was civil in nature. The sanction was remedial and specifically designed to compel compliance with the protective orders that the defendant had previously disobeyed. In addition, the sentence imposed was not for a definite period. Rather, it was structured so that the defendant could purge himself of the sentence at any time if he posted the required cash amount and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>represented to the court that he would have no further contact with the women. Such a sanction is a proper civil contempt remedy. See <em>Shillitani </em>v. <em>United States, </em>384 U.S. 364 (1966) (sentence must be viewed as civil in nature if court conditions release on contemnor\u2019s willingness to comply with order or imposes determinate sentence which includes purge clause); <em>Gompers </em>v. <em>Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Co., supra </em>at 442 (conditional nature of punishment renders relief civil since contemnor \u201ccan end the sentence and discharge himself at any moment by doing what he had previously refused to do\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Similarly, the cash-posting requirement was also conditioned on the defendant\u2019s compliance with the protective court order. It was also a proper civil contempt sanction. See <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Feiock, supra </em>at 631-632. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fall River Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>382 Mass. 465, 475 (1981) (conditional, coercive orders considered civil contempt). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the cash requirement was not a \u201cfine\u201d; it was merely designed to ensure that the defendant complied with the terms of the original restraining order. Even if it was intended that the sum revert to the Commonwealth if the defendant again violated the court order, that would not make the sanction criminal where the primary objective of such a prospective \u201cfine\u201d is to coerce compliance with a court order. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fall River Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 475-476.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, supra, </em>is misplaced. The question the Supreme Court addressed in <em>Halper, supra </em>at 443, was \u201cwhether a civil sanction, in application, may be so divorced from any remedial goal that it constitutes \u2018punishment\u2019 for the purposes of double jeopardy analysis.\u201d The Court held that \u201cunder the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448-449. The Court then emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cWhat we announce ... is a rule for the rare case, the case such as the one before us, where a fixed-penalty provision subjects a prolific but small-gouge offender to a sanction overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damages he has caused. The rule is one of reason: Where a defendant previously has sustained a criminal penalty and the civil penalty sought in the subsequent proceeding bears no rational relation to the goal of compensating the Government for its loss, but rather appears to qualify as \u2018punishment\u2019 in the plain meaning of the word, then the defendant is entitled to an accounting of the Government\u2019s damages and costs to determine if the penalty sought in fact constitutes a second punishment. . . . [T]he only proscription established by our ruling is that the Government may not criminally prosecute a defendant, impose a criminal penalty upon him, and then bring a separate civil action based on the same conduct and receive a judgment that is not rationally related to the goal of making the Government whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449-451.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">As to the defendant\u2019s argument grounded on his claimed inability to post the required amount, it is settled that, in a civil proceeding, the defendant had the burden of proving his inability to comply with the court order. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rylander, </em>460 U.S. 752, 757 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Ford Econoline Van, </em>413 Mass. 407, 412 (1992). Here, the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the \u201camount of the bail\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>set by the judge, but introduced no evidence on the defendant\u2019s inability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">2. The defendant argues that, even if the proceeding was civil in nature, the judge should have followed the procedure outlined in Mass. R. Civ. P. 65.3, as appearing in 386 Mass. 1244 (1982) (proceedings for civil contempt). Rule 65.3 applies to the enforcement of restraining orders and injunctions generally. The procedures delineated are inconsistent with the clear intent of c. 209A, that there be speedy intervention by the courts in domestic disputes to protect the health and safety of the domestic partners. Moreover, the rule does not apply to the District Court Department. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 1, 365 Mass. 730 (1974). Although the District Court rules incorporate many of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure including rules 65 and 65.1, rule 65.3 was not adopted. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 65, 365 Mass. 832 (1974); Mass. R. Civ. P. 65.1, 365 Mass. 834 (1974); Mass. R. Civ. P. 65.2, as amended, 376 Mass. 948 (1979); Mass. R. Civ. P. 65.3; Dist./Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 65-66 (1992). In such a situation the District Court rules authorize the court to \u201cproceed in any lawful manner.\u201d Dist./Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 81 (1992). Since the defendant was given notice, was represented by counsel, and was afforded an opportunity to be heard, the procedure followed by the judge was lawful. This is especially so considering, as noted above and as specifically commented on by the judge, the requirements for speedy intervention in G. L. c. 209A.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We hold that, since the contempt sanction was civil in nature, proceeding with criminal charges against the defendant will not offend the double jeopardy clause. A judgment is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>enter denying the defendant relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">On December 11, 1991, a judge issued a similar set of restraining orders and included a provision that the defendant have \u201cno contact directly or indirectly with [his girl friend], including telephone communication.\u201d These orders were made effective until December 16, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In bills of particulars provided to the defendant in February, 1992, the Commonwealth described the charges as follows: (1) the assault and battery allegedly occurred on December 10, 1991, at the wife\u2019s household when the defendant \u201cdid assault and beat [his wife] in that he punched, pushed and grabbed her about the head and body\u201d; (2) the violation of the protective order and the threat to commit a crime allegedly occurred on December 10, 1991, when the defendant telephoned his girl friend and threatened to kill her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\">General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 7 (1990 ed.), states in pertinent part: \u201cCriminal remedies provided herein are not exclusive and do not preclude any other available civil or criminal remedies. The superior, probate and family, district and Boston municipal court departments may each enforce by civil contempt procedure a violation of its own court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The defendant did not object to the contempt hearing procedure as announced by the judge, and was provided approximately one and one-half hours to prepare for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">At the arraignment, when asked by the judge whether there was a question of bail, the assistant district attorney stated that the defendant had been released on $100 cash bail on one of the charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The judge stated: \u201cI don\u2019t have any doubt at all that on the date in question this defendant, in clear violation of the Court\u2019s order, went on those premises [his wife\u2019s residence]. And he didn\u2019t just violate the order by going on the premises or raising his voice, he took after her and beat on her. And that\u2019s exactly what this order was attempting to forestall, that he was not to be engaging in acts of violence towards this woman. And I consider that to be willful and deliberate and [contumacious] it\u2019s conduct in clear violation and in contempt of this Court\u2019s order. And if this Court is going to have any way of seeing that its orders get enforced, it\u2019s going to start considering actions like this before we get to questions about whether [there] on some criminal case that was an assault and battery or whether that conduct amounted to a violation of a protective order. . . . [T]his man is out of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u201cHe\u2019s out of control with both people. And one of them may invite more of it than the other, but he has to be dealt with. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u201cI have no assurances that this woman is going to be safe as long as he\u2019s on the street while these cases are pending. . . . I\u2019m finding him in contempt and . . . I\u2019m going to tell you what I\u2019m going to do about it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The hearing was adjourned until the following day at the request of defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b296-10\">The judge then continued: \u201cI view this to be an extremely urgent matter, of great exigency, that poses a clear and present danger to each of the women in this case. I\u2019ve heard the evidence. I\u2019m persuaded that \u2014 by clear and convincing evidence as a matter of fact, that this man . . . beat his wife, as the history has been in the past, that he punched her all over the place, that he banged her off two or three walls; that as a result, she came back seeking further relief in the face of an existing restraining or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>der. It\u2019s not good enough for me to say, \u2018Well, now we ought to have a complaint issue for contempt [pursuant to Mass. P. Civ. P. Rule 65.3, as defense counsel had requested]. We\u2019ll await an answer for twenty days and we\u2019ll go on.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u201cSee, there are other remedies that I even considered yesterday \u2014 while we\u2019re talking about what occurred \u2014 and that is, it was clear to me that this defendant, as you\u2019ve indicated earlier, was before the Court for arraignment on the violation of a restraining order and he was before the Court on an assault and battery on his wife. And I could have considered, for example, the question of setting some kind of bail. But that would be a misuse of bail in my opinion, because that was not the purpose of the bail statute. We don\u2019t have preventative detention in this Commonwealth yet. And so I\u2019m not going to start resorting to that under the bail statute. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u201cMy concern here is the safety and well being of two women, most especially this man\u2019s wife. He has the demonstrated capacity to cause serious physical injury on the one hand and he has the demonstrated capacity to make life-threatening assertions on the other. So I\u2019m not going to wait for some 20-day proceeding and an opportunity to set this down for some kind of discovery and all of those things that might attend the normal civil contempt proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u201cI\u2019m satisfied from what I heard yesterday, as I indicated earlier, by clear and convincing evidence, that this defendant beat this woman, his wife; that he made threats to the other woman under a separate restraining order; that that conduct is in flagrant and deliberate and clear violation of this Court\u2019s order; that if this Court is going to do anything to see to the proper enforcement of its orders, it should and it must, and it has the authority, as I read [G. L. c. 209A], to undertake an immediate . . . forthwith determination of whether or not a particular defendant is in contempt of an existing court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Defense counsel then read from G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7, stating, \u201cThe Superior, Probate, Family, District and Boston Municipal Court departments may enforce by civil contempt procedure a violation of its own court order.\u201d To which the judge responded, \u201cSo I don\u2019t disagree with you. If you want to characterize it as civil contempt, I don\u2019t disagree with that. . . . The problem with it, however, is, what is the appropriate procedure or remedy to be followed.\u201d Defense counsel later stated, \u201cAnd for that reason, I was thinking of \u2014 it called \u2014 [G. L. c. 209A], a civil contempt proceeding.\u201d To which the judge again responded, \u201cRight. And that\u2019s exactly what we had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">In response to defense counsel\u2019s comment that \u201cadditional confusion came by utilizing the district attorney\u2019s office to prosecute a civil contempt,\u201d the judge responded: \u201c[T] here\u2019s been some reference made to the fact that the Commonwealth \u2014 the prosecutor participated in the proceeding, and I\u2019m very mindful that that was exactly what occurred. And, in fact, that was at my instruction. Because I see a risk, that if we don\u2019t have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>an adversary-type proceeding and the judge starts injecting himself into the case, that that\u2019s subject to criticism as well. And it was for that reason that I vested in the hands of two attorneys ... of the presentation that occurred before this Court yesterday. And I\u2019m also at pains to say that I know of nothing . . . that was or could have been adduced in this proceeding in behalf of this defendant that either was identified, or even this morning, is identifiable that would \u2014 that could not and was not reached directly yesterday .... And so I am, and I was, mindful yesterday that I\u2019m not going to compel anybody to participate in a proceeding unless they understand it and they have a fair opportunity to defend themselves. And it seems to me that that\u2019s \u2014 that all of those standards were met yesterday.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied in April, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d It is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508, 510 n.1 (1990).
