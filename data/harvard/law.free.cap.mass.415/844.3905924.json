The insurers moved for summary judgment. A judge in the Superior Court granted the insurers\u2019 motion, and Tufts appealed. We granted the Tufts\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">The following facts are not in dispute. Tufts purchased liability insurance coverage from both insurers. The policy periods on the Commercial Union policy extended from July 1, 1968, to November 7, 1972. The policy periods on the St. Paul policy covered November 7, 1972, through July 1, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">In June, 1977, the Jacksonville Electric Authority (Jacksonville) acquired by condemnation land in Florida that had once been owned by a subsidiary of Tufts. In April, 1989, Jacksonville filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Tufts and two other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>defendants, to recover cleanup and response costs for environmental damage to the land under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601 et seq. (1988). The complaint alleged that: (1) the Eppinger and Russell Company (E &amp; R), The Bernuth Corporation, and Tufts owned or operated a creosote wood preservation facility on the subject parcel until the early 1960\u2019s; (2) E &amp; R was a wholly owned subsidiary of Tufts from 1925 until 1942; (3) while E &amp; R, Bernuth and Tufts owned or operated the facility, arsenic creosote, carbazole, and phenanthrene were released during transfer, storage, and preservation treatment operations on the parcel; (4) Jacksonville had incurred and will incur costs for remedial actions necessary to treat and cap the hazardous substances released on the site; (5) the actions taken are in response to directives from the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation pursuant to a consent order, a copy of which was attached to the complaint. The consent order stated that tests indicated contamination of soil and ground water, and that Jacksonville was attempting to eliminate discharges into the St. Johns River.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Tufts moved for summary judgment on Jacksonville\u2019s complaint and a United States District Court judge granted the motion on the basis that Tufts was not an \u201cowner and/or operator\u201d of the site under CERCLA. <em>Jacksonville Elec. Auth. </em>v. <em>Eppinger &amp; Russell Co., 776 </em>F. Supp. 1542 (M.D. Fla. 1991), and Jacksonville appealed. That appeal is currently pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In May, 1989, Tufts demanded that the insurers defend and indemnify it in connection with the Jacksonville action. When the insurers refused, Tufts filed this action in Superior Court in Middlesex County seeking a declaration of its rights under the policies. The Superior Court judge ruled: \u201cThe in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>surers have no duty to defend in this case because the claimant Jacksonville did not become the owner of the property until June, 1977, and thus could not possibly have sustained property damage in relation to this property until two years after the end of the latest policy period.\u201d We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">1. A liability insurer has the duty to defend third-party actions against an insured if the allegations in the third-party complaint are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>SCA Servs., Inc., </em>412 Mass. 330, 331-332 (1992). <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 146-147 (1984). <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). Under the policy terms the insurers promised to \u201cpay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of . . . <em>property damage . . . </em>caused by an <em>occurrence, </em>and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such . . . property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent. . .\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the Commercial Union policy the term \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>damage, neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d The policies define \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property\u201d during the policy period.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The policies contain provisions excluding coverage for \u201cproperty damage to property owned or occupied by . . . the insured,\u201d but do not contain pollution exclusion clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Reading these policy provisions together, we conclude that the allegations in the Jacksonville complaint state a claim covered by the policy terms. In the United States District Court complaint, Jacksonville requests reimbursement for the cost of cleaning up contamination on the site caused by release of hazardous substances during the time Tufts owned or operated the site. The \u201coccurrence\u201d is the \u201cinjurious exposure\u201d to the hazardous material during the policy periods. The \u201cproperty damage\u201d is the continued contamination of soil and groundwater on the site during the policy periods caused by the release of the hazardous material. <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity and Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 698 (1990). The plain language of the policy terms, therefore, indicates that the insurers had a duty to defend Tufts in these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The insurers argue that the proper inquiry under these policies is.not whether property damage occurred during the policy period, but whether the entity making the claim sustained harm during the policy period. <em>Hoppy\u2019s Oil Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>783 F. Supp. 1505, 1508 (D. Mass. 1992). Thus, they argue that the judge was correct in ruling that, since Jacksonville did not acquire the property until 1977, it could not have sustained harm until after the last policy period in 1975. We disagree with this interpretation of the policies. The policy language does not require that Jacksonville have a property interest in the contaminated property during the policy period, but only that the property damage itself occur during that time. Had the insurers in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>tended to exclude coverage whenever the underlying plaintiff did not own the property at the time of the occurrence, the insurers could have expressed such an exclusion. See <em>Garriott Crop Dusting Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Kern County, </em>221 Cal. App. 3d 783, 791 (1990). Even assuming that the policies are susceptible to the interpretation of the insurers, where \u201cthere are two rational interpretations of policy language, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it.\u201d <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., supra </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In construing this policy, it is also appropriate \u201cto consider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We conclude that a reasonable policyholder, reading this policy language, would expect coverage in these circumstances. There is no restriction in the language of the policy requiring that the claimant possess an ownership interest in the property at the time the damage occurred. \u201cWe read the policy as written. We are not free to revise it or change the order of the words.\u201d <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 147 (1984). This court has, in the past, refused narrowly to construe policy terms which would limit or defeat \u201cany coverage fairly intended to be given by a policy described by the insurer in such broad terms (\u2018Comprehensive General Liability Policy\u2019) as was this policy.\u201d <em>Vappi &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty </em>&amp; <em>Sur. Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 432 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The judge and the insurers rely on <em>Hoppy\u2019s Oil Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>783 F. Supp. 1505, 1508 (D. Mass. 1992) (\u201cUnder \u2018occurrence\u2019 coverage, as commonly construed and applied in Massachusetts . . . and other states as well, an entity making a tort claim against the insured must sustain harm within the period of the policy in order to assert a claim to which the insurance applies\u201d). In <em>Hoppy\u2019s Oil, </em>the court held that an insurer had no duty to defend an insured where the plaintiff in the underlying action did not acquire an interest in the property allegedly damaged by the insured until after the period of the policy. <em>Hoppy\u2019s Oil </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number><em>Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am., supra </em>at 1508. The United States District Court based its decision on a Massachusetts case, <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., supra. </em>See <em>Hoppy\u2019s Oil Serv., supra </em>at 1508-1509 (\u201cAlthough the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has not yet had occasion to consider this precise issue, see <em>Lumber-mens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Belleville Indus., Inc., </em>407 Mass. 675 . . . [1990], this conclusion is consistent with relevant Massachusetts precedent. See <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143 . . . [1984]\u201d). We, however, distinguish <em>Gilbane, supra, </em>and decline to follow the rule in <em>Hoppy\u2019s Oil Serv., supra, </em>in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\"><em>Gilbane, supra, </em>was a declaratory judgment action brought by the insurer of two construction firms alleged to be responsible to the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company for faulty design of the John Hancock Tower that led to the failure of glass window panels and resulting property damage. <em>Id. </em>at 144-146. The insurer contended that a \u201c[c]are, custody, or control exclusion\u201d in the comprehensive general liability policy issued to the construction companies justified its disclaimer of coverage. Under that exclusion, there was no coverage for property <em>\u201cbeing installed, erected or worked </em>upon\u201d by the companies (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 151. The insurer argued that the failure of the window panels constituted a single occurrence that commenced when the companies were still working on them, and therefore that the damage was not within the policy. <em>Id. </em>The court rejected the argument, stating: \u201cThe time of the occurrence of an accident within the meaning of an indemnity policy is not the time the wrongful act was committed, but the time when the complaining party was actually damaged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">It is in this context that the rule followed in <em>Gilbane, supra, </em>must be read. The underlying claimant in <em>Gilbane, supra, </em>owned the damaged property at all relevant times. The court, therefore, could refer to damage to the \u201ccomplaining party\u201d instead of damage to the \u201cproperty.\u201d <em>Garri-ott Crop Dusting Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Kern County, </em>221 Cal. App. 3d 783, 793 (1990). But by doing so, the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>distinguishing between a causative act and the injurious result of that act. <em>Id. </em>at 795. Applied here <em>Gilbane, supra, </em>stands for the proposition that the event giving rise to coverage under an occurrence-based.policy is the happening of the actual property damage, and not the causative act. <em>Garriott Crop Dusting Co., supra </em>at 793-794. Moreover, the court in <em>Gilbane, supra, </em>did not require that the complaining party own the property at the time the damage occurs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The California Court of Appeals distinguished the general rule of <em>Gilbane, supra, </em>in similar fashion. <em>Garriott Crop Dusting Co., supra </em>at 793-795. See <em>Remmer </em>v. <em>Glens Falls Indem. Co., </em>140 Cal. App. 2d 84, 88 (1956) (\u201cThe general rule is that the time of the occurrence of an accident within the meaning of an indemnity policy is not the time the wrongful act was committed, but the time when the complaining party was actually damaged\u201d). The <em>Garriott </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-6\">\u201cIn the midst of this rush to adopt the \u2018general rule\u2019 of <em>Remmer, </em>it must be remembered that the rule is just that: a general rule. It is not universal; it is not without exception. . . . [Here, the insured] is now being sued for property damage (physical injury to tangible property) which may have commenced during one of the last two . . . policy periods \u2014 precisely what the policies say they cover. Use of the <em>Remmer </em>rule to impose a prerequisite to coverage not expressed in the policies (i.e., that the eventual claimant had to own the damaged property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>during the policy period) would be contrary to every fundamental rule of insurance policy construction.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-5\"><em>Garriott Crop Dusting Co., supra </em>at 794-795.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">There are additional reasons that support our interpretation. If Tufts were sued under CERCLA or G. L. c. 21E for allegedly contaminating two separate properties \u2014 one owned by the same party throughout the period during which the property damage occurred, and the other recently sold to a new owner \u2014 under the insurer\u2019s interpretation coverage would exist for the former claim but not the latter. See <em>Gar-riott Crop Dusting Co., supra </em>at 795 (\u201cWe do not see any reason why the existence of coverage <em>vel non </em>should turn on fortuitous events or conditions wholly outside the insured\u2019s control\u201d). Moreover, since CERCLA and the Massachusetts equivalent, G. L. c. 2IE, attempt to place the ultimate responsibility for cleaning up hazardous waste on those entities responsible for the contamination, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607; G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 5 <em>(a), </em>we think it entirely logical that the insurer whose policies are in effect during the time that the property damage is alleged to have occurred be required to defend the insured. See <em>Jacksonville Elec. Auth. </em>v. <em>Eppinger &amp; Russell Co., </em>776 F. Supp. 1542, 1545 (M.D. Fla. 1991), citing <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>Allis Chalmers Corp., </em>893 F.2d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">2. The \u201cowned property exclusion\u201d in each policy, which prevents an insured from obtaining coverage for damage or injury to \u201cproperty owned or occupied by or rented to the insured,\u201d does not preclude our result. The facts alleged in the complaint and those facts known by the insurers do not establish that Tufts owned the contaminated property. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. 7, 10-11 (1989). The underlying complaint does allege that Tufts \u201cowned and/or operated\u201d a facility on the Jacksonville site. However, it also alleged that E &amp; R was a wholly owned subsidiary of Tufts, which ordinarily would mean that Tufts owned stock in E &amp; R, and E &amp; R <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>owned the property. <em>Jacksonville Elec. Auth. </em>v. <em>Eppinger &amp; Russell Co., supra </em>at 1544. Indeed, the court in the underlying Jacksonville action stated: \u201cIt is undisputed that [Tufts] never actually owned the facility in question. [E &amp; R] owned the facility, while [Tufts] was the parent company of [E &amp; R]. \u2018The property of the corporation is its property, and not that of the stockholders, as owners.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1545.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">3. Commercial Union also argues it had no duty to defend Tufts because the property damage to the Jacksonville site did not manifest itself until after its last policy period. Commercial Union, however, again ignores the language of the policy itself. The policy requires a duty to defend where there is an \u201coccurrence,\u201d including injurious exposure to conditions, that results, during the policy period in \u201cproperty damage,\u201d a term defined as injury to, or destruction of, property. Nothing in the language of the policies requires that the claimed property damage be discovered or manifested during the policy period. The inquiry instead, is whether the property damage, as defined in the policies, \u201coccurred\u201d within the policy period and within the meaning of the word \u201coccurrence.\u201d <em>Harford County </em>v. <em>Harford Mut. Ins. Co., </em>327 Md. 418, 434 (1992). Indeed, the very nature of an \u201coccurrence\u201d as opposed to a \u201cclaims-made\u201d policy is to provide coverage for property damage that occurred during the policy period whenever that liability is imposed. K.S. Abraham, Environmental Liability Insurance Law 95 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We have already said: \u201cThe contamination of soil and groundwater by the release of hazardous material involves property damage.\u201d <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity and Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 698 (1990). The burden of showing that property damage occurred within the coverage of the policies is on the insured. <em>Harford County </em>v. <em>Harford Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 436. We, therefore, conclude that coverage may be triggered before discovery or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>manifestation of the damage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>New Castle County </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>725 F. Supp. 800, 812 (D. Del. 1989), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 933 F.2d 1162 (3d Cir. 1991) (applying continuous trigger to environmental damage from spread of leachate); <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas Solvent Co., </em>683 F. Supp. 1139, 1153, 1162 (W.D.Mich. 1988) (rejecting manifestation trigger and holding occurrence may have happened after each exposure of the environment to a pollutant); <em>Harford County </em>v. <em>Harford Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 434-436 (rejecting manifestation theory and holding that policies in effect when property damage occurred are triggered).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">In deciding this appeal we need not reach the question whether another trigger is appropriate; we need only decide that the manifestation trigger is inappropriate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Lumber-mens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Belleville Indus., Inc., </em>407 Mass. 675, 687 (1990); <em>Harford County </em>v. <em>Harford Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 436. Any of the other trigger theories would raise a duty to defend, but a precise determination of which we should adopt requires additional findings on the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>injury. See <em>Belleville Indus., supra, </em>quoting <em>In re Acushnet River &amp; New Bedford Harbor, </em>725 F. Supp. 1264, 1276 (D. Mass. 1989) (crucial factor in determining when injury occurs for purposes of insurance coverage is nature of injury).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">We note that different triggers may be applied to different types of injuries and property damage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Trizec Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Biltmore Constr. Co., </em>767 F.2d 810, 813 (11th Cir. 1985) (manifestation trigger rejected in negligence and breach of contract action in construction case); <em>American Home Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>748 F.2d 760, 764 (2d Cir. 1984) (injury-in-fact trigger adopted in bodily injury case); <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am. </em>v. <em>Forty-Eight Insulations, Inc., </em>657 F.2d 814 (6th Cir. 1981) (exposure, rather than manifestation trigger adopted in asbestos case); <em>Triangle Publications </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>703 F. Supp. 367, 371 (E.D. Pa. 1989) (manifestation trigger rejected in environmental damage case; insured must prove actual damage during policy period).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">4. Commercial Union argues that its policies are not triggered because the property damage at the site was a loss in progress at the inception of its policy periods. Their argument, however, raises questions of fact as to when property damage at the site occurred and, therefore, cannot be a basis for sustaining summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">5. Commercial Union also contends it has no duty to defend because E &amp; R\u2019s operations were not scheduled hazards in its policies. The policy which purports to be com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>prehensive general liability insurance provides that \u201ccoverages\u201d includes \u201cproperty damage liability\u201d and that a specific premium was charged for the coverage. Item 3 of the declarations page states: \u201cThe insurance afforded is only with respect to such of the following coverages as are indicated by specific premium charge or charges.\u201d Nowhere does the policy unambiguously provide that coverage is limited to the specific hazards listed in the schedule. Thus, the very reading of the policy now urged by Commercial Union could not properly be the basis of summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">A related issue is Commercial Union\u2019s argument that it has no duty to defend because Tufts\u2019 failure to identify E &amp; R as a scheduled hazard increased Commercial Union\u2019s risk of loss. The policy does not seek to identify the ownership of stock or clearly require the insured to disclose property it may have controlled in the past as the result of its ownership of corporate stock. Commercial Union argues that at the very least these issues should be resolved by further proceedings in the Superior Court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">6. Finally, we decline to accept Commercial Union\u2019s assertion that we should reject Tufts\u2019 arguments as not based on the record before the Superior Court. Our decision is not based on Tufts\u2019 characterization of the policies as \u201cstandard form\u201d and \u201cclassic contracts of adhesion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The complaint does not specify the precise dates of release, contamination, or migration of the pollutants but can be reasonably read as alleging such damage throughout the time periods encompassed by the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b863-6\">\u201cOtherwise stated, the process is one of envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of the allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg.

App. 3d 783, 791 (1990), reviewing similar policy language, stated: \u201c[U]nder the terms of the insurance policies . . . the \u2018event triggering coverage is one that causes \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property\u201d . . . during the policy period. Nowhere do the policies say to whom that property must belong, save that it must not belong to the insured. In other words, the policies themselves do not expressly require that the eventual claimant own the property at the time the property is damaged for coverage to ensue; they merely require that the damage, the \u201cphysical injury to . . . tangible property,\u201d \u2019 take place during the policy period.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">That court also concluded that \u201cno genuine issue of material fact exists which would justify piercing the corporate veil to hold Tufts liable as an owner under CERCLA.\u201d <em>Jacksonville Elec.

Those that did adopt the trigger reasoned that the bodily injury or property damage at issue does not occur until manifested. K.S. Abraham, Environmental Liability Insurance Law 97 (1991).

An insurer must indemnify its insured when a judgment within its policy coverage is rendered against the insured. The duty to defend, however, is antecedent to, and independent of, the duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. 7, 10 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Indeed, one commentator has noted that, given variations in the injury processes associated with different kinds of environmental harms, different triggers for environmental harms may be appropriate.
