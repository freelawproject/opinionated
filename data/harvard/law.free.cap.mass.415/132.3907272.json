The complaint alleged that during several disciplinary actions county officials violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional right to due process of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. On November 4, 1991, a judge in the Superior Court issued a memorandum and order granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the issue of liability but denying declaratory relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge also ruled that the then Commissioner of Correction (Commissioner), Michael Fair, was liable individually for damages. The defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment were denied. With the amount of damages yet to be resolved, partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs was entered on November 25, 1991. The defendants petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court for leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal from judgment of the Superior Court. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118 (1990 ed.). On December 11, 1991, the single justice granted the defendants\u2019 petition. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We now affirm summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to liability for violations of due process, but reverse the judgment against Michael Fair individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The material facts of this case are undisputed. Between July, 1983, and July, 1985, the inmates were subjected to a total of ten disciplinary proceedings at the jail, which they claim were conducted in violation of their due process rights. The inmates did not receive advance written notice of the hearings. In none of the proceedings was the inmate given a copy of the decision of the disciplinary board (board). Instead, the inmates were allowed to read it, but not to take a copy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In all ten proceedings, the board imposed disciplinary isolation, but in only one case was an inmate (Moore) actually confined to an \u201cisolation cell.\u201d Under the regulations, when the board imposed isolation as a disciplinary sanction, the inmate could be locked up in his own cell, placed in a special isolation unit within the jail known as the \u201ccounty lockup,\u201d or sent to an isolation cell known as the \u201cHole.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs assert that they spent twenty-three hours a day in isolation as a result of disciplinary sanctions. As to qualitative differences between an isolation cell and lockup, in an isolation cell the inmate is left with only his underwear and a Bible whereas in the lockup situations only the inmate\u2019s television is removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">During the period at issue, the jail\u2019s written regulations failed to provide an inmate with either twenty-four hours advance notice of a disciplinary proceeding or a written copy of the board\u2019s findings and decision. The regulations of the Department of Correction (department), issued by the Commissioner, provided, inter alla, that an inmate \u201cbe informed of the violation he is charged with by copy of the [incident] report,\u201d and \u201cbe advised in writing of the decision\u201d which shall include \u201ca description of the evidence relied upon by the board . . . and a statement of the reasons for the sanction(s) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>imposed.\u201d 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 943.03 (1) and (6) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">During this same period, the department conducted inspections of the jail twice each year as required by G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 IB (1990 ed.). In each report, the inspection team certified that Worcester County\u2019s disciplinary procedures were in compliance with the Commissioner\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Addressing the defendants\u2019 appeal, we note first that \u201c[a]n order granting or denying summary judgment will be upheld if the trial judge ruled on undisputed material facts and his ruling was correct as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 536 (1992). Because the parties to this case do not contest any material facts, we review the trial judge\u2019s decision to determine whether the plaintiffs were entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">1. <em>Due process. </em>The judge concluded that <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539 (1974), and its progeny require certain procedural safeguards when disciplinary isolation is imposed. Because these safeguards were not followed in the ten disciplinary proceedings involving O\u2019Malley and Moore, the judge found a violation of their constitutional right to due process. This conclusion, we hold, was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In Massachusetts, as in every other State, prison inmates are protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Wolff, supra </em>at 556, and cases cited. \u201cThere is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution and the prisons of this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555-556. Prisoners, therefore, \u201cmay not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The procedural protections of due process apply, however, only if there is an existing liberty or property interest at stake. <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 571 (1972). The plaintiffs argue that they have a valid liberty interest in avoiding disciplinary isolation. To determine if this constitutes a protected entitlement, we look first to Federal due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>process and then to State law. <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 466 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c[a]s long as the conditions or degree of confinement to which the prisoner is subjected is within the sentence imposed upon him and is not otherwise violative of the Constitution, the Due Process Clause does not in itself subject an inmate\u2019s treatment by prison authorities to judicial oversight.\u201d <em>Montanye </em>v. <em>Haymes, </em>427 U.S. 236, 242 (1976). Thus, the <em>Montanye </em>Court found that the transfer of inmates between State prisons did not implicate a liberty interest inherent in the due process clause. <em>Id. </em>See also <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 226-227 (1976). Similarly, we have recognized that administrative segregation does not involve a federally protected liberty interest because it \u201cis the sort of confinement that inmates should reasonably anticipate receiving at some point in their incarceration.\u201d <em>Real </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>390 Mass. 399, 407 (1983), vacated sub nom. <em>Ponte </em>v. <em>Real, </em>471 U.S. 491, <em>S.C., </em>396 Mass. 1001 (1985), quoting <em>Hewitt, supra </em>at 468. The United States Supreme Court has also rejected \u201cthe notion that <em>any </em>grievous loss visited upon a person by the State is sufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause,\u201d because that \u201cwould subject to judicial review a wide spectrum of discretionary actions that traditionally have been the business of prison administrators rather than of the federal courts\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Parenti </em>v. <em>Ponte, </em>727 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1984), quoting <em>Meachum, supra </em>at 224-225. Given these precedents, we discern no Federal liberty interest regarding disciplinary isolation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>A State may also create a protected liberty interest by placing \u201csubstantive limitations on official discretion.\u201d <em>Olim </em>v. <em>Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 249 (1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To find these substantive limitations we look to the language of the statute that governs the conduct at issue. <em>Kentucky Dep\u2019t of Corrections </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 461 (1989). We have acknowledged that Massachusetts regulations containing \u201cexplicitly mandatory language in connection with requiring specific substantive predicates\u201d can create protected liberty interests. <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>390 Mass. 409, 417 (1983), quoting <em>Hewitt, supra </em>at 472. The regulations of the department state explicitly that \u201c[a]n inmate may be placed in isolation only pursuant to a sanction imposed by a disciplinary board\u201d and only after the inmate\u2019s appeal has been decided or waived. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.20 (1978). Additionally, those sections of the regulations pertaining to county correctional facilities provide that \u201c[n]o inmate shall be placed in disciplinary isolation to [sic] compliance with the procedures set forth in 103 CMR 943.03.\u201d 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 943.05 (1) (1979). The procedures in \u00a7 943.03 require, inter alla, that prison authorities provide inmates with notice of charges, an opportunity to be heard at a hearing before a disciplinary board, a conditional opportunity to present evidence, and review of a written decision including reasons for any sanctions imposed, as well as a right of appeal. The language is mandatory, not permissive. Thus, these regulations make clear that isolation may not be imposed arbitrarily or at the unbridled discretion of prison officials.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We hold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>therefore, that these regulations bestow on inmates a protected liberty interest in avoiding disciplinary isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Once a liberty interest has been established, a court must next determine what procedural safeguards are necessary to satisfy the requirements of due process. <em>Thompson, supra </em>at 460. Under <em>Wolff, </em>a prisoner facing a disciplinary proceeding that may result in the loss of a liberty interest must receive: \u201c(1) advance written notice of the disciplinary ch\u00e1rges; (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and to present evidence in his defense; (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst. at Walpole </em>v. <em>Hill, 472 </em>U.S. 445, 454 (1985), citing <em>Wolff, supra </em>at 563-567. The defendants argue that, even if inmates do have a protected liberty interest in avoiding disciplinary isolation, that interest does not require the protections detailed in <em>Wolff </em>which are necessary only in cases involving forfeiture of \u201cgood time credits.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They maintain that a flexible balancing approach, such as applied in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976), is the more appropriate standard for disciplinary isolation cases.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Applying the <em>Mathews </em>balancing test, the <em>Hewitt </em>Court held that, in the case of administrative segregation of inmates, due process is satisfied by \u201can informal, nonadversary review of the information supporting [the inmate\u2019s] administrative confinement, including whatever statement [the inmate] wished to submit, within a reasonable time after con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>fining him to administrative segregation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472. Indeed we have also upheld administrative segregation procedures in reliance on the <em>Hewitt </em>analysis. <em>Lamoureux, supra </em>at 417. This case, however, involves disciplinary isolation, not administrative segregation. As Justice Marshall noted in <em>Wolff:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201c \u2018solitary\u2019 confinement . . . represents a major change in the conditions of confinement and is normally imposed only when it is claimed and proved that there has been a major act of misconduct. Here, as in the case of good time, there should be minimum procedural safeguards .... We do not suggest, however, that the procedures required by today\u2019s decision for the deprivation of good time would also be required for the imposition of lesser penalties such as the loss of privileges.\u201d <em>Supra. </em>at 571-572 n.19. <em>Supra, </em>at 581 n.l (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">More recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that a prisoner who faces the risk of isolation time is entitled to the procedural protections set forth in <em>Wolff Smith </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>936 F.2d 1390, 1399 (1st Cir. 1991). See <em>Parenti, supra </em>at 25. We find this reasoning to be persuasive. Isolation, regardless of location, entails much more than the simple loss of privileges such as television viewing; it involves a significant loss of freedom, opportunity for exercise or earning good time credits, as well as contact with visitors and others. Distinguishing administrative segregation from disciplinary isolation, the United States Supreme Court recognized that the latter carries with it a \u201cstigma\u201d of misconduct that taints the inmate\u2019s reputation and affronts his dignity. <em>Hewitt, supra </em>at 473. In addition, the department\u2019s regulations themselves prohibit disciplinary isolation except as a \u201c[mjajor\u201d sanction. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.23 (3) (a) (1978). \u201cMinor sanctions\u201d include the loss of privileges or room restrictions. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.23 (1) (1978). See 103 Code Mass. \u00a7 430.10 (1978). We hold, therefore, that, when prison au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>thorities may impose isolation time on an inmate as the result of a disciplinary proceeding, they must follow the procedures outlined in <em>Wolff </em>to satisfy the inmate\u2019s due process rights. In this case the defendants do not dispute that the procedures employed in the ten disciplinary proceedings against the plaintiffs failed to comply with those outlined in <em>Wolff, </em>consequently, the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">2. <em>The Commissioner\u2019s liability. </em>This court has never squarely addressed the issue of the Commissioner\u2019s liability for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988). See <em>Hoffer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>412 Mass. 450, 453 n.5 (1992) (only amount of damages at issue); <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>403 Mass. 764, 766 n.3 (1989) (liability for damages not contested); <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 537 (1983) (equitable relief available). At trial the defendant, Michael Fair, former Commissioner of Correction, moved for summary judgment on the issue of his liability for violations of plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights. The judge denied Fair\u2019s motion and found him liable for damages. Fair now argues that the trial judge\u2019s ruling was in error. He charges, first, that there is no factual basis for his liability, and second, that damages cannot be awarded in this case because the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was not asserted against Fair in his individual, as opposed to his official, capacity. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The judge was correct in concluding that the Commissioner can be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for depriving the plaintiffs of their Federal constitutional rights. <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>575 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1978), citing <em>Inmates of Suffolk County Jail </em>v. <em>Eisenstadt, </em>494 F.2d 1196, 1199 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 977 (1974). See <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Middlesex County, </em>407 Mass. 455, 469-471 (1990). The judge erred, however, in ruling that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>missioner is liable for damages. If a State official is sued in his official capacity, then the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery is limited to equitable relief only. <em>Will </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989). <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 170 (1985).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Monetary damages against State officials are available only if they are sued in their individual or personal capacities for actions under color of State law. <em>Hafer </em>v. <em>Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 23-24 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In this case, nothing in the record indicates that Fair was sued in his individual or personal capacity. The complaint is void of any reference to Fair other than in his official capacity. Moreover, at trial the judge appears to have ruled that Fair was sued in his capacity as Commissioner even though the plaintiffs argued otherwise.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiffs no longer contest that Fair was sued in his official capacity. Rather, they appear to argue in their brief that Fair is personally liable for damages even when sued in his official capacity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This claim, we conclude, is based upon a misreading of the case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">As discussed above, State officials are liable for damages only if they are sued in their individual or personal capacities. Plaintiffs cite to <em>Hafer </em>for the proposition that Fair may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>be held personally liable for damages based on actions taken in his official capacity. Plaintiffs fail to recognize, however, that <em>Hafer </em>also reaffirmed the decision in <em>Will </em>that State officials acting in their official capacities are not \u201cpersons\u201d subject to personal liability under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Supra </em>at 360. Thus, the rule, properly stated, is that State officials may be held personally liable for damages because of actions taken in their official capacities only if they are sued in their individual capacities. <em>Hafer, supra </em>at 362-363 (liability turns on capacity in which State officials are sued, not on capacity in which they acted when injuring plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Regardless of whether Fair was sued in his individual or official capacity, recovery may still be barred by the officials\u2019 qualified immunity. <em>Graham, supra </em>at 166-167. This qualified immunity is based on the defendants\u2019 personal defenses and not those of the government agency. <em>Hafer, supra </em>at 362. To overcome the defendants\u2019 qualified immunity, the plaintiffs must show that the defendants directly participated in violating the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclearly established\u201d rights. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987) (plaintiffs\u2019 rights must be clearly established so that a \u201creasonable official\u201d would understand that his actions violate those rights). <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>423 U.S. 362, 371 (1976) (law requires sufficient association between supervisors and unlawful policy or program for injunctive relief). <em>Kostka </em>v. <em>Hogg, </em>560 F.2d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 1977) (to negate official immunity, plaintiffs must establish bad faith participation in the wrongdoing). The defendant must have acted \u201ceither outside the scope of his respective office, or if within the scope, [he] acted in an arbitrary manner, grossly abusing the lawful powers of his office.\u201d <em>Scheuer </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 235 (1974). See, e.g., <em>Naughton </em>v. <em>Bevilacqua, </em>605 F.2d 586, 589 n.5 (1st Cir. 1979) (plaintiffs unable to recover damages against director of medical institution under \u00a7 1983 because they failed to allege his personal involvement).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We hold that, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not defeat the Commissioner\u2019s qualified immunity. First, the plaintiffs failed to show that the Commissioner had any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>personal involvement in the constitutional violation. He was neither a member of the disciplinary board nor part of the inmates\u2019 appeal process. Second, the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the Commissioner intentionally failed to fulfil his statutory duties. To the contrary, the record reveals that he established minimum rules and standards in compliance with statutory regulations and conducted inspections of the jail to ensure its compliance with minimum standards. See G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(d) </em>and <em>{q) </em>(1990 ed.); G. L. c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 1A and IB (1990 ed.). Although the Commissioner did not inspect the facility personally, his agents, pursuant to regulations, reported to him that Worcester\u2019s disciplinary procedures satis-' fled the department\u2019s minimum standards. Thus, there is nothing in the record before us which shows Fair had personal knowlege that authorities at the jail had denied the plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights. Moreover, he had no duty to investigate further. Cf. <em>King v. </em>Higgins, 702 F.2d 18, 20-21 (1st Cir. 1983) (prison superintendent who, after receiving disciplinary board reports, failed to investigate possible constitutional violations is liable for damages under \u00a7 1983 because, as the official designated to hear prisoners\u2019 appeals, he had a further duty to investigate merits of plaintiff\u2019s appeal); <em>Hafer, supra </em>at 360-361 (newly elected Auditor General who personally dismissed her employees because they allegedly secured their jobs by bribery may be liable for damages under \u00a7 1983). We conclude, therefore, that there is no factual predicate shown here that supports the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages against the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that, where a plaintiff seeks <em>equitable relief, </em>failure to fulfil a statutory mandate renders the Commissioner of Correction a proper party defendant, and a court may order the Commissioner to maintain constitutional standards. <em>DiMarzo, supra </em>at 17. Extrapolating from this decision, the plaintiffs argue that, since the Commissioner had a statutory duty to promulgate minimum standards for county correctional facilities, the failure of those standards to pass constitutional muster also renders the Commissioner personally lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ble for <em>damages.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We disagree. As discussed above, different rules apply when damages are sought. A plaintiff must first sue the State official in his individual capacity and then overcome any qualified immunity defense. Here, not only does the Commissioner\u2019s conduct fall far short of active participation, but it is precisely the type of conduct, performance of official duties, for which qualified immunity exists. If State officials were held personally liable for <em>damages </em>every time regulations that they issued or enforced pursuant to statute were found to violate the Federal Constitution, only the most fearless among them would dare to fulfil their duties. Hence, we conclude on the facts before us that the Commissioner is not personally liable to the plaintiffs for damages.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">For these reasons, we affirm summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to liability for due process violations, but reverse the judgment as to Michael Fair\u2019s liability for damages.

On the other hand, State officials sued for damages in their official capacity are not \u201cpersons\u201d under \u00a7 1983 because the law treats the action as against the official\u2019s office and hence against the State. <em>Hafer </em>v. <em>Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991), citing <em>Will, supra </em>at 71. Therefore, to avoid a State\u2019s sovereign immunity to a damages suit, a plaintiff must sue the State official in his individual and not his official capacity. <em>Hafer, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The trial judge ruled that \u201cthe course of the litigation indicates that plaintiffs seek to impose liability on Fair for actions he took which were in the name of and for the Commonwealth in his capacity as Commissioner of Corrections,\u201d citing <em>Graham, supra </em>at 167.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The trial judge found that \u201cFair, as Commissioner of Corrections, is a proper defendant in this case and he may be liable for damages to plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The department\u2019s regulations provide for twenty-four hour notice before a disciplinary hearing as required by <em>Wolff, supra </em>at 564, but fail to require that the inmate be given a written record of the Board\u2019s decision. 103 Code Mass. Regs. 943.03 (3) and (6) (1979). As written, the County Facility Regulations, 103 Code Mass. Regs. 430.00 et seq.

Unless the plaintiffs\u2019 protected liberty rights were \u201cclearly established\u201d so that the Commissioner would have understood that his conduct violated those rights, he cannot be held liable. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640-641 (1987) (Fourth Amendment context). However, since we conclude that the Commissioner was not directly involved, we do not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
