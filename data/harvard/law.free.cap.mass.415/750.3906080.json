After citing in \u00a7 I the importance of reducing \u201cthe easy access of tobacco products to youths,\u201d the regulation in \u00a7 IV E prohibits cigarette vending machines except at \u201c[pjrivate [cjlubs and [bjars licensed by the City of Marlborough to sell or serve alcoholic beverages\u201d or at \u201c[a] factory, business office, or other place not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>open to the general public where persons under 18 years of age are not permitted access.\u201d In addition, \u00a7 IV E(c) mandates installation on all cigarette vending machines of \u201clockout\u201d devices. According to \u00a7 11(d), a lock-out device \u201cenables an establishment\u2019s . . . employee to directly control the sale of items through tobacco vending machines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The plaintiff Kenneth Patton operates a gasoline station under the name of Lakeside Exxon (Lakeside). Lakeside has a licensed cigarette vending machine on its premises. The machine is owned and operated by the plaintiff Melo-Tone Vending, Inc. (Mela-Tone). The regulation prohibits the operation of the machine at the gasoline station. The board denied a request for a variance to permit the operation of the machine with a lock-out device.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The plaintiffs brought this action in the Superior Court to obtain a declaration that the regulation is invalid because it conflicts with G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 2 (1992 ed.), the Commonwealth\u2019s licensing statute for cigarette vending machines, and the Federal and State Constitutions. The plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the city from limiting the operation of cigarette vending machines to certain locations. A judge denied the request for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, second par. (1992 ed.). We transferred the case to this court on our own initiative. We conclude that the regulation is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the regulation conflicts with the Commonwealth\u2019s licensing scheme provided in G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 2, and that the Legislature has preempted the field of cigarette vending machine regulation. Also, implicitly, at least, the plaintiffs raise a procedural due process challenge to the regulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are essentially the same as those we have rejected today in <em>Take Five Vending, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Provincetown, ante </em>741 (1993). Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>though that case involved a by-law that prohibits all sales of cigarettes by vending machine, rather than a regulation, as here, that limits access to such machines at certain locations, the conclusions we reached in <em>Take Five Vending, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Provincetown, supra, </em>are dispositive of the issues raised in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The plaintiffs do not argue to us that the regulation denies them equal protection under the law, although they made that assertion in their complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
