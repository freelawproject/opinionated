The basis of the action was that the bank had taken a second mortgage from Coraccio\u2019s husband, Stephen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>on property owned by the Coraccios as tenants by the entirety. Coraccio\u2019s complaint contained common law claims for negligence and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She also claimed that the bank violated G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 1 (1990 ed.), which equalizes the rights of husbands and wives in property held by the entirety, and G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (1990 ed.). Finally, Coraccio sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1 (1990 ed.), concerning the validity and legal effect of the second mortgage and the meaning of a provision of c. 209, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The bank moved to dismiss Coraccio\u2019s complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1) and (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), arguing that Coraccio lacked standing to assert any claims arising out of the second mortgage because she was not a party to it, and that her complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. A judge in the Superior Court granted the bank\u2019s motion to dismiss as to all counts, without specifying the grounds therefor. Coraccio filed a timely appeal in the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our own initiative. We now affirm that part of the judgment dismissing Coraccio\u2019s common law and statutory claims for damages, and we modify the judgment to declare that c. 209, \u00a7 1, does not prohibit one spouse from encumbering his or her interest in entireties property.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>In reviewing a motion to dismiss, we accept facts contained in the complaint, and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom,- as true. <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977). A court may grant the radical relief of dismissal only if the plaintiff can set forth no set of facts which would entitle her to relief. <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>390 Mass. 604, 615 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On June 29, 1984, Coraccio purchased property in Chelmsford.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To secure a loan from the bank, and at the bank\u2019s insistence, Coraccio conveyed the property to herself and her husband as tenants by the entirety, and Coraccio and her husband then granted a first mortgage on the property to the bank. On January 29, 1987, the bank loaned $10,000 to Coraccio\u2019s husband alone. To secure this loan, the bank demanded and received a second mortgage on the property from Coraccio\u2019s husband alone. Coraccio neither assented to nor had notice of this transaction. This second mortgage was later discharged. On July 21, 1988, the bank loaned $65,000 to Stephen Coraccio, and again requested and received a second mortgage on the property from him alone. Coraccio did not know of or assent to the granting of the second mortgage. Coraccio\u2019s husband apparently defaulted on this mortgage, and the bank began foreclosure proceedings against him on January 4, 1989. Coraccio learned of the foreclosure (and the existence of the second mortgage) only after reading the foreclosure notice in the newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">We first address Coraccio\u2019s request for declaratory relief. Because Coraccio\u2019s action for declaratory relief was properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>brought,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the motion judge should have made a declaration of the rights of the parties, vis \u00e1 vis the second mortgage rather than dismissing all of Coraccio\u2019s counts. See <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>374 Mass. 574, 577 (1978). Coraccio is entitled to a declaration whether, under G. L. 209, \u00a7 1, a mortgage of property held by the entirety, granted by one spouse without the other\u2019s knowledge, can be a valid encumbrance. We declare that nothing in the statute prevents one spouse, acting alone, from encumbering his or her interest in property held by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The concept of a tenancy by the entirety is one of ancient common law origin; it has been described as a form of concurrent ownership that may exist only between coowners who are husband and wife. In <em>Raptes </em>v. <em>Pappas, </em>259 Mass. 37, 38 (1927), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cAt common law in such a tenancy the husband and wife are seised of the estate so granted as one person, and hot as ordinary joint tenants or tenants in common, and an incident of such an estate is that the survivor of the marriage is entitled to the whole, a right which one cannot destroy without the assent of the other. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>158 Mass. 11 [1893]. \u2018By that law the right to control the possession of such an estate during their joint lives is in the husband, as it is when the wife is sole seised. \u201cNeither could convey during their joint lives so as to bind the other, or defeat the right of the survivor to the whole estate\u201d, . . . but, subject to this limitation, the husband has the rights in it which are incident to his own property, and the right which by the common law he acquires in the real property of his wife. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>He has, during coverture, the usufruct of all the real estate which his wife has in fee simple, fee tail, or for life.\u2019 <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>141 Mass. 219, 223, 224 [1886]. Statutes relating to the separate rights of married women have not changed the common law rights of the husband in such estates. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>108 Mass. 254 [1871]. <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Stebbins, supra. Boland </em>v. <em>McKowen, </em>189 Mass. 563 [1905]. <em>Voigt </em>v. <em>Voigt, </em>252 Mass. 582 [1925].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Later, in <em>Licker </em>v. <em>Gluskin, </em>265 Mass. 403 (1929), we repeated the view that, while the husband, but not the wife, could alienate an interest in the property such an alienation could not defeat the right of the survivor spouse. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cBoth husband and wife are seised of such an estate <em>per tout et non per my </em>as one person, and not as joint tenants or tenants in common. Alienation by either the husband or the wife will not defeat the right of the survivor to the entire estate on the death of the other. There can be no severance of such estate by the act of either alone without the assent of the other, and no partition during their joint lives, and the survivor becomes seised as sole owner of the whole estate regardless of anything the other may have done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Additionally, at common law, the husband in a tenancy by the entirety was entitled to exclusive possession and control of the property. <em>Pineo </em>v. <em>White, </em>320 Mass. 487, 490-491 (1946). The wife\u2019s interest in the tenancy consisted exclusively of her right of survivorship. See <em>West </em>v. <em>First Agric. Bank, </em>382 Mass. 534, 536 &amp; n.4 (1981). If her husband predeceased her, the wife became the sole owner with all the rights of ownership. This right of survivorship in a tenancy by the entirety was indestructible. <em>Id. </em>Although an individual creditor of the husband could levy and sell on execution his interest in the tenancy, and dispossess both the husband and wife, the property always remained subject to the wife\u2019s survivorship right, and if the husband died before the wife, the creditor lost all of his interest. See <em>Raptes </em>v. <em>Pappas, </em>259 Mass. 37, 38-39 (1927). The wife\u2019s right of survivorship was not attachable by her individual creditors nor alienable by her. <em>Licker, supra </em>at 406-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The Legislature altered this common law regimen for tenancies by the entirety created after February 11, 1980.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> St. 1979, c. 727. In an attempt to equalize the rights of men and women holding property as tenants by the entirety, the Legislature adopted G. L. 209, \u00a7 1, which provides, in relevant part: \u201cA husband and wife shall be equally entitled to the rents, products, income or profits and to the control, management and possession of property held by them as tenants by the entirety.\u201d Additionally, the second paragraph of \u00a7 1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cThe interest of a debtor spouse in property held as tenants by the entirety shall not be subject to seizure or execution by a creditor of such debtor spouse so long as such property is the principal residence of the nondebtor spouse; provided, however, both spouses shall be liable jointly or severally for debts incurred on account of necessaries furnished to either spouse or to a member of their family.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The legislation granted women an equal right to enjoy the incidents of a tenancy by the entirety.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It also clearly precludes the seizure of the principal residence of the spouses, except as provided therein. Thus, the rule stated in <em>Raptes, supra </em>at 38-39, allowing a writ of entry for possession, albeit not title, was modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The statute did not, however, alter the characteristics of the estate itself. Merely because each spouse is \u201cequally entitled to the rents, products, income or profits and to the control, management and possession of property held by them as tenants by the entirety,\u201d it does not follow that each has an equal one-half interest in the property. On the contrary, a tenancy by the entirety remains a unitary title, and the statute simply guarantees each spouse an equal right to the whole. Whatever the husband could do at common law, the wife now may do as well. Each spouse continues to have an indestructible right of survivorship, and the estate remains inseverable and not subject to voluntary partition. See <em>In re Abdallah, </em>39 B.R. 384, 387 (D. Mass.), remanded, <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Abdallah, </em>46 B.R. 718 (D. Mass. 1984), appeal dismissed, 778 F.2d 75 (1st. Cir. 1985), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Abdallah, </em>476 U.S. 1116 (1986). See also G. L. c. 241, \u00a7 1 (1990 ed.) (prohibiting voluntary partition for tenancies by the entirety). Nor, by virtue of G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 1, may a creditor of either seize the principal residence absent the joint signature of the spouses. One spouse, acting alone, cannot convey or encumber the <em>entire </em>estate, because any conveyance or encumbrance remains subject to the other\u2019s survivorship right. See <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Abdallah, </em>46 B.R. 718, 719 (D. Mass. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Nonetheless, either spouse may convey or encumber his or her interest in property held as tenants by the entirety. This comports with the sounder view expressed by our sister States. Although, as Coraccio points out, some States have held that the consent of both spouses is necessary for a valid mortgage to be granted, see <em>Central Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Fitzwil-liam, </em>12 Ohio St. 3d 51 (1984); <em>Bellows Falls Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>148 Vt. 633 (1987), for the most part, these States have statutes which expressly require such consent. See, e.g., <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Wilmington Trust Co., </em>449 A.2d 1055 (Del. Ch. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In light of the language of c. 209, \u00a7 1, and the common law incidents of tenancy by the entirety, the view expressed by the New York Court of Appeals in <em>V.R.W., Inc. </em>v. Klein, 68 N.Y.2d 560, 565 (1986), sets forth the appropriate rule: \u201c[T]here is nothing in [our State\u2019s] law that prevents one of the co-owners [of property held by the entirety] from mortgaging or making an effective conveyance of his of her own interest in the tenancy. To the contrary, each tenant may sell, mortgage or otherwise encumber his or her rights in the property, subject to the continuing rights of the other.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We declare that G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 1, does not require the consent of both spouses before a mortgage may encumber the property, and that the bank, if it foreclosed, could acquire Stephen Coraccio\u2019s interest in the property, namely a right wholly defeasible should the plaintiff, the nondebtor spouse, survive him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Despite our declaration that the mortgage may be a valid encumbrance on the property, we must consider whether Coraccio\u2019s other claims were properly dismissed. Because we hold that Stephen Coraccio had a legal right to grant a mortgage on his interest in the property, it follows, a fortiori, that the bank had a legal right to take the mortgage from him, unless it owed Nancy Coraccio some special duty. Coraccio argues that the bank did owe her a special duty by virtue of c. 209, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and due to the relationship created between Coraccio and the bank by the first mortgage. A first mortgage, in itself, imposes no duty not to accept a second mortgage. The bank was not negligent toward Coraccio merely by granting a second mortgage to Coraccio\u2019s husband. Corac-cio\u2019s negligence count was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Coraccio claims that by further encumbering property on which it held a first mortgage, the bank breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that arose from the first mortgage. This covenant, implicit in all contracts, prohibits parties from doing \u201canything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.\u201d <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., </em>373 Mass. 96, 104 (1977). Coraccio claims that one of the fruits of her contract with the bank was an implicit agreement that the bank would not further encumber the property, and that it would keep her informed of any action by it which could negatively affect the property. She cites no cases to support these assertions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>without merit. The Superior Court judge properly dismissed this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Finally, the Superior Court judge dismissed Coraccio\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. This claims stands or falls with the propriety of the bank\u2019s taking of the second mortgage from Stephen Coraccio. Based on our discussion above, Coraccio clearly failed to allege a set of facts which would constitute a violation by the bank of c. 93A, and the Superior Court judge properly dismissed this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We order that the judgment dismissing Coraccio\u2019s complaint be modified to declare that G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 1, does not prohibit a spouse from encumbering his or her interest in property held by the entirety, without the other spouse\u2019s consent, but that the bank, in the alleged foreclosure proceeding pending in the Land Court (if it be still pending) cannot acquire possession or title over the property if the facts alleged are established. As so modified, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Coraccio\u2019s complaint also alleges that the bank intentionally interfered with a privileged relationship between her and her husband and that the bank\u2019s attorney, James A. Hall, was negligent in processing the loan. Coraccio did not appeal from the dismissal of the count against the attorney and he is not a party to the appeal. Other than to mention the intentional interference count in a list of the complaint\u2019s allegations, Coraccio does not discuss these counts or offer any argument as to why they should not have been dismissed. We therefore treat them as waived. See <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. 185, 194 (1990); Mass. R. Civ. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In addition, in her appellate brief, Coraccio states that her \u201ccomplaint is also analogous to the tort of disparagement.\u201d To the extent this statement attempts to set forth an additional cause of action, Coraccio cannot raise it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Coraccio\u2019s complaint does not describe the property other than to list its street address. This address is identical to the address given as Coraccio\u2019s residence in the complaint. The defendant, however, concedes in its brief that the second mortgage \u201con Stephen Coraccio\u2019s interest as a tenant by the entirety, does not affect Plaintiff\u2019s right to continued possession of <em>her home </em>or her right to survivorship\u201d (emphasis supplied). We take this as a concession that the property is the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cprincipal residence\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 1, quoted <em>infra </em>at 150.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We believe that Coraccio\u2019s request for declaratory relief was \u201cproperly brought,\u201d therefore entitling her to a declaration of her rights, see <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>373 Mass. 819, 829 (1977), because by arguing that property in which she held an undivided one-half interest had been encumbered improperly, she set forth an \u201cactual controversy\u201d involving a dispute about the legal status of her ownership interest. See G. L. 231 A, \u00a7 1 (1990 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\">We later held that where the spouses are divorced the estate is converted into a tenancy in common. See <em>Bernatavicius </em>v. <em>Bernatavicius, </em>259 Mass. 486 (1927). There is no allegation that the spouses are divorced, nor is there anything in the record to indicate a divorce has occurred. While there is an allegation that Stephen Coraccio reconveyed the property to his wife <em>after </em>the giving of the record mortgage to secure his debt, there is nothing of record to show the terms or circumstances of this reconveyance. Additionally, the parties make no argument as to what effect, if any, this reconveyance may have on the bank\u2019s interest. Thus, we do not reach this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Yet, in <em>Licker </em>v. <em>Gluskin, </em>265 Mass. 403 (1929), the court stated that a wife, unlike the husband, could not convey even such a limited interest in a tenancy by the entirety because \u201cits nature is such that the principle . . . does not govern the power of the wife touching her interest therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">All of the transactions relevant to this case occurred after this date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Unlike Massachusetts, many jurisdictions held, at a much earlier date, that the \u201cMarried Women\u2019s Property Acts\u201d equalized the rights of husbands and wives in property held by the entirety. <em>West </em>v. <em>First Agric. Bank, </em>382 Mass. 534, 542 n.14 (1981). <em>West </em>provides an excellent review of the common law principles involved in tenancies by the entirety and of potential constitutional challenges to those principles subsequent to the Commonwealth\u2019s adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment. See art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We note that the State of New York had long before recognized that spouses share equal rights to property held by- the entirety, on the basis of that State\u2019s Married Women\u2019s Act of 1849. See <em>V.R.W., Inc. </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>68 N.Y.2d 560, 564 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The parties indicate that foreclosure proceedings are pending in the Land Court. The second paragraph of G. L. 209, \u00a71, would prohibit the bank from executing on any interest it acquired in the property. Cf. <em>Peebles </em>v. <em>Minnis, </em>402 Mass. 282 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">We express no view on the rights of the spouses or of the creditors of either as to property held by spouses as tenants by the entirety where the property is not the principal residence of the spouses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\">It appears that Coraccio\u2019s argument that the bank was negligent in taking the second mortgage from her husband is supported only by her assertion that the bank violated c. 209, \u00a7 1, in taking the mortgage, and that \u201cviolation of a statute is evidence of negligence and with evidence of negligence, dismissal cannot be had.\u201d Our conclusion that the statute was not violated disposes of this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Coraccio does cite a New York case, <em>Lavington </em>v. <em>Edgell, </em>127 A.D.2d 155 (N.Y. 1987), in which a former wife was held to have breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in a separation agreement when she secretly purchased property that, according to the terms of the agreement, was supposed to be available for her former husband to purchase jointly with her. This case is inapposite because one party denied the other \u201cthe fruits of his contract,\u201d i.e., the right to purchase contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>in the agreement, and thus does not support Coraccio\u2019s assertion that implicit in a first mortgage is a duty not to accept a second mortgage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
