L. c. 195, \u00a7 16 (1990 ed.), has the legal authority to maintain or compromise a wrongful death action under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2 (1990 ed.). We summarize the relevant facts established by statements, affidavits, and other materials in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">On August 26, 1988, Kenneth S. Hickey (decedent) died in the course of a surgical operation performed by Dr. Richard E. Wilson at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. On March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>6, 1991, a judge in the Probate and Family Court for Mid-dlesex County appointed the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse, Julie Hickey Marco (Marco), administratrix with the will annexed of the decedent\u2019s estate. On August 27, 1991, Marco filed a wrongful death claim in the Superior Court against the estate of Dr. Wilson, who had died in March, 1989, and against Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. In her complaint, Marco alleged that Dr. Wilson negligently caused the decedent\u2019s death by allowing a long clamp to crush the tissue to which it was attached. Marco further alleged that the clamp fell off, thereby causing massive arterial bleeding which resulted in the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">On November 15, 1991, the defendants moved to dismiss Marco\u2019s complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The defendants presented the following uncontroverted facts in support of their motion: On September 27, 1988, Kathleen Hickey (Hickey), the decedent\u2019s daughter from a prior marriage, undertook to act as voluntary administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate. On July 28, 1989, Hickey filed, in the Probate and Family Court for Norfolk County, a notice of claim against Dr. Wilson\u2019s estate for damages arising from the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With the assistance of her attorney, Hickey subsequently negotiated a $375,000 settlement with Dr. Wilson\u2019s malpractice insurer, in consideration of which Hickey signed a general release purporting to discharge the defendants of all liability arising from the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This release,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendants ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>gued, was binding on Marco and barred her wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The motion judge treated the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The judge held that, under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, a wrongful death claim may be brought by the \u201cexecutor or administrator of the deceased.\u201d The judge noted that the statutes of the Commonwealth establish various categories of executors and administrators.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The use of a general term in G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, the judge reasoned, indicates that no distinction should be made between such categories and that a voluntary administratrix may maintain or compromise a wrongful death claim. Moreover, the judge held, G. L. c. 195, \u00a7 16, provides independent statutory support for such conclusion because \u00a7 16 authorizes a voluntary administratrix to \u201creceive payments and discharge debts\u201d and to \u201cnegotiate or assign any chose in action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The judge found that Hickey fully complied with the requirements of \u00a7 16,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and in light of his rulings of law, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>concluded that Hickey released the defendants of all liability arising from the decedent\u2019s death. Accordingly, the judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motions and entered summary judgment in their favor. Marco now appeals, arguing that the judge\u2019s legal conclusions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">General Laws c. 229, \u00a7 2, governs actions for recovery of damages arising from wrongful death. In <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>362 Mass. 60 (1972), this court explained that \u00a7 2 establishes procedures for the recovery of damages the substantive right to which is anchored in the common law. <em>Id. </em>at 71. See <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Indem. Co., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 555, 559 (1992). One such procedure is the requirement that the \u201cexecutor or administrator of the deceased,\u201d rather than any beneficiary of the estate as such, act as the plaintiff in a wrongful death action brought on behalf of the designated categories of beneficiaries. G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. See <em>Gaudette, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">These words unquestionably encompass administrators appointed pursuant to G. L. c. 193, \u00a7 1 (1990 ed.), and executors appointed pursuant to G. L. c. 192, \u00a7 4 (1990 ed.). See <em>Koutoudakis </em>v. <em>Great Am. Co., </em>285 Mass. 466, 467 (1934), and cases cited.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A public administrator also may maintain or compromise a wrongful death claim on behalf of the estate which he or she represents. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>309 Mass. 424, 427 (1941). Such authority flows from the statutory provision stating that a public administrator \u201cshall, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>cept as otherwise provided in this chapter, administer estates and render accounts in the same manner as other administrators.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 194, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The Legislature, however, has established limitations on the power of other administrators or executors to bring legal actions. The Legislature, for instance, has authorized a \u201cspecial administrator\u201d to bring only such actions as are necessary \u201cto collect all the personal property of the deceased and preserve the same for the executor or administrator when appointed.\u201d G. L. c. 193, \u00a7 11 (1990 ed.). See G. L. c. 192, \u00a7 14 (1990 ed.) (similarly limiting ability of temporary executor to bring legal action). Also, the Legislature clearly intended to deprive an \u201cexecutor in his own wrong,\u201d defined as one who \u201cinjuriously intermeddles with any personal property of a deceased person, without being thereto authorized by law,\u201d of the power to bring any legal action whatsoever. G. L. c. 195, \u00a7 14.'</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We strive to construe related statutes harmoniously so as to give rise to a consistent body of law. See <em>Boswell </em>v. <em>Zephyr Lines, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 241, 247 (1993). In light of the express statutory limitations on the authority of certain administrators and executors to maintain or compromise a cause of action, we hold that the motion judge erred when he concluded that G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, does not distinguish between the various categories of executors and administrators. We conclude that such executors or administrators do not come within the ambit of \u00a7 2 where another statute deprives them of the power to sue. Accordingly, we turn to the issue whether G. L. c. 195, \u00a7 16, so limits the powers of a voluntary administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Section 16 delineates the circumstances in which a designated person voluntarily may undertake, without appointment by a court, to administer an estate consisting entirely of personal property not exceeding $15,000 in value.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>16, first par., requires that such person file a statement containing prescribed information as a prerequisite to holding the office of voluntary administrator.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 16, third par., empowers the voluntary administrator to \u201creceive payment of any debt or obligation in the nature of a debt, or delivery of any chattel or asset, scheduled in such statement.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 16, fourth par., authorizes the voluntary administrator to \u201cnegotiate or assign any chose in action to convert the same to cash in a reasonable amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Hickey argues that the motion judge properly concluded that these two clauses authorized her to bring a wrongful death action under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">By its plain terms, \u00a7 16 provides that a voluntary administrator may receive payment of only those debts or obligations <em>scheduled in the statutorily required statement. </em>This language accords with the informal nature of the office held pursuant to \u00a7 16: The status of voluntary administrator may be achieved on fulfilment of essentially administrative for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>malities and without formal court approval. Cf. G. L. c. 192, \u00a7 1 (1990 ed.) (requiring filing of petition for appointment of administrator or executor of estate prior to issuance of letters testamentary or letters of administration). A voluntary administrator is not required to give bond with sufficient sureties to guarantee the proper performance of his or her trust. Cf. G. L. c. 205, \u00a7 1 (1990 ed.) (providing that, among other fiduciaries, an \u201cexecutor, temporary executor or temporary administrator with the will annexed, administrator, [or] administrator with the will annexed\u201d shall give such bond unless exempted pursuant to another section).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In recognition of the relative lack of accountability of a voluntary administrator, the Legislature explicitly has confined the applicability of \u00a7 16 to estates of limited value. The requirement that the voluntary administrator file a statement and administer only those assets and debts so itemized evinces a legislative intent to establish a mechanism whereby the use of \u00a7 16 is confined to its intended scope.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We would negate both the letter and the spirit of \u00a7 16 if we concluded that a voluntary administratrix may compromise a wrongful death claim which is apparently worth at least $375,000 and which was not listed in the requisite statement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>We conclude also that the authority of a voluntary admin-istratrix to \u201cnegotiate or assign [a] chose in action\u201d does not encompass the power to maintain or compromise a wrongful death claim. As the motion judge recognized, a wrongful death claim is not a chose in action. See <em>Koutoudakis, supra </em>at 468.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cThe money recovered upon a wrongful death claim is not a general asset of the probate estate, but constitutes a statutory trust fund, held by the administratrix as trustee for distribution to the statutory beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Gou-lette, </em>344 Mass. 307, 311 (1962). Where the statute is not ambiguous or couched in terms suggesting that we must look beyond its express language, we construe the statute in accordance with its plain meaning. See <em>Pobieglo </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co., </em>402 Mass. 112, 116 (1988). There is no indication that the Legislature intended a voluntary administratrix to compromise a wrongful death claim such as the present one. Accordingly, we decline to infer the power to compromise such a claim from the inapposite language addressing the negotiation or assignment of a chose in action.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In sum, we hold that a voluntary administratrix acting pursuant to \u00a7 16 possesses no authority to bring a wrongful death claim, or to settle one.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The notice of claim denotes Hickey as \u201cadministrator.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\">According to the uncontroverted affidavit of a representative of Dr. Wilson\u2019s malpractice insurer, Mr. Flannigan, Hickey\u2019s attorney, represented that Hickey \u201cwas the Administratrix of the Estate of the decedent [and] had full legal authority to compromise the claim against Richard Wilson, M.D. and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\u201d The affidavit also stated that \u201c[i]t was further represented ... by Attorney Flannigan that his client, Kathleen Hickey, was capable of settling this claim prior to the institution of a lawsuit by executing a Release of All Claims binding upon the decedent\u2019s estate and family.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\">It appears that no notice was given to Marco of either the claim or of the release in settlement. Nor does it appear in the record that any monies received by Hickey were distributed to the beneficiaries. G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The term \u201cadministrator\u201d is used without a qualifier in G. L. c. 193, \u00a7 1 (1990 ed.), which designates the person entitled to administer the estate of a person who dies intestate. This term is used with a qualifier in other statutes such as G. L. c. 193, \u00a7 7 (1990 ed.) (providing for the appointment of an administrator \u201cwith the will annexed\u201d if no executor is named in the will, or if all the executors therein named are dead, incompetent, or deemed neglectful); G. L. c. 193, \u00a7 9 (1990 ed.) (providing, with certain enumerated conditions, for the appointment of an \u201cadministrator de bonis non\u201d if \u201ca sole or surviving executor or administrator dies, resigns or is removed before having fully administered an estate\u201d); G. L. c. 193, \u00a7\u00a7- 10, 11 (providing for appointment of \u201cspecial administrator\u201d to collect and preserve personal properly of deceased); G. L. c. 194, \u00a7 4 (providing for the appointment of a public administrator); G. L. c. 195, \u00a7 16 (establishing procedures for voluntary administration of small estates).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">While these provisions are relevant to our analysis, we do not undertake a comprehensive review of all statutes referring to \u201cexecutors\u201d and \u201cadministrators\u201d and the relationship between such statutes and G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The parties do not dispute this aspect of the judge\u2019s ruling. Rather, they focus their argument on whether a voluntary administratrix who fulfils the requirements of \u00a7 16 is empowered to maintain or compromise a wrongful death claim. We note, however, that Marco presented uncontroverted evidence that she received no share of the settlement proceeds. Hickey\u2019s retention of the settlement proceeds may have violated \u00a7 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>sixth par., which provides that, after certain enumerated expenses are paid, the voluntary administrator must distribute the balance of the \u201cassets which come into his hands\u201d to the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The parties to the present dispute agree that the ability to compromise a wrongful death action flows from the power to maintain it, and that the resolution of the dispute thus revolves on whether a voluntary administratrix acting pursuant to G. L. c. 195, \u00a7 16, comes within the relevant language in G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b751-12\">The power of such an executor devolves by necessary implication on an administrator with the will annexed or on an administrator de bonis non because of the similar nature of the office which they hold.

Carey, 268 Mass. 255, 258 (1929); <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>12 Cush. 559, 569 (1853).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">This language is still found at G.

The statement must be verified by oath or affirmation, and must contain the following information: <em>\u201c(a) </em>the name and residential address of the affiant, <em>(b) </em>the name, residence and date of death of the deceased, (c) the relationship of the affiant to the deceased, <em>(d) </em>a schedule showing every asset of the estate known to the affiant and the estimated value of each such asset, <em>(e) </em>a statement that the affiant has undertaken to act as voluntary administrator of the estate of the deceased and will administer the same according to law, and apply the proceeds thereof in conformity with this section, (/) the names and addresses of surviving joint owners of property with the deceased, known to the affiant, and <em>(g) </em>the names and addresses known to the affiant of the persons who would take under the provisions of section three of chapter one hundred and ninety in the case of intestacy.\u201d G. L. c. 195, \u00a7 16 (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The statement filed by Hickey showed the only assets to be a \u201c1978 Cadillac DeVille\u201d (no value shown) and a bank account ($827.59 value shown). No contention is made that the present wrongful death claim is \u201can asset of the estate\u201d that should have been listed in this statement. See <em>infra </em>at 737.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\">The voluntary administrator must present a duly attested copy of the statement required by \u00a7 16, first par., \u201ctender ... a proper receipt in writing,\u201d and \u201csurrender .. . any policy, passbook, note, certificate or other evidentiary instrument.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\">We do not intend to restrict the ability of a voluntary administratrix to receive payment of a debt inadvertently omitted from the statement filed, so long as the statement is properly amended, and the receipt of such debt does not bring the estate outside of the scope of \u00a7 16, as happened here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Moreover, \u00a7 16 explicitly states that the voluntary administrator is the \u201clegal representative of the deceased\u201d for purposes of the third paragraph of the section and for purposes of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A (6) (1990 ed.) (motor vehicle insurance coverage of legal representative of estate), and G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 2, fourth par. (1990 ed.) (registration of motor vehicles and trailers; transfer of ownership; plates). Had the Legislature intended the voluntary administrator to act as legal representative for other purposes, it would have provided so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">We disagree with the defendants\u2019 argument that such express grant of authority flows from the statutory language providing that the statement required by \u00a7 16 must contain a declaration that the voluntary administrator will administer the estate \u201caccording to law, and apply the proceeds thereof in conformity with this section . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 195, \u00a7 16.
