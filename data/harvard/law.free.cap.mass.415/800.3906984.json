See St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 100, amending G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 65C, effective January 12, 1988, pursuant to an emergency preamble. We conclude that he is not. The case is here on a reser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>vation and report by a single justice of this court on cross motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Judge Connolly was appointed presiding justice of the Second District Court of Eastern Middlesex County in December, 1952. He became an associate justice of the Superior Court in October, 1970. In June, 1976, on attaining the age of seventy, he was retired as required by the Constitution of the Commonwealth. At that time the judge elected the spousal survivor option available under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 65C, as then amended, by which he would receive a reduced pension and his wife, Mary, would receive two-thirds of that lesser amount for life, if she should survive him. His salary at retirement was approximately $36,000, and his annual pension was $19,000 based on his election of the spousal survivor option. Mary Connolly died in 1985. Judge Connolly served as a recall justice from June, 1979, to June, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">When, in 1976, Judge Connolly made his election under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 65 C, that section then provided, as it still does, that a judge\u2019s election must be filed at the time of his retirement or within thirty days thereafter. Section 65C further provided that, as a result of Judge Connolly\u2019s election, the actuarial equivalent of the value of his full pension was made available by providing him with a lesser pension for life with the right in his wife Mary to receive two-thirds of that lesser pension, if she should survive him.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The 1987 amendment to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 65C, added a provision that, if after electing the spousal survivor option on retirement, a judge\u2019s then spouse were to die first, the judge should receive \u201ca full retirement allowance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>increase in a judge\u2019s pension is colloquially described as a \u201cpop-up,\u201d an analogy perhaps to a toaster (but not to the high parabolic flight of a struck baseball). The \u201cpop-up\u201d would not increase the value of any judicial pension because actuarial equivalency would have to be maintained. The result of the amendment is that a judge making the. spousal election receives a somewhat reduced lesser pension (and any surviving spouse of such a judge would receive two-thirds of that reduced lesser pension) in order to reflect the possibility that the judge would be the survivor of the two and would be entitled to the \u201cpop-up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Judge Connolly argues that, although he retired and made his election before the 1987 amendment became effective, he is entitled to the \u201cpop-up.\u201d His principal contention is that he is, within the words of \u00a7 65C, a judge \u201cwho is retired,\u201d and hence he, who elected the surviving spouse option years before, automatically qualifies for the \u201cpop-up.\u201d This-argument fails because the reference to a judge \u201cwho is retired\u201d is not to a judge who is in retirement but rather to a judge at that moment when he or she is retired by operation of the constitutional mandate. Section 65C itself refers to such a judge as one who \u201cwas retired,\u201d not as one who retired. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 65C, fourth par. Other provisions in adjacent sections of G. L. c. 32 that use the word \u201cretired\u201d in reference to a judge make it clear that the reference is to a judge whose retirement was constitutionally forced. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 65A, first and third pars., 65B, first and second pars., 65D (c) (1) and (e) (1990 ed.). See also St. 1973, c. 1211, \u00a7 5. Each of these adjacent sections (\u00a7\u00a7 65A, 65B, 65C, and 65D) appears in St. 1973, c. 1211, \u00a7 3, using the verb retired in a passive form. A word used in one part of a statute in a definite sense should be given the same meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>elsewhere in the statute, barring some plain contrary indication. <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Info. Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236, 240 (1978). Section 65C, as we have said, requires that the pension election be made on retirement or within thirty days thereafter. Section 65C deals thus with judges as they are retired or retire (or, as \u00a7 65C puts it, resign), not with judges who went through the process in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The reduced pension payable to Judge Connolly when he made his election was calculated differently from the pension payable under \u00a7 65C with its new \u201cpop-up.\u201d The absence of any legislative instruction as to what to do about this discrepancy, if the 1987 amendment were to apply to a judge in the position of Judge Connolly, supports the view that the \u201cpop-up\u201d was not intended to be available except to any judge who should be retired or should retire after the effective date of the 1987 amendment or within thirty days prior thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The judge relies on the fact that for two other \u201cpop-up\u201d provisions inserted by the 1987 act (see St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 42, amending G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12 [2] [c], and \u00a7 99, amending G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58B), but not for the \u00a7 65C \u201cpop-up\u201d inserted by \u00a7 100, the Legislature expressly provided in \u00a7 135 of the act that the \u201cpop-up\u201d benefits would be available only pursuant to \u201capplications for such benefits . . . made on or after the effective date of this act.\u201d St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 135.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge asks us to infer from the absence from \u00a7 135 of a reference to \u00a7 100 that his election of the spousal survivor option made at his retirement is sufficient to entitle a judge such as he to the benefits of the \u201cpop-up.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because under \u00a7 65C, both before and after the 1987 act, a judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>election could not be made until retirement and had to be made within thirty days after retirement, no effective \u201capplication\u201d to elect the spousal survivor option could be on file before January 12, 1988, from a judge retiring after that date. On the other hand, there could be such \u201capplications\u201d on file from the other potential \u201cpop-up\u201d recipients referred to in \u00a7 135 of the act, who are required to make their elections at or before the time of retirement. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12 (1) (1990 ed.) (election of spousal survivor option may be made before retirement and changed up until filing of application for retirement); G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58B (1990 ed.) (election of spousal survivor option must be made on or before application for retirement). Without their inclusion in \u00a7 135, it would be unclear whether these latter \u201cpop-ups\u201d applied to eligible recipients who made their \u201capplications\u201d for election before the effective date of the act but retired after that date. Since, as we have noted, retiring judges cannot \u201capply\u201d for election of the spousal survivor option before retirement, there was no need for the act to make special provision for when the \u201cpop-up\u201d would apply to their elections. Because the only way that a retiring judge could make an election that included a \u201cpop-up\u201d was to do so both after the effective date of the act and after his or her retirement, the result that \u00a7 135 directed as to other \u201cpop-ups\u201d was to occur as to judges in any event. There was, therefore, no reason to refer to \u00a7 100 in \u00a7 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Finally, we see no merit to the judge\u2019s argument that, because he was serving on recall when the judicial \u201cpop-up\u201d provision was enacted, he is entitled to the benefit of the \u201cpop-up.\u201d While he was on recall, the judge\u2019s pension was waived (see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 90B [1990 ed.]; G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 14 <em>[c] </em>[1990 ed.]), and he received a salary and benefits equal to those of a Superior Court judge <em>(id.), </em>except with respect to pension rights and obligations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Once he ceased to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>serve on recall, he commenced to receive the pension payments that he would have received if he had not served on recall. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 65G (c) (1990 ed.). There is no suggestion in the relevant statutes that a recall judge automatically obtains new pension options when he ceases to serve on recall.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Our opinion should not be viewed as an endorsement of a pension system that leaves Judge Connolly after a long and distinguished judicial career with a pension ravaged by inflation. Summary judgment should be entered for the defendants declaring that the Honorable Paul K. Connolly is not entitled to the pension benefits provided in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 65C, as amended by St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 100, but that he is entitled to the pension benefits that were available and were elected by him when he was retired by constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\">\u201cThe first sentence of \u00a7 65C now reads as follows (with the words added by the 1987 amendment in italics and those added by St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 359 in brackets): \u201cA chief justice, justice, associate justice, judge, associate judge, or special justice, hereinafter in this section called judge, who is retired or who resigns and who is entitled to a pension or retirement allowance for life under the provisions of section sixty-five A, sixty-five B [,] sixty-five D [,sixty-five F, or sixty-five I] may elect to receive, in lieu thereof, a pension or retirement allowance for life at a lesser annual rate with provision that upon his death, leaving as a survivor a surviving spouse who was his spouse at the time of his retirement or resignation, two-thirds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>of such pension or retirement allowance for life at a lesser, annual rate shall be paid to such surviving spouse; <em>provided, however, that if such surviving spouse dies on or after the date such lesser retirement allowance becomes effective and before the death of such member, such member thereafter shall be paid a full retirement allowance.\" </em>G.
