L. c. 231A (1990 ed.) that the Commonwealth has failed to fulfil its duty to provide them an education as mandated by the Constitution. The plaintiffs claim that the State\u2019s school-financing system effectively denies them the opportunity to receive an adequate education in the public schools in their communities. This denial of the opportunity for an adequate education, the plaintiffs claim, violates both Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, and arts. 1 and 10 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Initially, suit was commenced in May, 1978, under the caption Webby <em>vs. </em>Dukakis, by the filing of a complaint and a motion for class certification in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk. Shortly thereafter, the Legislature enacted \u201cSchool Funds and State Aid for Public Schools,\u201d St. 1978, c. 367 \u00a7 70C (codified at G. L. c. 70). Following that legislative enactment, the case was inactive for five years, until 1983, when the parties initiated discovery. In July, 1985, a single justice of this court referred the case to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>master with orders to hear the evidence and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, that same month the Legislature enacted \u201cAn Act improving the public schools of the Commonwealth,\u201d see St. 1985, c. 188, \u00a7 12 (codified at G. L. c. 70A), and proceedings in the case were again suspended. Five years later, in 1990, the plaintiffs filed a \u201crestated complaint\u201d (presently before us) and a renewed motion for class certification. In October, 1991, the parties filed a stipulation of agreed facts, and, in November, 1992, they filed a supplemental stipulation of agreed facts along with a joint appendix to the stipulations consisting of six volumes of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In 1989, a separate suit, captioned Levy <em>vs. </em>Dukakis, was filed in the Superior Court Department in Worcester County. The first seven counts of the complaint in the Levy case consist of claims by nine young people who live in and attend public schools in Worcester, Carver, Revere, and Rockland, against various State education officials and institutions challenging the constitutionality of the State\u2019s school-financing system.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In May, 1990, the single justice in the present case, McDuffy <em>vs. </em>Robertson, issued an order transferring the first seven counts of the Levy complaint from the Worcester Superior Court to the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County \u201cfor disposition.\u201d G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In December, 1992, a single justice reserved and reported both the McDuffy case and the Levy case without decision to the full court on the stipulated record. The parties filed briefs in this court and the court heard oral argument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the entire school-financing scheme in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs fail, however, to specify either in their complaint or their brief any particular financing statute which they seek to have us declare unconstitutional. As will be briefly shown in this opinion, the school-financing scheme provides a complex, and frequently changing, mixture of State and local funding, together with a minor amount of Federal aid. It appears-the plaintiffs seek to have us declare the entire financing scheme unconstitutional. We shall decline the invitation to engage in such a blunderbuss approach. Instead, we shall restrict ourselves to a determination whether the constitutional language of Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, is merely hortatory or aspirational, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>imposes instead a constitutional duty on the Commonwealth to ensure the education of its children in the public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We conclude that a duty exists. Second, we shall attempt to describe the nature of that duty and where it lies. Third, we shall consider whether on this record such a duty is shown to be violated. We take this approach because we are confident that the executive and legislative branches of government will respond appropriately to meet their constitutional responsibilities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The stipulated record contains 546 stipulations and six volumes of documentary material. The plaintiffs claim that this record supports their factual assertions, and that these facts, taken together, are sufficient to prove their legal claim that the school-financing scheme in Massachusetts violates Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, and arts. 1 and 10. The defendant education officials dispute both contentions: They deny that the stipulated record supports the plaintiffs\u2019 factual claims, and they argue that, even if it did, these facts would be insufficient to prove the plaintiffs\u2019 legal claims. The defendants also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>dispute the existence of the plaintiffs\u2019 legal claims under the Massachusetts Constitution. We outline briefly the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">1. <em>The plaintiffs\u2019 factual claims. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 key factual assertions concern: (1) the inadequacy of the education offered at the public schools they attend; (2) the insufficiency of funds for their schools; and (3) the State\u2019s school-funding system.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">a. <em>Adequacy. </em>The plaintiffs assert that the educational opportunities offered to them in the towns and cities in which they live and attend public school are \u201cinadequate.\u201d They assert further that \u201cthe education provided to the Plaintiffs is inadequate by any reasonable standard of adequacy.\u201d To support this inadequacy claim, the plaintiffs cite reports and affidavits of education professionals on the question of adequacy, and, in addition, using stipulations of record, they describe conditions in the plaintiffs\u2019 schools, and then compare them with conditions in three \u201ccomparison\u201d communities (Brookline, Concord, and Wellesley). Among the reports which the plaintiffs cite to support their claim of inadequacy is a 1991 report of the Board of Education (one of the defendants). This report states that \u201cschools in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are in a state of emergency due to grossly inadequate financial support,\u201d and that the education offered in the public schools in some cities and towns of the Commonwealth is not \u201cadequate\u201d or \u201cacceptable.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also cite the affidavits of three education professionals: Harold Raynolds, former Commissioner of Education; Peter Finn, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents; and Rosanne K. Bacon, former president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Each of these education professionals expresses the opinion that the education offered in the poorer towns and cities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the Commonwealth is inadequate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Lastly, the plaintiffs cite a 1991 report of the Massachusetts Business Alliance for Education, a group of business persons concerned with education reform in the Commonwealth, which concludes that the \u201cpublic education system is failing to provide its students with the knowledge and skills necessary for them to be productive, informed citizens in coming decades.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In describing the conditions in the plaintiffs\u2019 schools, the plaintiffs focus mainly on four of the sixteen towns and cities in which they live and attend school: Brockton, Winchendon, Leicester, and Lowell. The parties have stipulated that the conditions in the schools in these communities are \u201csufficiently typical\u201d of those in the schools in the other twelve communities, and that whatever findings the court makes for these four cities or towns should also apply to the other twelve. The parties also have stipulated that \u201cevidence of the conditions in the school districts in which the plaintiffs attend school is sufficient to establish the conditions under which the plaintiffs attend school.\u201d In describing the conditions in the schools of these four communities, the plaintiffs cite extensive stipulations in the record, including stipulations describing the opinions of the superintendents of those four school systems on the adequacy of the education offered in their schools.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also cite stipulations concerning: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>crowded classes; reductions in staff; inadequate teaching of basic subjects including reading, writing, science, social studies, mathematics, computers, and other areas; neglected libraries; the inability to attract and retain high quality teachers; the lack of teacher training; the lack of curriculum development; the lack of predictable funding; the administrative reductions; and inadequate guidance counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The record also contains extensive stipulations concerning the conditions in the public schools in three \u201ccomparison\u201d school districts: Brookline, Concord, and Wellesley. The parties have stipulated that the public school systems in these three communities are \u201ctypical of a significant number of the cities and towns in which the per pupil expenditure is in the top 25% of the Commonwealth.\u201d They have stipulated that the public schools in these \u201ccomparison\u201d communities offer \u201csignificantly greater educational opportunities than the public schools in the communities in which the plaintiffs attend school,\u201d and that the latter offer \u201csignificantly fewer educational opportunities and lower educational quality than\u201d the schools in the comparison districts. Further, they have stipulated that the \u201camount of financial resources\u201d available to the comparison communities \u201cis a significant contributing factor that affects the quality of the education that these communities are able to provide to their students, as compared to the plaintiffs\u2019 communities.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">With this introduction, the plaintiffs proceed, again relying on stipulations, to describe features of the school systems in the comparison districts, specifically: multi-faceted reading programs; extensive writing programs and resources; thorough computer instruction; active curriculum development and review ensuring a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum; extensive teacher training and development; comprehensive system-wide student services; and a wide variety of courses in visual and performing arts.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">b. <em>Funding levels. </em>The plaintiffs claim that the financial resources of the public schools in their towns and cities are substantially less than the financial resources of public schools in other towns and cities of the Commonwealth. They also claim that financial resources of the schools in their communities are so low as to render their schools unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>provide students \u201cwith the opportunity to receive an adequate education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">c. <em>The school financing system. </em>The plaintiffs claim that the school funding system \u2014 \u201ca conglomeration of statutes, occasional emergency legislation, local appropriations, and ad hoc practices not codified by statute\u201d fails to ensure that the schools in the plaintiffs\u2019 towns and cities have sufficient funds to provide an adequate education. The financing \u201csystem,\u201d the plaintiffs claim, is responsible both for the wide disparity in funding among the schools in different communities of the Commonwealth, and for the insufficiency of school funds in the towns and cities in which they live and attend school.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">According to the plaintiffs, there are several, interrelated problems with the school funding system: First, under the existing \u201csystem,\u201d the principal source of funds for public schools is local funds, primarily the local real property tax, which is assessed, collected, and used locally. Towns and cities with low real estate valuations, such as those in which the plaintiffs live and attend school, are severely limited in their ability to raise local funds. Second, there is no State statute or regulation requiring towns and cities to contribute any particular amount, percentage of local funds, or any local funds to the support of schools in their communities. Third, although the Commonwealth provides various forms of \u201cState aid\u201d annually to towns and cities under G. L. c. 70 and 70A, to supplement funds raised locally, the amounts granted are insufficient to compensate for deficiencies in local funds. Fourth, State aid is unpredictable every year and, in some years, is not granted by the State until after the school year has begun. Fifth, State aid for schools is undifferentiated from State aid for other municipal purposes, and there is no requirement that towns and cities actually use State aid for schools to support schools and not for other municipal purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">2. <em>The plaintiffs\u2019 legal claims. </em>On the basis of these factual assertions, the plaintiffs claim that the Commonwealth, through its school-financing system, has effectively denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the plaintiffs the opportunity to receive an adequate education. The Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide them with an adequate education, they claim, violates the duty imposed on the Commonwealth by Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, of the Massachusetts Constitution, which provides, inter alla, that \u201cit shall be the duty of legislatures and magistrates, in all future periods of this Commonwealth, to cherish ... the public schools and grammar schools in the towns.\u201d The plaintiffs also claim that the failure to provide them with an adequate education violates the equal protection guarantees of arts. 1 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The plaintiffs seek identical relief under both of their constitutional claims:<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a declaratory judgment that \u201cthe Commonwealth has an obligation to provide each public school child with the opportunity to receive an adequate education,\u201d and that \u201cthe Commonwealth has violated the Massachusetts Constitution by failing to fulfill its obligations to the Plaintiff school children.\u201d In addition, in their complaint (but not in their briefs), the plaintiffs ask the court to declare \u201cthat the Massachusetts system of financing elementary and secondary public education violates both the Education Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Massachusetts Constitution\u201d and, following such declaration, to \u201c[ejnjoin any act by any of the defendants to continue to implement the current unconstitutional scheme of financing.\u201d As noted, we shall decline to reach these two latter points. We add also that in light of the failure of the plaintiffs to brief adequately which financial schemes are involved in these prayers, these issues are waived. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We note that the plaintiffs do not seek a judgment that the Commonwealth has an obligation to equalize educational spending across all towns and cities, or that the Commonwealth has an obligation to provide equal educational opportunities to all its students. Instead, they seek a declaratory judgment that these constitutional provisions require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>State to provide every young person in the Commonwealth with an \u201cadequate\u201d education. The plaintiffs argue that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, and arts. 1 and 10, each require \u201cequal access to an adequate education, not absolute equality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We turn now to an examination of Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, of the Massachusetts Constitution to determine whether, as the plaintiffs claim, its provisions impose on the State an enforceable obligation to provide to each young person in the Commonwealth the opportunity for an education.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\u201cThe Constitution of Massachusetts is a frame of government for a sovereign power. It was designed by its framers and accepted by the people as an enduring instrument, so comprehensive and general in its terms that a free, intelligent and moral body of citizens might govern themselves under its beneficent provisions through radical changes in social, economic and industrial conditions. It declares only fundamental principles as to the form of government and the mode in which it shall be exercised.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>357 Mass. 564, 570-571 (1970), quoting <em>Tax Comm\u2019r v. Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, 523-524 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">In determining the meaning of a constitutional provision, we look to the language and structure of the provision, so that it is \u201cconstrued so as to accomplish a reasonable result and to achieve its dominating purpose.\u201d <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>326 Mass. 313, 317 (1950). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, </em>402 Mass. 534, 541 (1988). We do so bearing in mind the Constitution was \u201cwritten to be understood by the voters to whom it was submitted for approval. It is to be interpreted in the sense most obvious to the common intelligence. Its phrases are to be read and construed according to the familiar and approved usage of the language.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 195, 199 (1976), quoting <em>Yont </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>275 Mass. 365, 366 (1931). The words of a constitutional provision \u201care to be given their natural and ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>vious sense according to common and approved usage as the time of its adoption.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>308 Mass. 601, 611 (1941), quoting <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>289 Mass. 149, 158 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Moreover, the Constitution \u201cis to be interpreted in the light of the conditions under which it and its several parts were framed, the ends which it was designed to accomplish, the benefits which it was expected to confer, and the evils which it was hoped to remedy.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 571, quoting <em>Tax Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Putnam, supra </em>at 523-524. The Constitution \u201cis to be construed in the light of the circumstances under which it was framed, the causes leading to its adoption, the imperfections hoped to be remedied, and the ends designed to be accomplished.\u201d <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, supra </em>at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Lastly, the Constitution \u201cis a statement of general principles and not a specification of details. ... It is to be interpreted as the Constitution of a State and not as a statute or an ordinary piece of legislation. Its words must be given a construction adapted to carry into effect its purpose.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>357 Mass. 564, 571 (1970), quoting <em>Tax Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, 523-524 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, of the Massachusetts Constitution was adopted as part of the Constitution of the Commonwealth in 1780. We repeat the part relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\"><em>\u201cWisdom and knowledge, </em>as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body of the people, <em>being necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties; and as these depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages of education </em>in the various parts of the country, and among the different orders of the people, <em>it shall be the duty of legislatures and magistrates, </em>in all future periods of this Commonwealth, <em>to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, </em>and all seminaries of them; <em>especially the </em>university at Cambridge, <em>public </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>schools and grammar schools in the towns . </em>. .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe duty of legislatures and magistrates, in all future periods of this Commonwealth, to cherish . . . public schools and grammar schools in the towns\u201d includes the duty to provide an adequate education to the young people of the State, and that this duty is \u201can enforceable obligation\u201d of the Commonwealth. The defendant education officials argue that the language of the entire section is \u201caspirational\u201d and a \u201cnoble expression of the high esteem in which the framers held education,\u201d but that it is not \u201cmandatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">We begin with the language and structure of the provision. We seek the \u201cnatural and obvious sense\u201d of the terms of the provision \u201caccording to common and approved usage at the time of [the Constitution\u2019s] adoption\u201d in 1780. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>308 Mass. 601, 611 (1941), quoting <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co., supra </em>at 158. Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, opens with two declarations, or statements, and then proceeds to establish the \u201cduty ... to cherish the . . . public schools.\u201d First, it declares that \u201c[w]isdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body of the people\u201d are \u201cnecessary for the preservation of [the people\u2019s] rights and liberties.\u201d Second, it states that the diffusion of wisdom, knowledge, and virtue among the body of the people \u201cdepend [s] on spreading the opportunities and advantages of education in the various parts of the country, and among the different orders of the people.\u201d Following these two declarations, the section provides that \u201cit shall be the duty of legislatures and magistrates, in all future periods of this Commonwealth, to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of them; especially . . . public schools and grammar schools in the towns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The two statements at the beginning of Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, state plainly the premises on which the duty is established: First, the protection of rights and liberties requires the diffusion of wisdom, knowledge, and virtue throughout the people. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Second, the means of diffusing these qualities and attributes among the people is to spread the opportunities and advantages of education throughout the Commonwealth. In the statement of these two premises for which the duty is established it is revealed that: The duty is established so that the rights and liberties of the people will be preserved. The immediate purpose of the establishment of the duty is the spreading of the opportunities and advantages of education throughout the people; the ultimate end is the preservation of rights and liberties. Put otherwise, an educated people is viewed as essential to the preservation of the entire constitutional plan: a free; sovereign, constitutional democratic State.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The language of the section makes clear the connection between the opening declarations and the duty which follows: <em>\u201c[A]s </em>these [wisdom, knowledge, and virtue, diffused among the people] <em>depend on </em>spreading the opportunities and advantages of education ... it <em>shall be </em>the duty of legislatures and magistrates ... to <em>cherish </em>. . . public schools\u201d (emphasis added). From the context, it is clear that \u201cas\u201d is used to mean \u201cbecause,\u201d and that there is a clear causal chain connecting the two statements and the establishment of the duty. The language of Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, thus leaves little doubt about the reasons for which the duty to cherish is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The duty established is, inter alla, placed on the \u201clegislatures and magistrates, in all future periods of this Commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The common meaning of \u201cduty\u201d in 1780, accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ing to a dictionary of the English language published that year, was \u201cthat to which a man is by any natural or legal obligation bound.\u201d T. Sheridan, A General Dictionary of the English Language (1780) (Scalar Press, facsimile ed. 1967). \u201c[I]n the sense most obvious to the common intelligence,\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 199, both then and now, a duty is that to which one is bound, or an \u201cobligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The term \u201ccherish\u201d was used in the Eighteenth Century to import a meaning which is no longer, or which is much less, in vogue today. The meaning attached to the word then was \u201cto support,\u201d \u201cto nourish\u201d or \u201cto nurture.\u201d A host of dictionaries published in that era define the verb to \u201ccherish\u201d this way.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That meaning can also be seen in the use of the term \u201ccherish\u201d in common texts likely to have been in circulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>at that time.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Most importantly, that distinctive meaning can be seen from works of the framers themselves. John Adams, in Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law (1765), reprinted in 3 Works of John Adams 447 (C.F. Adams ed. 1851), described an \u201caspiring, noble principle founded in be--nevolence, and <em>cherished </em>by knowledge\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 448); declared that \u201cnone of the means of information are more sacred, or have been <em>cherished </em>with more tenderness and care by the settlers of America, than the press\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 457); and proclaimed that \u201c[t]his spirit [of liberty], however, without knowledge, would be little better than a brutal rage. Let us tenderly and kindly <em>cherish, </em>therefore, the means of knowledge. Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 462) (emphasis supplied). In 1789, John Hancock, then Governor of the Commonwealth, spoke to the Massachusetts Legislature about \u201cthe commencement and operation\u201d of the new Federal government, pronouncing that \u201c[t]he early laws of the Union must <em>cherish </em>commerce\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Thus, according to common usage in the late Eighteenth Century, a duty to cherish was an obligation to support or nurture. Hence, the \u201cduty ... to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of them; especially . . . public schools and grammar schools in the towns\u201d is an obligation to support or nurture these interests and institutions. The breadth of the meaning of these terms (\u201cduty . . . to cherish\u201d), together with the articulated ends for which this duty to cherish is established, strongly support the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the \u201cduty ... to cherish . . . the public schools\u201d encompasses the duty to provide an education to the people of the Commonwealth. Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, states plainly that the duty to \u201ccherish\u201d \u2014 support \u2014 public schools arises out of the need to educate the people of the Commonwealth; it is reasonable therefore to understand the duty to \u201ccherish\u201d public schools as a duty to ensure that the public schools achieve their object and educate the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Constitutional structure, as well as constitutional language, supports the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, imposes a duty on \u201clegislatures and magistrates\u201d to provide for the education of the populace. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 195, 200 (1976). Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, is distinctively and prominently placed in the Constitution. The Constitution is composed of a short Preamble and two Parts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Part One \u2014 \u201cA Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u201d \u2014 contains thirty articles which declare the rights of the people. Part Two \u2014 \u201cThe Frame of Government\u201d \u2014 contains six chapters which prescribe the structure and pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ers of the government of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, is the second of two sections in the fifth chapter of the \u201cFrame of Government\u201d; the first section in c. 5 concerns the \u201cuniversity at Cambridge.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The framers\u2019 decision to dedicate an entire chapter \u2014 one of six \u2014 to the topic of education signals that it was to them a central concern. Their decision to treat education differently from other objects of government by devoting a separate chapter to education rather than listing it as a matter within the powers of the legislative or executive branches indicates structurally what is said explicitly by words: that education is a \u201cduty\u201d of government, and not merely an object within the power of government. Lastly, the framers\u2019 decision to place the provisions concerning education in \u201cThe Frame of Government\u201d \u2014 rather than in the \u201cDeclaration of Rights\u201d \u2014 demonstrates that the framers conceived of education as fundamentally related to the very existence of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">This last point illustrates an instance where structure echoes language. The preservation of rights and liberties was one of the principal reasons for the formation of the Commonwealth and the adoption of a republican form of government. The Preamble to the Constitution states that the \u201cend of the institution, maintenance and administration of government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>is to secure the existence of the body politic, to protect it, and to furnish the individuals who compose it, with the power of enjoying in safety and tranquility their natural rights and the blessings of life.\u201d Education, which Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, states is the means of diffusing wisdom, knowledge, and virtue, is, therefore, a prerequisite for the existence and survival of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">While both language and structure support the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, imposes on \u201clegislatures and magistrates\u201d a duty to educate the populace, we consider also whether this duty is, in the defendants\u2019 words, \u201cmandatory.\u201d The defendants argue that the duty to cherish in Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, cannot be mandatory because, first, the duty to cherish extends to objects other than the public schools, and second, because Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, establishes, in addition to the duty to cherish, the duty to \u201cencourage\u201d various societies and the duty to \u201ccountenance and inculcate\u201d various habits and values.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Several features of Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, strongly suggest that the duty to cherish schools is mandatory. First, \u201cduty,\u201d according to common usage in the late Eighteenth Century, meant, as indicated above, \u201cobligation.\u201d Second, the language of Pt. II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, contains in essence a double injunction: It not only sets forth the \u201cduty\u201d; it also, by the use of the term \u201cshall,\u201d mandates the duty: \u201cit <em>shall be </em>the <em>duty </em>of legislatures and magistrates\u201d (emphasis supplied). Third, the duty is enjoined \u201cfor all future periods of this Commonwealth.\u201d This unusual temporal reference underscores the continuing nature of the obligation and militates against a reading of \u201cduty\u201d as merely advisory. Fourth, the Constitution does not use the term \u201cduty\u201d lightly. None of the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of government is described or prescribed in the Constitution as a \u201cduty.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">We are not deterred by the fact that the duty to \u201ccherish\u201d extends not only to \u201cpublic schools and grammar schools in the towns\u201d but also to \u201cthe university at Cambridge\u201d and to \u201cthe interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of them.\u201d We do not read the section to require that \u201clegislatures and magistrates\u201d cherish (i.e., support) each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>these interests and institutions in the same manner. A sensible reading of the language is that each object of the duty to cherish is to be cherished in accordance with its nature. \u201cInterests\u201d are unlike institutions, and so are \u201ccherished\u201d in different ways from institutions. The \u201cuniversity at Cambridge\u201d is different from \u201cpublic schools and grammar schools in the towns\u201d and so is cherished differently from them.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We do, however, stop to consider the fact that, as the defendants point out, Pt. II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, imposes not only a duty to cherish certain educational interests and institutions, but also the duty \u201cto encourage private societies and public institutions, rewards and immunities, for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, trades, manufacture, and a natural history of the country\u201d and the duty \u201cto countenance and inculcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and private charity, industry and frugality, honesty and punctuality in their dealings; sincerity, good hu-mour, and all social affections, and generous sentiments among the people.\u201d The defendants argue that these latter duties are so vague that they cannot be mandatory and enforceable, and that, if these latter duties are not mandatory, the first duty \u2014 the duty to cherish educational institutions, including public schools \u2014 cannot be mandatory. While the point has appeal, we believe the argument runs too far. It does not follow that if one duty (the duty to cherish the public schools) is mandatory, the other two duties must necessarily be mandatory. Whether the duties established in Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, are \u201cmandatory\u201d depends, among other things, on their content and their object. We have no occasion in this case to consider either the content or the object of the duties to \u201cencourage\u201d or to \u201ccountenance and inculcate.\u201d Simply put, the duties are different from one another and must be examined separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">An examination of the language of Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, and the placement of that provision within the Constitution supports the plaintiff students\u2019 argument that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, requires the State to provide them with an education. That conclusion is buttressed by an examination of the \u201cconditions\u201d under which Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, was \u201cframed, the ends which it was designed to accomplish, the benefits which it was expected to confer, and the evils which it was hoped to remedy.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>357 Mass. 564, 571 (1970), quoting <em>Tax Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Putnam, supra. </em>To determine those conditions, we examine both the history of public education in the Commonwealth at the time the Constitution, was adopted, and the specific circumstances of the adoption of Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2. We begin with the former, and explore it in some detail because it forms the backdrop against which Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, was drafted by the framers and adopted by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Public education, both as a practice and as a value, was commonplace in Massachusetts in 1780. As the court has detailed in the past, the founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and later of the Province of Massachusetts Bay \u201cappreciated the importance and necessity of providing for the universal education of the people, at a very early period,\u201d and \u201claid the foundation of a system of common schools,\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>103 Mass. 94, 96-97 (1869). See <em>Cush-ing </em>v. <em>Newburyport, </em>10 Met. 508, 511 (1845).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">A public commitment to education was evidenced from the first days of the colonial period. The Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded in 1630. Five years later, in 1635, the people of Boston agreed that \u201cour brother Philemon Purmont shall be intreated to become scholemaster for the teaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>and nourtering of children with us.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The next year, in 1636, the General Court made a public grant of 400 English pounds to found a college. 1 Massachusetts Bay Records 183 (October 28, 1636). In 1642, the General Court enjoined the selectmen of every town to keep \u201ca vigilant eye over their brethren and neighbours\u201d to see \u201cthat none of them shall suffer so much Barbarism in any of their families, as not to endeavour to teach, by themselves or others, their Children and Apprentices,\u201d and prescribed a twenty-shilling fine for such neglect.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In 1647, in a law which is credited with beginning the history of public education in America, the General Court required the towns to maintain a system of public schools. See Cubberley, Public Education in the United States 18 (1947). The statute of 1647 \u2014 which is the precursor to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 1 \u2014 required every town with fifty or more householders to appoint a schoolmaster in the town \u201cto teach all such Children as shall resort to him to Write and Read,\u201d and every town of one hundred or more householders or families to \u201cset up a <em>Grammar School, </em>the Master thereof being able to Instruct Youth so far as they may be fitted for the University.\u201d For a town\u2019s failure to set up a grammar school in which students studied grammar, Latin, and Greek, the 1647 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>statute prescribed a penalty of five pounds a year, see Martin, The Evolution of the Massachusetts Public School System 58-60 (1915), to be paid over \u201cto the next such School,\u201d every year until the offending town complied with the statute and set up a grammar school.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The 1647 statute did not ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>pressly require towns to support these schools by general taxation, but this was the effect of the statute.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In 1671, the General Court increased the penalty for a town\u2019s failure to set up a grammar school to ten pounds, again to be paid \u201cunto the next Town School that is settled according to that law [of 1647].\u201d The General Laws and Liberties of the Massachusetts Colony (1672 ed.) 137, reprinted in The Colonial Laws of Massachusetts (1890).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">After the grant of the new charter for the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1692, one of the General Court\u2019s first acts was to issue school legislation like that which had been in effect in the colony. See An Act for the settlement and support of ministers and school-masters, Province Laws 1692-1693, c. 26, \u00a7 5, reprinted in 1 Acts and Resolves of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay at 63. As before, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>towns which neglected their obligation would be assessed a penalty \u2014 ten pounds a year \u2014 \u201cwhich penalty shall be toward the support of such school or schools within the same county, where there may be most need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As for the support of these public schools, in a separate law also enacted in 1692, the General Court granted town selectmen the authority \u201cto assess the inhabitants and others resident within such town ... for the maintenance and support of the . . . schools.\u201d \u201cAn Act for the regulating of townships, choice of town officers, and setting forth their power,\u201d Province Laws 1692-1693, c. 28, \u00a7 6, reprinted in 1 Acts and Resolves of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In 1701, the General Court found that observance of this \u201cwholesome and necessary law [the 1692 school law] is shamefully neglected by divers towns, and the penalty therefore not required\u201d and that this neglect \u201ctend[ed] greatly to the nourishing of ignorance and irreligi\u00f3n.\u201d An Act in addition to An act for the settlement and support of schools and school-masters, Province Laws 1701-1702, c. 10, preamble, reprinted in 1 Acts and Resolves of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay at 470. To counter this tide of neglect, the General Court amended the school law to increase the penalty for violation from ten to twenty pounds per year, \u201cany law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding\u201d; to require approval of all grammar school masters by the minister of the town and the ministers of two adjacent towns; and to prohibit any minister of a town from also being the schoolmaster of the town. In addition, the 1701 statute directed the \u201cjustices of peace\u201d of the counties to \u201ctake effectual care that the laws respecting schools and school-masters be duely observed and put in execution,\u201d and \u201call grand jurors\u201d to \u201cdiligently inquire\u201d into breaches of the school law. <em>Id. </em>at c. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4. Ten years later, in 1711, the General Court enacted a statute prohibiting all but those who are \u201cof sober and good conversation, and have the allowance and approbation of the selectmen\u201d from being schoolmasters in either writing schools or grammar schools, and providing a penalty for violation of this provision. An Act against intemperance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>immorality and profaneness, and for reformation of manners, Province Laws 1711-1712, c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18, reprinted in 1 Acts and Resolves of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay 681-682.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">After finding \u201cby sad experience\u201d that \u201cmany towns\u201d required under the school law to set up a grammar school and \u201cvery able\u201d to do so chose instead to ignore the law and incur the fine, the General Court again increased the penalty for violating the school law, to thirty pounds for towns of 150 families, forty pounds for towns of 200 families, \u201cand so <em>pro rata </em>in case the town consist of two hundred and fifty or three hundred families.\u201d An Act in addition to the several acts for settlement and support of school-masters, Province Laws 1718-1719, c. 2, reprinted in 2 Acts and Resolves of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Fifty years later, in 1768, the General Court enacted a statute authorizing the inhabitants of precincts within towns and districts to raise money to support the schools within their individual precincts. This statute authorized precincts that wished to \u201cexpend more for the instruction of children and youth, in useful learning, within their own bounds, than, as parts of such towns or districts, they are, by law, held to do\u201d to tax themselves additional amounts, in an annual vote, for such purposes.

In 1636, the General Court of the Bay Colony founded Harvard College with a public grant of 400 pounds, and in 1650, it granted a charter to the college.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In 1640, the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Court granted the revenues of the Charlestown-Boston ferry to Harvard College. 1 Massachusetts Bay Records 304 (1853), and, in 1694, two years after the creation of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, the General Court of the Province confirmed the grant of the Charlestown ferry revenue to the college. Province Laws 1694-1695, c. 38, reprinted in 7 Acts and Resolves of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay 452 (1892). Throughout the period of the colonial and provincial governments, the General Court made grants for the support of the president and professors of the college. See 2 J.

Persons who failed to give a \u201ctrue list of their estate and polls\u201d to the taxing officials of their town were fined forty shillings, one-half to be paid to the informer, and one half \u201cfor and towards the support of the schoolmaster in said town; and for want of such schoolmaster, according to law in said town, then to the use of the next grammer-school master in the county.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">By 1780, a system of public schools had been in existence for over 130 years in Massachusetts, a college had been in existence for over 140 years, and the values of public education had been expressed and supported in a wide variety of ways. It was against this background and with this experience that the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1779-1780 framed, and the people of Massachusetts adopted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the Constitution of the Commonwealth, including Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We now examine the history of the adoption of Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution. Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, was drafted by a drafting committee charged by the delegates to the 1779-1780 Constitutional Convention with the task of preparing the initial draft of a Constitution.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> John Adams is generally regarded as the principal author of the draft Constitution produced by this committee,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> including the section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>which became Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> At the convention, the delegates accepted Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, as drafted, and included it without change in the proposed Constitution <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The delegates then sent the proposed Constitution to the towns.for review by the people. When the town returns were in, the delegates determined that the people had approved the proposed Constitution as written, and declared the Constitution ratified, including Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, as originally drafted.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The returns of the towns are vivid evidence that the people who adopted the Constitution of 1780 understood Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, as imposing a duty on Legislatures and magistrates to provide for the education of the people. When the proposed Constitution was sent to the towns, the towns were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>requested to discuss and vote on the Constitution, section by section, and, if they had objections to any section, to \u201cstate their Objections distinctly and the Reasons therefor.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> While the towns as a whole overwhelmingly accepted Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, without comment,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> five towns recorded objections to the provision. These objections share a common understanding of the provision; each of the objections is premised on the idea that, if the provision were to be included in the Constitution, the Legislature would issue legislation mandating public education in all the towns. It is precisely this to which the towns objected, although for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The townspeople of Colrain wrote: \u201c[W]e Object to the Town being oblidged to keep Gramer Schools Reason as Towns in General are not of Ability to Keep a Sufficency of English Schools.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The town of West Springfield wrote: \u201cVoted to erase the Word <em>Grammer-Schools. </em>The Reason why we think that Injunction unsalutary is because many Towns in the Country are not under Circumstances to receive any considerable advantage from Grammar Schools and therefore think it a Grievance to be at so great Expence when a good English School may answer all the valuable Ends most of the Inhabitants can expect to receive from Schools.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The town of Sutton proposed \u201cthat the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Grammer be deled. Because we are and have long been of the opinion that the obloiging every Town to keep a Grammer School is rather a stagnation to the learning of Youth than any promotion of it.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The town of Bellingham opined that \u201cthe Encouragement of literature is Good and we think the inhabitants of Each Town have the Sole Right and are the Properest Judges of what Schooles are the most Suteall for the inhabitants thereof as they suport and have the advantage thereof and no town has any busness with another Town about Schooles. as that is not a matter of legeslation.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Lastly, the town of Middleborough objected to the provision more generally, writing that \u201cit is Such a Complicated inconsistant Flourish of Expressions that it is in our opinion impossible To Seperate the good which we Conceive to Be intended by it, from the Numerous Evils which may take place in Consequence of it\u201d; the people of Middleborough concluded, however: \u201cBut would by all means Encourage all Nessasary Scools in the Several Towns.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>These objections reflect the townspeople\u2019s knowledge of and experience with the colonial laws mandating public education in the towns and their belief that this provision of the Constitution would require the new Legislature to continue to mandate public education in the towns. Given the uniformity of this understanding in the recorded objections, we think it a safe assumption that many, if not all, of the other towns \u2014 which voted for the provision \u2014 probably had a similar understanding of the effect of the provision. We believe that the people of those other towns, who voted for the provision without objection, and whose affirmative vote carried the day, endorsed the provision with the understanding that it would require the Legislature to mandate universal public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">It seems plain that this is what the framers of the Constitution of 1780 intended. There is substantial evidence that John Adams believed that widespread public education was integral to the very existence of a republican government. In an early and influential essay, Adams described the strong alliances between ignorance and oppression, and between knowledge and liberty.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> He praised the early English settlers of the colony as deeply learned and deeply committed to liberty. They knew, he said, that nothing countered political oppression more than \u201cknowledge diffused generally through the whole body of the people\u201d and so they set out to \u201cpropagate and perpetuate knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Under their efforts, \u201cthe education of all ranks of people was made the care and expense of the public\u201d and the result was that a \u201cnative of America who cannot read and write is as rare an appearance as ... a comet or an earthquake.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> There were, he claimed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>however, some persons in Massachusetts \u201cwho affect to censure this provision for the education of our youth as a needless expense, and an imposition upon the rich in favor of the poor\u201d; this attitude, Adams continued, was calculated to foster ignorance and, with it, servility. Ignorance and servility were not the lot of the people of Massachusetts, however, because people have natural rights to liberty and to knowledge (they have \u201ca right, from the frame of their nature, to knowledge\u201d). In Massachusetts, the right to liberty was not only a natural right but also the inheritance bequeathed by \u201cour fathers [who] have earned and bought it for us, at the expense of their ease, their estates, their pleasure, and their blood.\u201d Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law, in 3 Works of John Adams 456 (C.F. Adams ed. 1851). To Adams, these rights were interdependent; the former could not be maintained without the latter: \u201c[L]iberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For this reason, he argued, \u201cthe preservation of the means of knowledge among the lowest ranks, is of more importance to the public than all the property of all the rich men in the country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In 1776, three years before drafting the Constitution of the Commonwealth, Adams wrote and published a pamphlet entitled Thoughts on Government, in which he endeavored to answer the question \u201cwhat plan I would advise a colony to pursue, in order to get out of the old government and into a new one.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> He offered that \u201cthere is no good government but what is republican.\u201d Thoughts on Government, in 4 Works of John Adams 194 (C.F. Adams ed. 1851). He described the requirements of a Constitution for a republican government. He prescribed a tripartite system of government in which the executive, legislative, and judicial branches are independent of one another, a \u201cmilitia law,\u201d and provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>for widely dispersed public education: \u201cLaws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower class of people, are so extremely wise and useful, that, to a humane and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be thought extravagant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199. In a subsequent version of this plan, he wrote that \u201ctwo things are indispensably to be adhered to, \u2014 one is, some regulation for securing forever an equitable choice of representatives; another is, the education of youth, both in literature and morals.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aza\">Samuel Adams, the second member of the drafting subcommittee of three, also took pride in and instruction from the commitment of the early settlers to public education. In 1775, he wrote to James Warren: \u201cOur Ancestors in the most early Times laid an excellent Foundation for the security of Liberty by setting up in a few years after their Arrival a publick Seminary of Learning; and by their Laws they obligd every Town consisting of a certain Number of Families to keep and maintain a Grammar School.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> He wrote also of his regret that the \u201cextraordinary Expence\u201d of waging the Revolution was taking resources away from the public schools, and asked whether, if this \u201cInattention\u201d were to continue, \u201cwould not the leading Gentlemen do eminent Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>to the Publick, by impressing upon the Minds of the People, the Necessity &amp; Importance of encouraging that System of Education, which in my opinion is so well calculated to diffuse among the Individuals of the Community the Principles of Morality, so essentially necessary to the Preservation of publick Liberty.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">This examination of the views of those who framed and those who adopted our Constitution provides compelling support for the argument that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, was intended to impose on Legislatures and magistrates the duty to provide for the education of the people. The townspeople who left records of their debates on the proposed Constitution plainly stated their view that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, would require the Legislature to mandate the maintenance of schools in the towns. The framers created a Constitution which by its words and its structure states plainly that providing for the education of the people is both duty of and prerequisite for a republican government, and in their writings, the Adams cousins stated this belief repeatedly and fervently. We turn now to the statements and actions of legislators and magistrates on the adoption of the Constitution in 1780, and find that they, too, understood Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, as imposing on Legislatures and magistrates the duty to educate the populace.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution commanded the attention of legislators and magistrates immediately after the Constitution was adopted. At the opening of the first legislative session held under the newly adopted Constitution, the Legislature issued a statement pledging itself to its new responsibilities. Answer of a Committee of both Houses of Assembly of Massachusetts to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor at the Opening of the Session (Nov. 7, 1780), in Massachusetts, Colony to Commonwealth: Documents on the Formation of Its Commonwealth 163 (R. Taylor ed. 1961). A substantial portion of its address was devoted to Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2. Echoing the language of the constitutional provision, the Legislature stated: \u201cInasmuch as knowledge and virtue are essential to the preservation of freedom in a State, we shall be happy in affording the highest marks of attention and respect to all Seminaries of Literature, and yielding them all the support they may need, and which it becomes the Representatives of a wise and free people to afford . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164-165. On the specific topic of schools, the Legislature pledged itself to address the needs of the public schools: \u201cNor can the schools throughout this Commonwealth be permitted to continue under such inattention and discouragement as they have for many years suffered, to the irreparable injury of the present and future generation, and to the indelible disgrace of a free government. We shall therefore hold ourselves obliged to form proper establishments for restoring them to their primitive dignity and usefulness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In 1789, nine years after the adoption of the Constitution, the Legislature powerfully stated its view that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, imposed on it the \u201cduty\u201d to \u201cprovide for the education of youth.\u201d In that year, the Legislature enacted the Commonwealth\u2019s first comprehensive school law,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and in doing so, expressly declared itself to be following its constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>duty. The preamble to the 1789 statute declares: \u201cWhereas the Constitution of this Commonwealth hath declared it to be the duty of the General Court to provide for the education of youth; and whereas a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue is necessary to the prosperity of every State, and the very existence of a Commonwealth: Be it enacted . . . .\u201d St. 1789, c. 19, preamble.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Throughout the early years of the Commonwealth, legislators and magistrates \u2014 several of whom had been delegates to the constitutional convention \u2014 publicly articulated their views of the responsibilities imposed on them by Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2. In speeches and other public messages, they stressed several points repeatedly: They described Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution as imposing on them a duty or injunction. They stated emphatically that public education was integral to the republican form of government newly adopted in the Commonwealth. They characterized and extolled public education as education for the rich and the poor alike. Lastly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>they stated, in numerous different ways, that ensuring the education of the population was a matter of State-wide responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Thus, in 1791, Governor John Hancock pleaded with the Legislature to use State resources to help citizens in the frontier parts of the State to set up schools. In that address he stated: \u201cI feel myself so much impressed with the disagreeable situation of our fellow Citizens in the eastern part of the Commonwealth [referring to that part of Massachusetts now located in the State of Maine] . . . that I cannot but urge it upon you Gentlemen, to take measures for their relief, so far as it is within your power to do it.\u201d Speech of Governor John Hancock, Jan. 28, 1791, reprinted in 1790-1791 Resolves of the General Court 563, 564. Hancock urged the Legislature to take action, and advised the legislators that \u201cthe resources of the State, by the appropriation of wild lands, or by any other means, are such, as will allow you to assist that society in their laudable endeavours to disseminate the principles of Religion and morality amongst our fellow Citizens.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In 1793, Governor Hancock requested the Legislature to turn its attention to the entire system of public schools in the Commonwealth: \u201cAmongst the means by which our government has been raised to its present height of prosperity, that of education has been the most efficient; you will therefore encourage and support our Colleges and Academies [<footnotemark>59</footnotemark>]; but more watchfully the Grammar and other town schools. These offer equal advantages to poor and rich; should the support of such institutions be neglected, the kind of education which a free government requires to maintain its force, would soon be forgotten.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">In 1794, Samuel Adams, assuming the office of Governor on the death of Governor Hancock, addressed the General Court on the \u201cgreat and important\u201d subject of \u201cthe educa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tian of our children and youth.\u201d Samuel Adams declared that the security of the State depended on the education of youth; one reason, among others, was that education \u201cqualifies] them [youth] to discover any error, if there should be such, in the forms and administration of Governments, and point out the method of correcting them.\u201d Address to the Massachusetts Legislature, Jan. 17, 1794, reprinted in 4 The Writings of Samuel Adams 359-360 (H.A. Cushing ed. 1968). \u201cBut,\u201d Governor Adams continued, \u201cI need not press this subject, being persuaded, that this Legislature from the inclination of their minds, as well as in regard to the duty enjoined by the Constitution, will cherish \u2018the interest of Literature, the Sciences, and all their Seminaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360. The next year, Governor Adams, like Governor Hancock just two years before, warned the legislative body of the dangers to the public schools of the growing phenomenon of private \u201cAcademies.\u201d While praising the \u201cpatriotic exertions of worthy citizens\u201d to establish the private academies, he continued: \u201c[Pjerhaps it may be justly apprehended, that multiplying them, may have a tendency to injure the ancient and beneficial mode of Education in Town Grammar Schools. The peculiar advantage of such schools is, that the poor and the rich may derive equal benefit from them; but none excepting the more wealthy, generally speaking, can avail themselves of the benefits of the Academies. Should these institutions detach the attention and influence of the wealthy, from the generous support of town Schools, is it not to be feared that useful learning, instruction and social feelings in the early parts of life, may cease to be so equally and universally disseminated, as it has heretofore been.\u201d Address to the Legislature of Massachusetts, June 3, 1795, in 4 Writings of Samuel Adams, <em>supra </em>at 375, 378-379.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Governor Caleb Strong, in 1801, devoted an entire address to the Legislature on \u201cthe education of youth,\u201d stating that \u201c[a]mong the various subjects of State Legislation, there is none more important to the preservation of our Free Govern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>merits.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Like many before him, Governor Strong praised the early settlers who, he said, \u201cconsidered the education of children, as the most essential duty, and the most important exercise of government\u201d and \u201cprovided for the establishment of schools for the children of the poor as well as the rich.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> In concluding, Governor Strong asked the legislators: \u201cIf any of the towns or plantations which have lately settled in the Commonwealth, are unable to provide the means of instruction and education at their own expense, will it not be expedient for the public to afford them assistance, that no children may grow up in the State without instruction.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In response to Governor Strong, the Senate proclaimed that a republic cannot \u201clong exist, without the general diffusion of knowledge among every class of citizen\u201d; agreed that \u201cno subject of legislation can be more important\u201d; and declared that \u201can early and unwearied attention to the instruction of our youth\u201d was its \u201cduty, which to neglect would be a breach of the trust reposed in us by our constituents.\u201d Answer of the Senate, June 4, 1801, in Resolves of the General Court (1801) 9. The House of Representatives responded by stating that it was its \u201chighest wisdom to cherish, and if possible, to improve them [the public schools], and one of our first duties to transmit them unimpaired to our posterity.\u201d Answer of the House of Representatives, June 4, 1801, in Resolves of the General Court (1801) 9, 10. The House also agreed that, \u201c[i]f any of the towns or plantations in this Commonwealth are unable to provide the means of instruction for their children, we conceive that the public good requires that they should have such assistance as may be required for this purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Governor John Brooks, in 1819, also articulated the fundamental relation between republican government and public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>education, and the constitutional duty imposed by Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, to provide for the education of the people: \u201c[T]he conservation of our liberties, as defined in our great social compact, is intimately connected with the intelligence and virtue of the people. But man is born neither wise nor good. Knowledge and virtue result from instruction, and discipline and effort. . . . Hence the usefulness and importance of early tuition; and hence, likewise, the interest which the public has in providing means for cultivating the minds, and forming the manners of youth. Agreeably to these sentiments, the constitution enjoins it as a duty on the Legislature and Magistrates, in all future periods of the Commonwealth, to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, public schools and grammar schools in the towns. Should the existing laws be found insufficient to provide for the primary education of children, especially of destitute orphans, and the children of the poor and necessitous, prerequisite to their admission into grammar schools, the deficiency has strong claims to the consideration of the Legislature.\u201d Governor\u2019s Speech, June 1, 1819, in Resolves of the General Court (1819) 27, 28. The Legislature agreed with Governor Brooks. The Senate responded: \u201c[I]t is a truth, not to be forgotten, that political rights have little value, unless accompanied by intelligence and virtue. . . . [Legislators are obliged ... to foster and preserve the institutions calculated to diffuse useful knowledge and correct principles; our schools, colleges and churches. . . . [Ojur ancestors made early regulations for the establishment of schools in every part of the Commonwealth, for the instruction of the poor, as well as the affluent; thus encouraging the humblest individual, with the conviction that he was an object of interest to the community, and teaching him that, as his faculties had been developed under the public care, it was his duty to repay the service rendered him, by contributing to the support of similar institutions. . . . Nor ought we to allow advantages so valuable, to yield to the unfavorable influence apprehended from the increase of our population, commerce and wealth. It becomes the Legislature, therefore, to be vigilant, lest the causes of moral deteri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>oration, which have accompanied the progress of refinement, and the establishment of large manufactories in other countries, should gain admission within this Commonwealth.\u201d Answer of the Senate, Resolves of the General Court (1819) 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The House of Representatives pledged itself to act in accordance with its constitutional duty: \u201c[T]he House of Representatives hold it to be their indispensable duty, as it is their highest interest, to encourage every practicable measure that may be suggested or devised, to carry into effect the requisitions of the constitution, respecting the education of youth.\u201d Answer of the House, Resolves of the General Court (1819) 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In 1822, Governor Brooks again articulated the intimate connection between the republican form of government which the people of Massachusetts had chosen for themselves and the commitment to public education which is required to sustain that form of government: \u201cThe framers of the Constitution were aware that a compact on parchment merely, however definite its checks and provisions, would provide an insufficient preservative to a free government, should the people become indifferent to their own safety, and sink into a state of ignorance and profligacy.\u201d Governor\u2019s Speech, June 3, 1822, in Resolves of the General Court (1822) 508. \u201cTo this point the language of the Constitution is clear and emphatic,\u201d continued Brooks, \u201cwhen it affirms that \u2018knowledge generally diffused among the people, is necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509. And Massachusetts town schools \u201cin which her sages and statesmen have commenced their career of glory, are calculated to awaken the youthful intellect, to inspire a sense of character, and prepare the great mass of people for understanding and defending their rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Once again, the Legislature responded with an affirmative commitment. The Senate was particularly articulate on the connection between the maintenance of a republic and the education of her citizens: \u201c[T]he general diffusion of knowledge, among all classes of people, is the essential and indispensable basis of a representative re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>public. <em>The town school is the only proper introduction to the town </em>meeting\u201d (emphasis added). Answer of the Senate, June 3, 1822, in Resolves of the General Court (1822) at 517. See also Answer of the House of Representatives, June 3, 1822, in Resolves of the General Court (1822) 519, 520. Thus, in all of these early years of our Commonwealth it is clear that the people, the framers, the Legislatures, and the magistrates (Governors) had no doubt that it was their duty to cherish the public schools and that they were enjoined to respond to the constitutional mandate of Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2. The statutes they enacted add further evidence of their fulfilment of this obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The early legislation of the Commonwealth put these ideas into practice. In 1785, the Legislature authorized the townspeople to \u201cgrant and vote such sum or sums of money, as they shall judge necessary for the settlement, maintenance and support of . . . schools . . . ; to be assessed upon the polls and property within the same [the town],\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> and, as indicated, in 1789, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive school law mandating the maintenance of schools in the towns.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Like the earlier colonial and provincial laws, the 1789 school law required the towns to maintain schools in proportion with the number of their inhabitants. St. 1789, c. 19, \u00a7 1. The statute prescribed penalties for neglect of the law. St. 1789, c. 19, \u00a7 6. As in the earlier statutes, the penalty increased with the number of families in the offending town, and the monies collected from payment of the penalties were to be used \u201cfor the support of such school or schools\u201d in those towns within the same county as the offending town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\u201cwhose circumstances most require such assistance.\u201d St. 1789, c. 19, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In addition, the 1789 statute \u201cauthorized and empowered\u201d the towns to divide themselves into school \u201cdistricts.\u201d St. 1789, c. 19, \u00a7 2. The preamble to this section of the law explained that districts were necessary because \u201cby means of the dispersed situation of the inhabitants of several towns and districts ... the children and youth cannot be collected in any one place for their instruction.\u201d St. 1789, c. 19, \u00a7 2, preamble. Also, the statute required students to attain certain levels of proficiency in English before attending grammar school (\u00a7 3); set qualifications for grammar schoolmasters (\u00a7 5); required schoolmasters teaching the very young to obtain a certificate from the selectmen of the town (\u00a7 9); and enjoined ministers and selectmen to \u201cuse their influence and best endeavours, that the youth of their respective towns and districts do regularly attend the schools appointed and supported as aforesaid\u201d and to visit and inspect the schools to inquire into regulation and discipline and the proficiency of the students. St. 1789, c. 19, \u00a7 7. Last, in a provision which reveals the close relationship between public education and the survival of the republic in the minds of the members of the early Commonwealth (and which remains in effect today as G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 30), the 1789 statute directed teachers to instruct children and young people in the \u201cvirtues which are . . . the basis upon which the republican Constitution is structured.\u201d St. 1789, c. 19, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>16 Mass. 141 (1819), this court considered the requirements of the 1789 statute. A grand jury had issued an indictment against the inhabitants of the town of Dedham charging them with failing to maintain a grammar school \u201cin subversion of that diffusion of. knowledge, and in hindrance of that promotion of education, which the principles of a free government require, and which the constitution of the commonwealth enjoins; against the peace and dignity of said commonwealth, and the form of the statute in such case made and provided [St. 1789, c. 19].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The town defended on the basis that it employed a grammar school master in <em>one </em>of its \u201ctown or district schools.\u201d This court emphatically rejected Dedham\u2019s defense: \u201cThe schools required by the statute [St. 1789, c. 19] are to be maintained for the benefit of the whole town, as it is the wise policy of the law to give all the inhabitants equal privileges, for the education of their children in the public schools. <em>Nor is it in the power of the majority to deprive the minority of this privilege. </em>If, then, the schools in three of the districts are to be considered as grammar schools, and those in the other districts as of another description, the whole proceedings of the town have been irregular; and it may well be doubted, whether the money of the town can be lawfully appropriated to the support of schools thus instituted. <em>Every inhabitant of the town has a right to participate in the benefits of both descriptions of schools </em>[reading and writing schools and grammar schools]; and it is not competent for a town to establish a grammar school for the benefit of one part of the town, to the exclusion of the other; although the money raised for the support of schools may be, in other respects, fairly apportioned. If the whole of the money so raised by the defendants had been expended in three districts, no one would contend for the legality of such an appropriation. Yet the principle of the present case is the same. For the two descriptions of schools are to be considered as distinct and independent of each other. Both must be town schools, and not schools for the benefit of a part of the town only.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dedham, supra </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>In the years following 1789, a variety of school laws were enacted. The Legislature authorized the inhabitants of towns to raise money to repair schoolhouses, and to purchase land and buildings for new schoolhouses; mandated a district taxing system (for those towns that had subdivided into districts for school purposes as authorized by the 1789 law); and enacted various other provisions concerning the system of public schools in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In 1826, the Legislature required each town to elect a school committee, charged each school committee with specified duties, and instituted a report or \u201creturn\u201d to the Secretary of the Commonwealth. St. 1826, c. 170. By its return, a school committee was required to report annually on a number of topics, including: the amount spent the preceding year \u201cfor the instruction of youth\u201d; the number of pupils in the town (divided into three, groups \u2014 those under seven, those between seven and fourteen, and those over fourteen years of age); the number of pupils between seven and fourteen years old, if any, who do not attend school; and the number of persons over fourteen and under twenty-one \u201cwho have had a right to education in the public schools in this Commonwealth, who are unable to read or write.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>In 1827, the Legislature repealed the existing statutes and enacted a new comprehensive school law. St. 1827, c. 143. The 1827 statute consolidated, amended, and added to the previous school provisions. Thus, it required each town or district to maintain schools to teach specified subjects for specified periods of time, according to the number of inhabitants in the town or district (St. 1827, c. 143, \u00a7 1); authorized \u2014 but did not require \u2014 towns to subdivide into districts for school purposes <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 2); enjoined teachers to instruct youth in the virtues \u201cupon which the Republican Constitution is founded\u201d <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 3); \u201cauthorized, empowered and directed\u201d the towns to raise money for the support of schools <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 4); mandated the election of a school committee in each town and specified the duties of school committees <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 5)<footnotemark>68</footnotemark>; mandated the creation of \u201cprudential\u201d committees in towns subdivided into districts, and specified their duties <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 6)<footnotemark>69</footnotemark>; instituted a system for providing students with school books <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 7)<footnotemark>70</footnotemark>; required the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>school committees to make annual reports to the Secretary of the Commonwealth <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9)<footnotemark>71</footnotemark>; empowered the towns or districts within the towns to raise money to build, repair, or purchase a school house (and to purchase land) <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 10); prescribed a school district taxing system <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12, 13); specified the procedures by which meetings in the districts were to be called <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 14); granted the towns certain powers over the districts <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 16, 17); made each school district in the Commonwealth \u201ca body corporate\u201d with specified powers and liabilities <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 17); and, last, prescribed penalties for a town\u2019s refusal to raise money for the support of schools or to choose a school committee or prudential committees, and directed that such penalties were to be used for the support of schools in the town <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 19).<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In 1834, the Legislature created the \u201cMassachusetts School Fund,\u201d a \u201cpermanent fund for the aid and encouragement of common schools.\u201d St. 1834, c. 169, \u00a7 1. Public monies from two sources were appropriated to create the fund: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>monies from the sale of public lands in Maine,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> and monies recovered by the State in its claim against the United States for military services rendered. The same year the Legislature created this State-wide fund for the support of public schools, Governor Davis addressed the Legislature on the topic of public education. Echoing the themes which had animated the framers of the Constitution and the first legislators and magistrates of the Commonwealth, he declared that the people of Massachusetts owed the early colonial settlers \u201ca debt of never ending gratitude for establishing free schools to be maintained at the public expense,\u201d and he continued: \u201cThe great wisdom evinced in thus boldly striking out a course of public policy which required the rich to aid in educating the poor, and which is rapidly tending to revolutionize the world, has not been wasted upon their posterity, for free schools have ever since been cherished and maintained as the nurseries of virtue and liberty. So deeply imbued with this attachment was the public mind when the Constitution of the State was framed, that one of its sections, in language of singular beauty, enjoins on those who administer the government the duty of promoting the diffusion of knowledge as the basis of civil liberty.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>3.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Statements by legislators and magistrates made long after the adoption of the Constitution, unlike those made at the time of the Constitution\u2019s adoption or shortly thereafter, have little probative value as indications of the contemporary understanding of the Constitution in 1780. Despite this limitation, however, we note here the statements of a 1919 Report of the Special Commission on Education, because of their pertinence to the precise issues in this case. The special commission was created by resolve of the General Court and was composed of members of the Legislature and appointees of the Governor. The special commission was charged with investigating the State\u2019s educational systems and making recommendations for the \u201cproper co-ordination of public education within the commonwealth.\u201d Its work resulted in the enactment of An Act to provide for the distribution of a portion of the income tax, and of the income of the Massachusetts school fund, for the purpose of improving the public schools, St. 1919, c. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The special commission found wide disparities in the educational opportunities available to students across the State and stated: \u201cTo the reader of this report who takes comfort in the thought that his city or town is now taxing for maintenance of schools all it can possibly afford, and is on the whole doing pretty well by its unfortunates ... it would be a rather disconcerting revelation to visit the poorer cities, the struggling towns and sparsely settled rural sections of the State, and see how large a number of boys and girls of the Commonwealth are being denied the equal opportunity for an education which chapter V, section II, of the Massachu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>setts Constitution guarantees.\u201d Report of the Special Commission 27 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The special commission recommended the creation of a general school fund in the Commonwealth, supported by income tax, which would be \u201cdistributed to all cities and towns so as to assist them in supporting education and equalizing educational opportunities.\u201d Report of the Special Commission, <em>supra </em>at 20. See <em>id. </em>at 54-57.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> In addition, the special commission recommended a new formula for distributing the income of the Massachusetts School Fund which \u201ctakes into consideration the actual needs of the town and its valuation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. See <em>id. </em>at 57-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The special commission did not mince words in describing the need for these measures: \u201c[N]o state probably can show a greater diversity among the towns and cities with respect to their financial ability to maintain schools [than Massachusetts], and no state can produce a social and industrial situation that makes more necessary a high level of general education throughout all communities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. The Report described the early commitment to public education in Massachusetts and noted that \u201c[i]n earlier days, when wealth was more evenly distributed over the State, the system [of local funding] was not seen at its worst.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. Now, however, the need for \u201cequalizing educational opportunity\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 29) across the towns was acute: \u201c[W]hile Massachusetts has some of the best schools in the country, she also has some of the poorest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. Lastly, the Commission gave its view that \u201c[t]he excellence of schools depends in large measure upon the amount of money spent upon them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>E.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In none of our prior cases have we had occasion to consider whether Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, imposes a duty on \u201clegislatures and magistrates\u201d to provide an adequate education to the young people of the State. Our cases are, however, consistent with the view that the section imposes such a duty. In a series of cases, this court has held that various actions of the Legislature accorded with the \u201cduty\u201d imposed on it by Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, and has characterized the duty as the \u201cpublic obligation to provide for general education.\u201d <em>Nicholls </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; School Comm. of Lynn, </em>297 Mass. 65, 68 (1937). There we stated: \u201cIn the performance of the obligation thus imposed on the Commonwealth\u201d by Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, it was \u201cwithin the competency of the General Court\u201d to enact a statute \u201crequiring the flag salute and the pledge of allegiance\u201d in the public schools. <em>Id. </em>at 69. In <em>Antell </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>287 Mass. 103, 105-106 (1934), we declared: \u201cEducation of youth was provided at public expense and with anxious solicitude through the colonial and provincial periods of our history. The duty to maintain and cherish public schools was declared in the Constitution, c. 5, \u00a7 2.\u201d Further, we noted that the General Court had taken \u201cjealous care\u201d to clothe \u201cmunicipal officers with adequate authority to encourage the highest practicable efficiency of the system of public education,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 106; and, that, therefore, the Haverhill school committee was fully empowered to issue and enforce a rule forbidding public high school students from participating in secret societies. Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Interstate Consol. St. Ry., </em>187 Mass. 436 (1905), aff'd, 207 U.S. 79 (1907), the court declared that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution \u201cjustified\u201d the Legislature\u2019s passage of a statute requiring street railway companies to transport public school children to and from school at half fare: \u201cThe duty of legislatures and magistrates to be diligent in the promotion of education, among all the people, is specially declared in c. 5, \u00a7 2,\u201d and the statute at issue \u201cmerely gives help to [the] pupils in connection with their acquisition of knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439. See <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>12 Allen 500, 503 (1866) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>(in accepting a grant of Federal lands to be used for an agricultural college in the State, \u201cthe legislature not only acted strictly within its constitutional authority, but also in accordance with the duty enjoined upon it by an express provision of the constitution, c. 5, \u00a7 2\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Moreover, in <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>317 Mass. 73 (1944), in the course of holding that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, does <em>not </em>require the Commonwealth to provide free education in State teachers colleges, the court stated in effect that the provision <em>does </em>require the Commonwealth to provide free education in the elementary and secondary public schools: \u201cThere is nothing in the contention of the plaintiffs that [Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2] provides for free education <em>not only </em>in common schools but also in higher institutions of learning such as teachers colleges\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 76. \u201c \u2018Common schools\u2019 or \u2018public schools,\u2019 \u201d we stated, \u201cembrace only the grade schools and high schools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Much earlier, in <em>Jenkins </em>v. Andover, 103 Mass. 94, 97 (1869), the court wrote that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, \u201crequires the legislature and the magistrates, among other things, to \u2018cherish\u2019 \u2018public schools and grammar schools in the towns,\u2019 \u201d and that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, \u201cclearly refer[s] to the [system of common schools], and solemnly testifies] to their importance in maintaining a system of popular government, which shall secure not only peace and order, but individual freedom and elevation of character.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> More recently, in <em>Care &amp; Protection of Charles, </em>399 Mass. 324, 335 (1987), in balancing the rights of parents to educate their children at home against the State\u2019s interest in educating its young citizens, we held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, \u201cproclaims the State\u2019s interest in ensuring that its citizens are educated.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>77</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The defendants place considerable weight on <em>Cushing </em>v. <em>Newburyport, </em>10 Met. 508 (1846). In <em>Cushing, </em>the question was whether the power of towns to tax themselves to support schools was limited to the power to raise money to support only the number and type of schools which they were required by State statute (Rev. Sts. [1836] c. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6) to maintain, or whether they could tax themselves to support additional schools. The court held that the statute requiring towns to maintain a specified number of schools merely set a minimum on the number of schools the town could maintain, and that the towns could tax themselves to support more schools than they were <em>required </em>to maintain. While the case involved a matter of statutory interpretation, the court interpreted the statutes \u201cunder the strong light cast upon them by the just, and liberal, and enlightened views of the founders of our Commonwealth, in the state constitution, c. 5 , \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>Cushing, supra </em>at 511. The court stated that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, \u201cannounce[s], in clear and energetic terms, the object of that constitution to establish a free government sustained by an enlightened, intelligent and educated people; that this should extend, as far as practicable, to all classes of the people; and for this purpose it is made the duty of the legislature who make the laws, and of the magistrates who may expound them, to cherish the interests of literature (among other means) by public schools and grammar schools, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>towns.\u201d <em>Cushing, supra </em>at 512. Under this \u201cstrong light,\u201d the court determined that the towns were free to raise money to support more schools than they were, by statute, required to maintain, provided, however, that schools were <em>\u201ctown </em>schools and designed for general education of all the people\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Cushing, supra </em>at 513.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We perceive nothing in either the logic or the holding of <em>Cushing </em>to support the defendant education officials\u2019 argument that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, does not impose a duty on \u201clegislatures and magistrates\u201d to provide for the education of the children of the Commonwealth. To the contrary, the decision that the statutes permitted the towns to raise money for schools beyond those which they were expressly required to maintain as long as the additional schools were \u201cdesigned for the general education of <em>all </em>the people\u201d supports the argument that the Constitution requires Legislatures and magistrates to provide for the education of the people \u2014 <em>all </em>the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Nor are we detained by our decision in <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>358 Mass. 94 (1970). There, we held that Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution afforded Suffolk University no special exemption, as an educational institution, from the Boston Zoning Code. While we stated in that case that the Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2, \u201chas never been cited as a constitutional command forbidding or requiring specific legislative action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 104, our holding was limited to the determination that the. section had no force in the zoning controversy before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>F.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We have reviewed at great length the history of public education in Massachusetts so that we might glean an understanding of the meaning of c. 5, \u00a7 2. In doing so, we have considered the history of the colony and the province, the condition and concepts relating to education underlying the drafting of the Constitution of the Commonwealth and, in particular, c. 5, \u00a7 2. We have examined the intention of the framers, the language and the structure of the Constitution, the ratification process by the towns and also the words, acts, and deeds of contemporaries of that time, and, especially the views, addresses, and statutes of early Governors (magistrates) and the Legislatures. In this light, we have considered the proper meaning of the words \u201cduty\u201d and \u201ccherish\u201d found in c. 5, \u00a7 2. What emerges from this review is that the words are not merely aspirational or hortatory, but obligatory. What emerges also is that the Commonwealth has a duty to provide an education for <em>all </em>its children, rich and poor, in every city and town of the Commonwealth at the public school level, and that this duty is designed not only to serve the interests of the children, but, more fundamentally, to prepare them to participate as free citizens of a free State to meet the needs and interests of a republican government, namely the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">This duty lies squarely on the executive (magistrates) and legislative (Legislatures) branches of this Commonwealth. That local control and fiscal support has been placed in greater or lesser measure through our history on local governments does not dilute the validity of this conclusion. While it is clearly within the power of the Commonwealth to delegate some of the implementation of the duty to local governments, such power does not include a right to abdicate the obligation imposed on magistrates and Legislatures placed on them by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We now turn to the remaining questions before us. In so doing, we consider briefly the statutory structures pertaining to the administration of the public schools and to the funding schemes presently utilized. Ultimately, we must decide two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>additional fundamental questions. First, what does the constitutional mandate entail? Second, on this record is that mandate being violated?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We shall then conclude by a brief discussion of what remedies may be appropriate for this court to require.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">We turn now to a description of the statutory schemes pertaining to the present interrelationship of the State and local governments in regard to education in the public schools. Much of what we shall set forth is a reprise of the long history of this Commonwealth, as we have already described it. Having concluded that the duty to educate is an enforceable one which rests on the Commonwealth, we describe the administrative and financial schemes as they presently exist. This we deem necessary so we may determine whether the duty we have described is being violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">1. <em>Administrative structure of the Commonwealth\u2019s public school system. </em>The Legislature has enacted a complex of statutes that identify, assign, and mandate various responsibilities related to public education. See generally G. L. c. 15; G. L. c. 69; G. L. c. 76. While we do not purport to canvass all the statutes, we note here briefly the broad outlines of the existing legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">The requirement to maintain public schools is assigned to the towns and cities of the Commonwealth: Every town or city in the Commonwealth is required to maintain \u201ca sufficient number of schools for the instruction of all children who may legally attend a public school therein.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 4 (requiring towns of 500 householders or more to maintain a high school, unless exempted). Towns and cities must \u201cprovide and maintain a sufficient number of schoolhouses, properly furnished and conveniently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>situated for the accommodation of all children therein entitled to attend the public schools.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 68. Two or more towns or cities may join together to form a regional school district to meet these responsibilities. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">\u201cGeneral charge\u201d of the public schools in each town, city, or regional school district is assigned to a locally elected school committee in each community. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37. The Legislature has identified and mandated the specific duties and powers of the school committees. See, e.g., G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 37-67. These include the appointment of a superintendent of schools (G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 59, 59A), principals for each of the schools in the district (G. L. c 71, \u00a7 59B), and teachers and aides (G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38). In addition to hiring decisions, the school committees are charged with compensation, tenure, and removal decisions. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">To guide and oversee public education in the schools and to set State-wide policy and requirements, the Legislature has created State administrative structures. The Board of Education (board), which dates from 1837,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> was created to \u201csupport, serve, and plan general education in the public schools.\u201d G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 1G, first par. See G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 IE. The Legislature has charged the board with a range of broad planning, support and coordination responsibilities,<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> educa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tian standard setting duties,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> duties regarding State aid to schools,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> and numerous other powers and responsibilities which are specified in provisions throughout, inter alla, G. L. c. 15, c. 71, c. 71A, c. 71B, c. 72, and c. 76.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The Legislature has also created a Department of Education, which is under the supervision and control of the board (G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 1), and is headed by the Commissioner of Education. The Commissioner serves as the board\u2019s secretary and chief executive officer and as the chief State officer for elementary and secondary education. G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 IF. The Commissioner has \u201csupervision of all educational work supported in whole or in part by the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1. The board is charged with establishing divisions in the areas of curriculum and instruction, administration and personnel, research and development, school facilities and related services, State and Federal assistance, occupa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tional education, special education, and educational personnel. G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 IF, first par. The Legislature has also created an advisory council on education; the council\u2019s purpose is \u201cto recommend policies designed to improve the performance of all public education systems in the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 1H. The council is charged with the duty, among others, to \u201crecommend such policies as will promote and facilitate coordination, effectiveness and efficiency in the operation of all public education systems in the commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In addition to identifying, assigning, and mandating responsibilities related to public education, the Legislature has itself addressed numerous issues concerning public education. Thus, for example, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, mandate basic curriculum requirements in the schools<footnotemark>85</footnotemark>; G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, contains- compulsory school attendance requirements; G. L. c. 71A addresses transitional bilingual education; G. L. c. 7IB concerns special education programs for children with special needs; and G. L. c. 74 addresses vocational education.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">As this brief sketch of the statutes demonstrates, the Legislature has recognized its constitutional duty to provide for the education of the populace. Whether what the Legislature has done is sufficient to fulfil that constitutional duty is, of course, another matter. We recognize, however, that the details of implementation of such a duty are best left, at least initially, to the executive and to the legislative branches of government. Thus, it is generally within the domain of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>\u201clegislatures and magistrates\u201d to determine how they will fulfil their duty under Part II, c. 5, \u00a7 2. In fulfilment of their duty, they may, as they have done, assign some responsibilities for education to the local communities of the Commonwealth. At all times, however, the ultimate responsibility for educating the public belongs to the \u201clegislatures and magistrates.\u201d If the mandate of the Constitution is not met, or if a statutory structure which worked at one time no longer works, the responsibility for the failure to educate falls squarely on the Commonwealth, specifically the \u201clegislatures and magistrates.\u201d They may delegate, but they may not abdicate, their constitutional duty. \u201cWithout in any way attempting to invade the rightful province of the Legislature to conduct its own business, we have the duty, certainly since <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 178 (1803), to adjudicate a claim that a law and the actions undertaken pursuant to that law conflict with [or fall short of] the requirements of the Constitution. \u2018This,\u2019 in the words of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, \u2018is of the very essence of judicial duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colo </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>378 Mass. 550, 553 (1979). See <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>382 Mass. 629, 642 (1981). See also <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 244 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">2. <em>The public school funding scheme. </em>As presently constituted, funding for the public schools comes from three sources: local monies, State monies, and Federal monies. Federal monies account for only four to five per cent of the total expenditures, and are generally targeted for specific programs. Local monies are monies assessed, collected, and used locally. The main source of local funds is the local property tax. General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 34, provides that \u201c[e]very city and town shall annually provide an amount of money sufficient for the support of the public schools as required by [c. 71], provided, however, that no\" city or town shall be required to provide more money for the support of the public schools than is appropriated by vote of the legislative body of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the city or town.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> In each town or city, the school committee prepares an annual budget request for the schools, which the local appropriating authority then votes on, along with requests to appropriate funds for a wide variety of municipal services such as police and fire protection and public health. See generally regarding cities G. L. c. 44, \u00a7 31A (submission to mayor); G. L. c. 44, \u00a7 32 (submission from mayor to city council and vote by city council); regarding towns G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 59 (submission to appropriation, advisory, or finance committee); G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 60; G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 16 (town budget prepared and made available to town inhabitants); G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 5 (town meeting vote on town budget).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The setting of local property tax rates is a complex process involving both local and State officials. See generally <em>An-drade </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>406 Mass. 337, 340-341 (1989). Local tax rates must be approved by the Commissioner of Revenue, and no local rate is fixed until such approval is obtained. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 21D and 23. General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 21C <em>(b), </em>inserted by the initiative proposal known as \u201cProposition 2\u2019/a,\u201d limits the amount of local taxes which any city or town may assess in a given fiscal year to two and one-half per cent of the full and fair cash valuation of the real and personal property in such city or town. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 215 (1981). While the local appropriating authority may seek voter approval to appropriate specified amounts above the two and one-half per cent limit for specified purposes, a two-thirds vote of the voters at a general election is required for such an \u201coverride.\u201d See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 21C; <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 216. The Commissioner of Revenue is responsible for determining the total limit on local taxes for each of the Commonwealth\u2019s towns and cities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>and may not approve a tax rate for any city or town which would \u201callow the amount of property taxes levied to exceed the limit\u201d on local taxes. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 21D.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The second source of funds for public schools is \u201cState aid.\u201d General Laws c. 70 specifies a formula for determining the amount of State aid to be granted annually to each town or city (\u00a7\u00a7 2-6) and states that the \u201cpurpose of the financial assistance provided by this chapter shall be to promote the equalization of educational opportunity in the public schools of the commonwealth, to reduce the reliance upon the local property tax in financing public schools, and to promote the equalization of the burden of the cost of school support to the respective cities, towns, regional school districts and independent vocational schools.\u201d G. L. c. 70, \u00a7 1. The parties have stipulated, however, that since 1984, State aid to schools has not been determined according to the c. 70 formula, but instead through the annual appropriations process.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In addition to the annual appropriation of State aid (which \u2014 even though it is no longer determined according to c. 70 \u2014 is termed \u201cChapter 70 Aid\u201d and \u201cAdditional Assistance\u201d), some municipalities receive additional State monies through the equal educational opportunity grant program. See G. L. c. 70A.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> \u201cThe purpose of the equal educational opportunity grant... is to accelerate the achievement of the objectives set forth in [G. L. c. 70, \u00a7 1] . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 70A, \u00a7 1. Under G. L. c. 70A, as enacted, grants are to be awarded to towns and cities whose total direct service ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>penditures on schools (combining local and State funds) are less than eighty-five per cent of the State average of such expenditures (the average of all the towns and cities of the Commonwealth). See G. L. c. 70A, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5. For six years, starting in 1985, such towns and cities were to be awarded one-sixth of the difference between the eighty-five per cent figure and their actual expenditure. <em>Id. </em>The parties have stipulated that in fiscal year 1991, local aid (including both \u201cChapter 70 Aid\u201d and the equal educational opportunity grants) was reduced by four per cent, and in fiscal year 1992, the same was reduced by twenty per cent. In addition, in fiscal year 1992, emergency funding legislation was enacted. St. 1991, c. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The defendants argue before us that, if one looks to the administrative and financing schemes now in effect, that one must conclude, even if a constitutional duty is found, that the defendants are meeting their constitutional mandate. We disagree. The essential facts are not in dispute and we are entitled to draw our own proper inferences from them. We need not conclude that equal expenditure per pupil is mandated or required, although it is clear that financial disparities exist in regard to education in the various communities. It is also clear, however, that fiscal support, or the lack of it, has a significant impact on the quality of education each child may receive. Additionally, the record shows clearly that, while the present statutory and financial schemes purport to provide equal educational opportunity in the public schools for every child, rich or poor, the reality is that children in the less affluent communities (or in the less affluent parts of them) are not receiving their constitutional entitlement of education as intended and mandated by the framers of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">For this conclusion, we need look no further than the parties\u2019 stipulations and the record appendix to conclude that the Commonwealth has failed to meet its constitutional obligation. In these documents, which include extensive stipulations, reports, and affidavits of education professionals (some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>of them defendants or former defendants in this case), we find statement after statement recounting the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to educate the children in the plaintiffs\u2019 schools and those they typify. The Commonwealth has not directed us to, nor have we discovered, any statements in the record tending to show otherwise. We briefly review the relevant portions of the record.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In their 1991 Report of the Committee on Distressed School Systems and School Reform, the defendant members of the board speak of a \u201cstate of emergency due to grossly inadequate financial support,\u201d and admit that \u201c[c]ertain classrooms simply warehouse children at this time, with no effective education being provided.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Arguably, this admission, by itself, suffices to establish the constitutional violations, but there is more. Harold Raynolds, Jr., the former Commissioner of Education (and a former defendant) has stated that \u201c[i]n many of the communities in Massachusetts, particularly less affluent communities such as the ones in which the plaintiffs attend school, Massachusetts is failing \u2014 and failing more than ever before \u2014 to achieve [the] goal [of providing every child with an opportunity for success in learning].\u201d Peter Finn, the Executive Director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, affirms that \u201c[i]t is also clear that the education now offered in many of the poor communities, including the communities in which the plaintiffs attend school, is inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The parties have stipulated to the opinions of the superintendents of four of the plaintiffs\u2019 districts, which describe in some detail the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to educate the children in those districts. The parties have stipulated that the conditions in these schools are \u201ctypical\u201d of the schools in the other twelve communities in which plaintiffs attend school. The superintendent in Brockton is of the opinion that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Brockton Public Schools are unable to provide the programs, services and personnel that are necessary to meet the needs of its students\u201d; that \u201cBrockton is not adequately teaching its students to read\u201d; that \u201cshortcomings in the history and social studies programs in the Brockton public schools . . . have severely undercut the system\u2019s capacity to educate its students to understand the society in which they live and to help students become enlightened participants in the democratic process as they become adults.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The superintendent of the Leicester public schools states that \u201cthe Leicester public school system does not provide an adequate education to its students\u201d; that class sizes in the third, fourth, and fifth grades in Leicester are \u201ctoo large to provide the amount of individual attention and instruction needed by elementary students\u201d; that guidance services in the schools \u201care inadequate and seriously jeopardize the future of [Leicester\u2019s] students\u201d; that administrative support and management are \u201cinadequate\u201d; and that \u201cmost of the Leicester schools are in a terrible condition and that the high school is an extremely unsafe building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The superintendent of the Lowell public schools states that class sizes in Lowell are \u201ctoo large for teachers to be effective with elementary level students\u201d; that the \u201clow level of guidance offered in the Lowell public schools is inadequate to meet the needs of even an average suburban system, let alone the extreme needs of a system such as Lowell, with its unusually diverse population and large percentage of at-risk students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Lastly, the parties stipulated that the superintendent of the Winchendon public schools is of the opinion that Winchendon \u201ctends to end up with inexperienced and poor quality teachers\u201d; that \u201cthere are not enough offerings for advanced students\u201d; that \u201cthe science facilities are also poor, the textbooks are outdated and the middle school labs antiquated\u201d and that \u201cWinchendon is unable to provide an adequate science education for today\u2019s world to its students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The parties have stipulated that students in the plaintiffs\u2019 districts are offered \u201csignificantly fewer educational opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>nities and lower educational quality than\u201d students in the schools in the \u201ccomparison\u201d districts of Brookline, Concord, and Wellesley. The stipulations outline specific deficiencies in the plaintiffs\u2019 schools, such as: large classes; reductions in staff; inadequate teaching of basic subjects including reading, writing, science, social studies, mathematics, computers, and other areas; neglected libraries; inability to attract and retain high quality teachers; lack of teacher training; lack of curriculum development; lack of predictable funding; administrative reductions; and inadequate guidance counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In contrast, the comparison districts are able to offer \u201csignificantly greater educational opportunities,\u201d including: multi-faceted reading programs; extensive writing programs and resources; thorough computer instruction; active curriculum development and review ensuring comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum; extensive teacher training and development; comprehensive student services; and a wide variety of courses in visual and performing arts. In short, the record indicates that these districts are able to educate their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">It is clear that c. 5, \u00a7 2, obligates the Commonwealth to educate <em>all </em>its children. The bleak portrait of the plaintiffs\u2019 schools and those they typify, painted in large part by the defendants\u2019 own statements and about which no lack of consensus has been shown, leads us to conclude that the Commonwealth has failed to fulfil its obligation.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The crux of the Commonwealth\u2019s duty lies in its obligation to educate all of its children. As has been done by the courts of some of our sister States, we shall articulate broad guidelines and assume that the Commonwealth will fulfil its duty to remedy the constitutional violations that we have identified. The guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court of Kentucky fairly reflect our view of the matter and are consistent with the judicial pronouncements found in other decisions. An educated child must possess \u201cat least the seven following capabilities: (i) sufficient oral and written communication skills to enable students to function in a complex and rapidly changing civilization; (ii) sufficient knowledge of economic, social, and political systems to enable students to make informed choices; (iii) sufficient understanding of governmental processes to enable the student to understand the issues that affect his or her community, state, and nation; (iv) sufficient self-knowledge and knowledge of his or her mental and physical wellness; (v) sufficient grounding in the arts to enable each student to appreciate his or her cultural and historical heritage; (vi) sufficient training or preparation for advanced training in either academic or vocational fields so as to enable each child to choose and pursue life work intelligently; and (vii) sufficient level of academic or vocational skills to enable public school students to compete favorably with their counterparts in surrounding states, in academics or in the job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>market.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Council for Better Educ., Inc., </em>790 S.W.2d 186, 212 (Ky. 1989).<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">These guidelines accord with our Constitution\u2019s emphasis on educating our children to become free citizens on whom the Commonwealth may rely to meet its needs and to further its interests. As Horace Mann, the first secretary of the Board of Education, stated many years ago: \u201cIn regard to the application of this principle of natural law, \u2014 that is, in regard to the extent of the education to be provided for all, at the public expense, \u2014 some differences of opinion may fairly exist, under different political organizations; but under our republican government, it seems clear that the minimum of this education can never be less than such as is sufficient to qualify each citizen for the civil and social duties he will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>be called to discharge;\u2014 such an education as teaches the individual the great laws of bodily health; as qualifies for the fulfilment of parental duties; as is indispensable for the civil functions of a witness or a juror; as is necessary for the voter in municipal and in national affairs; and finally, as is requisite for the faithful and conscientious discharge of all those duties which devolve upon the inheritor of a portion of the sovereignty of this great republic.\u201d The Massachusetts System of Common Schools: Tenth Annual Report of the Massachusetts Board of Education 17 (1849).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The content of the duty to educate which the Constitution places on the Commonwealth necessarily will evolve together with our society. Our Constitution, and its education clause, must be interpreted \u201cin accordance with the demands of modern society or it will be in constant danger of becoming atrophied and, in fact, may even lose its original meaning.\u201d <em>Seattle Sch. Dist. No.1 </em>v. <em>State, </em>90 Wash. 2d 476, 516 (1978). Justice Holmes aptly captured this principle of constitutional jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201c[Wjhen we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters.

It shall be declared also that the constitutional duty is not being currently fulfilled by the Commonwealth. Additionally, while local governments may be required, in part, to support public schools, it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to take such steps as may be required in each instance effectively to devise a plan and sources of funds sufficient to meet the constitutional mandate. No present statutory enactment is to be declared unconstitutional, but the single justice may, in his or her discretion, retain jurisdiction to determine whether, within a reasonable time, appropriate legislative action has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The plaintiffs through their next friends sued, among others, the Governor, the Department of Education, the Commissioner of Education, the\u2019 Treasurer and Receiver General, and the Board of Education.

We decline to enter into this aspect of the debate. To us the words \u201cadequate\u201d and \u201ceducation\u201d can be viewed as redundant as well as contradictory. E.H. Filene, a noted businessman, has stated: \u201cWhen a man\u2019s education is finished, he is finished.\u201d Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens) once stated: \u201cI have never let my schooling interfere with my education.\u201d The American Heritage (Electronic) Dictionary defines \u201ceducation\u201d as \u201cthe knowledge or skills obtained,\u201d and \u201cadequate\u201d as either \u201cable to satisfy a requirement\u201d or \u201cbarely satisfactory; mediocre.\u201d Synonyms for adequate (Roget\u2019s II Electronic Thesaurus) are: \u201csufficient,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d \u201ccompetent,\u201d or \u201cenough.\u201d Synonyms for \u201ceducation\u201d range from \u201cscience\u201d to \u201cknowledge\u201d to \u201cerudition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The word \u201cadequate\u201d does not appear in the constitutional language and the struggle of the parties reveals, with good faith on all sides, necessary biases as to meaning.

For the reasons just discussed, this argument is unpersuasive; we believe that the placement of the education provisions in Part II, The Frame of Government, is a forceful statement that education is both a duty of and a prerequisite for republican government. And, if \u201clegislatures and magistrates\u201d have a constitutional duty to educate, then members of the Commonwealth have a correlative constitutional right to be educated. See <em>Seattle Sch.

In addition, we note that a constitutional right to an education is fully consistent with the provisions of several articles in the Declaration of Rights: the right to liberty (art. 1), the right of self-government (art. 4), the right to elect officers and to be elected as an officer (art. 9), the right to \u201cobtain right and justice freely\u201d (art. 11), the right to be free from unreasonable searches (art. 14), the right and duty to \u201crequire of . . . lawgivers and magistrates an exact and constant observance of\u2019 the fundamental principles of the Constitution (art. 18), and the right to \u201cassemble to consult upon the common good: give instructions to their representatives, and to request of the legislative body, by the way of addresses, petitions, or remonstrances, redress of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they suffer\u201d (art. 19).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b583-6\">For example, Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, which prescribes the powers and responsibilities of the Legislature does not use the term \u201cduty\u201d; it speaks instead of the grant of \u201cfull power and authority\u201d to the Legislature to enact laws.

The highest courts of some of our sister States have declared their educational systems to violate the education clauses, the equal protection provisions, or both clauses, of their Constitutions: <em>Dupree </em>v. <em>Alma Sch. Dist. No. 30 of Crawford County, </em>279 Ark. 340 (1983); <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest, </em>18 Cal. 3d 728 (1976), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907 (1977); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615 (1977); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Council for Better Educ., Inc., </em>790 S.W.2d 186 (Ky. 1989); <em>Helena Elementary Sch.

While we do not undertake a comprehensive review of these cases, we note that several decisions relied on constitutional language and history less explicit than ours.

Ultimately, however, these courts left the task of defining the specifics of their State\u2019s educational systems to their legislative and administrative bodies. For example, the Supreme Court of Washington declared specific portions of that State\u2019s education funding scheme unconstitutional and went on to declare broad guidelines with respect to the nature of the State\u2019s constitutional duty to educate children. Nonetheless, the Washington court made clear that the legislative branch had the responsibility to \u201cdefine and give substantive content\u201d to education. See <em>Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, supra. </em>Similarly, the Supreme Court of Texas held that that State\u2019s Constitution \u201cdoes not allow concentrations of resources in property-rich school districts that are taxing low when property-poor districts that are taxing high cannot generate sufficient revenues to meet even minimum standards [of education] .... [Districts must have substantially equal access to similar revenues per pupil at similar levels of tax effort.\u201d <em>Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist., supra </em>at 397. In spite of this relatively specific holding, the Texas court declared that it did not \u201cinstruct the legislature as to the specifics of the legislation it should enact; nor do we order it to raise taxes. The legislature has primary responsibility to decide how best to achieve an efficient system. We decide only the nature of the constitutional mandate and whether that mandate has been met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">As did these courts, we have declared today the nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s duty to educate its children. We have concluded the current state of affairs falls short of the constitutional mandate. We shall presume at this time that the Commonwealth will fulfil its responsibility with respect to defining the specifics and the appropriate means to provide the constitutionally-required education.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b637-7\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"abj-dedup-0\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part). I agree with the court that \u201cthe Commonwealth has a duty to provide an education for <em>all </em>its children, rich and poor, in every city and town of the Commonwealth at the public school level, and that this duty is designed not only to serve the interests of the children, but, more fundamentally, to prepare them to participate as free citizens of a free State to meet the needs and interests of a republican government, namely the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Ante </em>at 606. I also agree that an educational program that is reasonably calculated to provide the children of the Commonwealth with the capabilities set forth in the Supreme Court of Kentucky\u2019s guidelines <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>Council for Better Educ., Inc., </em>790 S.W.2d 186, 212 [Ky. 1989]), would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>satisfy the constitutional mandate. <em>Ante </em>at 618-619. I do not agree, however, that the record establishes that the Commonwealth has failed to provide public education in keeping with those guidelines. Therefore, I do not agree that the plaintiffs have proved that the defendants have violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional entitlement to an education.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In support of its conclusion that children in the Commonwealth\u2019s less affluent communities or parts of communities are not receiving the education to which they are constitutionally entitled, the court states that it \u201cneed look no further than the parties\u2019 stipulations and the record appendix.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 614. Specifically, the court appears to rely on a 1991 report of the Board of Education, <em>ante </em>at 552, a 1991 report of the Massachusetts Business Alliance for Education, <em>ante </em>at 553, the affidavit of Harold Raynolds, former Commissioner of Education, the affidavit of Peter Finn, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, and the affidavit of Rosanne Bacon, former president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, <em>ante </em>at 553. In addition, it appears that the court relies on the parties\u2019 stipulation \u201cto the opinions of the superintendents of four of the plaintiffs\u2019 districts.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 615-616. The reports and' affidavits identified by the court are contained in a joint appendix filed by the parties and they set forth the opinions of various individuals. For example, the court notes that the 1991 Board of Education Report of the Committee on Distressed School Systems and School Reform, speaks of a \u201cstate of emergency due to grossly inadequate financial support,\u201d and states that \u201c[cjertain classrooms simply warehouse children . . . with no effective education being provided.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 615. The court also points to the affidavits of Harold Raynolds, Jr., and Peter Finn expressing the affiants\u2019 view that education in many poor communities is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In deciding whether the plaintiffs have established that their constitutional rights have been violated, it is critically important to understand that (1) the opinions contained in the aforementioned reports and affidavits do not purport to employ the Supreme Court of Kentucky guidelines <em>{Rose, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>supra) </em>or any other articulable standards of educational adequacy, and (2) the parties have not stipulated to the truth of any assertion or to the validity of any opinion stated in the reports and affidavits. The mere inclusion of those documents in a jointly filed appendix establishes nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In addition to the aforementioned reports and affidavits, the court focuses on the opinions of four superintendents of schools. <em>Ante </em>at 615-616. The court states that \u201c[t]he parties have stipulated to the opinions of the superintendents of four of the plaintiffs\u2019 districts, which describe in some detail the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to educate the children in those districts.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 615. The court\u2019s opinion sets forth relevant portions of those opinions. The tenor of the superintendents\u2019 opinions is fairly illustrated by the stated views of the superintendent of the Brockton public schools that \u201cthe Brockton Public Schools are unable to provide the programs, services and personnel that are necessary to meet the needs of its students,\u201d and \u201cBrockton is not adequately teaching its students to read.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 616. Just as it is important to understand that the parties have not stipulated to the merit or validity of the opinions expressed in the reports and affidavits included in the joint appendix, it is also important to understand that, although the parties \u201chave stipulated to the opinions of the superintendents of four of the plaintiffs\u2019 districts,\u201d as the court says, <em>ante </em>at 615, they have done so only in the sense that they have agreed that the stated opinions are indeed the four superintendents\u2019 opinions and the superintendents are competent to render them. The parties have not stipulated to the merit or correctness of the opinions. On the contrary, in a supplemental stipulation, the parties have expressly agreed that \u201cthere is no consensus among education experts as to what constitutes an adequate education.\u201d Therefore, whether standing alone or in conjunction with the reports and affidavits discussed by the court, the superintendents\u2019 opinions do not establish any constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The court states: \u201cThe parties have stipulated that students in the plaintiffs\u2019 districts are offered \u2018significantly fewer educational opportunities and lower educational quality than\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>students in the \u2018comparison\u2019 districts of Brookline, Concord, and Wellesley. The stipulations outline specific deficiencies in the plaintiffs\u2019 schools, such as: large classes; reductions in staff; inadequate teaching of basic subjects including reading, writing, science, social studies, mathematics, computers, and other areas; neglected libraries; inability to attract and retain high quality teachers; lack of teacher training; lack of curriculum development; lack of predictable funding; administrative reductions; and inadequate guidance counseling.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 616-617. If that passage is intended to say that the parties have agreed that, in the plaintiffs\u2019 schools, basic subjects such as reading, writing, science, social studies, mathematics, and others are \u201cinadequately\u201d taught, or that the teaching in those subjects does not comply with the Supreme Court of Kentucky guidelines or similar standards, I respectfully disagree with the court. The parties have not stipulated to those facts. Those facts have not been established, and it is of no constitutional significance that more educational opportunities are provided in wealthy communities than in poor ones. Therefore, I am unwilling to join the court insofar as it declares that the defendants or the Commonwealth have failed to fulfil their constitutional obligations.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
