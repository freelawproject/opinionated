Transferred from the May term, 1910, of the superior court by <em>Plummer, </em>J., on an agreed statement of facts,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-11\">August 1, 1907, the plaintiff, Anna Tessier, gave Albina V. Tessier a bond conditioned to convey certain real estate to the latter upon payment of $20,000 therefor in accordance with the terms of the bond, as follows: $800 on the date of the bond and $600 each six months thereafter, with interest upon the unpaid balance at the rate of five per cent per annum. April 1, 1909, the defendants\u2019 assessors taxed the real estate to Albina, who was in possession under the bond, and also taxed the plaintiff for the unpaid balance of the price which Albina was to pay for the property ($19,700), as money at interest. The plaintiff contends that the tax assessed against her is illegal, as there was no money loaned or at interest. The defendants claim that the tax was properly assessed, as the plaintiff was to receive interest on the deferred payments of the purchase price of the property.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-12\"><em>Q-eorge B.

It is not clear from the record as to how the fact may be, but if it is to be ascertained from the construction of the bond the tax should be abated; for if Albina fails to meet the payments as they become due, the plaintiff cannot recover them in an action on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Oase discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b603-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
