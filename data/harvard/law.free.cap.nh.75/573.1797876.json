Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the January term, 1910, of the superior court by <em>Wallace, </em>C. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-13\">As the plaintiff\u2019s servant was driving her team diagonally across Canal street in Nashua, the defendants\u2019 car collided with the wagon and caused the injury complained of. The driver did not see the car until after the collision, but the motorman saw that the team was in danger when the front end of the car was opposite the rear end of the wagon. The car was moving at the rate of four and a half to six feet a second, and the team two thirds as fast.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-14\">The plaintiff was permitted to testify as to certain statements made to her by the defendants\u2019 adjuster, which it was claimed amounted to an admission of liability. The defendants excepted to the admission of this evidence and to the denial of their motion for direction of a verdict in their favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-15\"><em>Wason $ Moran, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-16\"><em>Doyle $ Lucier, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXaI\">The evidence excepted to was competent. <em>Coffin </em>v. Plymouth, 49 N. H. 173. Even if an offer to pay a small sum in settlement of a large demand is as consistent with an intention, to buy peace as with one to admit liability <em>(Colburn </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>66 N. H. 151, 157), it cannot be said that that is the fact when, as in this case, the defendants voluntarily offer to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Since the evidence excepted to was properly admitted, it is unnecessary to consider the defendants\u2019 second exception. But if that were not so the exception would have to be overruled, for it can be found from the testimony of the expert that the motorman could have stopped the car in a second by reversing it; in other words, in time to prevent the accident.- Consequently it can be found that ordinary care on the part of the motorman after he knew the team was in a place of danger would, and like care on the part of the driver after he knew of the approach of the car would not, have prevented the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>Defendants\u2019 exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b604-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
