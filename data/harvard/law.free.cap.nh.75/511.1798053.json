Transferred without ruling from the September term, 1909, of the .superior court by Chamberlin, J., on an agreed statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-12\">The plaintiff agreed to furnish to the defendant coupons to the \u25a0amount of $20,000. The denominations vary, but tbe printed matter on all of them is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u201cGRAND PIANO CONTEST CERTIFICATE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">\u201cSave these certificates.

After the delivery of the property sold the plaintiff bad no control over it, and was in no way connected with the contest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-8\">The defendant contends that the contract is in violation of the laws of the state.

S., <em>e. </em>270, <em>ss. </em>1-5) or by the trading-stamp act (Laws 1905, <em>c. </em>83), or whether the latter act can be sustained. Conceding that it was the purpose of the defendant, known to the plaintiff, to procure the articles sold for use in violation of some valid statute of the state, the plaintiff is still entitled to recover on his contract so long as he himself took no part in the prohibited transaction. The case is not distinguishable frojn <em>Bryson </em>v. Haley, 68 N. H. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff for $228.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-13\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
