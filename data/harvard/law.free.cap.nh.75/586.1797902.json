The appellant received the fund in controversy as trustee under the will of William Stevens.

The trustee excepted to this finding, upon the ground that there was no evidence to support it. As such evidence was found in the manner in which the trust was conducted for a long period and from the relations of the parties, and in letters and oral admissions of the the trustee, the order was,</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b616-12\">Peaslee, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
