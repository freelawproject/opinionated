Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the October term, 1907, of the superior court by <em>Wallace, </em>C. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The land in question is a small lot on the shore of Massabesic lake, with a small cottage upon it, built by one Eaton about 1873. The plaintiff claimed title by deed, and the evidence relied upon tended to prove the following facts: The land in controversy was a part of the farm of Edward P. Offutt, and was in his possession in 1873 and thereafterwards until his death in 1881 or 1882, under title he obtained from one Morrill about 1840. February 1, 1882, Offutt\u2019s heirs conveyed the land to Charles Williams, who was in possession of it until 1899, and whose heirs conveyed it to the city of Manchester on December 18, 1903. In 1897 or 1898, the defendant paid rent for the land to Williams. In 1904, the city demanded $25 of the defendant as rent for the land for one year, which he paid about a week after the demand. The possession upon which the defendant relied was not adverse, and was of the cottage only and not of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">The defendant claimed title by adverse possession, and the evidence upon which he relied tended to show that the land was in the possession of Henry J. Eaton from 1872 until about 1880, and in the possession of the defendant since the latter date, claiming under Eaton; that the possession was adverse, and that the rent paid by the defendant was for another parcel of land, known as the McAllister lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, the plaintiff introduced in evidence tax records of the town of Auburn, where the land is situated, which showed a tax assessed against the defendant and his grantors on \u201c buildings on Williams land,\u201d for a series of years prior to the date of the writ. The plaintiff claimed title under Williams. There was no evidence that the defendant knew of these entries, except that he and his predecessors in title paid the taxes in question and some of the tax receipts given them were for tax \u201c on the cottage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">At the defendant\u2019s request, the jury were instructed as follows: \u201cThe fact, if it was a fact, that the tax assessors of Auburn described this property of Duggan\u2019s as a building on Williams\u2019 land is no evidence whatever that the land was Williams\u2019 and not Duggan\u2019s.\u201d The defendant excepted to a denial of his request for the following instruction: \u201cI instruct you that if the defendant paid rent to Williams or to the city on the lot designated as the McAllister lot, and refused to pay rent on or in respect to the parcel he now claims, and always understood that he was paying thin rent only on the McAllister lot, then this payment was not a waiver of the statute or a recognition of the plaintiff\u2019s title, and your verdict will be for the defendant.\u201d The defendant also excepted to the denial of his motions for a nonsuit and the direction of a verdict in his favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Burnham, Broten, Jones Warren, </em>for tbe plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-5\"><em>Taggart, luttle, Burroughs $ Wyman </em>and <em>David W. Berkins, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b65-6\">Walker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsT\">The finding of the court that the evidence tended to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s theory of title to the land in question is supported by an examination of the evidence. If the assessors\u2019 books showing how the tax was assessed against the defendant are excluded as incompetent and prejudicial, what remains would support a verdict for the plaintiff. If believed, it would prove that the plaintiff\u2019s ancestor in title acquired a deed of a farm in the \u201940\u2019s, known as the Offutt farm, which included the <em>locus; </em>that the subsequent grantees had been in possession of it and cultivated it; and that after the deed to the plaintiff the defendant paid rent to the plaintiff for the occupation of the <em>locus. </em>The motion for a nonsuit was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">If it could not be legally found from the evidence of the assessments that tbe defendant was not the owner of the land, this error was cured when, at the request of the defendant, the court charged that the assessment of the property as a building on \u201c Williams\u2019 land\u201d was \u201cno evidence whatever that the land was Williams\u2019 and not Duggan\u2019s.\u201d Asking for and obtaining that instruction amounted to a waiver of his exception to the evidence. So far as its competency to prove title was concerned, it was expressly excluded from the consideration of the jury, and the presumption is that they did not consider it as evidence of title. The effect of the successful request was the same upon the motion for a non-suit as evidence afterward introduced by a defendant which cures the alleged defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">But it is said the evidence was prejudicial because it impressed upon the minds of the jury the fact that the assessors had for some years determined that the defendant owned merely the building. But in view of the positive instruction it is not apparent how the evidence was prejudicial. Its only relevancy, according to the defendant, was to show that \u201cthis was Williams\u2019 land.\u201d The jury were told, in effect, to give it no weight whatever upon the only point in the case it was calculated to have a bearing upon. If the jury had been told that the evidence was stricken out and that they could not consider it for any purpose, it is not plain how its effect would be more effectually removed than it was by the instruction which was given. Whether the jury in fact considered it in reaching a verdict is a question for the determination of the superior court. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>72 N. H. 101. As the burden is on the excepting party to point out the error com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>mitted, the defendant fails. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Flanders, </em>72 N. H. 11, 12; <em>Staniels </em>v. <em>Whitcher, </em>73 N. H. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The defendant\u2019s second request for instructions was properly-denied. If the defendant did not pay rent to the plaintiff on the lot in question, but on another lot, and always understood the transaction in that way, it does not follow that he was entitled to-a verdict. While he may not have recognized the plaintiff\u2019s title,, or waived any rights he supposed he had to the land, he could not succeed against the true owner without proving to the satisfaction of the jury that he had been in the open, adverse, and exclusive possession of the premises for twenty years at least. The requested instruction was too broad and authorized a verdict for the defendant upon the mere finding that he had not recognized the plaintiff\u2019s title. That would have been manifest error.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled: judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"ANM\">Peaslee, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
