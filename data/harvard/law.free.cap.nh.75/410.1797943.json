Although it was inadmissible against the administrator <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>73 N. H. 122; P. S., <em>c. </em>224, s. 16), it was admissible against the heirs-at-law <em>(Crowley </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>72 N. H. 241) ; for the mere fact that the administrator is a party does not make her testimony incompetent as to them. <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>72 N. H. 433. The bill therefore must be dismissed as to the administrator, but as to the heirs the decree stands; and he will treat her share of the house in settling James\u2019 estate just as he would if James had devised it to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-16\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
