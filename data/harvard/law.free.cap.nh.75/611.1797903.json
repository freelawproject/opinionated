Transferred without a ruling from the May term, 1910, of the superior court by <em>Plummer, </em>J., upon an agreed statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-16\">By the terms of the sale, the title to the piano is in the plaintiffs and is to so remain until it is paid for as stipulated in the contract. At the time of the sale Wright was an innkeeper at Haverhill; and the piano was received by him there for use in his hotel by the guests and his wife, and it had been so used at the time of the attachment. No memorandum of the sale was recorded. The plaintiffs claim that the piano was \u201c household goods,\u201d and that no record was necessary.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b641-17\"><em>Joseph Moore </em>(by brief and orally), for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b641-18\"><em>Burleigh $ Adams (Mr. Adams </em>orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b641-19\">Walker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AINO\">The statute requiring a memorandum of a conditional sale of personal property to be recorded expressly excepts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>from its operation \u201ca lien upon household goods created by alease thereof, containing an option in favor of the lessee to purchase the same at a time specified.\u201d P. S., <em>c. </em>140, s. 23. In <em>Lamb </em>v. King, 73 N. H. 400, it was held that a piano kept for use in a family is an article of \u201c household goods \u201d under this statute. Whether it is so kept for use is obviously a question of fact which the reported case does not disclose. That it might be kept for the use of a landlord\u2019s family in a hotel, as well as in a private house, is too plain for serious discussion. No debatable question of law is raised by the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
