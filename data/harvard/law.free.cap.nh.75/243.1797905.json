The question whether the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad should be charged as trustee was transferred from the May term, 1908, of the superior court by Pike, J. The trustee disclosed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-15\">Q. \u201c Can you state whether or not the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad was indebted to the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway on the first day of January, 1906, and if so, for how much?\u201d A. \u201c It was undoubtedly indebted to the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific road on the first day of January, 1906, but I cannot here and now state the net amount of the indebtedness. The indebtedness between railroads consists not only of traffic balances, but likewise of car-service balances covering the use and interchange of freight cars; it further includes bills between the respective companies covering amounts due for repairs to freight cars. There are also many items between companies accruing in the settlement of claims for loss and damage to freight and for overcharge on inter-line or through freight, and these claims in the ordinary course of business are not received until a considerable time has elapsed after the transportation has been performed; so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>in order to arrive at the net balance due to or from any railway at the close of a given month, it requires a large amount of investigation covering a long period in order to properly state the amount, or to even approximately indicate the real balance which may be due.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">Q. \u201c Would it be possible by investigation of your books to tell the amount due the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway from the Boston &amp; Maine road upon the first day of January 1906 ? \u201d A. \u201c I should say it would be possible to determine the balance as shown by our books, but this balance so determined would not be the actual amount due to the Rock Island road because of the fact that there might be proportions accruing on through freight that would be settled with our next connecting road. In other words, the Rock Island road would not appear in our accounts at all because the proportions due that road would be included in the balance which we settled with our connecting line.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">Q. \u201cCould this other factor which you have mentioned \"be determined at all from your books ? \u201d A. \u201c I should say it could not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">Q. \u201c But the amount due the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway from the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad on the first day of January, 1906, so far as your hooks show, could be determined?\u201d A. \u201cIt could.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-8\">Q. \u201cCan you state what that amount is now?\u201d A. \u201cI cannot.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-9\">It is agreed that the foregoing may be considered as the deposition of the amounts due the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway with the exception of the exact figures, which are to be furnished by the deponent and to be taken as a part of this deposition provided it is held that the trustee is chargeable. It appeared upon cross-examination that there was\\ nothing due the defendant from the trustee on account of any special contract or agreement to be performed in this state, and that \u201cby mutual understanding, agreement, or course of business,\u201d all \u201ccredits on traffic balances or otherwise due \u201d were payable in Boston.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-10\"><em>Burnham, Brown, Jones $ Warren (Robert L. Manning </em>orally), for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-11\"><em>Branch Branch (Oliver W. Branch </em>orally), for the trustee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-12\">Peaslee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWHK\">The trustee is a resident of this state. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>33 N. H. 337. 'As such resident it is properly chargeable here upon a transitory cause of action, even if the debt due from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>it to the principal debtor was payable in another jurisdiction. <em>Steer </em>v. <em>Dow, ante, </em>95.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The disclosure is incomplete and leaves in doubt the question whether the traffic balances are so commingled with those due to other roads that they cannot be separated. It is not deemed advisable to attempt to decide questions as to these balances which may not arise when the facts are found.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The sums due for the use of cars, repair of cars, and similar items appear to be ordinary matters of debt and credit, which can be ascertained by an examination of the trustee\u2019s books. That the accounts may be lengthy or complex is no reason for refusing to apply the settled law of the state. The statute makes the trustee chargeable for the money, rights, or credits of the defendant in its possession. P. S., <em>c. </em>245, <em>s. </em>19. It makes no exception of cases where the evidence may be voluminous or the calculations complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The trustee also claims that the sequestration of this fund is an interference with interstate commerce. There is here no attempt to seize a fund due to a carrier from a shipper. The case is simply this: Several roads are jointly interested in interstate carriage. The carriage has been completed, the shippers have paid to one of the roads the entire amount due, and this process is used to seize the portion of the fund due to another of the roads from the one to which payment was made. The interference seems more remote than that which has heretofore been held lawful. <em>DeRochemont </em>v. <em>Railroad, ante, </em>158. The authorities now relied upon were before the court in the DeRoohemont case. The conclusion then reached, that such an interference is not direct but only incidental, is reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
