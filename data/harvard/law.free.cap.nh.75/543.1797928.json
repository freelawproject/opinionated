Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the January term, 1910, of the superior court by Wallace, C. J., upon the defendant\u2019s exception to a denial of his motions for a nonsuit and the direction of a verdict in his favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-8\"><em>David W Perkins </em>and <em>Gyprien J.

It could be found that passengers frequently came around the end of the car toward which the horse was moving, and that they could not see an approaching horse, driven as this one was, until they stepped from behind the car and practically in the path of the moving animal. In this situation it might well be found to be negligent to drive with a sleigh over half bare ground, with the horse straining at a pulling gait, and so close to both the side and end of the car that a stop could not be made in season to avoid a collision with an unsuspecting foot-traveler who might step from behind the car. There were twenty-seven feet of roadway for the horse to travel upon, and due care might well require that when passing these standing cars it should be driven further to the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">It might also be found that the plaintiff was careful. She went around the end of the car \u201c just the same as the rest of them.\u201d She thought the driver \u201c would go on that side ; he was on my side.\u201d It cannot be said as a matter of law that her reliance upon the proposition was not reasonable conduct under the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>cumstances. While she knew that teams going south usually went on the west side of the street, there is no evidence that she knew, or had reason to believe that they would carelessly drive on the easterly edge of this broad driveway, in a manner highly dangerous to alighting street railway passengers. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Burque, </em>72 N. H. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The principle of <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>72 N. H. 528, is not involved. There is here no question of subsequent and prior negligence. It is simply a case where it could be found that there was negligence on one side and none on the other. That the very different conclusions drawn from the evidence by the defendant are properly deduced does not affect the result on these motions. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Burque, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\n<em>(Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b574-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
