On that date and for more than twenty years previously the plaintiff had his residence and domicile in Franklin. He was duly notified of the tax, seasonably applied to the selectmen for an abatement, and upon their refusal seasonably filed his petition. In 1907, he was taxed on the same property in Franklin. Upon the foregoing facts it was ordered that the tax be abated, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-5\"><em>Leach, Stevens </em>Couch, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-6\"><em>Dudley </em>Lowe, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-7\">Bingham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">As a rule, personal property is taxable in the town in which the owner resides.
