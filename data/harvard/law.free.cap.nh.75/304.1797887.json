The testator bequeathed the residue of his estate \u201c in equal shares \u201d to bis four children and two children of a deceased son, naming the legatees, and directed his executors to pay the shares of the grandchildren to them when they arrived at the age of twenty-one years. In case of the death of any of the legatees named, their shares were given to the survivors. The probate court decreed one fifth of the residue to each of the testatator\u2019s four children and one tenth to each of the two grandchildren. Upon appeal the decree was affirmed <em>pro </em>forma, and the grandchildren excepted. Transferred from the October term, 1908, of the superior court by <em>Chamberlin, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-13\"><em>Joseph Madden, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-14\"><em>Charles M.

The direction of the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>is that the property be distributed in equal shares \u201c to my children, . . . and also to my grandchildren.\u201d There is no satisfactory evidence that the testator intended the grandchildren to take only the statutory share of their deceased parent. In the provision relating to survivorship he treats all alike. The shares of deceased beneficiaries go to the survivors. If one of the grandchildren had died, its share would have been distributed to all tbe survivors equally. Had the testator had in mind the statute of distribution, and intended that the two grandchildren should take only their father\u2019s share, he would also have provided that in the event of the death of one grandchild its half of its father\u2019s share in the estate should go to the other grandchild, to the exclusion of its uncles and aunts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">A will is made to avoid \u2014 not to carry into effect \u2014 the statute of distribution. If, as the appellees argue, the testator had intended to divide his estate as the statute would cause it to be divided, he could have omitted all of this clause of his will except the provision that the grandchildren\u2019s shares should be held in trust. If he had had the suggested familiarity with the statute, it could well be argued that he would not uselessly insert its provisions in the will. There is more ground for arguing that the children constitute a class taking one share, while the grandchildren as a class take the other share, than there is for the contention that the children take as individuals and the grandchildren as a class. But neither construction would carry out the intent expressed in the will. As was said in <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>46 N. H. 435, 440, \u201c any inference of an intention to divide the residue by classes is merely conjectural and quite too uncertain to prevent the application of the well settled general rule ; . . . individuals falling within the description of the devisees in the residuary clause take <em>per </em>capita.\u201d The persons named and described in the residuary clause all stand alike, and each is entitled to one sixth of the residue of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\n<em>Appeal sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
