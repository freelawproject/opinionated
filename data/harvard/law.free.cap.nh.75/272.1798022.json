Transferred from the March term, 1908, of the superior court by <em>Stone, </em>J., without a ruling, upon an agreed Statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-13\">In 1906, the plaintiff took a mortgage of an ice-house erected on leased land in Meredith. In 1907, the town taxed the mortgagor for the house and other personal property. He did not pay his taxes when due, and on December 2, 1907, the collector advertised the house for sale, and on January 16, 1908, sold it to the town for all the taxes assessed against the mortgagor. The plaintiff redeemed before February 2, 1908. He now insists that the sale is invalid because (1) he was not legally notified of it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>(2) the proceedings were begun prematurely, and (3) the collector had no lien on the house.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-5\"><em>Walter 8.

The plaintiff paid the town before the time to notify him of the sale had expired, and therefore he is in no position to complain of want of notice. P. S., <em>a. </em>61, <em>s. </em>8.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">2. It was the mortgagor\u2019s duty either to pay his taxes or to expose personal property within fourteen days after he was notified of the tax; and as he failed to do either, the collector was authorized to sell the house when and as he did, provided it is real estate within the meaning of section 13, chapter 60, Public Statutes, which is held to give the collector a lien on the mortgagor\u2019s real estate for all the taxes assessed against him. <em>Drew </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>62 N. H. 23, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">3. Section 21, chapter 61, Public Statutes, makes such a building as the ice-house in question real estate within the meaning of section 13, chapter 60, Public Statutes. Consequently the collector had a lien upon it for all the mortgagor\u2019s taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
