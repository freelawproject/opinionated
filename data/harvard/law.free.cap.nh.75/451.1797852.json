Trial by the court. Facts found, and case transferred from the April term, 1909, of the superior court, by <em>Chamberlin, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-11\">December 14, 1904, the plaintiff and one Jenney signed a contract which provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-12\">\u201c 1st. Said Webster agrees to place or cause to be placed in said Jenney\u2019s place of business at said Enfield five hundred dollars\u2019 ($500) worth of groceries and provisions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-13\">\u201c 2d. Said groceries and provisions, or others of equal value, to be the property of said Webster at all times.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-14\">\u201c 3d. Said Jenney to have the right to sell or exchange said goods for profit, provided they are replaced by others of equal value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-15\">\u201c4th. For the above privilege said Jenney is to pay said Webster the sum of twenty dollars ($20) each year, also to pay all taxes on said goods and to keep them insured for their value at all times.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-16\">At the date of the agreement Jenney had about $150 in money. This sum, together with the plaintiff\u2019s $500, was used to purchase a stock of goods which was put into Jenney\u2019s store, and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>upon Jenney sold and purchased goods as is customary in country stores. All goods bought were commingled with others not sold, and the stock was maintained as was found necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-5\">Early in April,; 1908, Jenney being in default on his annual payment of $20 required by the contract, the plaintiff demanded of him the posession of the stock of goods, claiming to be the owner of them, and Jenney voluntarily gave him the possession and turned over to him the key of the store. The next day the goods were attached by the defendant, who is a deputy sheriff, on writs in favor of two of Jenney\u2019s creditors. Within a few days Jenney was adjudged a bankrupt. The defendant was appointed receiver, and in that capacity claimed to hold the goods which he had before attached. The attachment suits were abandoned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">The foregoing agreement exactly expresses what the parties agreed to and was entered into in good faith, without any intention on the part of either party to defraud the other or any one else. The defendant as receiver sold the goods for $430.15, which was their fair value; and if the plaintiff on the foregoing facts is entitled to recover, he is to have judgment for that amount.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-7\"><em>William Batehelder </em>and <em>Oharles Batehelder </em>(both of Vermont), and <em>Smith </em>Smith, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-8\"><em>Marshall J). Oolleigh </em>and <em>Alhin $ Sawyer, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b482-9\">Walker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAml\">If, as against Jenney\u2019s creditors, the transaction between him and the plaintiff might be deemed a sale with a secret trust in favor of the plaintiff, while Jenney retained possession of the property, its fraudulent character was purged when the plaintiff asserted his right under the contract and took possession of the property which, as against Jenney, belonged to him. <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>71 N. H. 518. By that act the contract was terminated, and at the time of the attachment Jenney had no possession of the goods upon which fraud could be predicated as a matter of law. <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Fowler, supra. </em>Nor did the defendant\u2019s appointment as a receiver in bankruptcy of Jenney\u2019s estate furnish any justification for his seizure of the plaintiff\u2019s property and retention of the possession thereof. <em>Truda </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>71 N. H. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
