The conductor of the car was called by the defendants and testified in regard to what occurred at the time the plaintiff was injured. On cross-examination, he testified that some days afterward he made a written report to the company at the request of the company\u2019s superintendent. On redirect examination, the report was ruled in, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception. Among other things, the report stated that the accident was due to want of care of the plaintiff alone.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-11\"><em>Joseph Madden, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-12\"><em>Charles H.

The fact that upon the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s conductor' it appeared that he made a report of the accident to the defendant, did not render the report competent as affirmative evidence for the defendant of the truth of the facts stated therein. Because one party proved the fact that a report was made did not authorize the other party to prove the contents of the report. The plaintiff did not offer any part of the report as evidence, and the question whether the defendant might then use other parts of it or the whole of it as explanatory evidence ( <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>McDuffie, </em>48 N. H. 402; <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>63 N. H. 448 ; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Hazelton, </em>74 N. H. 252, 254) did not arise. Nor can it be said that the contents of the report were not prejudicial to the plaintiff. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>statement that the accident was wholly due to the plaintiff\u2019s want of care is sufficient to show that the admission of the report furnished the jury with incompetent evidence of a most darnaging character to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s motorman, who had testified that the report stated the truth, as to his recollection of the report, did not amount to a waiver of the exception to its admission. The witness\u2019 credibility was properly tested in this way after the report had been admitted as evidence before the jury. Clearly, there was no waiver of the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\n<em>Exception sustained: verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-7\">Young, J., dissented: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
