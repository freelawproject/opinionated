Trial by jury and verdict for the defendant. Transferred from the-February term, 1908, of the superior court by <em>Stone, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-12\">The defendant is a physician and treated the plaintiff\u2019s daughter for spasmodic croup. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove that, she died of membranous croup. Dr. Morgan, who was called to-the child about two hours before her death, was a witness for the-defendant and admitted on cross-examination that the plaintiff and his attorney, Scott, called on him at his office, but denied that he-told them death resulted from membranous croup. The redirect examination took up the occurrences at his office and then proceeded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-13\">Q. \u201cDid you see Colonel Scott later ? \u201d A. \u201c Saw him on the street one day; that is all.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-14\">Q. \u201c What talk did you have with Colonel Scott about it on the street ? \u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objecting, the court said: \u201c That, is not evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-15\">Defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201c It was put in before, your honor. I don\u2019t think it is quite fair. I don\u2019t wish to criticise the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-17\">The court: \u201cAnytalk this man had with Colonel Scott on the-street is not evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-19\">Defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cThey put it in before. I didn\u2019t know but they wanted to now.\u201d To this the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The court found that these remarks were addressed to the court in explanation of the defendant\u2019s contention as to the competency of the question put to Dr. Morgan, and that the counsel acted in good faith in his endeavor to address the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-5\"><em>Walter W. Scott </em>and <em>Samuel W. Emery </em>(of Massachusetts), for .the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-6\"><em>William F.

If the plaintiff thought the controversy was likely to prejudice him, he should have asked the court to instruct the jury to disregard it. <em>Batchelder </em>v. Railway, 72 N. H. 329, is not in point. In this case the court has found that the remarks excepted to were made to the court while the defendant\u2019s counsel was urging the competency of his question. In the case cited the question excepted to was asked after its competency had been considered and it had been finally excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b619-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
