In 1905, the plaintiff bought the land to which this right was originally appurtenant. At the request of the parties, the question whether the plaintiff can maintain this proceeding was transferred without a ruling from the April term, 1909, of the superior court by <em>Pike, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Doyle </em>&lt;f* Dacier, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-3\"><em>Cain </em>&lt;\u25a0}\u25a0 <em>Benton, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b503-4\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3f\"><em>Eastman </em>v. Company, 44 N.

Company, 7 3 N. H. 11); but in a proceeding of this kind he admits the validity of the taking. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Company, ante, </em>3. Consequently, if the plaintiff can recover anything in this action, it must be the value of the right at the time it was taken <em>(Chapman v. Company, </em>67 N. H. 180) ; but he cannot recover the value of that, for it never belonged to him. <em>Hodgman </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>69 N.
