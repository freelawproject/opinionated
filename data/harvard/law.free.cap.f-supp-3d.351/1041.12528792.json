Mr. Gleissner, the Senior Manager who allegedly made frequent age-related comments to Plaintiff and his co-workers, had some participation in Plaintiff's termination, at least to the extent of approving Martinez's draft termination letter and forwarding it to his own supervisor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The stated reason for Plaintiff's termination was failure to notify management about the accident at the time it occurred in violation of Defendant's Acceptable Conduct Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant's Acceptable Conduct Policy lists \"[f]ailure to report a vehicle accident in accordance with 8-90 Vehicle Accidents/Occurrences\n   and 4-48 Driving Qualifications\" as \"Misconduct\" which \"may result in severe disciplinary action up to and including termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The referenced Vehicle Accidents/Occurrences Policy defines an employee's responsibility for reporting accidents as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The operator of a revenue road licensed vehicle (i.e. Company-owned, rented, or leased) must report to a member of their management or dispatch, if management is not available, any accident/occurrence of a vehicle coming in contact with an object, property, or person ....

Therefore, by the express terms of Defendant's policy, Plaintiff committed a \"serious violation\" for which termination was an available repercussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff then argues that assuming Plaintiff violated Defendant's policy, Plaintiff's evidence of discriminatory comments and disparate treatment establishes that Plaintiff's termination was discriminatory. \"Stray remarks\" rejected as direct evidence, while insufficient to defeat summary judgment on their own, may still be used to demonstrate pretext or be offered as additional circumstantial evidence alongside other discriminatory conduct.\n   <em>\n    Goudeau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278209\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/470/#p475\">\n    793 F.3d at 475-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
