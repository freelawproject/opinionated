Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on June 30, 2013. (Dkt. 6 at 25). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since August 30, 2012, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of prostatitis, right shoulder impairment, affective disorder, anxiety disorder, and substance abuse disorder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of abscess on his buttock and scalp, chest pain, high blood pressure, and ulcers were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.02, 12.04, and 12.06 in reaching her conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of unskilled light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   is limited to occasional overhead use of the right upper extremity. He may work in proximity to others, but is limited to tasks that do not require him to work in conjunction with others and that predominantly involve working with objects rather than people.

At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was unable to perform any past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of mail clerk, office helper, and electronic assembler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

(Dkt. 9-1 at 17-30). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ's assessment of Plaintiff's RFC, particularly limitations associated with Plaintiff's chronic prostatitis, is unsupported by substantial evidence and that this error necessitates remand for further administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The RFC Finding is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In deciding a disability claim, an ALJ is tasked with \"weigh[ing] all of the evidence available to make an RFC finding that [is] consistent with the record as a whole.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Matta v.

(Dkt. 6 at 81-82,100-101). At his administrative hearing, Plaintiff testified that he was \"working in constant pain and I have to go to the restroom all the time because of my prostate infection. And I'm bleeding - I have blood coming out of my urine. And the last time I was trying to work, I was just working in a lot of pain and I was let go because I wasn't able to perform the job, what was expected.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-62).

Plaintiff also testified that he uses the restroom four to five times per hour, depending on how much water he had consumed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71). Due to his prostate problems, it took Plaintiff approximately five minutes to use the restroom, and he experienced pain when using the restroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff explained that he first experienced prostatitis in 2007, and that it had gotten worse overtime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72-73). Plaintiff explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   In the beginning I would just get ... an infection, and then I'd take medication. It'll clear up and I'll be fine for awhile. And then it started, you know, every six months I was having these infections. And I would take the medication, it'll clear up. I'd be fine for awhile. But I'd say in the last couple of years, the period of time that I would be fine for awhile, it's gotten shorter. I mean I've taken medication and it really doesn't help anymore at all. And the doctor's trying to figure out why, and they can't keep me on that type of medication for, you know, eight, nine months because it's harmful to my liver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73). The VE testified that work would be precluded if Plaintiff required four to five unscheduled restroom breaks in an hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At step two of the disability analysis, the ALJ concluded that Plaintiff's prostatitis was a severe impairment, noting that Plaintiff \"complained of urinary symptoms in April, May, and September 2012. He has been diagnosed with prostatitis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26). In assessing Plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ rejected Plaintiff's testimony relating to the severity of his prostatitis, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The claimant has a history of [prostatitis ], which he reports causes him to use the restroom frequently. More specifically,\n   he reports that he must use the restroom four times per hour and requires five minutes each time. Notably, the claimant did not complain of this to his providers. One would expect that an individual who had to use the restroom as often as four times per hour and who required at least five minutes each time, would report these symptoms to his provider and would seek more aggressive treatment. The claimant has been referred to a urologist and only complains of urinary symptoms approximately once per year to his primary care provider. Therefore, I reject the claimant's testimony regarding the frequency and duration of breaks needed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30) (internal citations omitted). The ALJ ultimately afforded Plaintiff \"some accommodation for restroom breaks in the residual functional capacity to account for [Plaintiff's] chronic prostatitis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). The RFC permits Plaintiff a one-to-three minute break every 30 minutes to use the restroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As an initial matter, the ALJ's reasons for rejecting Plaintiff's testimony regarding his prostatitis are flawed. The ALJ penalizes Plaintiff for complaining to his medical providers of issues stemming from his prostatitis\"approximately once per year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30). However, at his hearing, the claimant specifically explained that his prostatitis would initially respond to treatment for a period of time, but that his symptoms ultimately returned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62, 73). Plaintiff also testified that had taken different medications to treat issues stemming from his prostatitis, but treatment was ultimately unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Medical records confirm that Plaintiff was periodically treated for chronic pain relating to his prostatitis, which was a recurrent problem for him despite treatment with antibiotics. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 6 at 326 (in April 2012, Plaintiff presented with \"dysuria, frequency, 'burning' with urination, hematuria\" and Plaintiff's dysuria was a \"recurrent problem,\" that has been \"gradually worsening.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 367 (in May 2012, Plaintiff treated for dysuria, reporting that he was treated with cipro the month prior, but that symptoms had returned);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 460 (in September 2012, Plaintiff treated for urethral discharge and reported pain when urinating);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 508 (in December 2013, Plaintiff \"believes his prostatitis is acting up ... his main complaint is urinary frequency\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 516 (at a follow-up visit in January 2014, Plaintiff explained that he took bactrim, which \"worked for a long time,\" and then took \"cipro\" in December 2013, which initially \"resolved the feeling of urgency and limited flow,\" but he experienced a \"[s]low recurrence of symptoms since off meds\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 521 (in November 2014, Plaintiff reported that \"he has been having increased urinary frequency again for the last few weeks.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In other words, the record supports Plaintiff's testimony, which was clear as to why he complained of issues stemming from his prostatitis only periodically. The ALJ's failure to address this point when evaluating Plaintiffs credibility amounts to a mischaracterization of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales v.

June 27, 2017) (\"The case must be remanded because the ALJ's credibility determination relied on perceived inconsistencies that rely on a mischaracterization of the record.\"). Further, the Court is unclear what \"more aggressive treatment\" the ALJ believes Plaintiff should have sought. The record reflects that Plaintiff saw multiple providers for issues relating to his prostatitis over a long period of time, and was prescribed different medications to treat symptoms of his prostatitis. Without further explanation by the ALJ, it is not clear to the Court what about this treatment the ALJ found did not support Plaintiff's testimony. The ALJ's rejection of Plaintiff's testimony is particularly problematic in this case, where the VE found a need to use the restroom four to five times per hour would preclude work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Further, the Court finds that the ALJ's assessment of limitations relating to Plaintiff's prostatitis was based on her own lay interpretation of the medical record. In the written determination, the ALJ discussed the opinion evidence relating to Plaintiff's physical limitations, which included an opinion from Aharon Wolf, M.D., that Plaintiff had no physical limitations. (Dkt. 6 at 32;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 423-26). Dr. Wolf's opinion does not include an assessment of Plaintiff's limitations relating to his chronic prostatitis. The ALJ acknowledged that \"[t]here is no other medical opinion relating to the claimant's physical conditions in the record,\" and explained that she would include in the RFC \"some accommodation for restroom breaks ... to account for the claimant's chronic prostatitis\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32), which the ALJ apparently determined should be a \"one-to-three minute bathroom break every 30 minutes\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29). The written determination does not contain any further explanation as to how the ALJ arrived at these particular durations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"[W]here the medical findings in the record merely diagnose the claimant's exertional impairments and do not relate these diagnoses to specific residual capacities... the Commissioner may not make the connection himself.\"\n   <em>\n    Quinto,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20200302\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

Here, the ALJ found that Plaintiff's chronic prostatitis was a severe impairment and, in the absence of any opinion evidence relating to this severe impairment, used her lay judgment to determine what accommodations Plaintiff should be permitted. This was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant contends that the ALJ's RFC finding adequately addressed Plaintiff's prostatitis, because it accounted \"for Plaintiff's credible need for two restroom breaks per hour,\" and that Plaintiff's treatment history \"did not support further restrictions.\" (Dkt. 11-1 at 19). Defendant's argument misses the mark. As noted above, the ALJ's credibility determination relating to Plaintiff's prostatitis is flawed, and therefore her explanation as to why Plaintiff's treatment history did not support further limitations was inadequate. Further, even if the ALJ properly evaluated Plaintiff's credibility, the record is devoid of opinion evidence for work-related limitations caused by his prostatitis, which the ALJ determined was a severe impairment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.
