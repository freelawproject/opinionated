In 2015, Evans was the mayor of Camp Hill and a recurring target of Holley's criticism. In retaliation, says Holley, Evans\n   told Chief of Police Johnny Potts to arrest Holley. And one day, when Holley was driving into town, Potts did indeed stop and arrest Holley. Holley pleaded guilty to making an improper lane change, but he also filed this lawsuit for First Amendment retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because Holley pleaded guilty to a traffic violation, the court must assume that Potts had probable cause to stop and arrest him.\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

And once Potts stopped Holley, he also had probable cause to arrest him for other offenses. Evans and Potts are thus entitled to qualified immunity.

Holley has served four terms, and Evans has twice defeated Holley in mayoral elections. (Doc. # 31-2, at 4, 12.) Evans was the mayor in 2015. At the same time, Holley remained politically active and often attended town council meetings. He publicly questioned Evans's mayoral salary, the lack of a recent town audit, and Camp Hill's financial condition. (Doc. # 31-2, at 9-12; Doc. # 31-5, at 2-3.) The minutes of an August 2015 town council meeting reflect the contentious nature of Holley and Evans's relationship:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Frank Holley was present and addressed Mayor Evans asking why he wasn't allowed to speak at the last Council Meeting. Mr. Holley then asked Mayor Evans to resign or Council to impeach him. There was no response. Holley said he was denied public records when requested. Mr. Holley asked Mayor Evans if he was getting paid more than $800.00 per month. Mayor Evans replied \"no.\" Mayor Evans also said to Mr. Holley that he was tired of him (Holley) coming to Council Meetings intimidating him. Mr. Holley asked Mayor Evans if he felt intimidated. Mayor Evans replied \"Yes, I feel intimidated by you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Doc. # 31-6, at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 31-5, at 3.) Of course, both men deny that they saw each other as rivals. (Doc. # 31-2, at 11; Doc. # 35-1, at 6-8.) But neither were they allies, and Evans allegedly used the police to retaliate against Holley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Evans allegedly ordered police officers to arrest Holley in retaliation for Holley's protected speech.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Holley has repeatedly alleged that Evans directed Camp Hill police officers to \"target\" or \"profile\" him. \"This [profiling] is no surprise,\" Holley wrote to Evans in September 2015, \"because of my addressing important and sensitive issues at council meetings which has drawn attention to your incompetency, and your inability to compete intellectually.\" (Doc. # 31-3, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to witnesses, in 2014 Evans told police officers to target Holley. Roosevelt Finley, who was the police chief in 2014, says that Evans repeatedly ordered him \"to arrest [Holley] on illegal charges, whether it be for DUI or whatever because of his [constant] meddling in Camp Hill affairs.\" (Doc. # 31-7, at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 31-10, at 5.) Finley also testified that Evans told him to \"set [Holley] up\" and to do \"anything you can do to arrest that b-ard, put his old a-in jail.\" (Doc. # 31-10, at 4.) Once, when Finley told Evans there was no probable cause to arrest Holley, Evans allegedly responded: \"Well, you should arrest him for something.\" (Doc. # 31-10, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A former Camp Hill police officer, Nathan White, likewise testified that Evans told him to arrest Holley for driving under the influence even though Holley was \"completely sober.\" (Doc. # 31-8, at 1; Doc. # 31-11, at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   And in an affidavit, Camp Hill resident Morris Greathouse says he overheard Evans tell Johnny Potts \"to arrest Mr. Frank Holley ... because [he] drove around Camp Hill drunk all the time.\" (Doc. # 31-9, at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Greathouse, Evans also told Potts that \"he had already ordered Chief Roosevelt Finley to arrest that d-Frank Holley because he could not stand that Mother F-er.\" (Doc. # 31-9, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Evans allegedly targeted other people too. According to Greathouse, Evans told Potts to target a man named Hubert Finley. Potts then arrested Hubert. (Doc. # 31-9, at 1.) Roosevelt Finley also testified that Evans told him to \"target\" Douglas Heard. (Doc. # 31-10, at 2.) Douglas Heard claims Potts arrested him \"without probable cause as directed by Danny Evans.\" (Doc. # 31-16, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response to Holley's allegations, Evans testifies that he \"never ordered anybody to be arrested.\" (Doc. # 35-1, at 5.) No one admits ever arresting Holley, Hubert Finely, or Douglas Heard without probable cause. In the ten years before Holley's arrest, \"the Town of Camp Hill never had a legal finding against it that\n   anyone in the police department or any other public official violated the First Amendment rights of any citizen.\" (Doc. # 27-3, at 2.) And in that same decade, Camp Hill \"never received any complaints [other than those from Holley] that a mayor, chief of police or any other public official attempted to violate the constitutional right of any citizen to free speech.\" (Doc. # 27-3, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Potts arrested Holley, who pleaded guilty to a traffic violation.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to Holley, Evans's \"targeting\" culminated on December 14, 2015. Holley had gone to Dadeville to buy a bottle of liquor. He was driving back into Camp Hill when Johnny Potts, who was then the chief of police, pulled him over. (Doc. # 27-1, at 4.) According to Potts, Holley had been driving \"unusually slowly\" and was weaving between the center lane line and the side of the road. Potts claims he suspected Holley of drunk driving. (Doc. # 27-2, at 3-4.) But Holley maintains that he used his turn signal, drove just under the speed limit, and otherwise obeyed the law. He denies that the road even had a center lane line. (Doc. # 27-1, at 4; Doc. # 31-2, at 14-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Once Holley pulled over, Potts got out of his cruiser and walked up to Holley's truck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Within seconds, Potts noticed a .38 pistol on the bench seat next to Holley. Potts asked if Holley had a pistol permit. Holley replied that he did not have a permit but that he had a \"permission card\" from the sheriff of Tallapoosa County. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 31-2, at 14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Potts then asked if Holley had been drinking, stating that Holley had been \"all over the white line.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Less than two minutes after first talking to Holley, Potts announced he was going to conduct a field sobriety test. The test consisted of Potts asking Holley to touch his nose with each hand and to stand on one foot. Holley touched his nose with his left hand, but he had trouble doing so with his right. (Before the test, he told Potts he had just had surgery on his right shoulder.) Holley was shaky while standing on one foot. Potts then arrested Holley \"for driving under the influence of alcoholic beverages.\" Holley was in handcuffs about three minutes into the stop. Potts took Holley's pistol from the truck and put it in his cruiser. Potts explained that he did not want anyone to steal the \"high-dollar weapon.\" Holley denied drinking alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Potts then drove Holley to jail, where a blood alcohol test revealed that Holley had no alcohol in his system whatsoever. (Doc. # 27-2, at 3.) Later that night, Potts charged Holley with making an illegal lane change and carrying a pistol without a permit. (Doc. # 31-14, at 2; Doc. # 31-15, at 2.) On his attorney's advice, Holley eventually pleaded guilty to the lane violation. (Doc. # 31-15, at 1; Doc. # 31-17, at 1.) In exchange, Camp Hill dismissed the weapons charge. (Doc. # 31-14, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Magistrate Judge recommended denying Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After pleading guilty, Holley sued Evans, Potts, and the Town of Camp Hill for First Amendment retaliation and for \"negligence or wantonness.\" (Doc. # 1.) Defendants moved for summary judgment. (Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   # 27.) They argue Holley's guilty plea bars him from challenging whether Potts had probable cause. If Potts had probable cause, Defendants continue, there can be no constitutional violation. Finally, they argue the state-agent immunity doctrine defeats Holley's tort claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge concluded that Holley's First Amendment claim should survive summary judgment because Holley is not barred from challenging the existence of probable cause and because Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity. (Doc. # 44, at 6-13.) Defendants objected to that conclusion. (Doc. # 45.) The Recommendation also concluded that Holley's tort claim should be dismissed because of the state-agent immunity doctrine. (Doc. # 44, at 13-14.) Holley did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   object to that conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Holley's First Amendment claim raises three questions. First, does his guilty plea for making an improper lane change collaterally estop him from challenging whether Potts had probable cause? Second, if Potts had probable cause, are Evans and Potts entitled to qualified immunity? And third, if Potts had probable cause, can Holley still sue the Town of Camp Hill? Answers: yes, yes, and yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The doctrine of collateral estoppel bars Holley from claiming that he was stopped without probable cause.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When Holley pleaded guilty to making an illegal lane change, he necessarily admitted that he made an illegal lane change. But now Holley says he committed no traffic violations whatsoever. That argument implicates the doctrine of collateral estoppel (also known as \"issue preclusion\"), which generally keeps parties from relitigating issues already decided in court.\n   <em>\n    Cmty. State Bank v. Strong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754284\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/1241/#p1263\">\n    651 F.3d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1263 (11th Cir. 2011). Because Holley pleaded guilty in an Alabama court, Alabama law determines whether he is collaterally estopped from arguing that he did not make an illegal lane change.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754284\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/1241/#p1263\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He is barred from making that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Alabama's collateral estoppel doctrine extends to situations in which a party to one case is in privity with a party to an earlier case.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Alabama Supreme Court often summarizes the collateral estoppel doctrine in a four-part boilerplate test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   For the doctrine of collateral estoppel to apply, the following elements must be established: (1) that an issue in a prior action was identical to the issue litigated in the present action; (2) that the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) that resolution of the issue was necessary to the prior judgment; and (4) that the same parties are involved in the two actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Walker v. City of Huntsville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037258\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/62/474/#p487\">\n    62 So.3d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 487 (Ala. 2010) (cleaned up);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stinnett v.

This formulation can be helpful, especially for the first three elements. But the fourth element, which is often called the \"mutuality of estoppel\" requirement,\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Flexible Prods. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8999301\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/915/34/#p45\">\n    915 So.2d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45 (Ala. 2005), is somewhat misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the first three elements of the test are satisfied. Nor could they. Holley made a knowing and voluntary guilty plea in state court, and there is no indication that he preserved any issues for appeal. So as a matter of state law, Holley admitted he made an improper lane change, and he waived any challenges to the legality of his arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    G.E.G. v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7039091\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/54/949/#p956\">\n    54 So.3d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 956 (Ala. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    Vann v.

Determining that Holley made an improper lane change was necessary to his conviction. It is the same issue now before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   So if collateral estoppel does not apply, it must be because there is no mutuality of estoppel. That is what the Magistrate Judge concluded. The Magistrate Judge wrote that Holley pleaded guilty in a case brought by the State of Alabama,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Alabama is not a defendant here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because \"the same parties\" are not involved in both cases, the Magistrate Judge reasoned, collateral estoppel cannot apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On a strict reading of the boilerplate collateral estoppel test, the Magistrate Judge would be correct. But that test is misleading. The Alabama Supreme Court does not \"strictly enforce[ ]\" the mutuality requirement \"if the party raising the defense of collateral estoppel ... is in privity with a party to the prior action.\"\n   <em>\n    Dairyland Ins.

The question is whether a reasonable officer in Potts's position could have believed that he or she had probable cause to arrest Holley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montoute v.

It is also irrelevant that Potts did not tell Holley he was being arrested for a traffic or weapons violation. \"Quite simply, the validity of an arrest does not turn on the offense announced by the officer at the time of the arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509594\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/284/1188/#p1194\">\n    284 F.3d at 1195-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Holley admitted to Potts that he did not have a permit for the .38 revolver in his truck. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 31-2, at 14.) It is a misdemeanor to carry a pistol in a vehicle without a permit, unless the pistol is unloaded and locked away out of reach. Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-11-73, 13A-11-84(a). Holley had a \"permission\" or \"commission card\" from the Tallapoosa County Sheriff, but that did not satisfy the permit requirement. Thus, Holley confessed to a misdemeanor, meaning Potts had probable cause to arrest Holley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Holley also made an illegal lane change and had some trouble completing the field sobriety test. In the video of the traffic stop, Holley's speech arguably sounds slurred. Holley also appears confused when Potts asks for his license and proof of insurance. Thus, a reasonable officer could have concluded that Holley was driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of state law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032\">\n    Ala.

That means Potts had at least arguable probable cause to arrest Holley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because Potts had probable cause to stop Holley for an illegal lane change and at least arguable probable cause to arrest him for other offenses, Potts and Evans are entitled to qualified immunity. It was not clearly established in December 2015 that an arrest supported by probable cause could violate the First Amendment. In 2012, the Supreme Court wrote that it had \"never recognized a First Amendment right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Reichle v.

Those cases shield Potts from liability. And if Potts had probable cause or arguable probable cause, then Evans cannot be liable for an arrest made without probable cause or arguable probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The upshot is that both Evans and Potts are entitled to qualified immunity.
