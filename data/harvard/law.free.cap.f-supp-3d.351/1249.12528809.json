A-D. The application of the '555 Patent is a continuation of the patent application that issued as the '928 Patent, and thus the two patents share the same specification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monsanto Co. v.

Similarly, the application for the '819 Patent is a continuation of the patent application that issued as the '555 Patent and the '408 Patent is a continuation of the patent application that issued as the '819 Patent. For simplicity, unless referring to a specific patent, the Court's citations to the text and figures of the Patents-in-Suit refer to the '928 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Patents-in-Suit relate to \"[a] system and method for the automatic analysis and categorization of images in an electronic imaging device.\" '928 Patent at Abstract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   All the asserted claims recite a system or method for automatic analysis and categorization of images that involves three components: 1) an imaging device, 2) a system bus and 3) a camera computer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '555 Patent, 3:46-49; '928 Patent, 3:55-58; '819 Patent, 3:47-50; '408 Patent, 3:52-54.

Next, image processing modules replace any defective pixels in image data, perform white balance color correction on the image data, and perform interpolation (edge enhancement) on the image data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644603\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/1328/#p1337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The processing module then converts the image data into an intermediate format, such as an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644603\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/1328/#p1337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Analysis modules then analyze the image data at an RGB transition point.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644603\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/1328/#p1337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 7:56-64.

Like the representative patent in\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   , the Patents-in-Suit describe physical components such as a digital camera, but the physical components \"merely provide a generic environment in which to carry out the abstract idea.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p613\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p613\">\n    at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In response, Plaintiff asserts that the claims are directed to \"a particular improvement in computing specifically in regard to digital analysis and categorization.\" Dkt.

The digital camera, processor and memory identified in the Patents-in-Suit are described in conventional and generic terms. The remaining element-the analysis module-is described in purely functional terms as a component configured to perform image data analysis and to automatically generate a category tag. This description of the analysis module is no different from the vague description of the server in\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   that the Federal Circuit found patent-ineligible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p613\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p613\">\n    at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The server A includes ...
