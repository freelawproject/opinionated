Mot. Toll, ECF No. 55. In their motion, Plaintiffs request that the statute of limitations be tolled for 599 days\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   or, alternatively, for a time period that this Court deems to be equitable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of the underlying dispute in this case were set forth in detail in this Court's Opinion and Order granting conditional class certification. Op. and Order, ECF No. 29. This Opinion and Order will therefore focus on the procedural history of the claim and will discuss the merits only as they relate to the request for equitable tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their FLSA Complaint against Defendant in April 2016 for failure to properly pay overtime wages, Compl., ECF No. 1, and moved for conditional class certification on May 3, 2016. Mot. Certification, ECF No. 2. Defendant sought and was granted a forty-five day extension of time to file its opposition brief. Mot. Extension, ECF No. 4. Approximately one month later, Defendant moved to stay the case and requested discovery. Mot. Stay, ECF No. 11. Defendant then sought a second extension of time to file its opposition brief, asking to file the same either after the Court ruled on the motion to stay or after the initial discovery period ended. Mot. Extension, ECF No. 14. In both of its requests for additional time, Defendant agreed to toll the statute of limitations until it filed its opposition brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Magistrate Judge King ordered both parties to respond to written discovery and set the deadline for Defendant's opposition brief. Order, ECF No. 20. When Defendant filed its opposition brief on September 2, 2016, per the agreement between the parties, the statute of limitations was tolled for ninety-eight days. Resp., ECF No. 60. Plaintiffs filed their reply just over two weeks later. Resp., ECF No. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court granted conditional class certification to Plaintiffs in early January 2018 and ordered Defendant to provide a list of each current and former employee fitting the class definition. Op. and Order, ECF No. 29. The parties then jointly requested an additional fourteen days to comply with the Order and agreed to toll the statute of limitations during that time. Mot., ECF No. 31. Altogether, the parties agreed to toll the statute of limitations for 112 days. Resp., ECF No. 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant provided Plaintiffs with correct class information on February 26, 2018. Mot. Tolling, ECF No. 55. Notice was issued two days later, and over 150 purported class members returned consents\n   to join the collective action by the opt-in deadline of April 14, 2018. ECF No. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs request that the Court equitably toll the statute of limitations for opt-in class members from the date Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Conditional Class Certification (May 3, 2016) through the end of the notice period (April 14, 2018).

Class members received notification of the collective action, and over 150 plaintiffs returned their consent to opt-in to the lawsuit.

This Court respectfully declines to follow the reasoning set forth in those decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, the Court finds that the Sixth Circuit opinions those cases rely on do not hold that group-wide tolling is improper. For instance, in concluding that equitable tolling requires an analysis of whether each individual plaintiff satisfied the five-factor\n   <em>\n    Truitt\n   </em>\n   test, the\n   <em>\n    Lemmon\n   </em>\n   court relied on two Sixth Circuit cases, which explained that a \"plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating why he or she is entitled to equitably toll the statute of limitations in a particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Lemmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20234854\">\n    2016 WL 234854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.

Those Sixth Circuit cases, however, considered only a single plaintiff's request for equitable tolling in habeas corpus actions and did not consider the propriety of tolling a statute of limitations on a group-wide basis. The language used in those cases must be considered in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Fenley,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lemmon\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Atkinson\n   </em>\n   are inapposite to those in the case at hand.

The courts in those cases consistently found, as this Court has, that a ruling on equitable tolling prior to certification would be premature as the characteristics of the putative class were still unclear at that stage of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Fenley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344847\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/1063/#p1077\">\n    170 F.Supp.3d at 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying equitable tolling because potential plaintiffs had \"not yet opted into the lawsuit\");\n   <em>\n    Lemmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20234854\">\n    2016 WL 234854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (declining to \"extend the rights of putative plaintiffs\");\n   <em>\n    Atkinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20853234\">\n    2015 WL 853234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (holding that claims for equitable tolling \"on behalf of potential opt-in plaintiffs [are] premature since those individuals are not yet before the court\"). Because the posture of those cases was a substantial factor in the outcomes of each of those opinions with respect to equitable tolling, and because this case is in a different procedural posture, those cases are less persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Indeed, other courts do routinely grant equitable tolling in FLSA collective actions when doing so is warranted by the specific facts of the case. Whether, and how long, to equitably toll depends on the circumstances, but courts commonly find that tolling is appropriate when, as here, plaintiffs pursue their claims diligently but nevertheless experience a substantial delay between the time they moved for conditional certification and the time the court granted conditional certification/authorized notification to potential class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When notification to potential class members is impeded by an excessive court delay, equitable tolling helps ensure that plaintiffs are not \"penalized due to the\n   courts' heavy dockets.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Ohio Mar. 22, 2016) (concluding that a six-month court delay warranted equitable tolling when the plaintiff had diligently asserted her rights). In fact, in situations where court delay has time-barred a sizeable number of potential plaintiffs, many courts find that the delay alone warrants equitable tolling and decline to analyze the typical equitable tolling factors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322307\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/298/152/#p170\">\n    298 F.R.D. at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court agrees with that approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the present case, Plaintiffs moved for class certification and timely briefed that motion, but they did not receive a court ruling on that motion for almost sixteen months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   it became ripe (473 calendar days). Obviously, some delay in ruling on a motion for conditional certification is expected and is the reality of Congress' choice to keep the statute of limitations running until each opt-in plaintiff files his or her consent to opt into the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20256\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Tolling the statute of limitations from the date Plaintiffs filed their motion for conditional certification\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -or even from the date it became ripe-would contravene this intent and would not be equitable because it would result in a windfall to Plaintiffs. What constitutes a \"reasonable\" period of time to rule on a ripe motion for conditional certification may vary from court to court or even from time to time within a single court. In any event, this Court concludes that a delay of almost sixteen months is\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   and was entirely beyond Plaintiffs' control. For purposes of this case, the Court finds that six months would have been a reasonable amount of time to rule on the ripe motion, and all delay exceeding six months constitutes an extraordinary circumstance beyond Plaintiffs' control. This approach best \"comports with the regular course of litigation and reflects the lapse of time the FLSA's opt-in mechanism necessarily involves.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Consumer Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:12-cv-1093,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20884494\">\n    2014 WL 884494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (M.D. Tenn. Mar. 5, 2014) (finding that a fifteen-month delay is excessive but declining to toll the entire period of the delay). The tolling for Plaintiffs' claim will therefore begin six months after Plaintiffs' motion for conditional certification became ripe for review-March 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs request that the Court toll the statute of limitations through the end of the notice period, which concluded on April 14, 2018. However, under the FLSA, the statute of limitations for collective actions continues to run, after a court grants conditional certification and approves notice, until each individual plaintiff has opted-in to the lawsuit. Moreover, the parties have agreed to toll a portion of the time after the Court granted conditional certification in this case but before notice was approved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulation, ECF No. 33. In light of these facts, and absent any extenuating circumstances such as egregious conduct on the part of Defendant delaying the ability to mail the notice or unreasonable delay by the Court in approving the form of notice, it would not be equitable to toll the period of time between the Court's grant of conditional certification and the end of the opt-in period. The Court will therefore toll the statute of limitations only from March 19, 2017, through the date the Court granted conditional certification, January 5, 2018. This results in a total of 292 calendar days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the above reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for equitable tolling and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   that the statute of limitations be tolled for 292 days with respect to any plaintiff who timely and validly opted into the lawsuit. This period of time is in addition to all tolling previously agreed to by the parties. The Clerk shall terminate ECF No. 55 from the Court's pending motions list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Plaintiffs ask the Court to toll all time between the filing of their motion for conditional certification (May 3, 2016) through the end of the notice period (April 14, 2018), minus the 112 days that the parties previously agreed to toll.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF Nos. 14, 33.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Approximately twenty months passed between the date Plaintiffs moved for conditional certification and the date the Court ruled on the motion. Four of those months, however, were spent briefing the motion, and it would not be equitable to toll the statute of limitations (beyond the time the parties have agreed to toll it) for this reasonable amount of time spent on discovery and briefing the motion. That is time the parties would expect the statute of limitations to run under the statutory scheme, and there is nothing extraordinary about that process taking four months.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
