LARIMER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action was brought by four property owners in Corning, New York (\"Corning, NY\"), against Corning Incorporated (\"Corning\"), asserting claims under the Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and under New York state law. Plaintiffs seek damages and \"response costs\" due to alleged contamination by hazardous substances of property owned by plaintiffs. The complaint is ostensibly brought on behalf of a class of owners, occupants an residents of the area in question (identified in the complaint as the \"Houghton Plot\"), but at this point no class has been certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Corning has moved to dismiss most of plaintiffs' claims, and to stay the remaining claims pending a decision by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (\"DEC\") on an appropriate remedy, pursuant to proceedings that have been taking place before the DEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plaintiffs' Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following allegations are taken from plaintiffs' complaint. For the purposes of this factual background, plaintiffs' allegations are taken as true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs own properties in an area in Corning, NY, known as the \"Houghton\n   Plot.\" The area comprising the Houghton Plot was at one time farmland, and was later acquired by Corning Homes, Inc., which is a predecessor in interest to Corning. Corning Homes acquired the land in 1920 from the heirs of the late founder of Corning Flint Glass Works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Houghton Plot encompasses areas in which Corning released or disposed of fill containing hazardous substances, including arsenic, cadmium and lead. It appears that this occurred prior to plaintiffs' acquisition of their particular plots;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint \u00b6 47 (stating that Corning deposited the fill \"[m]any years ago\"), \u00b6 52 (stating that the alleged contaminated fill \"may have ... been used to improve drainage and to fill in low-lying areas in order to develop the neighborhood\"), \u00b6 82 (stating that the area \"was developed into to [sic] a residential area after the Contamination was deposited\"). Plaintiffs do not allege that any contaminants have been deposited in the Houghton Plot since they purchased their properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the complaint, on June 27, 2014, Corning entered into an Order on Consent with the DEC (\"2014 Order\"), following the discovery of contamination at a location in Corning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 53. The Order on Consent itself does not appear to be in the record, but the parties do not dispute that it was issued. The gist of it was that Corning would undertake a study to determine the extent of the contamination, and recommend an appropriate plan to remediate the contamination. Corning commissioned a private firm, Weston Solutions (\"Weston\") to undertake the study and prepare the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the course of that study, Weston submitted a \"Focused Feasibility Study/Alternatives Analysis\" (\"FFS\") dated March 23, 2017. (Dkt. # 11-7.) That report offered several alternative remedial measures, including no action at all (which was used as a baseline option, for purposes of comparison with the other options); excavation and replacement of soil to a depth of two feet; and excavation to a depth of 15 feet, with subsequent backfill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its conclusion, Weston recommended the two-foot excavation, with a soil cover. The reasons are fully stated in the FFS (Dkt. # 11-7 at 91), but Weston's report stated that based on its study, it concluded that \"[d]eeper excavations are possible, but impracticable, and do not provide any significant additional benefit with respect to overall health or environmental protectiveness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, the report stated that excavations deeper than two feet would likely do more harm than good, for a number of reasons, including the demolition of existing structures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After a period in which members of the public were invited to submit comments, the DEC in July 2017 issued a Final Decision Document (\"FDD\"), setting forth a remedy for the subject area. (Dkt. # 11-9 at 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DEC stated that \"[t]he remedy will consist of excavation and removal of target fill to conform to [DEC standards] and excavation and removal of soil within the top two feet ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 4, 2017, Corning Inc. and the DEC entered into another Order on Consent and Administrative Settlement (\"2017 Order\"), which superseded the 2014 Order. (Dkt. # 11-10.) The 2017 Order stated that \"[c]ommencing upon the effective\n   date of this Order [which was specified as the tenth day after the order was signed by the DEC commissioner], Respondent [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Corning Inc.] will implement the remedial activities required by [the] Final Decision Document ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The DEC also stated that it accepted Weston's FFS. (Dkt. # 11-10 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The 2017 Order also provided that Corning would submit a Remedial Action Work Plan (\"RAWP\") to the DEC, describing \"the means and methods for determining the extent of remediation and for implementing the remediation\" within the subject area, as called for in the FFS. (Dkt. # 11-10 at 6.) Corning did so, in a report prepared by Weston, dated April 6, 2018. (Dkt. # 11-6.) In short, the RAWP sets forth the details of implementing the DEC-approved remedy of excavation and removal of the top two feet of soil in the subject area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the complaint in this action on February 9, 2018. They have asserted five causes of action, on behalf of themselves and other owners, occupants and residents of properties in the Houghton Plot: (1) a claim for response costs under CERCLA, based on Corning's disposal of hazardous substances on the subject property; (2) a state-law claim for negligence, based on the disposal of hazardous substances, and defendants' failure to warn plaintiffs of the danger ensuing from that disposal; (3) strict liability, based on a theory of abnormally dangerous activity; (4) private nuisance; and (5) public nuisance. Plaintiffs seek response costs, compensatory and punitive damages, and injunctive relief requiring Corning to undertake additional remediation efforts, beyond what was approved by the DEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants now ask the Court to: (1) dismiss all plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief because of plaintiffs' alleged failure to exhaust their administrative remedies, and based on the DEC's primary jurisdiction over the remediation of the subject property; (2) dismiss all of plaintiffs' common-law causes of action, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and (3) stay any remaining damages claims, under the primary-jurisdiction doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies/Primary Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants contend that the Court should dismiss plaintiffs' requests for injunctive relief based on plaintiffs' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. They also contend that the Court should dismiss plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief, and stay their claims for damages, under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. As they relate to this case, these two issues are intertwined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiffs simply request an order which \"permanently restrains and enjoins Corning from allowing the Contamination from continuing to persist, or migrate onto or through\" their properties, and which \"compels Corning to comprehensively remediate the Contamination it has caused ....\" (Dkt. # 1 at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs' papers, and their attorney's statements at oral argument, have shed some light on these matters. In their response to defendants' motion, plaintiffs state, with respect to the exhaustion issue, that they \"are not directly attacking the decisionmaking by NYSDEC, so there was no need to exhaust administrative remedies,\" and that they have \"brought this action under CERCLA, and under that regulatory scheme, the remedy cannot be challenged until after it has been completed.\" Plaintiffs' Mem. at 9 (Dkt. # 19 at 18). Plaintiffs state that under CERCLA, \"any court challenge to the remedy [ordered by the DEC] is premature.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   expressly requested equitable relief, which, if ordered, would effectively alter, or go beyond, the remedy directed by the DEC. At oral argument, plaintiffs' attorney was imprecise about the exact nature of the injunctive relief that plaintiffs seek, stating, \"[W]e certainly\n   think that more can be done on the remedy, whether it's digging another 13 feet or something else ....\" (Dkt. # 25 at 25). The reference to \"another 13 feet\" was obviously an allusion to the DEC's adoption of a two-foot, rather than a 15-foot excavation remedy. But clearly, plaintiffs want more than what was ordered or approved by the DEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' attorney also freely admitted at oral argument that plaintiffs made what amounted to a tactical decision not to bring an Article 78 proceeding in state court, challenging the DEC's approved remedy. He stated, \"We don't think we even could because ... it's really an interim decision.\" (Dkt. # 25 at 4.) He added that plaintiffs are \"suing under CERCLA,\" and, tellingly, that \"it's probably unlikely that we would succeed in a claim that [the DEC's decision] was arbitrary and capricious ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. In other words, plaintiffs and their counsel concluded that it would be unlikely for them to succeed on a direct challenge to the DEC's decision, under state law. So rather than pursue a head-on approach, seeking to overturn or modify the DEC's decision, plaintiffs chose to bypass that route altogether, and to seek relief in federal court under CERCLA. But that end-run attempt runs afoul of the primary-jurisdiction doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under the New York Environmental Conservation Law, the DEC has jurisdiction over remedial programs for inactive hazardous waste disposal sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20E.C.L.%20%C2%A7%2027-1313\">\n    N.Y.

In fact, the decision is not even a close one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   An analysis of the abovementioned four factors supports this conclusion. First, the questions presented here plainly involve matters that are not within the conventional experience of judges, and which involve technical or policy considerations within the agency's particular field of expertise. While the Court has jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims, the DEC has considerably more expertise in the underlying factual matters. The DEC deals with problems arising from environmental contamination on a regular basis, and presumably is well equipped to deal with such matters. For similar reasons, the underlying question at issue-how best to remediate the contamination-has been committed to the DEC's discretion by the New York legislature. New York E.C.L. \u00a7 27-1313 provides that the DEC \"shall be responsible ... for\n   inactive hazardous waste disposal site remedial programs,\" with certain exceptions that are not at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Third, if this Court were to grant the relief sought by plaintiffs, there would obviously be a significant risk of inconsistent rulings. The DEC has approved a two-foot excavation remedy; plaintiffs contend that the two-foot remedy is not good enough. They want the Court to order a literally more extensive remedy. At oral argument, plaintiffs' attorney expressly stated that in plaintiffs' view, the remedy \"should be more\" than what was approved by the DEC. (Dkt. # 25 at 25.) Indeed, were it otherwise, the Court and the parties would not be dealing with this dispute in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   If this case were to go forward, and the Court were ultimately to order, for example, a fifteen-foot excavation remedy, one can only imagine the delay and uncertainty that would ensue, as Corning found itself whipsawed between two different remedies ordered by two different entities, each with jurisdiction over the matter. Having two proceedings moving forward, on separate tracks, with the possibility of inconsistent rulings, would inject needless confusion into the process, as well as likely inefficiency and delay into the actual remediation, which is supposed to be the ultimate goal here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of Santa Fe County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7845309\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/892/1333/#p1349\">\n    892 F.Supp. at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"[s]hould this Court independently determine an appropriate investigatory and remediation plan, aspects of the order may contradict [the state agency's remedial order] and subject Defendants to conflicting obligations\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The fourth factor that courts consider-whether a prior application to the agency has been made-obviously weighs in further favor of this Court staying its hand. The application has not only been made, the process has advanced to the point where the DEC has actually approved a specific remedy. Late-in-the-day meddling by this Court would serve little if any useful purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As stated above, the exhaustion doctrine is of little relevance to this case, in one sense at least. Exhaustion typically comes into play when a party seeks to challenge an administrative decision; in general, one cannot seek to overturn an administrative decision in court without having first availed oneself of all available administrative remedies. But as explained above, plaintiffs have disavowed any frontal challenge to the DEC's order; they have brought a claim for relief under CERCLA, that on its face is not based on the DEC's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   But the fact that plaintiffs, by their own admission, initially participated in the DEC process, and then took a different tack, out of strategic considerations, only adds weight to the Court's ruling as to the primary-jurisdiction issue. It is evident that at some point after they entered into the DEC administrative process, plaintiffs concluded that they stood a better chance of success pursuing claims in federal court. Based on that calculation, they abandoned the remedies that New York State had made available to them, and filed suit in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court recognizes that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not, strictly speaking, an absolute precondition for bringing a CERCLA claim in federal court. But the fact that plaintiffs deliberately chose a federal forum, in pursuit of a federal remedy, to avoid a state administrative process that was well advanced, but where, in plaintiffs' estimation, their prospects of success were growing increasingly dim, only serves to illustrate why this Court should stay its hand in favor of the state administrative agency that has been dealing with this matter for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Having said all that, the Court will address plaintiffs' alternative argument that they\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   in fact exhausted their state administrative remedies. Plaintiffs contend that they did so simply by raising objections during the process leading up to the DEC's adoption of the two-foot remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In support of their argument, plaintiffs state that \"[t]he New York State Court of Appeals has held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine applies only when '[n]o one raised the issue.' \" (Dkt. # 19 at 19.) The case they have cited in support of that assertion,\n   <em>\n    In re Jackson v. New York State Urban Dev.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   was addressing a challenge to a plan by a state agency to redevelop the Times Square area of Manhattan. In the course of the administrative process, two Article 78 proceedings were brought, unsuccessfully, by petitioners challenging the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The petitioners then filed an action in state court, and lost. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed, and in doing so, it noted as to one particular issue concerning certain environmental effects of the plan, that \"[n]o one raised the issue during the lengthy hearing and comment periods before the FEIS [Final Environmental Impact Statement] was issued.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 427,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=503%20N.Y.S.2d%20298\">\n    503 N.Y.S.2d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=494%20N.E.2d%20429\">\n    494 N.E.2d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court said that while the state agency had an affirmative obligation to consider environmental effects, \"petitioners' silence cannot be overlooked in determining whether the agency's failure to discuss an issue in the FEIS was reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=494%20N.E.2d%20429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At no point, then, did the court in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   hold that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when \"no one raised the issue.\" To assert otherwise grossly misrepresents the court's holding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In short, plaintiffs' argument would stand the exhaustion requirement on its head. They argue, in effect, that simply to raise an issue, somewhere along the line in the administrative process, obviates the need to pursue it further during that process. That argument is illogical, nonsensical, and not supported by the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In a grasp at one more straw, plaintiffs argue that they could not challenge the DEC remedy by means of an Article 78 proceeding, because \"the remedy was not finalized - only the general elements of the remedy.\" (Dkt. # 19 at 20.) But it is clear from the terms of the 2017 Order that it is not, as plaintiffs suggest, merely some preliminary document; it is an order, setting forth a very detailed course of remediation. That the order contemplated further investigative and remedial studies and plans during the course of the remediation does not render it \"non-final\" for Article 78 purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gordon v.

When all is said and done, though, plaintiffs' position was probably most candidly stated by plaintiffs' counsel at oral argument, when he said that had plaintiffs pursued an Article 78 proceeding, they would have had a \"difficult\" and \"challenging\" case ahead of them. (Dkt. # 25 at 26, 27.) He may have been correct in that assessment, but that does not mean that this Court should now step in and interfere with an ongoing process being conducted by a state administrative agency that has been charged with authority to address the matters at issue, particularly where the plaintiffs deliberately chose not to pursue the avenues of relief that are or were available to them in the state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
