DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, Agoda argues that the Court should grant summary judgement on Phan's sole claim, for violation of the TCPA, for three reasons: (1) Phan provided the required level of consent under the TCPA because the text messages he received did not contain advertising and were not telemarketing; (2) Phan waived his rights to assert his TCPA claim by agreeing to Agoda's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and by continuing to make bookings with Agoda after receiving the allegedly unlawful text messages; and (3) Phan agreed to a Singapore choice of law and venue clause in the Terms of Use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 3-4. As discussed below, the Court agrees with Agoda's first argument, and thus does not address Agoda's second and third arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Requirements Under the TCPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The TCPA makes it \"unlawful for any person within the United States ...

The question of whether Phan consented turns solely on whether the text messages here contained advertising or constituted telemarketing. Indeed, Phan concedes that his claim fails if the text messages are neither advertising nor telemarketing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 24 (\"Plaintiff agrees with the notion that, if the at-issue messages do not constitute advertising or telemarketing, they do not violate the TCPA.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Agoda argues in its motion that the text messages were neither advertising nor telemarketing, but instead were \"merely transactional\" because they served only two purposes: (1) to confirm \"that [Phan's] bookings were reserved with the third party hotel\"; and (2) to direct Phan to the app \"to locate and modify the booking prior to the completion of [his] stay.\" Mot. at 11. As to the latter purpose, Agoda argues that directing Phan to the app so he could modify his booking was merely transactional because the business transaction between Agoda and Phan did not conclude until Phan completed his stay at the hotels he booked through Agoda.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.

In doing so, the court distinguished the texts at issue in\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Aderhold I\n   </em>\n   because in those cases the links were included to allow the recipient to complete a registration, whereas the text in\n   <em>\n    Haagen-Dazs\n   </em>\n   made clear on its face that the recipient had already \"join[ed]\" the rewards program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As such, the encouragement to \"download [the] app\" was unnecessary and could constitute an advertisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Similarly in\n   <em>\n    Herrick v.

The first message\n   encouraged the plaintiffs to sign up for an app that would allow them to see their \"wait in real time, control when [they] get served &amp; find more places with no lines-[link]\" and, the second message both informed them that their wait was over and included a link to the defendant's website.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271695\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/216/816/#p817\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court held the messages were advertising because they \"advertised a 'free' app for the purpose of conveying the quality of [defendant's] products and services and soliciting plaintiffs to recruit more business customers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271695\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/216/816/#p817\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271695\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/216/816/#p817\">\n    at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As to the context, these messages were sent as part of an ongoing business transaction between Agoda and Phan. Phan used Agoda's services to book a travel itinerary online. Up until the time he finished his travel, he could cancel that booking or otherwise modify it through Agoda. Kelts Decl., Ex. 2 at 31; Rattanasrimata Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. As such, his transactional relationship with Agoda as to each booking continued through the time when he completed his travel. This scenario is directly comparable to\n   <em>\n    Mackinnon\n   </em>\n   , where the restaurant reservation was booked, but was not completed until the plaintiff ate dinner at the restaurant. Even assuming Phan paid for his booking on Agoda's website at the time of booking (as opposed to at the time of travel), this fact does not change the Court's conclusion. Phan contracted with Agoda for the provision of travel accommodations; Agoda's obligations were only completed by its successfully providing those accommodations to Phan at the time of Phan's travel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The content of the messages reinforces this conclusion. The text messages read: \"Good news! Your Agoda booking [number] is confirmed. Manage your booking with our free app http://app-agoda.com/GetTheApp.\" Compl. \u00b6 21; Kelts Decl., Ex. 2 at 14. The plain language of the text messages is limited to (1) confirming the booking (a purpose no court cited by Phan has found constitutes advertising or telemarketing); and (2) encouraging Phan to \"manage [his] booking\" via the app.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Zelenski Decl., Ex. 2 at 10. These two purposes directly related to Phan's transaction with Agoda.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This language distinguishes this case from\n   <em>\n    Haagen-Dazs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204536422\">\n    2017 WL 4536422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-*2, where the app link was included without an attendant function relevant to the transaction, and from\n   <em>\n    Herrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271695\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/216/816/#p817\">\n    216 F.Supp.3d at 817-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where the app link in the first message was included, in part, to \"find more places with no line\" and the website link in the second message was included without an attendant function relevant to the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court recognizes that this scenario is not directly comparable to those in\n   <em>\n    Aderhold,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wick\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiffs each had to take an additional step before their agreements with the defendants were final.

The same is true for the app. Even though it contains certain promotions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Zelenski Decl., Ex. 1 at 20-21, the app was included \"to facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial transaction,\" making the link to it fully germane to the transaction.\n   <em>\n    In re Rules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20FCC%20Rcd%203787\">\n    21 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   3812 \u00b6 49. Put simply, Agoda was not advertising the app's commercial availability. To hold otherwise would run headlong into the decisions in this Circuit and others holding that inclusion of the link to a defendant's website, without more, does not render a message advertising or telemarketing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For these reasons, the Court holds that the messages at issue here were neither advertising nor telemarketing as defined by the TCPA. As such, Agoda needed only Phan's express consent prior to sending the messages. There is no dispute that Agoda received such consent because Plaintiff voluntarily provided his phone number and agreed to Agoda's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which made clear that such messages would be sent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aderhold II\n   </em>\n   , 668 Fed. App'x at 796 (\"The [FCC] has determined that 'persons who knowingly release their phone numbers have in effect given their invitation or permission\n   to be called at the number which they have given, absent instructions to the contrary.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   , Report and Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20FCC%20Rcd%208752\">\n    7 FCC Rcd. 8752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8769 (Oct. 16, 1992) ) ); Opp. at 2 (acknowledging that the express prior consent standard is \"relatively low\" and \"requir[es] only that consumers 'knowingly' agree to receive such calls\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As such, based on the undisputed facts in the record, the messages were neither advertising nor telemarketing and Agoda received prior express consent from Phan. Agoda has thus successfully demonstrated that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the affirmative defense of consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Pomona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067028\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/1036/#p1049\">\n    750 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1049 ; Fed.
