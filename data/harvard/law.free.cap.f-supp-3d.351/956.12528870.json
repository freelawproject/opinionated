Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   More than 20 years ago, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals stated: \"We are poignantly aware of the seeming transformation of our public schools from institutions of learning into crucibles of disaffection marred by increasing violence from which anguish and despair are often brought to homes across the nation.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. I-89\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513604\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/22/991/#p992\">\n    22 F.3d 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 992 (10th Cir. 1994). It is disheartening, to say the least, that this statement still rings true today. In yet another tragic - and indeed senseless - instance of school violence, this matter is now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff Gregory Keener brings this cause of action against defendant Alexander Hribal, a former classmate of his, who brought two kitchen knives to school and proceeded to stab 20 of his classmates in a seven-minute rampage. Plaintiff barely survived his life-threatening injury. In addition to suing the perpetrator, he sues Alex Hribal's parents, along with the school district and a private security company that performed services at the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff raises various state law claims for negligence and battery, as well as federal civil rights claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Each of the defendants now brings a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Doc. Nos. 12, 20, and 29. For the reasons that follow, both the parents' motion and the security company's motions will be denied. The school district's motion will be granted. Plaintiff will have 21 days to file an amended complaint that states a viable cause of action under Section 1983 ; otherwise, this case will be remanded to the state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff Gregory Keener brings this cause of action against the following defendants: Alexander Hribal; Tina and Harold Hribal - the parents of Alexander Hribal (the \"parents\"); Capital Asset Protection, Inc. (\"Capital\"); and Franklin Regional School District (the \"school district\"). As mentioned above, the suit arises out of a stabbing rampage perpetrated by Alexander Hribal, which occurred on April 9, 2014. At approximately 7:00 a.m., Alexander Hribal arrived at Franklin Regional High School (the \"school\") armed with two 12-inch kitchen knives taken from his parents' home. Doc. No. 1-2 \u00b6 13. Alexander Hribal stabbed 20 students and a security guard in the attack.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition, plaintiff brings a negligence claim (Count V)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against the parents. With respect to the parents, plaintiff asserts that they acted negligently because they knew that their child was mentally ill and potentially dangerous, yet they failed to take adequate steps to prevent the attack.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 48-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff also brings a negligence claim (Count VI) against Capital Asset Protection, Inc.

According to plaintiff, Capital assigned just one security guard to perform security services at the school.

First, plaintiff asserts in Count VII that the school district violated his constitutional right to bodily integrity under the Fourteenth Amendment, which the Court interprets as a municipal liability claim. He then asserts in Count VIII another Fourteenth Amendment due process claim under a \"state-created danger\" theory. In short, plaintiff maintains that the school district adopted \"a practice, custom and policy of deliberate indifference\" to his safety and welfare; he further contends that the school district failed to hire a competent and prepared security company, despite its knowledge that the students faced \"substantial risk of serious harm or death\" as a result of an attack like the one that occurred.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 65-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A parent has a duty of reasonable care to prevent harm to another when that harm is a natural and probable consequence. The necessary elements center on (1)\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   of a specific type of harmful conduct and (2) an\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   to interfere at the relevant time. Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that the parents were \"aware of their son's intent to carry out this attack, and were otherwise acutely aware of [their son's] serious mental illness(es) and propensity for violence prior to the attack.\" Doc. No. 1-2 \u00b6 28. Plaintiff avers several times that the parents had actual knowledge of their son's mental illness and violent tendencies prior to the attack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28, 55, 56, 57. Plaintiff further alleges that the parents knew, or reasonably should have known, about their son's manifesto where he plotted his attack prior to its execution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. These well-pleaded facts, when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, suggest that the parents had notice of the potential harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Furthermore, regarding the parents' ability and opportunity to prevent the harm, plaintiff asserts that the weapons used in the attack (i.e., the 12-inch knives) came from the parents' home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Plaintiff further claims that the parents could have prevented the attack by taking reasonable steps such as (1) keeping their son out of school; (2) ensuring he took his duly prescribed medications; (3) involuntarily committing their son to an inpatient mental health facility; and/or (4) otherwise taking additional steps to seek out appropriate medical treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. As discussed above, the ability and opportunity to prevent the harm does not require the parents to be physically present at the time of the attack; instead, what matters is that the parents had some\n   <em>\n    opportunity to control\n   </em>\n   their child at the\n   <em>\n    relevant time.\n   </em>\n   Here, the relevant time would have been\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the attack, as plaintiff contends in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Although plaintiff does not provide significant details to support his claim against the parents, the well-pleaded factual allegations do render the claim\n   <em>\n    plausible.\n   </em>\n   The complaint includes more than mere labels and conclusions.

There, the court dismissed a negligence claim against the parents of the older child, finding that plaintiff failed to allege any facts indicating that the parents had any reason to know\n   that their son was so reckless, aggressive, or violent that he should not be allowed to participate in a contact sport, or that they had the ability and opportunity to control him when he was under the supervision of his coaches at the camp.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120893\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/129/220/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, that case is distinguishable.

There, defendant sought to hold a landlord liable for criminal acts of unknown third parties. The Court held that the trial court erred in submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury because the type of danger at issue was not \"an easily perceptible one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 748. \"In deciding whether to impose punitive damages a court should not look to the third party's criminal conduct, which in this case was truly outrageous; a court should not look at the end result, which in this case also was outrageous; rather, the court should examine the actor's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here,\n   <em>\n    Feld\n   </em>\n   is instructive on punitive damages. Nevertheless, the\n   <em>\n    Feld\n   </em>\n   ruling\n   was not made at the pleading stage. The court in that instance had the benefit of a fully developed record, including a jury verdict. Furthermore, at this stage, this Court need not determine whether as a matter of law Capital acted with the state of mind necessary to impose punitive damages. \"[T]he clear trend in this Circuit is to permit adequately pled claims of punitive damages based on negligence to proceed to discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Despite plaintiff's creative arguments, these allegations, at most, amount to negligence, which is insufficient to establish culpability that shocks the conscience. Moreover, to the extent that plaintiff raises policy arguments about schools being aware of the risks of mass violence, this Court is not in a position to expand the confines of the Constitution on grounds of policymaking.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, plaintiff has stated a claim under Pennsylvania law regarding the parents' alleged negligence. The actionable claim is not for vicarious liability, but for the parents' own alleged acts in making the injury possible. The Court has found that plaintiff has sufficiently\n   alleged that the parents ought to have foreseen the injury and that their negligence is the proximate cause of that injury. Similarly, the Court has found that plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts that, if proven at trial, could support imposition of punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Second, plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts that could support punitive damages against the security company. The Court notes that, with respect to both the parents' motion to dismiss and Capital's motion to dismiss, plaintiff will face a substantial burden moving forward. Nevertheless, the well-pleaded facts in the complaint, taken as true, render those claims plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Third, plaintiff has failed to state an actionable Section 1983 claim. In this context, alleged violations of a due process right to bodily integrity is only actionable under the state-created danger doctrine. That is because the state otherwise has no duty to protect a citizen from violence caused by another private citizen. Here, the Court has found that plaintiff has failed to allege any facts that would satisfy the elements of that doctrine. In particular, he has failed to identify (1) that the harm was foreseeable and fairly direct; (2) that a state actor acted with culpability to shock the conscience; or (3) that a state actor acted affirmatively to create a danger to him. While school officials might have done more, their actions did not increase the risk of harm itself. Finally, because plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to show a constitutional violation, his municipal liability claim also fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In granting the school district's motion to dismiss, the Court will permit leave to amend. The Court cannot say with certainty that amendment would be futile, so his Section 1983 claims will be dismissed without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

The Court need not address whether plaintiff's state-created danger claim is insufficient because he failed to sue, or even name, any individual state actors.

There, this Court found that the affirmative-action requirement had been satisfied when school officials took affirmative steps to actively dissuade students from reporting rumors of sexual activities between teachers and students. Officials also took steps to actively conceal and otherwise cover-up improper conduct occurring within the school. That conduct, the Court reasoned, caused greater risk of harm to those students who ultimately were sexually abused by teachers at the school.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203492542\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Plum\n    </em>\n    case, and other cases where school districts took active steps to affirmatively hide or cover up dangerous situations, are readily distinguishable from the instant set of facts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
