Rule 59(e) states that \"[a] motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.\" And Rule 60(b) gives parties more time to file motions for relief from final judgment based on, among others, \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unum argues that Ms. Arabaitzis's motion should be evaluated under Rule 59(e) -not the \"more lenient standard of Rule 60(b).\" Def.'s Obj. at 1. Ms. Arabaitzis insists that she filed a Rule 60(b)(1) motion, and then she correctly argues that the \"bar is higher for permitting a Rule 60(b)(1)\" than a Rule 59(e) motion. Pl.'s Reply at 8-9, ECF No. 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Courts treat motions for reconsideration filed within Rule 59(e)'s stricter timeframe-originally 10 days and now amended to 28 days-as Rule 59(e) motions as opposed to Rule 60(b) motions.\n   <em>\n    Owen-Williams v.

So on this point, Unum is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But this is to Ms. Arabaitzis's benefit. Relief under Rule 60(b) is more restrictive than under Rule 59(e).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taitz v.

In general, \"the bar stands even higher for a party to prevail on a Rule 60(b) motion\" because a party must show \"fraud, mistake, extraordinary circumstances, or other enumerated situations.\"\n   <em>\n    Uberoi v.

Of course, it would be illogical to hold motions for reconsideration filed promptly to a higher standard than stale motions; this would just incentivize parties to sit on their grievances until after the 28-day cut-off. So contrary to her self-harming arguments, Ms. Arabaitzis is entitled to consideration under Rule 59(e) and its more forgiving standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Even Rule 59(e) has limits, though. \" Rule 59(e) permits a court to alter or amend a judgment, but it may not be used to relitigate old matters, or to raise arguments or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Leidos, Inc. v.

Def.'s Obj. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As discussed above, the Court will consider Ms. Arabaitzis's motion under Rule 59(e). Because she alleges no change of controlling law or new evidence, the question is whether reconsideration is necessary to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There is no \"manifest injustice.\" Ms. Arabaitzis \"could have easily avoided the outcome\" of the Court entering judgment before considering her objections to the Report and Recommendation by filing them within the 14 days provided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ciralsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9061692,3720940\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/355/661/\">\n    355 F.3d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even though the mathematical error was small, there is no serious argument that it was unavoidable. \"Close\" counts with horseshoes and hand grenades, not filing deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Similarly, Ms. Arabaitzis has not identified a \"clear error\" in need of correction. Her underlying objections lack merit. First, the Magistrate Judge did apply the correct standard of review. As she ably explained, because the benefit plan expressly gives the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility, a deferential standard of review is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

The Court will not disturb a determination if it is reasonable, that is, \"the result of a deliberate, principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Loucka v. Lincoln Nat'l Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527353\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/1/#p8\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (D.D.C. 2018) (citation omitted). And even though Ms. Arabaitzis may quibble with how Unum weighed the evidence, its determination is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Much of Ms. Arabaitzis's complaint is that the Magistrate Judge did not discuss specific arguments and pieces of evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not so. The Magistrate Judge did address Unum's alleged history of \"unfair claims review,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. &amp; R. at 13 (explaining that Ms. Arabaitzis offers no evidence to support such a claim) and witness statements of record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527353\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/1/#p8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (declining to evaluate\n   evidence because review \"is confined to the evidence before the plan administrators\"). And Ms. Arabaitzis criticizes the Magistrate Judge for not discussing Unum's decision to skip a physical examination. But as Ms. Arabaitzis admits, \"Unum was not required to undertake a physical examination.\" Pl.'s Objs. at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   And even though the Magistrate Judge did not mention specific arguments or evidence, that hardly proves that she failed to consider it. In fact, the Magistrate Judge explicitly made her recommendation \"[u]pon consideration of Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 22); Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 23); the memoranda in support thereof and in opposition thereto, as well as the supplemental memoranda, notices of supplemental authority and responses thereto, and the entire record therein.\" R. &amp; R. at 2. Ms. Arabaitzis just asserts that the Magistrate Judge did not consider specific arguments or evidence even though the Magistrate Judge expressly stated that she considered the pleadings and record. Ms. Arabaitzis has not articulated-much less shown-a clear error here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In any event, even \"if the medical evidence is close and supports both conclusions, then judicial deference would support the plan administrator's decision to deny the plaintiff's benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Mobley v.

Ms. Arabaitzis's objections reveal that she does not understand the Court's deferential review of Unum's decision. In arguing that Unum should not have denied her benefits, she points to different medical evidence, the effect of the combination of her medical conditions, alternative vocational analysis, and other witness statements. But \"[t]he ability to choose among conflicting evidence is, essentially, a natural outgrowth of the discretion that the plan affords the\n   <em>\n    administrator.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"908123\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/405/42/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).
