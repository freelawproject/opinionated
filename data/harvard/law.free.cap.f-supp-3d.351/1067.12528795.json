Memo in Opp. 6, ECF No. 35. However, Aero Advanced does not cite any evidence that the California Action was filed in bad faith. Therefore, the Court concludes that there is presently no extraordinary circumstance such that the Court should decline to apply the first-to-file rule. Accordingly, the Court exercises its discretion under the first-to-file rule to transfer this case to the Central District of California, where the first filed case is currently pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because the case is transferred pursuant to the first-to-file rule, it is unnecessary for the Court to address International Aero's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plantronics v.
