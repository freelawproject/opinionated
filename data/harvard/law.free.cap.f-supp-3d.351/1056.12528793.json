For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   ARU's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Cunningham Property Management Trust (\"Cunningham\") owns approximately 272 acres of real property in Harrison County, Ohio. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 6, ECF No. 20). The property is burdened by two separate oil and gas leases, one dated December 11, 1982, covering about 88 acres, and another dated January 12, 1983, covering about 183 acres. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-31). The leases use a standard, pre-printed form and include identical royalty provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   5. In consideration of the premises the Lessee covenants and agrees: (A) To deliver to the credit of the Lessor in tanks or pipe lines, as royalty, free of cost, the equal one-eighth (1/8) part of all oil produced and saved from the premises, or at Lessee's option to pay Lessor the market price for such one-eighth (1/8) royalty oil at the published rate for oil of like grade and gravity prevailing on the date such oil is run into tanks or pipe lines. (B) To pay to the Lessor, as royalty for the gas marketed and used off the premises and produced from each well drilled thereon, the sum of one-eighth (1/8) of the wellhead price paid to Lessee per thousand cubic feet of such gas so marketed and used, measured in accordance with Boyle's Law for the measurement of gas at varying pressure.... (C) Lessee to deduct from payments in (A) and (B) above Lessors prorata share of any severance (excise) tax imposed by any governmental body. (D) In the event Lessee does not sell the gas to others, Lessor shall be paid on the basis of The East Ohio Company field market price at the wellhead for gas of like kind and quality, and on the basis that East Ohio would pay for such gas, including any escalation in the price that East Ohio would pay for such gas as if a contract for the sale of same had been entered into at the time of initial production.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Leases at PageID 244, 246, EFC Nos. 20-1, 20-2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 32). The leases also contain identical notice provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   18. In the event Lessor considers that Lessee has not complied with all its obligations hereunder, both express and implied, Lessor shall notify Lessee in the writing setting out specifically in what respects Lessee has breached this contract Lessee shall then have thirty (30) days after receipt of said notice within which to meet or commence to meet all or any part of the breaches alleged by Lessor. The service of said notice shall be precedent to the bringing of any action by Lessor on said lease for any cause, and no such action shall be brought until the lapse of thirty (30) days after service of such notice on Lessee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Leases at PageID 245, 247.) And they contain identical disclaimers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   19. ... It is mutually agreed that this instrument contains and expresses all of the agreements and understandings of the parties in regard to the subject matter thereof, and no implied covenant, agreement or obligation shall be read into this agreement or implied upon the parties or either of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Leases at PageID 245, 247.) Cunningham eventually acquired the property's surface and mineral rights and is the current Lessor under the leases. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 33). Defendant ARU is the current Lessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Cunningham alleges that it began receiving royalty payments, with associated royalty statements in early 2016. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41). Those payments contained substantial \"post-production\" cost deductions\n   for items such as compression, processing, treating, transportation, fuel, marketing, and gathering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). The deductions were not explained in the royalty statements, Cunningham alleges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). And the deductions purportedly varied without explanation or good cause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44). Cunningham alleges that ARU is not entitled to deduct post-production expenses under the leases, and if they are so entitled the deductions must be reasonable. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ARU moved to dismiss Cunningham's complaint for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , failure to comply with the notice requirement set out in the leases. (ECF Nos. 22, 23; Leases at PageID 245, 247.) Once that motion to dismiss was fully briefed (ECF Nos. 25, 28), this Court issued a decision denying it without prejudice to refiling and stayed the case. The Court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court, in sum, cannot reasonably infer that Cunningham complied with the leases' notice requirement. This conclusion does not mandate dismissal of Cunningham's claims though. The notice requirement serves an important purpose in the parties' agreement-providing ARU an opportunity to cure purported breaches prior to facing suit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leases at PageID 245, 247; Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 5.)

ARU moves to dismiss this claim, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges an alternative theory that if ARU's deduction of post-production costs is authorized under the Leases and Ohio law, the deductions are wrongful because they are \"very substantial,\" \"high,\" \"without any explanation or good cause,\" \"very high,\" \"atypical,\" \"unreasonable,\" \"improper,\" \"inflated,\" and are \"arbitrarily deduct[ed]....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Compl. \u00b6 63; Declaration of Benjamin H. Thomas at PageID 292, ECF No. 20-9). He continued, \"certain deducted amounts appear not to be typical and result in a significantly lower net natural gas price being paid to the mineral interest owners.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b664.). Cunningham also attached to the Amended Complaint monthly royalty statements dating from March 2016 through August 2016, purported to vary substantially without \"explanation or apparent good cause.\" (Cunningham Royalty Statements at PageID 252-281, ECF No. 20-4; Am. Compl. \u00b6 44). Allegedly, by April of 2016, ARU \"was deducting\n   <em>\n    over 68%\n   </em>\n   of the gross value of the natural gas sales for various gathering, compression, and transportation 'expenses.' \" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In response to ARU's argument, Cunningham specifies what paragraph of the leases that it believes is violated by ARU's alleged unreasonably high post-production expenses, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The taking of unreasonable, improper, or inflated deductions is in violation of Paragraph 5 of each lease.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b665.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Pl.s' Mem. in Opp. at 20, ECF No. 25.)

(Reply at 2, 17, ECF No. 28) (Supp. Mot. to Dismiss at 11, ECF No. 37) (Reply in Support of Supp. Mot. to Dismiss at 6-7, ECF No. 39).

ARU's arguments are not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Cunningham has sufficiently pleaded a claim for breach of contract based upon the averments that the taking of post-production expenses at an unreasonably high amount breaches the leases. As set forth above, Cunningham specifies the provision of the leases it contends are breached by specific conduct of ARU, and how Cunningham is damaged by that conduct. Cunningham need not prove its claim here, just allege a plausible one, which it has done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, the courts in all four of the cases relied upon by Cunningham applied the \"at the well\" rule and still required that the deductions to be reasonable. As Cunningham correctly notes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Unreasonable amounts can arise from unreasonable practices. One example is\n   <em>\n    Beer v.

Cunningham is simply not in possession of the information held exclusively by ARU to make these determinations. (Id.) (\"[ARU] calls for more detail in its motion to dismiss, knowing all the while it holds-and has repeatedly refused to divulge-the details that would likely prove the company's questionable practices.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   ARU's Motion to Dismiss Cunningham's breach of contract claim based upon this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Cunningham will thus be entitled to much of the information it seeks in discovery. At this juncture it is unclear whether Cunningham can prove his breach of contract claim, and if he can, whether he has an adequate remedy at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Alternatively, ARU argues that even if there is not an adequate remedy at law, the equitable accounting claim cannot lie because \"the disclaimer of implied covenants in Paragraph 19 of the Leases forecloses this claim.\" (Def's. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss at 12, ECF No. 37.) Cunningham responds that the general disclaimer of implied covenants in Paragraph 19 is insufficient because Ohio law requires an express disclaimer of the specific implied covenant. (Pl's.

Of course, should [the plaintiff] ultimately prevail on her fraud claim, her recoverable damages would be limited to those separate and distinct from any damages awarded on her breach of contract claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Lebo v.
