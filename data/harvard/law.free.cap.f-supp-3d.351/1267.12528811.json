The court noted that the States had no obligation to identify a specific woman who would lose coverage, particularly given that the agencies' regulatory impact analysis estimated that between 31,700 and 120,000 women would lose contraceptive coverage, and that \"state and local governments will bear additional economic costs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n    at 571-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, the court held that the Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claim because the agencies had neither good cause nor statutory authority for bypassing the usual notice and comment procedure, and that the procedural violation was likely not harmless.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n    at 578-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fourth, the court affirmed this\n   Court's ruling that the Plaintiffs had established the other requirements to entitle them to injunctive relief because they were likely to suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction, and the balance of the equities and public interest tilted in favor of granting an injunction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n    at 581-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, women are entitled to contraceptive coverage regardless of their employer's action (or lack of action) with respect to seeking an accommodation. Because a woman's entitlement to contraceptive benefits does not turn on whether her eligible organization employer chooses to comply with the law (by providing contraceptive coverage or seeking an accommodation) or pay a substantial penalty (in the form of a tax) for noncompliance, we cannot say that the act of opting out imposes a substantial burden.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   818 F.3d at 1149.\n   <em>\n    See also, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Little Sisters of the Poor\n   </em>\n   , 794 F.3d at 1174 (\"[S]hifting legal responsibility to provide coverage away from the plaintiffs relieves rather than burdens their religious exercise.

Second, they point to what they characterize as \"unanimous rulings\" post-\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   entering \"permanent injunctions against the Mandate as a violation of RFRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court does not find either argument persuasive at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   With regard to the government's\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   \"concession,\" the Court cannot in the limited time available before the Final Rules are scheduled to take effect review the entirety of the\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   record to place the statements identified in context. But even assessing on their face the handful of facts proffered, it is not self-evident that the representations have the definitive effect posited by the Little Sisters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (citing following exchange during the\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   oral argument: \"Chief Justice Roberts: 'You want the coverage for contraceptive services to be provided, I think as you said, seamlessly.

Solicitor General Verrilli: \"I think it is one fair understanding of the case.' \") (ellipses as in Little Sisters Opp.). On the present record, the Court cannot conclude that the \"one fair understanding\" comment, or the other few representations cited, fatally undermined the core conclusion of the eight courts of appeal that requiring a religious objector simply to notify the government of its objection, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Wheaton College\n   </em>\n   , does not substantially burden religious exercise. The Court thus believes it likely that the answer to the legal question posed in that on-point authority is not altered by the position taken by the government in\n   <em>\n    Zubik.\n   </em>\n   This conclusion, like all of the Court's preliminary analysis in this order, is subject to re-evaluation once a fuller record is developed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n    911 F.3d at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the fully developed factual record may be materially different from that initially before the district court\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Relatedly, the Court finds that nothing in the post-\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   district court decisions cited by the Little Sisters compels the conclusion that the Religious Exemption was mandated by RFRA.

As a result, the post-\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   orders were entered without objection by the government, based on the agencies' new position that the accommodation violates RFRA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wheaton Coll. v. Azar\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:13-cv-08910, Dkt. 119 at 2 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 22, 2018) (noting that \"[a]fter reconsideration of their position, Defendants now agree that enforcement of the currently operative rules regarding the 'contraceptive mandate' against employers with sincerely held religious objections would violate RFRA, and thus do not oppose Wheaton's renewed motion for injunctive and declaratory relief\"). In other words, it appears to the Court that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   party in these cases purported to represent, or even consider the substantial interests of, the women who now will be deprived of \"full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1560. Counsel for the Little Sisters confirmed at oral argument that none of those decisions have been appealed (presumably for the same reason). So the eight appellate courts upon whose reasoning this Court relies have not had the opportunity to decide whether any subsequent developments would change their conclusions. For all of these reasons, the Court finds that nothing about the post-\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   orders cited by the Little Sisters changes its conclusion that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that the Final Rules are not mandated by RFRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Federal Opp. at 21 (\"[N]othing in RFRA prohibits the Agencies from now employing the more straightforward choice of an exemption-much like the existing and unchallenged exemption for churches.\"); Little Sisters Opp. at 17 (\"RFRA thus contemplates that the government may choose to grant discretionary benefits or exemptions to religious groups over and above those which are strictly required by RFRA.\"). As accurately summarized by the Little Sisters, the question is thus whether Congress has \"delegated authority to the agencies to create exemptions to protect religious exercise,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   such that RFRA \"operates as a floor on religious accommodation, not a ceiling.\" Little Sisters Opp. at 17.

The Court described this standard as limiting employers' discretion in making race-based decisions \"to cases in which there is a strong basis in evidence of disparate-impact liability,\" but said it was \"not so restrictive that it allows employers to act only when there is a provable, actual violation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p585\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p585\">\n    at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p585\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court \"h[e]ld only that under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of\n   avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p585\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p585\">\n    at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p585\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Court does not view\n   <em>\n    Ricci\n   </em>\n   as shedding any light on whether a federal agency has plenary discretion under RFRA to grant any exemption it chooses from an otherwise generally-applicable law passed by Congress.

The Court questions the Little Sisters' contention that RFRA effected a wholesale delegation to executive agencies of the power to create exemptions to laws of general applicability in the first instance, based entirely on their own view of what the law requires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   As this case definitively demonstrates, such views can change dramatically based on little more than a change in administration. In any event, there is no dispute that both the prior and current Administrations have contended that they have administered the ACA in a manner consistent with RFRA. But the courts are not concerned, at all, with the Federal Defendants' desire to \"avoid litigation,\" especially where that avoidance means depriving a large number of women of their statutory rights under the ACA. Rather, the courts have a duty to independently decide whether the Final Rules comport with statutory and Constitutional requirements, as they have done in many analogous cases involving RFRA, and the Court rejects the Federal Defendants' suggestion that \"an entity faced with potentially conflicting legal obligations should be afforded some leeway,\" Federal Opp. at 21. Ultimately, this Court (and quite possibly the Supreme Court) will have to decide the legal questions presented in this case, but no \"leeway\" will be given to the government's current position in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Moving to the substance of the issue, the Court first notes that the Ninth Circuit has held that a plaintiff's \"failure to demonstrate a substantial burden under RFRA necessarily means that [it has] failed to establish a violation of the Free Exercise Clause, as RFRA's prohibition on statutes that burden religion is stricter than that contained in the Free Exercise Clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Fernandez v.

That is one of the core disputes here: given its plain impact on women's entitlement to coverage under the ACA, is the Religious Exemption permissible under RFRA even if it is not mandated by RFRA?

Instead, the Final Rules on this point rest, at bottom, on new\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   assertions by the agencies.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 83 Fed.

Given the \"serious reliance interests\" of women who would lose coverage to which they are statutorily entitled if the Final Rules go into effect, the Court believes that Plaintiffs are also likely to prevail on their claim that the agencies failed to provide \"a reasoned explanation ... for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.\"\n   <em>\n    FCC v.

As this case proceeds to a merits determination, the Court will have to determine how to develop the relevant record regarding the compelling interest question. And the parties' positions on the legal issues described above will need to be laid out in substantially greater detail for the Court to sufficiently address the merits of this claim on a full record in the next stages of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the Moral Exemption is \"not in accordance with\" the ACA, and thus violates the APA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Further, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that the Moral Exemption is not in accordance with the ACA. In contrast to the Religious Exemption, there is no dispute that the Moral Exemption implicates neither RFRA nor the Religion Clauses of the Constitution. Despite this, Intervenor March for Life's brief focuses primarily on defending the Religious Exemption, to which March for Life is not entitled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March for Life Opp. at 3-4 (acknowledging that March for Life is a \"pro-life, non-religious entit[y]\";\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   March for Life Opp. at 6 (\"RFRA requires the religious exemption\"), 10 (\"[T]he Final Rules are an entirely permissible accommodation of religion, which as a general matter does not violate the Establishment Clause.\"), 10 (\"[T]he Final Rules do not compel women to participate in the religious beliefs of their employers, but rather merely ensure that a religious employer will not be conscripted to provide what his or her conscience will not permit.\"). The main purpose of the March for Life brief appears to be to establish that the Religious Exemption could not possibly run afoul of the Establishment Clause because the Moral Exemption exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (\"[T]he Final Rules protect both religious ... and non-religious ... actors, thereby dispelling any argument that the federal government intended to advance religious interests.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Whatever complexities may exist with regard to the Religious Exemption, as discussed above, they do not apply to the Moral Exemption. Congress mandated the coverage that is the subject matter of this dispute, and rejected a \"conscience amendment\" that would exempt entities like March for Life from this generally-applicable statutory requirement. The Final Rules note that \"[o]ver many decades, Congress has protected conscientious objections including based on moral convictions in the context of health care and human services, and including health coverage, even as it has sought to promote access to health services.\" 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,594. But that highlights the problem: here, it was the agencies, not Congress, that implemented the Moral Exemption, and it is inconsistent with the language and purpose of the statute it purports to interpret. The Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claim that the Moral Exemption is contrary to the ACA, and thus unlawful under the APA. Again, the Court does not dispute the sincerity, or minimize the substance, of March for Life's moral objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm unless the Court enjoins the Final Rules.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Court finds that the Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm unless the Final Rules are enjoined to maintain the status quo pending resolution of the case on the merits. In its order remanding this case, the Ninth Circuit found that \"it is reasonably probable that the states will suffer economic harm from the IFRs.\"\n   <em>\n    California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n    911 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   581 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/\">\n    at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The states show, with reasonable probability, that the IFRs will first lead to women losing employer-sponsored contraceptive coverage, which will then result in economic harm to the states.\").

The Final Rules themselves estimate that tens of thousands of women nationwide will lose contraceptive coverage, and suggest that these women may be able to obtain substitute services at Title X family-planning clinics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   83 Fed. Reg. at 57,551 n.26 (up to 126,400 women nationwide will lose coverage as result of Religious Exemption);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 57,551 (suggesting Title X family-planning clinics as alternative to insurer-provided contraceptives). The States have submitted substantial evidence documenting the fiscal harm that will flow to them as a result of the Final Rules.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cantwell Decl., Dkt. No. 174-4 \u00b6\u00b6 16-18 (Final Rules will result in more women becoming eligible for California's Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment program, meaning that \"state dollars may be diverted to provide\" contraceptive coverage); Tobias Decl., Dkt. No. 174-33 \u00b6 5 (exemptions in Final Rules \"will result in more women receiving\" New York Family Planning Program services, thus putting program at \"risk [of] being overwhelmed by the increase in patients\"); Rattay Decl., Dkt. No. 174-30 \u00b6 7 (Final Rules \"will contribute to an increase in Delaware's nationally high unintended pregnancy rate as women forego needed contraception and other services\"); Moracco Decl., Dkt. No. 174-23 \u00b6 5 (State of Minnesota \"may bear a financial risk when\n   women lose contraceptive coverage\" because state is obligated to pay for child delivery and newborn care for children born to low-income mothers). Thus, Plaintiffs have satisfied the irreparable harm prong of the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The balance of the equities tips sharply in Plaintiffs' favor, and the public interest favors granting preliminary injunctive relief to preserve the status quo pending resolution of the merits.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Plaintiffs also prevail on the balance of equities and public interest analyses. When the government is a party to a case in which a preliminary injunction is sought, the balance of the equities and public interest factors merge.\n   <em>\n    Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178991\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/1073/#p1092\">\n    747 F.3d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1092 (9th Cir. 2014). Broadly speaking, there are two interests at stake in that balance: the interest in ensuring that health plans cover contraceptive services with no cost-sharing, as provided for under the ACA, and the interest in protecting \"the sincerely held religious [and moral] objections of certain entities and individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   83 Fed. Reg. at 57,537 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   83 Fed. Reg. at 57,593.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   With these interests in mind, the Court concludes that the balance of equities tips sharply in Plaintiffs' favor. As the Court found previously, Plaintiffs face potentially dire public health and fiscal consequences from the implementation of the Final Rules. Plaintiffs point out that under the Final Rules, contraceptive coverage for employees and beneficiaries in existing health plans could be dropped with 60 days' notice that the employer is revoking its use of the accommodation process, or when a new plan year begins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 20. These changes likely will increase the Plaintiffs' costs of providing contraceptive care to their residents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Phuong H. Nguyen, Dkt. No. 174-26 \u00b6\u00b6 11-15 (Final Rules likely to increase demand for no- and low-cost contraception services funded by State of California); Declaration of Jennifer Welch, Dkt. No. 174-35 \u00b6\u00b6 10-12 (some women who lose insurer-provided contraceptive coverage as result of Final Rules likely to enroll in State of Illinois's Medicaid program). Plaintiffs persuasively submit that the suggestion in the Final Rules that women turn to Title X clinics actually will increase the number of women who will have to be covered by state programs. Mot. at 23 (citing Cantwell Decl., Dkt. No. 174-4 \u00b6\u00b6 16-18; Tobias Decl., Dkt. No. 174-33 \u00b6 5). Moreover, Plaintiffs face substantial costs stemming from a higher rate of unintended pregnancies that are likely to occur if women lose access to the seamless, no-cost contraceptive coverage afforded under the rules now in place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alexander-Scott Decl, Dkt. No. 174-7 \u00b6 3 (unintended pregnancies likely to result from Final Rules will impose costs on State of Rhode Island); Wilson Decl., Dkt. No. 174-38 \u00b6 5 (unintended pregnancies likely to result from Final Rules will impose costs on State of North Carolina). In essence, for many thousands of women in the Plaintiff States, the mandatory coverage structure now in place under the ACA will disappear, requiring them to piece together coverage from Title X clinics or state agencies, or to pay for such coverage themselves. This reality will cause substantial, and irreparable, harm to the Plaintiff States, and their showing compellingly establishes that the Final Rules do not in practice \"ensur[e] that women covered by petitioners' health plans 'receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zubik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596660\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1557/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   On the other hand, maintaining the status quo that preceded the Final Rules and the 2017 IFRs-in which eligible entities still would be permitted to avail themselves\n   of the exemption or the accommodation-does not constitute an equivalent harm to the Federal Defendants or Intervenors pending resolution of the merits.

On balance, because the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs are likely to show that the Final Rules are not mandated by RFRA, and that the existing accommodation does not substantially burden religious exercise, it finds that maintaining the status quo for the time being, pending a prompt resolution of the merits of Plaintiffs' claims, is warranted based on the record presented.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs have shown that the balance of equities tips sharply in their favor, and that the public interest favors granting a preliminary injunction.

In response to the Plaintiffs' challenge to the IFRs, the Court issued a nationwide injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 105 at 28-29.

As discussed at length above, the issues presented on this motion, much more than the notice-and-comment requirement that was the basis of the Court's prior order granting a preliminary injunction, implicate exactly these types of important and difficult questions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Court fully recognizes that limiting the scope of this injunction to the Plaintiff States means that women in other states are at risk of losing access to cost-free contraceptives when the Final Rules take effect. Plaintiffs also contend that women who reside in their States may still lose their entitlement to cost-free contraceptives because they receive their health insurance coverage from an employer or family member located elsewhere. But Plaintiffs provide little evidence of the effect this will have on their own States.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Dr. Jennifer Childs-Roshak, Dkt. No. 174-8 \u00b6 16 (discussing effect in Massachusetts); Declaration of Robert Pomales, Dkt. No. 174-28 \u00b6 9 (same); Mot. at 25 n.24 (California hosts 25,000 students from out-of-state and New York hosts 35,000). Plaintiffs do note that women who live in the Plaintiff States may live in one state but commute to another state for work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 15 n.17 (noting high percentage of Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and District of Columbia residents who commute to work in another state).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   On the present record, the Court cannot conclude that the high threshold set by the Ninth Circuit for a nationwide injunction, in light of the concerns articulated in the\n   <em>\n    California\n   </em>\n   opinion, has been met. The Court also finds it significant that a judge in the District of Massachusetts found in 2018 that the state lacked standing to proceed as to claims similar to those here, in\n   an order that has been appealed to the First Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v.

Mass. 2018). This parallel litigation highlights the potential direct legal conflicts that could result were this Court to enter a nationwide injunction.
