INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 6, 2018, the undersigned United States District Judge heard oral argument on Plaintiff Inline Packaging, LLC's (\"Inline\") Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Docket No. 540] and Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony [Docket No. 610]. Defendant Graphic Packaging International, LLC's (\"Graphic\") Motion for Summary Judgment [Docket No. 635], Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony [Docket No. 773], and Motion to Strike Pleading [Docket No. 788] were also heard on the same date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Additionally before the Court is Inline's Objection [Docket No. 538] to Magistrate Judge Leo I. Brisbois' March 8, 2018 Order\n   [Docket No. 534] denying Inline's Motion to Amend to Plead Punitive Damages [Docket No. 504]. For the reasons set forth below, Graphic Packaging's motion for summary judgment is granted, Inline's motion for partial summary judgment is denied, all other motions are denied as moot, and Inline's Objection is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Inline and Graphic compete in the susceptor food packaging industry. Compl. [Docket No. 1] \u00b6 2. Inline alleges Graphic is a monopolist in the United States susceptor food packaging market who has maintained its dominant position through a combination of anticompetitive tactics including unlawful discount bundling and sham intellectual property assertions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Inline contends that these tactics were employed in response to Inline's inroads at major food companies, and that Graphic's conduct has foreclosed Inline from selling to the market's largest purchasers of susceptor food packaging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Susceptor Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Susceptor food packaging is active food packaging that converts microwave energy to high surface temperatures which crisp and brown foods. Compl. \u00b6 60. Of the handful of companies that supply susceptor products in the U.S., Graphic holds by far the largest market share at approximately 95% of the market, and Inline is second with approximately 4.6%. Hicks Decl. [Docket No. 638] Ex. 2 [Docket No. 640] (\"Levinsohn Report\") Ex. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Inline and Graphic compete for supply contracts with consumer packaged goods food companies (\"CPGs\"). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. The five largest purchasers of susceptor products in the U.S. are Nestl\u00e9, Conagra, Heinz, Schwan's, and Pinnacle. Levinsohn Report \u00b6 187, Ex. 5. These five CPGs accounted for nearly 93% of U.S. susceptor sales in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Paperboard Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although Inline manufactures and sells only susceptor products, Graphic manufactures and sells paperboard/folding carton food packaging as well as susceptor products. Lindell Decl. [Docket No. 614] Ex. E [Docket No. 619] (\"Saravia Report\") \u00b6\u00b6 46-51. Graphic operates seven North American mills that produce paperboard to be used for manufacturing folding cartons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Graphic's paperboard customers include the five large CPGs listed above.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Graphic's revenue and profits from sales of paperboard to these five customers far exceed its revenue and profits from sales of susceptor products to these same CPGs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From 2010 to 2016, Graphic's revenue from paperboard sales to these CPGs was $1.9 billion, whereas its revenue from susceptor sales was $0.4 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Graphic's gross profits from paperboard sales to these customers was $0.8 billion over this time period, while its gross profits from sales of susceptors was $0.2 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Graphic faces intense competition in the paperboard market from WestRock (formerly RockTenn), International Paper, Burd &amp; Fletcher, and other regional and private label competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 53. In 2015, WestRock's reported revenue was $15.5 billion, which more than tripled Graphic's revenue of $4.3 billion for that year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Competition between Graphic, WestRock, and International Paper is intensified because these three firms are vertically integrated with paper mills.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. To cover the large fixed costs of running the mills while also offering competitive prices, the firms must operate the mills at full or close to full capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thus, these firms are dependent on and must compete for large paperboard orders that will enable them to operate more efficiently and offer lower prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Companies purchasing paperboard products employ strategies to encourage direct competition between paperboard suppliers to drive down prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Business is sometimes awarded through reverse auctions and by seeking multiple bids for new lines of products or before re-signing contracts for an existing line of products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, in early 2014, Heinz conducted an open market bid and reverse product auction on its folding carton volume, even though Graphic had an existing contract for that volume of products through April 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Graphic was successful in retaining the business, Heinz extracted a 5.8% price reduction on some products, with the reductions starting before the end of the original contract term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Customers also seek discounts and incentives that suppliers agree to in order to retain business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. This competition suggests that customers wield significant power in dictating contract terms and is likely one reason why Graphic's profit margins on paperboard products are lower than susceptor products, 9% to 23% for paperboard versus 32% to 46% for susceptors. Levinsohn Report \u00b6 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Graphic's Supply Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Graphic holds multi-year supply agreements with four of the five major CPGs for the supply of susceptor and paperboard products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 132-185; Hicks Decl. \u00b6 30. These contracts govern their purchases of susceptor and paperboard products from Graphic. Levinsohn Report \u00b6\u00b6 133, 144, 151, 158, 164, 168, 175, 179. The contracts, which extend from one to four years, are common in the industry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   Hicks Decl. Ex. 12 [Docket No. 650] (\"Jones Dep.\") 124:7-11; Hicks Decl. Ex. 14 [Docket No. 652] (\"Ferrara Dep.\") 95:12-12; Hicks Decl. Ex. 15 [Docket No. 653] (\"Dorman Dep.\") 142:17-144:1; 145:6-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   These supply contracts also include an array of financial incentives. For example, Graphic's supply agreement negotiated in 2010 with Heinz included price caps, price reductions, and improved payment terms for both paperboard and susceptor products. Levinsohn Report \u00b6 139. Graphic's 2012 contract with Schwan's included year-over-year price reductions and an annual rebate program that provided discounts for both paperboard and susceptor products if Schwan's purchased a target incremental amount of susceptor products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156. Graphic's 2014 contract with Conagra included fixed pricing, caps on paperboard price fluctuations, annual price reductions, and required Graphic to pay all tooling and die and equipment costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168. Graphic's 2014 amendment to its supply agreement with Pinnacle included a cap on paperboard prices, a $1.25 million signing bonus that Pinnacle would have to repay if it stopped purchasing from Graphic, and a commitment to pursue productivity improvements to reduce Pinnacle's costs by at least 4% each year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180. Similar contractual terms are common in the paperboard and susceptor industries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. 124:7-11; Ferrara Dep. 95:3-12; Dorman Dep. 145:13-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Graphic's 2010 contract with Heinz was contingent upon Graphic receiving Heinz's Smart Ones Artisan Pizza business, which was under contract with Inline at the time. Levinsohn Report \u00b6 136. During the negotiation period leading up to the 2010 Heinz contract, Graphic viewed Inline as a \"competitive threat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141. Graphic's internal emails from May 2009 reflect concern that Inline is \"pushing to get business at a major CPG[s] like Heinz, Nestl\u00e9, or Schwan [sic]. We want to keep them out of\n   these locations to limit their credibility and growth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Nestl\u00e9's Susceptor Sleeve Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Since at least 2005, Nestl\u00e9 has been one of Graphic's major customers. First Lorentz Decl. [Docket No. 543] Ex. 65 (\"Best Dep.\") 60:25-61:6. Unlike the other four large CPGs, however, Nestl\u00e9's purchases from Graphic are not covered by a supply agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2009, Graphic viewed Inline's competitive efforts to secure business from Nestl\u00e9 as having risen to a \"troubling level.\" First Lorentz Decl. Ex. 67 [Docket No 557]. Graphic understood that Nestl\u00e9 perceived Graphic's susceptor prices as \"very high\" because Graphic was \" 'unchecked' in the market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 68 [Docket No. 558]. In late 2011, Inline was successful in securing Nestl\u00e9's Kahiki susceptor sleeve\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   business for supply in 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 69 (\"Seefeldt Dep.\") 179:10-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   All of Nestl\u00e9's susceptor sleeve business-including the Kahiki line that Inline secured in 2012-was scheduled for renewal at the end of June 2014. Graphic was aware that Inline was a serious competitor for this business. First Lorentz Decl. Ex. 72 [Docket No. 561];\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 73 [Docket No. 562] at GPI 00104156. In the summer of 2013, Nestl\u00e9 sent requests for proposals (\"RFP\") to Graphic, Inline, and other suppliers that covered three Nestl\u00e9 product lines: Kahiki, Croissant Pocket, and Hot Pocket sleeves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 87 [Docket No. 575]; First Watkins Decl. [Docket No. 590] \u00b6 3. Nestl\u00e9 explained that the product specifications would be distributed through an online system called \"Ariba.\" First Watkins Decl. \u00b6 3. Suppliers would submit proposals through the Ariba system for Nestl\u00e9's review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If Nestl\u00e9 elected to award business on the basis of a RFP proposal, that decision would be communicated to the supplier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A [Docket No. 591].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Inline submitted RFP proposals for Nestl\u00e9's Kahiki, Croissant Pocket, and Hot Pocket susceptor sleeve business. Wolfe Decl. [Docket No. 600] \u00b6 4. Nestl\u00e9, however, elected not to award any business through the RFP process, but decided to conduct a one-day, best and final auction event on January 7, 2014 using the Ariba system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B [Docket No. 602].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Shortly before the auction, Inline received an email from Nestl\u00e9 stating that \"the Susceptors that you bid on in the previous RFP Susceptor Part I are going to be taken to a best and final auction.\" First Watkins Decl. \u00b6 6. The terms and conditions governing the auction provided that a two or three year contract would be awarded, that the lowest bid price does not guarantee a business award, and that a formal contract would be drafted after the auction that would take precedent over anything specified in the RFP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B [Docket No. 592].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Inline bid on five susceptor sleeve lots. First Watkins Decl. \u00b6 9. As bidding on each lot progressed on the Ariba system, participants were able to see if another supplier had submitted a lower bid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. If a lower bid had been received, there was an opportunity for suppliers to respond with another, lower bid of their own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This bidding activity occurred on lot 2, which was the Kahiki business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The back-and-forth competition resulted in a 20% reduction from the starting bid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For each the five susceptor sleeve lots on which Inline submitted bids, Inline's bid price was the lowest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Nestl\u00e9 communicated to Inline through the Ariba system that Inline had been awarded each of the five susceptor sleeve lots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12, Ex. F [Docket No. 596].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After the auction closed, Nestl\u00e9 informed Graphic that it intended to move its entire susceptor sleeve business to the lowest bidder. Seefeldt Dep. 230:13-23; First Lorentz Decl. Ex. 96 [Docket No. 583]. Nestl\u00e9 \"[e]xpressed disappointment in [Graphic's] lack of an aggressive move and the fact [Graphic] did not get aggressive in the auction.\" First Lorentz Decl. Ex. 96. Graphic viewed Nestl\u00e9's statement as an attempt to elicit a reaction from Graphic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Graphic intended to respond by \"send[ing] a very strong message to Nestl\u00e9 on how [Graphic] perceive[d] this underhanded move.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Graphic suspected Inline was the lowest bidder in the Ariba auction. First Lorentz Decl. Ex. 9 [Docket No. 546] (\"Voyzey Dep.\") 192:23-193:9. Graphic communicated to Nestl\u00e9 that it had patents on susceptor sleeves, and that a new supplier would likely be infringing those patents if Nestl\u00e9 elected to steer its susceptor business away from Graphic. Seefeldt Dep. 221:19-222:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On February 24, 2014, Nestl\u00e9 informed Inline that it was going to purchase only lots 2, 5 and 6, the Kahiki and Croissant Pocket sleeves, from Inline, representing about 10% of Nestl\u00e9's total susceptor sleeve business. First Lorentz Decl. Ex. 76 at 246:15-23; Ex. 99 [Docket No. 586] 68:6-8. Nestl\u00e9 awarded Graphic lots 3 and 4, the Hot Pocket product line, which were overwhelmingly Nestl\u00e9's largest susceptor sleeve lines. Voyzey Dep. 207:7-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Graphic's Patent Assertions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In December 2013, before the Ariba auction, Jeff Martinez (\"Martinez\"), Graphic's representative for the Nestl\u00e9 account, emailed Nestl\u00e9 and stated that at least two Graphic patents covered Nestl\u00e9 susceptor sleeves. Second Lorentz Decl. [Docket No. 824] Ex. 177 [Docket No. 888].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the auction ended, Graphic communicated to Nestl\u00e9 that Graphic's patents would likely be infringed if Nestl\u00e9 awarded any its susceptor sleeve business to Inline. Seefeldt Dep. 222:10-18; Voyzey Dep. 199:13-18. Because infringement threats can create concerns about the viability of a supplier and the impairment of Nestl\u00e9's supply chain, Nestl\u00e9 takes threats relating to intellectual property infringement \"very seriously.\" First Lorentz Decl. Ex. 101 [Docket No. 588] \u00b6 6. Graphic eventually did retain the Hot Pocket sleeve business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 97 [Docket No. 584]. After Inline lost the Hot Pocket business to Graphic, Nestl\u00e9 employee Judge stated to Inline's president, Jeffrey Watkins (\"Watkins\"), that Graphic had told Nestl\u00e9 that Inline would be infringing Graphic's patents if Inline were to become the supplier of the Hot Pocket packaging. Second Lorentz Decl. Ex. 167 [Docket No. 879] 256:21-257:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Shortly after Nestl\u00e9 awarded its 2014 business to Graphic and Inline, Graphic considered reminding Nestl\u00e9 of Graphic's patents on the susceptor sleeves, but decided that \"the patent issue will not force\n   Nestl\u00e9 to give us any more share or prevent them from bringing In Line [sic] in with a simple die change.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 184 [Docket No. 892]. Graphic decided instead to use the patent issue \"with In Line [sic] where the legal issue would be anyway.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   William Sedlacek (\"Sedlacek\") of Graphic suggested waiting until the current contract had nearly ended and then \"play the patent card.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Doing so would force Inline to \"requalify a revised die cut, essentially starting over again, having wasted time and expense while they pursue the current die cut.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In his deposition, Sedlacek defended this practice, describing waiting to \"play the patent card until it has the most impact and turmoil\" on Inline as \"competitive strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 185 [Docket No. 893] (\"Sedlacek Dep.\") 137:16-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On May 5, 2015, Graphic sent Inline a cease and desist letter asserting that Inline was infringing Graphic's intellectual property, specifically U.S. Patent Nos. 8,872,078 (the \" '078 Patent\") ; D694,106 ; D694,124 ; and D727,145 (collectively, the \"Asserted Patents\"), which related to Nestl\u00e9's susceptor sleeves. Second Lorentz Decl. Ex. 187 [Docket No. 895]. The letter stated that Graphic intended to serve Inline with a patent infringement lawsuit unless Inline cease all infringing activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The following day, Graphic notified Nestl\u00e9 about the cease and desist letter sent to Inline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 186 [Docket No. 894].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When considering Nestl\u00e9's 2016 business award, Nestl\u00e9's Andrew Leach (\"Leach\") recognized that \"Inline offered slightly higher savings although moving more volume away from [Graphic] would increase the likelihood of [Graphic] taking legal action on the perceived patent infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 191 [Docket No. 898]. Nestl\u00e9 eventually agreed to a three year extension with Graphic, which obligated Nestl\u00e9 to purchase at least 85% of its susceptor sleeve business from Graphic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 192 [Docket No. 899].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Origin of Asserted Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In 2005, Graphic obtained the Asserted Patents relating to susceptor sleeves. These are the same patents that Graphic asserted to Nestl\u00e9 before the Ariba auction and to Inline in 2015. Kelly Fitzwater (\"Fitzwater\"), a Graphic designer, is identified as the first and sole inventor of the Asserted Patents and their underlying applications. Because Inline challenges the validity of the Asserted Patents on inventorship grounds, their origin is reviewed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Asserted Patents represent the end result of susceptor sleeve redesigns. In the early 2000s, Corey Brower (\"Brower\"), a Nestl\u00e9 packaging engineer, was involved in Projects Quantum and Roxanne.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   First Lorentz Decl. Ex. 11 (\"Brower Dep.\") 15:11-16; 17:8-13. Project Quantum addressed increasing the filling within the Hot Pocket, and Project Roxanne was directed to increasing the portability of the Hot Pocket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   17:16-19:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Brower communicated with Graphic regarding particular sleeve design features that Nestl\u00e9 wanted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   33:9-12. After receiving instructions from Brower, Graphic would supply susceptor sleeve design samples to Nestl\u00e9, which Brower and others at Nestl\u00e9 would test and rate. Brower would then typically relay the suggested revisions\n   or changes back to Jeff Voyzey (\"Voyzey\") at Graphic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   33:14-36:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In a June 12, 2001 memo, Brower described Nestl\u00e9's interest in particular design concepts with tear strips, pillow packs, and gussets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   25:13-26:13; First Lorentz Decl.

Just as Graphic cannot have engaged in fraud on the PTO by failing to name someone from Nestl\u00e9 as a co-inventor when no one at Nestl\u00e9 claims to be a co-inventor, Graphic's pursuit of litigation on the Asserted Patents cannot be objectively baseless on inventorship grounds when no one at Nestl\u00e9 claims to be a co-inventor.

Finally, assume that A prices conditioner and shampoo at $5 and $3, respectively, if bought separately but at $3 and $2.25 if bought as part of a package.

In order for B to compete, however, it must persuade the customer to buy B's shampoo while purchasing its conditioner from A for $5. In order\n   to do that, B cannot charge more than $0.25 for shampoo, as the customer otherwise will find A's package cheaper than buying conditioner from A and shampoo from B.

Jan. 12, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Inline contends that its expert, Dr. Levinsohn, performed the discount attribution test for nine of Graphic's supply contracts with its customers and that all nine failed the discount attribution test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Levinsohn Report. Graphic disputes this conclusion and argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Inline's discount bundling claim because: (1) Graphic did not bundle susceptor and paperboard products; (2) Inline has not shown that Graphic has monopoly power in the leveraging market (paperboard); (3) the discount attribution test shows Graphic's susceptor price is above cost; and (4) the alleged bundles have not harmed competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Whether Graphic Bundled\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Graphic argues that it did not engage in bundling because the discounts on paperboard were not conditioned upon the purchase of susceptor packaging. Graphic contends that Inline leaps to the conclusion that whenever susceptors and paperboard are included in the same contract, any discount, rebate, or signing bonus in the contract was necessarily conditioned on the purchase of susceptors and would not have been available if only paperboard had been purchased. Graphic argues that this assumption lacks evidentiary support and is contradicted by the declarations and deposition testimony its customers. Several customers have testified that their discounts were not conditioned on the purchase of susceptors, and that it was the customer, not Graphic, who made the decision of which products to include in its purchase from Graphic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hicks Decl. Ex. 12 [Docket No. 650] (\"Jones Dep.\") 27:1-15, 109:1-111:9, 118:15-125:14; Hicks Decl. Ex. 13 [Docket No. 651] (\"Sitterly Dep.\") 180:18-181:4; Hicks Decl. Ex. 14 [Docket No. 652] (\"Ferrara Dep.\") 89:1-92:23, 97:5-17; Hick Decl. Ex. 15 [Docket No. 653] (\"Dorman Dep.\") 142:8-144:21. Thus, argues Graphic, discounts cannot constitute anticompetitive bundling when the customers ask for the discounts, deny that the discounts were conditioned on the purchase of susceptors, and deny that they were coerced into purchasing susceptors from Graphic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Inline responds that because this is not a tying case, it need not show that discounts on one product were expressly tied to the purchase of another product. This argument misses the mark. Although Inline need not show that a customer who purchased paperboard was required to also purchase susceptors (a traditional tying claim), Inline must show that if customers had purchased only paperboard (and no susceptor packaging) from Graphic, they would not have received any discount on their paperboard purchases. Thus, Inline must show that Graphic conditioned discounts and incentives on the purchase of susceptor and paperboard as a bundle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   That being said, Inline has adduced sufficient evidence to raise a fact issue about whether the discounts were conditioned on the purchase of susceptor and paperboard as a bundle. The supply contracts at issue include both paperboard and susceptor products as well as discount terms that are specific to those contracts. Levinsohn Report \u00b6 109; Hicks Decl. Exs. 28-36 [Docket Nos. 666-674] (Supply Agreements). Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Inline, a reasonable jury could conclude that the discounts were conditioned upon the purchase of both product categories as a discounted bundle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    b. No Monopoly or Market Power in Leveraging Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Graphic also argues that even if Inline could show that bundling occurred, a bundling claim requires the plaintiff to also show the defendant had monopoly power in the leveraging market (here, the paperboard market) and Inline has failed to do so. Inline responds that, although monopoly power or significant market power is required for a\n   <em>\n    tying\n   </em>\n   claim, the discount attribution test imposes no such requirement for a plaintiff to prevail on a discount bundling claim. Rather, contends Inline, courts look to the economic realities of a bundling claim to determine if the bundle is anticompetitive. Inline argues that the economic reality here is that Graphic's paperboard volume was so massive that even a small discount on the paperboard component of the bundle dwarfed any discount a single-product susceptor competitor could feasibly offer on the purchase of susceptors alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Tenth Circuit has recognized that there is no support in the caselaw for the proposition that the discount attribution test can properly be used to show coercion by a non-monopolist in the leveraging market.\n   <em>\n    Suture Express v.

However, Dr. Levinsohn provides no analysis of the documents, much less a conclusion stating what Graphic's market position is in the paperboard market. Additionally, Dr. Levinsohn conceded that he was \"not sure\" whether the market shares referenced in some of the documents pertained to both\n   paperboard and susceptor, or to paperboard only.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   52:5-16.

To the extent that this constitutes an expert opinion on Graphic's market power in paperboard, the opinion is untimely. Additionally, accounting margins are not reliable evidence of market power. 3 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 516f at 142 (\"[S]ubstantial accounting profits-say, 20%-may be consistent with trivial or zero economic profit and thus do not necessarily indicate any market power.\");\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

Thus, Inline has not produced sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Graphic had the necessary market power in the paperboard market to economically coerce a buyer into accepting the bundle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Inline's failure to show that Graphic had market power in the leveraging paperboard market is fatal to its bundling claim. \"[A]n essential element of unlawful package discounting is that the purchaser be 'forced' to take the bundle-which means that a rational, profit-maximizing buyer did not have good competitive options.\" 3A Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 749d3 at 326. The unrebutted evidence shows that a buyer does have good competitive options, because Graphic faces vigorous competition in the paperboard market. Thus, buyers are not coerced to take Graphic's bundle. Rather, they can purchase susceptors from Inline and purchase paperboard from another source at competitive prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Resisting this conclusion, Inline argues that market power in the leveraging market is not a required element of a bundling claim under\n   <em>\n    PeaceHealth\n   </em>\n   .

When the test is properly applied, it is undisputed that eight of the nine contracts pass the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As explained earlier, the discount attribution test is performed by allocating \"the full amount of the discounts given by the defendant on the bundle ... to the competitive product or products.\"\n   <em>\n    PeaceHealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645086\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/883/#p894\">\n    515 F.3d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the resulting price of the competitive product or products is below the defendant's average variable cost to produce them, the bundle has the potential to exclude an equally efficient rival who makes only the competitive product. However, if the resulting price of the competitive product remains above the defendant's cost to produce them, the bundle\n   falls into a safe harbor and is not actionable as exclusionary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645086\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/883/#p894\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645086\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/883/#p894\">\n    at 906, 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Here, Dr. Levinsohn allocated the full amount of the discounts on the bundle to only 20% of the competitive product (susceptors), rather than to the full amount of susceptors in the bundle. Levinsohn Report Ex. 7. Dr. Levinsohn explained that he allocated the discounts to only a fraction of the susceptors in the bundle because large buyers are unwilling to \"put all of their eggs in the basket\" of a susceptor manufacturer who has not previously supplied susceptors to a given buyer, and thus \"only a subset of a buyer's susceptor purchases are 'contestable' to an entrant.\" Levinsohn Report \u00b6 97. Dr. Levinsohn estimated the \"contestable share\" here to be 20% because \"Inline's share of a buyer's purchases ... never exceeds 20 percent in the first year of supply, and Inline never supplied more than one new product line to a large buyer in the first year of supply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645086\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/883/#p894\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under Dr. Levinsohn's \"contestable share\" variation of the discount attribution test, none of Graphic's contracts passed the test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97, 114, 148-49, 161-62, 171-72, 183-85, Ex. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   No precedent exists for Dr. Levinsohn's \"contestable share\" variation of the discount attribution test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the contestable share method might, in some instances, identify discount bundles that are capable of excluding an equally efficient rival who cannot contest all sales of the competitive product, the method is prone to error, would increase enforcement and litigation costs, and would chill procompetitive price cuts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barry Wright Corp. v.

[W]e must be concerned lest a rule or precedent that authorizes a search for a particular type of undesirable pricing behavior end up by discouraging legitimate price competition.\") (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The contestable share method is prone to error because it has the potential to condemn an overly broad category of bundled discounts that include non-predatory, above-cost discounts that could be matched by an equally efficient rival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   A modification of the earlier referenced shampoo/conditioner hypothetical illustrates this point. Suppose Firm A prices shampoo (the competitive product) at $3 and conditioner at $5 if purchased separately, and sells the products as a bundle for $7. Firm A's average variable cost for shampoo is $1.50. Under the\n   <em>\n    PeaceHealth\n   </em>\n   discount attribution test, the entire packaged discount, $1, would be subtracted from the shampoo price of $3, resulting in an effective price of $2, which is above Firm A's average variable cost. The bundled price of $7 thus passes the\n   <em>\n    PeaceHealth\n   </em>\n   test and falls within the safe harbor for packaged discounts that will not be condemned as anticompetitive, because the $7 bundle is not \"below the defendant's incremental cost\" and could be matched by an \"equally efficient producer of the competitive product.\"\n   <em>\n    PeaceHealth\n   </em>\n   at 909.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   However, the same $7 bundle would fail Dr. Levinsohn's \"contestable share\" test. For example, if Firm A sells 10 bundles of shampoo and conditioner, and the total discount of $10 ($1 per bundle \u00d7 10 bundles) were applied to only 20% of the shampoo sales (2 shampoos \u00d7 $3 = $6), the effective price of the two shampoos would be $-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The contestable share analysis would also add to enforcement costs by fueling litigation over the proper percentage of contestable shares. Mark S. Popofsky,\n   <em>\n    Section 2, Safe Harbors, and the Rule of Reason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Geo.%20Mason%20L.%20Rev.%201265\">\n    15 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1295 (2008). Here, for example, Graphic's expert, Dr. Saravia, opines that Dr. Levinsohn's selection of a 20% contestable share is flawed for at least three reasons: Inline has provided no evidence that it ever attempted to obtain more than 20% of a customer's susceptor purchases in the first year; there is no reason to assume that the asserted 20% first-year contestable share is appropriate to use during the entire term of the contracts; and if historic shares of\n   <em>\n    sales\n   </em>\n   volume rather than\n   <em>\n    unit\n   </em>\n   volume are measured, Inline's contestable share increases to over 40% for Inline's first-year contract with Schwan's. Saravia Report \u00b6\u00b6 99-108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Additionally, and perhaps most significantly, the contestable share analysis would chill competition by eliminating the safe harbor of the discount attribution test. As Dr. Levinsohn admits, \"[t]here is no basis to assume that Graphic would know exactly what portion of a buyer's demand is contestable to an entrant, and therefore there is no basis to assume Graphic would be able to exactly tailor its bundle offering to foreclose Inline with minimum amounts of discounts and incentives.\" Levinsohn Rebuttal at 19, n.74. Thus, it would be impossible for a seller to know whether its bundled discount conforms with antitrust law or has the potential to violate of the Sherman Act. The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that \"the costs of erroneous findings of predatory-pricing liability [a]re quite high because 'the mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricing-lowering prices-is the same mechanism by which a firm stimulates competition,' and, therefore, mistaken findings of liability would 'chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.' \"\n   <em>\n    Weyerhaeuser Co. v.

Additional Motions, Pending Objection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Because summary judgment is granted to Graphic on all claims, the parties'\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions, Graphic's Motion to Strike, and Inline's pending Objection are denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

[Docket No. 504, Attach 2] \u00b6\u00b6 29-37. The added paragraphs describe Graphic's supply contracts as \"bundled, exclusive requirements contracts\" which gave Graphic the right to supply a customer for a multiyear term, and allege that \"Graphic knew that the bundled requirements would tie up the vast majority of the market, thereby foreclosing Inline from selling susceptor food packaging to any contracted food company buyers, and that such a result would have anticompetitive effects.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 29, 35. However, exclusive dealing is not among the theories of liability listed in the Proposed Amended Complaint.
