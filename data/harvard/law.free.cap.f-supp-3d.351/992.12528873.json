Green Valley Mot. Summ. J. [# 100-9] at 2. Cibolo responded by offering to provide sewer service to GVDC for roughly $1.6 million under the terms of an Economic Development Agreement. Cibolo Preliminary Offer at 24-25. Cibolo did not specify when it would ostensibly begin providing service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201926\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After receiving the preliminary offer from Cibolo, GVDC withdrew its request that Green Valley provide sewer service and filed a petition with the PUC under Texas Water Code \u00a7 13.254(a-5) requesting decertification of GVDC's property from Green Valley's Sewer CCN.

GVDC Decertification Order at 11, 13. The PUC further determined that it could not consider whether removal of the GVDC Tract from Green Valley's CCN might violate federal law because \u00a7 13.254(a-6) prohibits the PUC from denying a petition \"based on the fact that a certificate holder is a borrower under a federal loan program.\" TEX.

[# 100-7] Ex. 2G (Cibolo Preliminary Certification Order) at 2-4 (concluding PUC lacks authority to adjudicate federal preemption issues). On these bases, the PUC approved GVDC's petition and decertified the GVDC Tract from Green Valley's CCN under \u00a7 13.254(a-5). GVDC Decertification Order at 11. The practical effect of this decertification was to revoke Green Valley's exclusive right to provide sewer service to the GVDC Tract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Present Federal Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In August 2017, Green Valley brought this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging GVDC, Schertz, and the PUC violated federal law by decertifying portions of Green Valley's CCN and thereby revoking Green Valley's exclusive right to provide service to the decertified areas. Compl. [# 1]. Specifically, Green Valley contends the PUC cannot decertify land from Green Valley's Sewer CCN because, under \u00a7 1926(b), the PUC may not \"curtail[ ] or limit[ ]\" service \"provided or made available\" by Green Valley under its Sewer CCN. Third Am. Compl. [# 89] at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On this basis, Green Valley seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the decertified areas to its Sewer CCN and to protect its Sewer CCN from further encroachment. For starters, Green Valley asks the Court to declare that provisions of the Texas Water Code prohibiting the PUC from considering \"the fact that a certificate holder is a borrower under a\n   federal loan program\" are preempted by \u00a7 1926(b).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; TEX.

Green Valley also asks the Court to enjoin the PUC from enforcing these provisions; to invalidate the GVDC and Schertz Decertification Orders; to command the PUC to reverse the GVDC and Schertz Decertification Orders; and to enjoin the PUC from further decertifying portions of Green Valley's Sewer CCN under Texas Water Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.254(a-5) and 13.255(b) - (c). Third Am. Compl. [# 89] at 14-16. Finally, Green Valley requests the Court enjoin GVDC from seeking sewer service from any service provider other than Green Valley and enjoin Schertz from either providing service to areas decertified from Green Valley's Sewer CCN or seeking to decertify additional areas of Green Valley's Sewer CCN under Texas Water Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.254(a-5) or 13.255(b) - (c).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   All parties now move for summary judgment on Green Valley's claims.

Concomitantly, of course, to the extent a utility does not fulfill its state law duty to provide continuous and adequate service under \u00a7 13.250(a), that utility has not provided or made available service under \u00a7 1926(b) and is not entitled to federal protection of its service area.

Because the PUC did not determine that Green Valley had failed to uphold its state law duty to provide service under \u00a7 13.250, Green Valley's state law duty remains intact.

Under \u00a7 1926(b), such service may not be curtailed or limited by inclusion of the area served within the boundaries of any municipal corporation-in this case, Schertz. The Court therefore grants Green Valley's motion for summary judgment on its \u00a7 1983 claim alleging GVDC and the PUC interfered with Green Valley's exclusive right to provide service to the GVDC Tract under \u00a7 1926(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Green Valley Mot. Summ. J. [# 100] at 10-12. And again, the parties' dispute centers on whether Green Valley made service available to the GVDC Tract under \u00a7 1926(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As the Court explained above in the context of the Schertz Decertification Order, a utility makes service available under \u00a7 1926(b) by incurring and upholding a state law duty to provide such service.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.B. Green Valley argues it has incurred a state law duty under Texas Water Code \u00a7 13.250 to provide \"continuous and adequate service\" within its service area. Green Valley Mot. Summ. J. [# 100] at 3. Further, Green Valley contends the GVDC Tract cannot be decertified from Green Valley's service area unless the PUC determines Green Valley has failed to fulfill its state law duty to provide continuous and adequate service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. In turn, GVDC argues that when the PUC found the GVDC Tract was not \"receiving\" service, it also implicitly concluded Green Valley had breached its state law duty to provide service. GVDC Mot. Summ. J. [# 120] at 5-7. Alternatively, GVDC argues the PUC's findings and Green Valley's discovery responses in this case demonstrate that Green Valley has not met its state law duty to provide continuous and adequate service under \u00a7 13.250.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The first question is whether the PUC implicitly concluded Green Valley had breached its state law duty to provide service to the GVDC Tract. It is undisputed that the PUC did not\n   <em>\n    explicitly\n   </em>\n   conclude Green Valley breached its state law duty to provide continuous and adequate service. The PUC did find, however, that the GVDC Tract was not \"receiving service\" as that term is used in Texas Water Code \u00a7 13.254(a-5). GVDC Decertification Order at 12-13. The Texas Water Code defines \"service\" as \"any act performed, anything furnished or supplied, and any facilities or lines committed or used by a retail public utility in the performance of its duties ....\" TEX. WATER CODE \u00a7 13.002(21). Although Green Valley had purchased 65 acres of land for construction of a permanent wastewater facility and applied for a discharge permit, the PUC concluded the GVDC Tract was not \"receiving service\" because Green Valley had neither \"performed acts or supplied anything\" to the GVDC Tract nor committed facilities or lines to providing service to the GVDC Tract. GVDC Decertification Order at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Of course, the immediate reason Green Valley did not perform any acts or supply anything to the GVDC Tract is that GVDC withdrew its request for service from Green Valley. On July 29, 2015, GVDC informed Green Valley that it had sixty days to produce \"a definitive commitment and agreement\" regarding the provision of wastewater service. GVDC Commitment Demand at 19-20. When Green Valley proved unable to produce such an agreement-presumably because GVDC was unwilling to agree to pay $3.6 million for\n   sewer service-GVDC withdrew its request for service and pursued a nearly identical request for service with Cibolo in hopes of receiving cheaper sewer service. Green Valley Mot. Summ. J. [# 100-9] at 2; GVDC Request Withdrawal; GVDC Resp. [# 102-1] Ex. 4 (Cibolo Offer) at 24-25 (suggesting GVDC and Cibolo pursue an \"economic development agreement\" whereby Cibolo would provide a wastewater line to the GVDC Tract for an initial outlay of $1.3 million).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This context makes clear that a failure to receive service does not necessarily entail a breach in a utility's duty to provide service. Green Valley avers that it stood ready to accommodate GVDC's wastewater needs as they arose, both an on expedited basis and through construction of a permanent wastewater treatment facility. Green Valley Commitment at 21-23. During the time GVDC's request for service was outstanding, the GVDC Tract did not receive service because GVDC had not agreed to pay for it. It is difficult to contemplate how, in these circumstances, GVDC's refusal to accept service might constitute a per se breach of Green Valley's duty to provide continuous and adequate service to consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even more to the point, it is immaterial whether the PUC's findings might support the conclusion that Green Valley did not meet its state law duty to provide service to the GVDC Tract, because the PUC did not reach that conclusion here. As explained above,\n   <em>\n    North Alamo\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cibolo\n   </em>\n   both suggest that a utility makes service available under \u00a7 1926(b) so long as its state law duty to provide service remains intact.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.B. In this instance, the PUC did not address whether Green Valley violated this duty, and as a result, Green Valley's state law duty remains inviolate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GVDC Decertification Order at 12-13. Until the PUC determines Green Valley has breached its state law duty to provide service, the existence of that duty means Green Valley is making service available to the GVDC Tract under \u00a7 1926(b).\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   GVDC argues that even if the PUC did not conclude Green Valley breached its state law duty, the PUC's findings and Green Valley's discovery responses in this case demonstrate that Green Valley has not provided continuous and adequate service to the GVDC Tract. GVDC Mot. Summ. J. [# 120] at 7-8. According to GVDC, it is irrelevant whether the PUC actually determined a breach of duty has occurred, because this Court can step into the shoes of the PUC and determine that Green Valley has not met its state law duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   It is not this Court's place to substitute its judgment on state law matters for that of the PUC. This case is not an appeal from the GVDC Decertification Order. Rather, it is a federal action brought under \u00a7 1983 to halt Defendants' interference with a federal right created by \u00a7 1926(b). Thus, while this Court might plausibly award equitable relief on the ground the GVDC Decertification Order interferes with a federal right, it lacks authority to adjudicate under state law the question of whether or not Green Valley has upheld its state law duty to provide service. Further, it is immaterial whether the facts are such that the PUC\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have concluded Green Valley did not uphold its duty to provide service because in this instance, the PUC did not do so. As the GVDC Decertification Order did not consider whether Green Valley had upheld its duty to provide service, that duty remains intact and Green Valley is making service available under \u00a7 1926(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cibolo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275466\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/339/#p343\">\n    866 F.3d at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This holding leaves GVDC with several avenues of recourse through which the GVDC Tract might be released from\n   Green Valley's Sewer CCN. Most obviously, the PUC might revoke or amend the Sewer CCN on the ground Green Valley has violated its state law duty to provide service because it has \"never provided, is no longer providing, is incapable of providing, or has failed to provide continuous and adequate service\" to consumers within its Sewer CCN. Tex. Water Code \u00a7 13.254(a)(1). Of course, the PUC did not make such a finding here. Under a similar statutory provision, the GVDC may petition the PUC for expedited release of the GVDC Tract from Green Valley's Sewer CCN upon a showing that Green Valley has either refused to provide or is incapable of providing service on a continuous and adequate basis as \"reasonably needed or requested by current and projected service demands in the area.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275466\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/339/#p343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13.254(a-1)(3). GVDC did not seek release under this provision, either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Instead, GVDC sought decertification under Texas Water Code \u00a7 13.254(a-5), and the resulting PUC order decertifying the GVDC Tract under \u00a7 13.254(a-5) did not consider whether or not Green Valley had fulfilled its state law duty to provide service. In this context, Green Valley's state law duty to provide service remains intact, and thus, Green Valley is making service available under \u00a7 1926(b). Such service may not be curtailed or limited by decertifying the GVDC Tract and then recertifying it to Cibolo. For this reason, the Court grants Green Valley's motion for summary judgment on its \u00a7 1983 claim alleging Schertz and the PUC interfered with Green Valley's exclusive right to provide service to the Schertz Acreage under \u00a7 1926(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court dismisses Green Valley's claim that \u00a7 1926(b) preempts Texas Water Code \u00a7 13.254(a-1) and grants summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Green Valley's claim that \u00a7 1926(b) preempts Texas Water Code \u00a7 13.254(a-6). Additionally, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of Green Valley on Green Valley's \u00a7 1983 claims and concludes the decertification of the GVDC Tract and Schertz Acreage violated Green Valley's exclusive right to provide service under \u00a7 1926(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that Green Valley's Motion for Summary Judgment [# 100] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as described in this opinion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Schertz's Motion for Summary Judgment [# 106] is DENIED as described in this opinion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that GVDC's Motion for Summary Judgment [# 120] is DENIED as described in this opinion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that the PUC's Motion for Summary Judgment [# 121] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as described in this opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    In the interest of consistency all page number citations refer to CM/ECF pagination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Schertz has at times suggested the PUC granted Schertz's application for decertification under \u00a7 13.254(a), rather than under \u00a7 13.255.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Schertz Mot.
