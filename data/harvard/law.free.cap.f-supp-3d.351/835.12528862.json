Naugle, and the Honorable Douglas G. Reichley. Warren primarily claims that the state court's failure to properly serve him with court orders and Judge Reichley's handling of a motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   he filed in state court violated his constitutional rights. Warren seeks to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis.\n   </em>\n   For the following reasons, the Court will grant Warren leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss his claims with the exception of his claims against Naugle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Warren filed a Writ of Quo Warranto in the Commonwealth Court, which was transferred to the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas (LCCCP). The respondents named in the writ filed preliminary objections and Warren filed preliminary objections in response. The court overruled Warren's preliminary objections. Naugle, in her capacity as Clerk of Judicial Records, mailed notice of the ruling to Warren.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Warren did not receive the notice and the mail was returned to the court. Naugle resent the mail to Warren, but it was again returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Warren learned of the court's ruling when he received a brief from the respondents in support of their preliminary objections, which discussed the ruling in connection with the procedural history of the case. Accordingly, Warren filed a notice with the court informing the court that he did not receive notice of the order. The docket reflects that Warren also filed a motion seeking to dismiss the respondents' preliminary objections. (Compl. at 22.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the court dismissed his case. Naugle mailed the court's dismissal order to Warren, but as with the last order, it was returned as undeliverable. Naugle re-mailed the order, but it was again returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After having failed to hear anything from the court, Warren requested a copy of the docket, which he received. He learned that his case had been dismissed and that he had not received the order. When he investigated, he learned from individuals in the prison mailroom that the mail from the court could not be delivered because it did not include Warren's inmate number on the envelope. According to the individuals in the mailroom, when mail is returned, the reason for the return is stamped on the envelope. Warren alleges that Naugle and the court were thus aware of the problem but failed to correct it by placing his inmate number on outgoing mail, thereby preventing him from being served with court orders. Warren also alleges that Naugle failed to comply with her duties under the relevant procedural rules by failing to serve him with court orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa. Code. \u00a7 236(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Warren filed a motion to reopen his case based on the court's failure to serve him with court orders. He did not receive a response for approximately three months, so he filed an application to appeal\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   seeking to appeal out of time due to the service failures. The court granted that motion because \"it appear[ed] likely that there was a breakdown in the Court's operation regarding [Warren's] ability to either obtain mail or file a timely appeal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the meantime, Warren initiated a civil action in the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Lehigh County, the Lehigh County Clerk of Judicial Court, and Andrea E. Naugle, apparently based on the service failures raised in the instant case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Judge Reichley, who was assigned to the case, denied Warren's motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and required him to pay the $175 fee to proceed with the action. Warren moved for reconsideration, but Judge Reichley \"disregarded\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   the motion and ordered the clerk to enter a judgment of\n   <em>\n    non pros.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Warren moved to reopen that judgment, but his filing was returned to him on the basis that if it was a new case, he was required to pay the fee or move for\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status and, if the document should have been filed in an existing case, it required a case number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) Judge Reichley subsequently denied the motion for reconsideration of\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on those allegations, Warren initiated the instant civil action claiming that the Defendants violated his right to access the courts and his due process rights. He also raises claims, apparently under Pennsylvania law, for \"obstruction of the administration of the law,\" \"breach of official duty,\" \"official oppression,\" negligence, and abuse of process. Warren seeks declaratory judgments stating that he has been wronged, an injunction directing the reopening of his civil action that was dismissed at the preliminary objection stage so that he may have an opportunity to respond to the dismissal order, and compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court will grant Warren leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   because it appears that he is not capable of paying the fees to commence this civil action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Complaint is subject to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B), which requires the Court to dismiss the Complaint if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim. Whether a complaint fails to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is governed by the same standard applicable to motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tourscher v.

It is not exactly clear what the \"Lehigh County Clerk of Judicial Courts\" refers to, but it is identified in the Complaint as \"a political subdivision within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\" with an address at the Lehigh County courthouse. (Compl. at 4.) Accordingly, it appears that this Defendant is a division of the state court that is also entitled to immunity from suit in federal court and is not a person for purposes of \u00a7 1983. The Court will therefore dismiss the claims against the \"Lehigh County Clerk of Judicial Courts.\" Furthermore, as any damages claims against Judge Reichley and Naugle in their official capacities are essentially claims against the court and its divisions, the Court will likewise dismiss any such claims brought against the individual Defendants in their official capacities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.C. v.
