Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Uber operates a rideshare app that allows users to request transportation and then connects them with a vehicle and a driver. [1] \u00b6 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Uber's services are available to people who download the app on their smartphones and open an account with a credit card. [1] \u00b6 21. Uber users can request specific kinds of rides, including some that vary in the type of vehicle that arrives. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 21-23. UberWAV is one of these special requests, which allows users to request a wheelchair-accessible vehicle. [1] \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Uber does not own the vehicles used for its rides, but it controls all aspects of the rides. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 5, 24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Uber sets requirements\n   for the type and age of vehicles, conducts mandatory vehicle inspections, and helps drivers arrange leases for Uber-approved vehicles. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28. Uber regulates its drivers by conducting background checks and setting requirements for drivers' age, experience, licensing, and driving records. [1] \u00b6 26. Uber instructs the drivers on the expected quality of the rides- issuing community guidelines, making recommendations about the amenities to stock in the vehicles and the radio station choice, and imposing cleanliness requirements. [1] \u00b6 28. Uber can deactivate drivers who break its rules. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Uber drivers and passengers do not negotiate the ride's fare; instead, Uber sets the cost of the trip using a certain formula. [1] \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Access Living of Metropolitan Chicago is a non-profit organization that advocates for people with disabilities, seeking to advance their civil rights and help them live more independently. [1] \u00b6 9. It offers independent living services, public education programs, and individualized and systemic advocacy, and it enforces civil rights on behalf of those with disabilities. [1] \u00b6 9. Fourteen percent of Access Living's employees and 20 percent of its board members either use a motorized wheelchair or cannot transfer to a standard vehicle from their manual wheelchairs. [1] \u00b6 10. Motorized wheelchairs are heavy and cannot fit into the trunk of a car, so they require ramps and lifts to be put inside vehicles. [1] \u00b6 8. Uber is \"virtually unavailable\" to people who use motorized wheelchairs-it provided them just 14 rides from September 2011 to August 2015. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 29, 56. The lack of accessible Uber rides requires Access Living to incur increased costs to transport its staff and board members who require accessible rides. [1] \u00b6 59. In August 2016, Access Living took this issue to Uber. [1] \u00b6 58. Access Living showed Uber the app, which at the time had no available accessible vehicles, and asked it to provide motorized-wheelchair users with services equivalent to those it offers others. [1] \u00b6 58. Uber responded that it had no intention of providing equivalent response times. [1] \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Michelle Garcia, Justin Cooper, and Rahnee Patrick are all Chicago residents who work or volunteer at Access Living, and they all have disabilities that require use of a motorized wheelchair. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 32-33, 38-39, 45. Patrick can usually transfer from her wheelchair to a standard vehicle, but her husband, who also uses a motorized wheelchair, cannot. [1] \u00b6 39. Garcia, Cooper, and Patrick want to use Uber (Patrick with her husband), and they have the smartphones and credit cards they need to do it. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 34, 44, 49. But none of them have downloaded the Uber app, because they believe that Uber does not provide equivalent services to people who use motorized wheelchairs. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 37, 44, 49. They each found out about the lack of accessible services in different ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Garcia heard from other motorized-wheelchair users at Access Living that they cannot use Uber because it does not have accessible vehicles, and Access Living colleagues showed Garcia the Uber app in September 2016, which at the time had just one accessible vehicle available in Chicago. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. Cooper once wanted to take an Uber ride to the mall, but he believed he could not because he had heard that Uber does not offer equivalent services to motorized-wheelchair users. [1] \u00b6 46. He believed that because he knew about an unsuccessful effort to pass an ordinance requiring equivalent service and that Uber was lobbying to be free of such a requirement. [1] \u00b6 47. In October 2016, Cooper saw the Uber app on someone else's phone, and the app showed no available accessible vehicles. [1] \u00b6 48. Patrick's husband downloaded Uber to take advantage of a promotion Uber offered for a\n   theater event, but he did not complete registration because his colleagues from the theater told him that Uber does not accommodate motorized-wheelchair users. [1] \u00b6 40-42. In October 2016, Patrick's husband saw a screenshot of the Uber app, showing that there were no available accessible vehicles. [1] \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege violations of the ADA and request declaratory and injunctive relief against Uber and its subsidiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Uber argues that none of the plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit. The constitution limits federal-court jurisdiction to controversies brought by plaintiffs who \"(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

Its reasoning is that the number of accessible vehicles available on the Uber app at any given moment is up to the drivers, since they control what vehicles they choose to drive and when. So, Uber argues, an injunction against Uber could not increase the number of accessible rides, because Uber does not control drivers' choices. But Uber's argument hinges on a fact not alleged in the complaint-that Uber drivers control which vehicles they use. Uber says that it is \"common knowledge\" that its drivers \"determine whether, when, where, how frequently, and with which vehicles to seek and accept ride requests via the Uber app.\" [112] at 16 (emphasis removed). It does not cite to allegations in the complaint for that factual assertion, and in making a facial challenge to standing, Uber cannot insert a factual allegation that contradicts plaintiffs' allegations by labeling it \"common knowledge.\" The complaint alleges that Uber does not own its drivers' cars, [1] \u00b6 5, but it also alleges that Uber \"maintains control over...the vehicle.\" [1] \u00b6 5.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6\u00b6 24 (\"Uber controls all aspects of its travel service.\"), 25 (\"Uber decides the type and maximum age of car for each of its services.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   But even if Uber drivers' own choices of vehicle are what cause plaintiffs' injuries, the cause can be attributed to Uber if its policies or actions have a determinative or coercive effect on the drivers' choices. The complaint alleges several ways Uber controls its drivers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6\u00b6 24-28. These allegations suggest that Uber drivers are not independent of Uber and, as a result, their choices do not break the chain of causation traceable to Uber. And if Uber caused plaintiffs' injuries, then an injunction against Uber-one that directs Uber to use its alleged control over drivers to cure the inadequate supply of wheelchair-accessible rides-is plausibly likely to redress the injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nor is Access Living's injury \"self-inflicted,\" even if it is not required to pay for its employees' transportation. \"Standing is defeated only if it is concluded that the injury is so completely due to the plaintiff's own fault as to break the causal chain.\" 13A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3531.5 (3d ed.). The complaint alleges that Access Living incurs \"increased costs\" to transport its employees due to Uber's discrimination, [1] \u00b6 59, suggesting that it paid transportation costs before Uber's discrimination and did not take up the practice only to self-inflict an injury.

Plaintiffs could be saying that Uber's services are not as useful for them as they are for others due to a lack of available\n   accessible vehicles-a challenge to the content of Uber's service. But the complaint could also be read to allege that Uber has denied plaintiffs meaningful access to Uber's transportation services by providing so few accessible vehicles. Without accessible vehicles that can actually transport them, plaintiffs are shut out of the service, effectively turned away due to their disabilities. Whether plaintiffs challenge access or content depends on how one describes Uber's services. Does Uber offer the service of providing a forum for requesting rides or the service of providing rides?\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this stage, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Uber is a transportation provider, and it is equal access to that service (not a particular type of transportation) that Uber has blocked.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [1] \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6, 73.

If Uber already knew that a reasonable modification was necessary to make its services accessible to plaintiffs and chose not to do so, requiring an express request from plaintiffs would serve no purpose. The complaint alleges that Access Living met with members of Uber's staff, showed them that the app offered no accessible vehicles in Chicago, and requested that they \"provide people requiring wheelchair accessible vehicles with equivalent service.\" [1] \u00b6 58. \"Uber responded that it had no intention of providing equivalent response times.\" [1] \u00b6 58. That meeting was sufficient to put Uber on notice that people like plaintiffs who need accessible vehicles required a modification to access their services-namely, more available accessible vehicles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Uber has cited no authority requiring plaintiffs to themselves each approach Uber to have the same conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Whether the requested modification is reasonable is a \"highly fact-specific inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    A.H. by Holzmueller v.

Without knowing more about Uber's business, and, as a result, the costs of any possible modifications that could result in more accessible vehicles for people with motorized wheelchairs, I cannot determine reasonableness on this motion. It is at least plausible that more accessible vehicles could be made available through reasonable measures. In fact, Uber provides some examples of its \"efforts to promote a sustainable WAV marketplace\" (though they are not alleged in the complaint), including working with third-party vendors to help drivers get accessible vehicles, marketing those opportunities to its drivers, and \"enhancing earning opportunities\" for drivers who provide accessible rides. [115] at 7. It is too early to say how reasonable it would be to require Uber to increase or continue any of these practices, but they demonstrate that plaintiffs' request for more accessible rides is at least plausibly reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Uber makes no argument about these claims, so they survive.

Uber argues that an entity meets that definition if its \"principal business is actually conveying passengers from place to place for money\" and that since Uber does not \"actually provide transportation,\" section 12184 does not apply to it. [115] at 18-19. Even if I accept Uber's definition, plaintiffs' allegations meet its terms. The complaint alleges that Uber \"operate[s] a travel service\"-it \"arranges rides between passengers and a fleet of drivers\" and \"maintains control over the cost, the vehicle, the driver qualifications, and the general ride experience for each trip.\" [1] \u00b6\u00b6 5, 72. These allegations are sufficient to raise a plausible inference that Uber is \"primarily engaged in the business of transporting people,\" and Uber's factual disagreement with this characterization of its business is immaterial at this stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Uber points out the complaint's allegation that Uber does not itself own or lease the vehicles, [1] \u00b6 5, but it has not pointed to anything suggesting that an entity must own or lease vehicles to be subject to section 12184.
