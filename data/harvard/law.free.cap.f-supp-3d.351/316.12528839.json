At step one, the ALJ determines whether the claimant is engaged\n   in substantial gainful work activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). If so, the claimant is not disabled. If not, the ALJ proceeds to step two and determines whether the claimant has an impairment, or combination of impairments, that is \"severe\" within the meaning of the Act, in that it imposes significant restrictions on the claimant's ability to perform basic work activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.1520(c). If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the analysis concludes with a finding of \"not disabled.\" If the claimant does have at least one severe impairment, the ALJ continues to step three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At step three, the ALJ examines whether a claimant's impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a listed impairment in Appendix 1 of Subpart P of Regulation No. 4 (the \"Listings\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.1520(d). If the impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a Listing and meets the durational requirement (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.1509), the claimant is disabled. If not, the ALJ determines the claimant's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), which is the ability to perform physical or mental work activities on a sustained basis, notwithstanding limitations for the collective impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.1520(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ALJ then proceeds to step four and determines whether the claimant's RFC permits the claimant to perform the requirements of his or her past relevant work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.1520(f).

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on September 30, 2015. (Dkt. 9 at 15). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity from his alleged onset date of December 24, 2012, through his date last insured of September 30, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of PTSD, depression, panic disorder, and alcohol abuse in remission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of pruritic rash, scabies infestation, and tremors were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 12.04, 12.06, and 12.09 in reaching his conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that, through the date last insured, Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels, with the additional non-exertional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   was able to do routine and repetitive tasks only. [Plaintiff] was unable to perform tasks requiring public contact or\n   more than occasional interactions with coworkers and supervisors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). At step four, the ALJ found that through the date last insured, Plaintiff was unable to perform any past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that through the date last insured, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of industrial sweeper/cleaner, motor vehicle assembler, motel cleaner, and packing line worker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act from the alleged onset date of December 24, 2012, through September 30, 2015, the date last insured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Commissioner's Determination is Supported by Substantial Evidence and Free from Legal Error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court has reviewed the record and considered the findings made by the Commissioner at steps one through five of the sequential evaluation. The ALJ's step one determination - that Plaintiff did not engage in substantial gainful work activity from his alleged onset date of December 24, 2012, through his date last insured of September 30, 2015 - is favorable to Plaintiff, and therefore cannot be a basis for remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Dec. 19, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The ALJ's step two determination also is favorable to Plaintiff, as the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had severe impairments, including PTSD, depression, panic disorder, and alcohol abuse in remission. (Dkt. 9 at 16). The ALJ's determination that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of pruritic rash, scabies infestation, and tremors were non-severe is supported by the record. As noted above, Plaintiff did not allege these impairments as contributing to his inability to work as of December 24, 2012 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 113), and he did not testify to any of these impairments at his January 2016 administrative hearing (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 88-100). Plaintiff complained of a rash on his hands and abdomen beginning in May 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 302). Amr Elsisi, M.D., diagnosed pruritic rash and prescribed a medication for itching and a topical ointment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 302-03). Plaintiff returned in June 2013, having not filled the prescriptions given by Dr. Elsisi. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 304). Rodrigo Samodal, M.D., diagnosed scabies infestation, and Plaintiff was directed to apply a cream treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 305). In July 2013, Plaintiff received a referral to dermatology to treat his rash. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 308). A physical examination in March 2014 revealed \"warm and dry\" skin, with \"no rash.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 311). There is no indication in the record that Plaintiff's rash and scabies rose to the level of being \"severe\" within the meaning of the Act, in that they imposed significant restrictions on Plaintiff's ability to perform basic work activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20208420\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.1520(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff began complaining of hand tremors in October 2015, which he said began six to seven years prior. (Dkt. 9 at 420). Plaintiff reported that his tremors had slowly gotten worse and were bothersome. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Erica Mendelsohn, PA, diagnosed benign essential tremors in Plaintiff's hands, and prescribed propranolol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 429). Like Plaintiff's rash, there is no indication in the record that the benign tremors rose to the level of a severe impairment and affected Plaintiff's ability to work. Accordingly, the ALJ's step two determination is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The ALJ's step three determination also was proper. The ALJ carefully considered the criteria of Listings 12.04 (depressive disorders ), 12.06\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders ), and 12.09 (substance abuse disorders). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). The ALJ considered each of Plaintiff's severe impairments in the context of the \"paragraph B\" criteria,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether Plaintiff's mental impairments resulted in at least two of the following: marked restrictions of activities of daily living; marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning; marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace; or repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ evaluated each of these four categories separately and cited to specific exhibits in the record supporting his determinations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ's conclusions that Plaintiff: had mild restrictions in his activities of daily living; moderate difficulties in social functioning; moderate difficulties for concentration, persistence, or pace; and had no episodes of decompensation for an extended duration, are supported by the medical record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Similarly, the ALJ considered whether the criteria of \"paragraph C\" were satisfied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). The ALJ properly concluded that the evidence did not support the presence of paragraph C criteria, in that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   there was no evidence to support that the claimant suffered from a residual disease process in that a small change in mental demands or environment caused him to decompensate. There were no repeated episodes of decompensation. No history was presented of a one or more years' inability to function outside a highly supportive living arrangement. The claimant's panic disorder and PTSD also did not result in complete inability to function independently outside the area of his home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on this information, the Court agrees that, in Plaintiff's case, the paragraph C criteria is not satisfied. Accordingly, the ALJ's step three determination is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The ALJ's RFC finding also is supported by substantial evidence. For example, in October 2014, T. Harding, the state agency medical consultant, opined that Plaintiff had moderate difficulties in maintaining social functioning and mild limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118). Dr. Harding also opined that Plaintiff was able to sustain attention and concentration for work, but not work closely with others (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 119) and retained the mental RFC \"for at least unskilled tasks\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 118). This supports Plaintiff's limitations for performing routine and repetitive tasks, avoiding contact with the public, and limiting contact with co-workers and supervisors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klotzbach v.

The ALJ gave little weight to the May 2012, May 2013, and September 2014 opinions of Dr. Barlow, Mr. Delaney, and Ms. Freeseman, respectively, that Plaintiff had marked restrictions in activities of daily living and maintaining social functioning, and frequent deficiencies in concentration, persistence or pace, resulting in a failure to complete tasks in a timely manner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). The ALJ noted that by October 2012, in his discharge evaluation and summary, Dr. Barlow found that Plaintiff's anxiety was not \"significantly interfering.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, 346;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 345 (noting that Plaintiff \"was stable at time of [discharge]. He had dealt with trauma related to police arrest. He was working on issues with his father. [Treatment] interrupted by relocation.\") ). The ALJ explained that he gave little weight to these opinions because they were inconsistent with the overall evidence in the record, including Plaintiff's ability \"to perform a modest range of daily activities, engage with family members and friends, answer memory related questions satisfactorily, and provide a detailed personal history to medical professionals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). The ALJ further explained that this evidence demonstrated that Plaintiff had mild restrictions in activities of daily living, and moderate difficulties in maintaining social functioning and maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ pointed to specific evidence in the record that called into question the validity of these opinions, and therefore adequately explained why he gave these opinions little weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ALJ gave little weight to the January 2016 opinion of Dr. Chen and Ms. Freeseman that Plaintiff would be off task more than 33 percent of the workday or absent more than three days per month, because there was \"no evidence\" supporting that opinion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). The January 8, 2016 opinion issued by Dr. Chen and Ms. Freeseman is contained in a two-page, check-box form.

The letter purports to be a \"comprehensive clinical report\" by Dr. Minotti, who has treated Plaintiff since he was ten years old. (Dkt. 13 at 1). The letter contains a thorough account of Plaintiff's hardships as a child through his teenage years (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3), Plaintiff's employment history (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4), and events from his adult life (including incidences during which he was treated wrongfully by police) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4) which contributed to his impairments. Dr. Minotti opined that Plaintiff's PTSD was \"triggered by employers not treating him fairly\" and \"rejecting him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The letter also contains the results of a March 6, 2018 questionnaire regarding Plaintiff's PTSD symptoms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-8). Dr. Minotti opined that Plaintiff is \"permanently disabled from his PTSD condition and therefore should be labeled as such by the Social Security Administration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). As an initial matter, while the Court appreciates Dr. Minotti's opinion that Plaintiff is permanently disabled, his opinion does not automatically translate to a disability as it is defined in the Act.

Moreover, despite the detailed nature of Dr. Minotti's letter, it does not contain any functional analysis from which Plaintiff's limitations for working could be assessed.

(Dkt. 9 at 26-27). Because he assessed additional limitations related to Plaintiff's mental functioning, the ALJ properly called a vocational expert to testify at the administrative hearing and relied on her testimony when making the step five determination.

In response to questioning by Plaintiff's attorney relating to contact with supervisors (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 103), the vocational expert testified that Plaintiff could still perform the above-mentioned occupations (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 105).
