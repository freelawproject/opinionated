Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is the Motion for Reconsideration (\"Motion\") (ECF No. 23) filed by Condemnee Stewart Merritts, Jr. Merritts filed a brief in support of his Motion. (ECF No. 24.) PennDOT did not respond to Merritts's Motion. For the reasons stated below, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Merritts owns two parcels of land in Frankstown Township, Pennsylvania, totaling 1.5 acres. (ECF No. 3 at 3-4.) In February 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (\"PennDOT\") informed Merritts that it would need to acquire a small portion of his land for a highway improvement project. (ECF No. 3-1 at 2.) PennDOT subsequently offered Merritts $500.00 to purchase a right-of-way to the land, which included a nearly 3,000 square foot temporary construction easement and a 1,150 square foot drainage easement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Merritts rejected PennDOT's offer, and made a counter offer which PennDOT declined. (ECF No. 3 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   PennDOT filed a Declaration of Taking in the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County, Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Merritts filed Preliminary Objections asserting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that PennDOT did not have the authority to condemn his property, that the taking was unconstitutional because it benefitted a private enterprise, and that the taking was excessive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 3-3 at 3-3 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   PennDOT responded by filing a Motion to Dismiss Merritts's Preliminary Objections and a Motion for Writ of Possession. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court of Common Pleas held oral argument. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court of Common Pleas then issued an opinion which denied and dismissed Merritts's Preliminary Objections, granted PennDOT's Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Writ of Possession, and awarded PennDOT possession of Merritts's property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Merritts appealed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Commonwealth Court received briefs and heard oral argument from both parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 26, 2018, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the decision of the Blair County Court of Common Pleas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 26, 2018-exactly thirty days after the Commonwealth Court's decision-Merritts filed a notice of removal. (ECF No. 1.) PennDOT did not challenge the removal, or even enter an initial appearance in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 13, 2018, Merritts filed a Petition to Stay Construction (ECF No. 5), which the Court interpreted as a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. The Court held a status conference on the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction on July 25, 2018. (ECF No. 12.) Counsel for both parties agreed that the Court should resolve the jurisdictional issue raised in PennDOT's Motion to Dismiss before deciding Merritts's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   PennDOT argued that the Court should dismiss Merritts's removal action for several reasons. First, PennDOT contended that Merritts improperly removed his case long after the 30-day statutory removal period expired. (ECF No. 9 at 6.) Second, PennDOT argued that the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine precludes the Court from possessing subject-matter jurisdiction over Merritts's case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Finally, PennDOT further asserted that the Court should abstain from hearing Merritts's case under\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burford v.

(ECF No. 18.) The Court held that (1) PennDOT waived any objection to the untimeliness of Merritts's removal by failing to object to removal within 30 days, (2) the Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine, (3) the Court should abstain from hearing the case under\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   , and (4) Merritts did not establish subject-matter jurisdiction under the well-pleaded complaint rule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366586\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/315/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, the Court remanded the case to state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Merritts filed the instant Motion (ECF No. 23) and brief in support (ECF No. 24) on September 27, 2018. Merritts argues that the Court erred in remanding the case to state court because there is subject-matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Merritts specifically argues that: (1) the Court improperly applied the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine, (2) the Court improperly applied\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   using non-precedential case law, (3) Merritts should be held to a less stringent pleading standard because he was a pro se litigant when this case began, and (4) removal was proper because Plaintiff PennDOT invoked federal jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 24.) The Court will address each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

But the record clearly shows the opposite. The Blair County Court of Common Pleas held oral argument on PennDOT's Motion for Writ of Possession and Merritts's Preliminary Objections, ordered the parties to\n   submit briefs on the issue, and then held an evidentiary hearing. (ECF No. 3 at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nonetheless, Merritts argues that his \"federal claims were never actually litigated in state court prior to the filing of the federal action.\" (ECF No. 24 at 4.) While unclear from his brief, the Court presumes that Merritts refers to his argument that the Commonwealth Court's decision violates the Fourteenth Amendment, which is an issue that he raises for the first time in federal court. However, the Third Circuit does not allow a party who lost in state court to raise new constitutional issues for the first time in a federal district court. The Third Circuit held that \"a plaintiff cannot ordinarily litigate one constitutional claim in state court and then raise a related constitutional claim in the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319261\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/321/#p329\">\n    385 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   329-30 (citing\n   <em>\n    Valenti v.

This constituted a final judgment because it entirely resolved the eminent-domain issue and permitted PennDOT to condemn parts of Merritts's property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 3-3.) Moreover, Pennsylvania law clearly establishes that a decision on a writ of possession is a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PA. R. CIV.

This argument is unconvincing, however, because\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   applies when a party who lost in state court asks a federal court to undo the state-court ruling, regardless of the type of relief sought in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/#p284\">\n    544 U.S. at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/#p284\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   does not apply if \"the federal plaintiff presents some independent claim, albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party.\"\n   <em>\n    Great W.

Here, Merritts's claim does not present an independent legal claim or ask the Court to reach an independent legal conclusion. Rather, his due-process claim is inextricably intertwined with the issues addressed by the Court of Common Pleas and the Commonwealth Court. In essence, Merritts asks this Court to review the Commonwealth Court's judgment and undo it by declaring PennDOT's condemnation of his property to be unconstitutional. The type of relief sought does not affect these conclusions. Therefore, Merritts's federal claim is barred by\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   even though he only seeks equitable remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Fourth, Merritts argues that \"the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine would not apply in this case as the title to Mr. Merritts's land was granted by previous foreign nations.\" (ECF No. 24 at 6.) Merritts argues his land was originally conveyed by Pennsylvania's then-Governor Robert Morris in 1755, which prevents the government from condemning it through eminent domain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 3 at 8-10.) The Commonwealth Court rejected this argument in its thorough opinion, which recited the state and federal law bases for eminent domain and rejected Merritts's argument. (ECF No. 3-3 at 10-14.) The Court agrees with the reasoning in the Commonwealth Court's opinion and can find no other basis for the proposition that the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine does not apply to property disputes involving the \"land of a superseded government.\" Under that rationale, all property disputes would be exempted from\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   so long as the land in question could be traced back to its pre-United States roots, which would be an absurd result. Therefore, the Court agrees with the Commonwealth Court's reasoning and rejects Merritts's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In sum, the Court finds Merritts's arguments on\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   to be unpersuasive. Thus, the Court finds that its prior\n   ruling was not manifestly unjust and will affirm its holding that the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine applies and precludes this Court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, Merritts's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to the Court's prior decision on\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Nor does Merritts point out which precedential cases the Court should have relied upon instead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Regardless, this argument is unpersuasive because the Court relied on five opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States, six published opinions of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and two district-court opinions in its Memorandum Opinion.

While\n   <em>\n    Quackenbush\n   </em>\n   did distinguish\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   , it did not overturn it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lewis Yelin,\n   <em>\n    Burford Abstention in Actions for Damages\n   </em>\n   , 99 COLUM.

(ECF No. 24 at 9.) The Court notes that pro se pleadings are generally construed liberally.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

(ECF No. 24 at 14.) But Merritts does not identify what aspect of PennDOT's brief to the Commonwealth Court made this case removable. The only federal question-whether the eminent-domain proceedings violated the Fourteenth Amendment-appears only in Merritts's defense to PennDOT's condemnation suit, and not on the face of PennDOT's Complaint. (ECF No. 3 at 2.) And PennDOT's brief to the Commonwealth Court does not appear to raise a distinctly federal issue. Rather, it appears that Merritts raised the federal constitutional issue in the Commonwealth Court by arguing that PennDOT did not have the legal authority to condemn his property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 3-3 at 15-18.) Accordingly, Merritts failed to sustain his burden to establish that the Court possesses subject-matter jurisdiction over his removal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, Merritts argues that \"removal was proper because PennDOT acknowledged that the taking of the [Merritts's] property was in connection with federal funds, law, policy, and regulations, with 80% of the funding for this highway road project federal funds [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] being provided by the Federal Highway Administration.\" (ECF No. 24 at 18.) But the involvement of federal funds in the highway condemnation is not addressed in PennDOT's Declaration of Taking (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 3-2), and therefore does not resolve the well-pleaded complaint issue Merritts faces.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. v.

Moreover, the involvement of federal funds in a case, by itself, is insufficient to establish federal question jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Virgin Islands Housing Auth. v.

And\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   allows district courts to decline to hear a case even where jurisdiction would otherwise be proper.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rucci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1164226\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/130/572/#p577\">\n    130 F. App'x at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, the Court again finds that Merrits's removal to this Court was improper. The Court further concludes that even if removal was proper, it would still not hear the case because of\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Felman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, the fourth argument in Merritts's Motion is unconvincing, and his Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in that respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court reaffirms that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this case.

As this passage indicates, Merrits contends that the state court's judgment condemning his property caused his injury. Accordingly, Merritts does not allege that the state-court judgment ratified, acquiesced in, or failed to punish a prior harm caused by PennDOT.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Shibles\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=730%20Fed.%20Appx.%20103\">\n     730 Fed.Appx. at 104-05\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Merritts cites a Pennsylvania statute, 42 PA.

In the same section of his brief, Merritts admits that \"the\n    <em>\n     Rooker-Felman\n    </em>\n    Doctrine has been applied to\n    <em>\n     final\n    </em>\n    decisions of lower state courts.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     N.V.
