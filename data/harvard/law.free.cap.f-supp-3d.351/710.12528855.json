The pertinent factual allegations, drawn from the complaint, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The principals of Winklevaus Capital Fund, LLC (\"WCF\"), Cameron and Tyler Winklevaus (collectively, \"the Winklevaus brothers\"), met Charles Shrem in 2012, shortly after Shrem had launched Bitlnstant, an online platform for buying and selling Bitcoin, a virtual currency. Compl., Dkt. 20, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11, 12. At that point, WCF had begun investigating investing in virtual currency, and Shrem offered to help WCF purchase Bitcoin, which was at that\n   time difficult to purchase in the amount that WCF wanted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13-15. Shrem told WCF that he could accomplish their desired purchases by buying at several different venues and spreading the purchases so as not to move the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. He offered to purchase Bitcoin for WCF \"at the best price\" without charging any fees for his services because his goal was to court an investment from WCF in Bitlnstant and use WCF's interest in Bitcoin to raise its public profile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In reliance on Shrem's representations, WCF sent Shrem a total of $750,000 between September 2012 and February 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Shrem had promised WCF an overall report once the Bitcoin were purchased, but did not share any accounting figures until January 31, 2013, and then only included half of the Bitcoin he had sent WCF in the summary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-24. WCF received 39,876.34 Bitcoin in exchange, at an average cost basis of $18.81 per Bitcoin, but suspected that the accounting for these purchases was inadequate and ceased working with Shrem to purchase Bitcoin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. At WCF's request, Shrem provided additional details and updates, but never provided a full accounting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-31. A friend of the Winklevoss brothers, who they had introduced to Shrem, also reported that he had noticed a shortfall when Shrem purchased Bitcoin for him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   WCF hired an accountant in February 2013 to perform an audit, and the auditor found that Shrem could not account for $61,000 sent to him, which was the equivalent of about 5,000 Bitcoin at the time based on the average price of $12.15 per Bitcoin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-36. Shrem disputed this, but never provided additional information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39. Another company hired by WCF identified that Shrem's Bitcoin address received 5,000 Bitcoin on December 31, 2012, almost exactly the amount of the shortfall identified by WCF's accountant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-44.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Analysis\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shrem moves to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and pursuant to Rule 12(b) (6) for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Charles Shrem's Motions to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed.

MTD at 5. The complaint seeks an award of compensatory damages calculated as the highest intermediate value of 5,000 Bitcoin between the time of wrongdoing and the time of trial, punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial, disgorgement of all things of value improperly obtained by Shrem to prevent unjust enrichment, attorneys' fees and costs, and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.

In addition to its claim for fraud, WCF brings claims for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive trust, and accounting - claims for which broad equitable remedies\n   are available that include monetary relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For instance, constructive trust remedies are \"measured by the defendant's gain rather than the plaintiff's loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Design Strategies, Inc. v.

Shrem claims that it was not misconduct to fail to purchase Bitcoin at the \"best price\" given the volatility of the market, but WCF is alleging that Shrem failed to purchase it on its behalf at all.

Shrem argues that his conduct, as alleged in the complaint, does not rise to the level required for punitive damages. MTD at 11.
