XIV, \u00a7 2. To that end, it mandates that an \"actual Enumeration\" be conducted \"every ... ten Years, in such Manner as [Congress] shall by Law direct,\" an effort commonly known as the census (or, more precisely, the decennial census).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. By its terms, therefore, the Constitution mandates that every ten years the federal government endeavor to count every single person residing in the United States, whether citizen or noncitizen, whether living here with legal status or without. The population count derived from that effort is used not only to apportion Representatives among the states, but also to draw political districts and allocate power within them. And it is used to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal, state, and local funds. Given the stakes, the interest in an accurate count is immense. Even small deviations from an\n   accurate count can have major implications for states, localities, and the people who live in them - indeed, for the country as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Since its inception in 1790, the decennial census also has been used for another purpose: to collect demographic data about the population of the United States, including information about respondents' race, sex, and age, and whether they own or rent their homes. Most relevant here, the government collected data about people's citizenship status from all households in the country in every census between 1820 and 1950 (with the exception of 1840). In 1960, however, the government stopped asking a citizenship question of every respondent, and for decades thereafter the official position of the Census Bureau was that reintroducing such a question was inadvisable because it would depress the count for already \"hard-to-count\" groups - particularly noncitizens and Hispanics - whose members would be less likely to participate in the census for fear that the data could be used against them or their loved ones. Every Secretary of Commerce (to whom Congress has long delegated significant authority over the census) adhered to that position - until early last year. On March 26, 2018, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. announced that he was reinstating the citizenship question on the 2020 census questionnaire, purportedly in response to a request from the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") for better citizenship data to assist in its enforcement of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\"VRA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He did so over the strenuous objections of the Census Bureau itself, which warned that adding a citizenship question would harm the quality of census data and increase costs significantly and that it would do so for no good reason because there was an alternative way to satisfy DOJ's purported needs that would not cause those harms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The question in these consolidated cases is whether Secretary Ross's decision to reinstate the citizenship question, and the process leading to that decision, violated provisions of statutory or constitutional law. Two sets of Plaintiffs - one, a coalition of eighteen states and the District of Columbia, fifteen cities and counties, and the United States Conference of Mayors (the \"Governmental Plaintiffs\"), and the other, a coalition of non-governmental organizations (the \"NGO Plaintiffs\") - challenge the decision on two principal grounds. First, they contend that the decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), which, among other things, prohibits federal agencies from acting in a manner that is arbitrary and capricious or not in accordance with law. Second, they allege that the decision violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it was motivated in part by invidious discrimination against immigrant communities of color. Defendants - the United States Department of Commerce; Secretary Ross (the \"Secretary\"); the Bureau of the Census (the \"Census Bureau\"); and the Director of the Census, Dr. Steven Dillingham\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   - have tried mightily to avoid a ruling on the merits of these claims. They asserted a slew of unsuccessful jurisdictional arguments, raised multiple challenges to this Court's decisions authorizing discovery beyond the administrative record collected and filed in this litigation (one of which is still pending before the United States Supreme\n   Court), and tried no fewer than fourteen times to halt the proceedings altogether. Between November 5 and 27, 2018, however, this Court held - and completed - an eight-day bench trial to resolve Plaintiffs' claims, taking direct testimony by affidavit from many witnesses and orally from others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This Opinion contains the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law following that trial. Broadly speaking, the Court reaches three legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Court holds that most, if not all, of Plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims. Specifically, they have proved by a preponderance of the evidence that they will be harmed in various ways as a result of the addition of a citizenship question on the census and that a favorable ruling here will redress those harms. Defendants' own documents and expert witness confirm that adding a citizenship question to the census will result in a significant reduction in self-response rates among noncitizen and Hispanic households. And expert testimony, based in large part on the Census Bureau's own analyses of past censuses, indicates that the Census Bureau's \"Non-Response Follow Up\" procedures, extensive though they will be, are unlikely to remedy that reduction in self-response rates, which means that hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people will go uncounted in the census if the citizenship question is included. The result will not only be a decrease in the quality of census data - something Defendants concede - but likely also a net differential undercount (that is, an undercount of certain sectors of the population, including people who live in households containing noncitizens and Hispanics, relative to others). That undercount, in turn, will translate into a loss of political power and funds, among other harms, for various Plaintiffs. In light of these and other factual findings, the Court holds that most, if not all, Plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes on the merits that Secretary Ross violated the APA in multiple independent ways. Most blatantly, Secretary Ross ignored, and violated, a statute that requires him, in circumstances like those here, to collect data through the acquisition and use of \"administrative records\"\n   <em>\n    instead\n   </em>\n   of through \"direct inquiries\" on a survey such as the census. Additionally, Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question was \"arbitrary and capricious\" on its own terms: He failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices - a veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut APA violations. On top of that, Secretary Ross acted without observing procedures required by law, including a statute requiring that he notify Congress of the subjects planned for any census at least three years in advance. And finally, the evidence establishes that Secretary Ross's stated rationale, to promote VRA enforcement, was pretextual - in other words, that he announced his decision in a manner that concealed its true basis rather than explaining it, as the APA required him to do. Notably, the Court reaches all of those conclusions based exclusively on the materials in the official \"Administrative Record\" - that is, the record of materials collected and submitted by Defendants that Secretary Ross allegedly considered, directly or indirectly, prior to making his decision. Looking beyond the Administrative Record merely confirms the Court's conclusions and illustrates how egregious the APA violations were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , on the merits of the constitutional claim, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs did not carry their burden of proving that Secretary Ross was motivated by invidious discrimination and thus that he violated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause. In particular, although the Court finds that Secretary Ross's decision\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   pretextual, it is unable to find, on the record before it, that the decision was a pretext\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   impermissible discrimination. To be fair to Plaintiffs, it is impossible to know if they could have carried their burden to prove such discriminatory intent had they been allowed to depose Secretary Ross, as the Court had authorized last September. As defense counsel more or less conceded during closing arguments, a deposition of Secretary Ross would have been the best evidence of the question at the heart of the due process inquiry - namely, the true nature of Secretary Ross's intent in reinstating the citizenship question. But this Court's order authorizing such a deposition was stayed by the Supreme Court pending its further review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623303,12623304,12623305,12623306,12623307,12623308\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/566/\">\n    139 S.Ct. 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623307,12623308,12623250,12623251,12623252,12623411\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/202/400/\">\n    202 L.Ed.2d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205458822\">\n    2018 WL 5458822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nov. 16, 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n    139 S.Ct. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12622660,12622661,12622630,12622601,12619666,12619667,12622648\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/202/306/\">\n    202 L.Ed.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (mem.), and Plaintiffs made the understandable decision to proceed with trial despite that stay (because, with the clock ticking on census preparations, waiting for a final ruling from the Supreme Court could have cost Plaintiffs a meaningful chance to obtain\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   relief). Be that as it may, it was - and remains - Plaintiffs' burden to prove discriminatory intent, and the evidence in the existing record does not support a conclusion that they carried that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court's Opinion is, to put it mildly, long. But that is for good reasons. For one thing, the Court has taken care to thoroughly examine every issue because the integrity of the census is a matter of national importance. As noted, the population count has massive and lasting consequences. And it occurs only once a decade, with no possibility of a do-over if it turns out to be flawed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, The Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, \u00a7 209(a)(8), Pub.

For another, time is of the essence because the Census Bureau needs to finalize the 2020 questionnaire by June of this year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 540, at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Brief for Petitioners at 45,\n   <em>\n    Department of Commerce v.

In 1960, twenty-five percent of households received the \"long-form\" questionnaire, while the remainder received the \"short-form.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Stat.%201012\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the 1970 and subsequent censuses, approximately one-sixth of all households received the \"long-form\" questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stips. \u00b6 31.

After the 2000 census, the Census Bureau introduced a new survey instrument, the American Community Survey (\"ACS\"). Joint Stips. \u00b6 37. Unlike the decennial census questionnaires, the ACS is conducted annually and not used to enumerate the population for apportionment purposes. It is distributed to about 3.5 million households (approximately two percent of households in the country) each year, for the sole purpose of collecting demographic data about the population. Since its inception, the ACS has included a question on citizenship. Joint Stips. \u00b6\u00b6 38-41. With the advent of the ACS, the Census Bureau phased out the \"long-form\" decennial census questionnaire. Joint Stips. \u00b6 37;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   JENNIFER D. WILLIAMS , THE 2010 DECENNIAL CENSUS: BACKGROUND AND ISSUES 3 (2011), https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/2010-background-crs.pdf. Thus,\n   the 2010 decennial census included only a single \"short-form\" questionnaire, distributed primarily by mail.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Stat.%201012\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So too, the 2020 census will be conducted with a single short-form questionnaire, which, for the first time, many respondents will complete online.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1091.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The modern decennial census begins with a Master Address File (\"MAF\"), a database containing every known housing unit in the country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2026643\">\n    83 Fed.

A majority of households self-respond to that questionnaire. To attempt to count the households that do not self-respond, the Census Bureau uses a set of procedures known as \"Non-Response Follow-Up\" or \"NRFU.\" Joint Stips. \u00b6 8. The first step in NRFU is an in-person visit from a census enumerator. Assuming that a household is listed in the MAF - a precondition for any NRFU efforts - a NRFU enumerator will visit any nonresponding household in person and, if possible, conduct the census survey face-to-face. In the 2020 census, if the NRFU enumerator's first visit is unsuccessful, but the Census Bureau believes the housing unit to be occupied, the Census Bureau will then refer to \"administrative records\" - data collected from other federal or state entities - to enumerate that household, assuming administrative records of sufficient quality exist. Joint Stips. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2026643\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 26649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the household cannot be enumerated with high-quality administrative records, a NRFU enumerator will return to the household for at least two more in-person attempts. Joint Stips. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. After three unsuccessful attempts to contact a member of the household in person, the NRFU enumerator will return and attempt to gather information from a \"proxy,\" such as a neighbor or landlord, who can report what he or she knows about the household and its members. Joint Stips. \u00b6\u00b6 11-13;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2026643\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 26649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, if enumeration-by-proxy fails, the Census Bureau will then \"impute\" either the number of household members or their characteristics (or both) based on already-existing data from the area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1281-82, 1304. In other words, the Census Bureau will use a formula to extrapolate what it does not know about the population from what it already knows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1351. Because NRFU data is less accurate than self-response data,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1281, the Census Bureau places a high priority on obtaining self-responses from as many households as possible,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 163-65. To that end, the Census Bureau partners with local organizations (which it refers to as \"Trusted Partners\") to encourage local households to self-respond.

Testing and Adding New Questions to the Census\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Census Bureau's longstanding opposition to a citizenship question on the census is consistent with a more general reluctance to tinker with the questionnaire unnecessarily. That is, although early census questionnaires changed regularly, a more sophisticated understanding of statistics and survey design in the modern era has caused the Census Bureau to approach any changes to the questionnaire with great care. For instance, after the 1990 census, the Census Bureau considered adding a question regarding respondents' Social Security Numbers (\"SSNs\") to the \"short-form\" questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 998-99. Before deciding to add such a question, however, the Census Bureau conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing a version of the questionnaire that asked about SSNs to one that did not in order to assess the question's impact on self-response rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 999. Overall, the Census Bureau observed a 3.4% decline in self-response rates attributable to the question, a decline that was not evenly distributed among subpopulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 999-1000. In part due to these results, the Census Bureau did not - and does not to this day - ask a question about SSNs on the decennial census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As the SSN example reflects, in recent decades, the Census Bureau has followed a fairly robust process in evaluating whether to add a new question to a survey such as the census. AR 9865, 9867; AR 3560; AR 3890-91; Docket No. 516-1 (\"Thompson Decl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 45, 47-49. The process usually begins with a request from Congress or an Executive Branch agency to add a question. AR 3890;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 2304. After receiving such a request, the Census Bureau works with the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\") to ensure that the proposed data collection would comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. AR 3890. If the Census Bureau determines that adding the new question is \"warranted,\" the Secretary of Commerce notifies Congress of his intent to add the question - first by including the subject of the question in the Section 141(f)(1) report to Congress, at least three years before the census date and, later, by reporting the question itself in the Section 141(f)(2) report, at least two years before the census date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Census Bureau must then test the wording of the new question.

Pre-testing requires approval from OMB and a process that includes notifying the public and inviting comment through a notice in the Federal Register.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the Census Bureau has responded to comments, OMB can approve the test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Once the question has been tested, the Census Bureau must redesign the questionnaires (or internet collection systems), including translation into non-English languages, and redevelop training procedures for enumerators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Census Bureau must submit the final questionnaire to OMB for approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   This process is subject to several sets of guidelines and standards governing collection of statistical data.

Sub-Requirement A2-3.3 of the Standards requires that \"[d]ata collection instruments and supporting materials\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be pretested with respondents to identify problems (e.g., problems related to content, order/context effects, skip instructions, formatting, navigation, and edits) and then refined, prior to implementation, based on the pretesting results.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (emphasis added). Sub-Requirements A2-3.3-1c and A2-3.3-1d further provide that pretesting must be performed when \"[r]eview by cognitive experts reveals that adding pretested questions to an existing instrument may cause potential context effects\" and when \"[a]n existing data collection instrument has substantive modifications (e.g., existing questions are revised or new questions added).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Standards note that, \"[o]n rare occasions, cost or schedule constraints may make it infeasible to perform complete pretesting. In such cases, subject matter and cognitive experts must discuss the need for and feasibility of pretesting. The program manager must document any decisions regarding such pretesting, including the reasons for the decision. If no acceptable options for pretesting can be identified, the program manager must apply for a waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Standards provide for another exception to the pretesting requirement: \"Pretesting is not required for questions that performed adequately in another survey.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Secretary Ross's Decision and This Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As noted above, the Census Act requires the Secretary of Commerce to submit a report to the relevant congressional committees at least three years before any given census listing the \"subjects proposed to be included, and the types of information to be compiled\" on the census.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). Consistent with that requirement, in March 2017 - approximately one month after his confirmation by the Senate - Secretary Ross submitted a report to Congress titled \"Subjects Planned for the 2020 Census and American Community Survey.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 194-270. The report listed as the planned subjects for the 2020 census questionnaire the very same subjects that had appeared on the 2010 census questionnaire: age, gender, race/ethnicity, relationship, and tenure (that is, whether the respondent's home in question is owned or rented).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 204-13. The list of subjects did not include citizenship status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   On March 26, 2018, however, Secretary Ross issued a memorandum directing the Census Bureau to reinstate a question about citizenship status on the 2020 census questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1313-20 (\"Ross Memo\"). In his memorandum, Secretary Ross asserted that his decision was\n   prompted by a letter from DOJ, dated December 12, 2017, which requested reinstatement of the citizenship question to facilitate enforcement of Section 2 of the VRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ross Memo 1, at AR 1313.

The Court denied the motions with respect to Plaintiffs' claims under the APA and the Due Process Clause, finding, among other things, that the NGO Plaintiffs had alleged a plausible claim of invidious discrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525715\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/766/#p776\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525715\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/766/#p776\">\n    at 806-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, the Court held that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Enumeration Clause. \"That conclusion,\" the Court reasoned, was \"compelled not only by the text of the Clause, which vests Congress with virtually unlimited discretion in conducting the census, but also by historical practice,\" namely \"that, since the very first census in 1790, the federal government has consistently used the decennial exercise not only to obtain a strict headcount ..., but also to gather demographic data about the population on matters such as race, sex, occupation, and, even citizenship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525715\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/766/#p776\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525715\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/766/#p776\">\n    at 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Second, around the same time, Plaintiffs moved for relief related to the \"Administrative Record\" - the record, compiled and submitted by Defendants, of materials \"upon which the Secretary of Commerce based his decision.\" Docket Nos. 173, 173-1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 193. To the extent relevant here, Plaintiffs moved for two forms of relief: first, an order compelling Defendants to \"complete\" the Administrative Record; and second, an order authorizing discovery \"outside\" the Administrative Record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 193, at 1. In an oral ruling on July 3, 2018, the Court granted both requests. With respect to the former, the Court found that the Administrative Record did not constitute the \"whole record\" - namely, the \"full scope of\" materials that Secretary Ross had considered, whether directly, \"indirectly,\" or \"constructively.\" Docket No. 208 (\"July 3rd Tr.\"), at 79-82. And with respect to the latter, the Court found that Plaintiffs had \"made a strong preliminary showing or\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that they will find material beyond the Administrative Record indicative of bad faith\" or pretext.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85. Notably, Defendants did not immediately challenge the Court's ruling authorizing discovery beyond the Administrative Record (and have never challenged its ruling with respect to completing the Administrative Record). Several months later, however, after the Court authorized depositions of Secretary Ross and a DOJ official, Defendants challenged those rulings by way of petitions for mandamus, tacking on a challenge to the Court's initial discovery Order.

In light of the pending Supreme Court challenge to the Court's decision authorizing extra-record discovery and the limited time to resolve Plaintiffs' claims before the 2020 census questionnaires need to be printed, the Court begins with an account that is based exclusively on the initially filed Administrative Record and then turns to what the evidence beyond that portion of the Administrative Record reveals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Defendants first filed what they characterized as the Administrative Record on June 8, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 173. That submission was 1,320 pages and included the December 12, 2017 DOJ letter requesting addition of a citizenship question to the census questionnaire; various analyses of that request by the Census Bureau; and Secretary Ross's March 26, 2018 memorandum. These pages reveal that the Census Bureau repeatedly and consistently recommended against addition of a citizenship question to the census questionnaire based on its assessment that adding the question would reduce self-response rates, thereby increasing costs and harming the overall data and integrity of the census,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that DOJ's stated interest in having more granular citizenship data could be satisfied in a less costly, more effective, and less harmful manner. More importantly, for the purposes of this Court's review, the initial Administrative Record submission alone contains overwhelming evidence to that effect, and none that contradicts it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The December 12, 2017 DOJ Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   2. Secretary Ross asserted in his March 26, 2018 memorandum that his decision to add the citizenship question to the census questionnaire was prompted by a December 12, 2017 letter from DOJ. The letter came from Arthur E. Gary of the Justice Management Division; it was addressed to then-Acting Director Jarmin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 663-65 (the \"Gary Letter\"); AR 1525-27 (same). In the letter, DOJ \"formally\n   request[ed] that the Census Bureau reinstate on the 2020 Census questionnaire a question regarding citizenship, formerly included on the so-called 'long form' census.\" Gary Letter 1, at AR 663. \"This data,\" the Letter stated, \"is critical to the Department's enforcement of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and its important protections against racial discrimination in voting. To fully enforce those requirements, the Department needs a reliable calculation of the citizen voting-age population in localities where voting rights violations are alleged or suspected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12622660,12622661,12622630,12622601,12619666,12619667,12622648\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/202/306/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   3. More specifically, the Gary Letter noted that the Supreme Court had \"held that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits 'vote dilution' by state and local jurisdictions engaged in redistricting, which can occur when a racial group is improperly deprived of a single-member district in which it could form a majority.\" Gary Letter 1, at AR 663 (citing\n   <em>\n    Thornburg v.

Further, \"[m]ultiple federal courts of appeals have held that, where citizenship rates are at issue in a vote-dilution case, citizen voting-age population\" - often referred to as \"CVAP\" - \"is the proper metric for determining whether a racial group could constitute a majority in a single-member district.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing cases). \"These cases,\" the Gary Letter reasoned, \"make clear that, in order to assess and enforce compliance with Section 2's protection against discrimination in voting, the Department needs to be able to obtain citizen voting-age population data for census blocks, block groups, counties, towns, and other locations where potential Section 2 violations are alleged or suspected.\" Gary Letter 2, at AR 664.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   4. The Gary Letter noted that DOJ had previously relied on citizenship data acquired through either the \"long form\" census questionnaire or the ACS.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p50\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Gary Letter asserted, however, that citizenship data acquired through the ACS is not \"ideal ... for such purposes\" for four reasons. Gary Letter at 2-3, at AR 664-65. First, \"[j]urisdictions conducting redistricting, and the Department in enforcing Section 2, already use the total population data from the census to determine compliance with the Constitution's one-person, one-vote requirement,\" such that \"using the ACS citizenship estimates means relying on two different data sets, the scope and level of detail of which vary quite significantly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, at AR 664. Second, ACS surveys are conducted annually and produce data that are \"aggregated into one-year, three-year, and five-year estimates,\" and thus \"do not align in time with the decennial census data,\" whereas \"[c]itizenship data from the decennial census ... would align in time with the ... data from the census that jurisdictions already use in redistricting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, at AR 665. Third, \"ACS estimates are reported at a ninety percent confidence level\" (that is, as a statistical sample with a margin of error that \"increases as the sample size - and thus, the geographic area - decreases\"), whereas \"decennial census data is a full count of the population.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And finally, decennial \"Census data is reported to the census block level, while the smallest unit reported in the ACS estimates is the census block group,\" requiring DOJ in some instances to \"perform further estimates\" of CVAP at the census block level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   5. \"For all of these reasons,\" the Gary Letter concluded, DOJ \"believes that decennial census questionnaire data regarding citizenship, if available, would be more appropriate for use in redistricting and in Section 2 litigation than the ACS citizenship estimates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On that basis, the Gary Letter \"formally request[ed]\" that the Census Bureau \"reinstate\" a citizenship question on the 2020 census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"At\n   the same time,\" however, the Gary Letter \"request[ed] that the [Census] Bureau also maintain the citizenship question on the ACS, since such question is necessary,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to yield information for the periodic determinations made by the Bureau under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Census Bureau's Preliminary Analyses and Recommendations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   6. Following receipt of the Gary Letter, experts at the Census Bureau - acting under the supervision of Dr. John M. Abowd, the Bureau's Chief Scientist and Associate Director for Research and Methodology - sought to determine the effects of adding a citizenship question to the census questionnaire and whether there were alternative means to satisfy DOJ's interest in more granular citizenship data. The Census Bureau's initial analyses and recommendations were memorialized in memoranda dated December 22, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 11634-45 (the \"December 22 Memo\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 5500-11 (copy of the same); January 3, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 5473-75 (the \"January 3 Memo\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and January 19, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1277-85 (the \"January 19 Memo\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   7. The December 22 Memo included two significant conclusions. First, the Memo opined that the Census Bureau could \"potentially\" obtain \"a more accurate measure of citizenship\" in a more \"cost efficient\" manner by using means other than a question on the census. December 22 Memo, at AR 11644. The Memo identified four existing surveys, including the ACS, through which the Census Bureau obtained \"directly reported\" citizenship data, as well as a slew of \"administrative record[s]\" (that is, records from other federal agencies or states) with similar information that the Census Bureau had or could acquire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 11634-35. The administrative records included Numident, a Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") dataset that represents \"the most complete and reliable administrative record source of citizenship data currently available,\" and citizenship data maintained by the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 11636, 11643-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   8. Second, the December 22 Memo concluded that including a citizenship question in the 2020 census questionnaire was likely to depress self-response rates, particularly among noncitizen households; increase costs; and produce lower quality citizenship data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 11639-45. The Memo explained that including a citizenship question could lower the rate of voluntary compliance, which would require expanded field operations that \"require additional unnecessary costs and burden to the Bureau.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 11644-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   9. The December 22 Memo recommended that the best way to \"support[ ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   redistricting in the manner requested by the Department of Justice is\" not to add a citizenship question to the census, but \"to make a citizenship variable available on the 2020 Census Edited File (CEF).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 11644. The CEF is \"the internal, confidential data file\" that underlies the census data set used by DOJ in redistricting, known as the \"PL94 tabulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . If citizenship were available on the CEF, the Memo explained, the PL94 tabulations could be restructured to include direct estimates of CVAP by race and ethnicity at the census block level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \"These tabulations would have essentially the same accuracy as current PL94 and Summary File 1 (SF1) data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   10. On the afternoon of December 22, 2017, Dr. Jarmin emailed Arthur Gary at DOJ, stating that \"the best way to provide PL94 block-level data with citizen voting population by race and ethnicity would be through utilizing a linked file of administrative and survey data the Census Bureau already possesses. This would result in higher quality data produced at lower cost.\" AR 3289.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   11. The January 3 Memo from Dr. Abowd to Dr. Jarmin expanded on the December 22 Memo's analyses and recommendations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 3 Memo, at AR 5473-75. The January 3 Memo described \"three alternatives for meeting the DoJ request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 5473.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   12. Under Alternative A, the Census Bureau would \"[m]aintain the status quo for data collection, preparation, and publication,\" but would prepare a \"special product\" for DOJ containing the Census Bureau's \"best estimate of block-level citizen voting age population by race and ethnicity,\" similar to what the Census Bureau prepares for use in connection with Section 203 of the VRA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alternative A would cost an extra $200,000 and would produce similar-quality data to that produced for Section 203 purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 5474.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   13. The January 3 Memo concluded that Alternative B - adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire - would \"most likely deliver higher quality block-level citizen voting age population by race and ethnicity data than Alternative A.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But it would cost an estimated additional $27.5 million and, based on an estimated minimum 5.1% decline in self-response among noncitizen households, would lead to an estimated minimum \"154,000\n   <em>\n    fewer\n   </em>\n   correct enumerations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   14. Finally, the January 3 Memo addressed Alternative C, the option the December 22 Memo had recommended (although not by that name).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 22 Memo, at AR 11644. Under Alternative C, the Census Bureau would not add a citizenship question to the questionnaire, but would \"[a]dd the capability to link an accurate, edited citizenship variable from administrative records to the final 2020 Census microdata files.\" January 3 Memo, at AR 5473. In that way, Alternative C would provide block-level tabulations of CVAP by race and ethnicity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It would deliver \"higher quality data than Alternative B for DoJ's stated uses\" because the \"primary data sources for the administrative record citizen variable require proof of\n   citizenship\" and, thus, are \"very accurate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 5475.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   15. Based on this analysis, the January 3 Memo opined that \"Alternative A is not very costly and does not harm the quality of the census count\"; that \"Alternative B better addresses DoJ's stated uses,\" but \"is very costly and does harm the quality of the census count\"; and that \"Alternative C even better meets DoJ's stated uses, is comparatively far less costly than Alternative B, and does not harm the quality of the census count.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"For these reasons,\" the Memo concluded, \"we recommend Alternative C for meeting the Department of Justice data request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   16. The January 19 Memo contained a \"Technical Review\" of the facts and the Census Bureau's analysis of Alternatives A, B, and C. January 19 Memo, at AR 1277-85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   17. The January 19 Memo described Alternative A in more detail, explaining that existing \"redistricting and CVAP data are used by the Department of Justice to enforce the Voting Rights Act\" and \"by state redistricting offices to draw congressional and legislative districts that conform to constitutional equal-population and Voting Rights Act nondiscrimination requirements. Because the block-group-level CVAP tables have associated margins of error, their use in combination with the much more precise block-level census counts in the redistricting data requires sophisticated modeling. For these purposes, most analysts and the DoJ use statistical modeling methods to produce the block-level eligible voter data that become one of the inputs to their processes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1279. Without modifying any of its other procedures, the January 19 Memo explained, the Census Bureau could deploy \"a small team of Census Bureau experts similar in size and capabilities to the teams used to provide the Voting Rights Act Section 203 language determinations\" to assist DOJ in making those calculations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The January 19 Memo updated the cost of Alternative A to $350,000, and estimated that it would \"have no impact on the quality of the 2020 Census.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   18. The January 19 Memo also presented an updated analysis of Alternative B.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1279-82. It explained bluntly that adding a citizenship question to the census \"is very costly, harms the quality of the census count, and would use substantially less accurate citizenship status data than are available from administrative sources.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1277. The Memo summarized \"[t]hree distinct analyses\" showing that the addition of a citizenship question would lead to \"an adverse impact on self-response\" to the census questionnaire and, consequently, \"on the accuracy and quality of the 2020 Census.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1280. First, the Memo described evidence that a citizenship question would increase \"item nonresponse rates\" - that is, omitted answers to the question - and would do so disproportionately among Hispanics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, the Memo described evidence that a citizenship question would decrease \"self-response rates\" - that is, the rate at which households voluntarily respond to the questionnaire - and would do so disproportionately among noncitizen households.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1280-81. Third, the Memo described evidence that a citizenship question would increase \"breakoff rates\" - that is, the rate at which households stop answering the questionnaire when they come to a particular question - and would do so disproportionately among Hispanics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1281.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   19. The updated analysis of Alternative B included more detail on its high cost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1281-82. The reduction in self-response rates caused by the citizenship question, the January 19 Memo explained, would lead to more people being counted\n   through the Census Bureau's NRFU (that is, Non-Response Follow-Up) procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1280. The greater use of NRFU procedures produces, in turn, lower-quality data because the NRFU procedures yield more \"erroneous enumerations\" and \"whole-person imputations\" than self-responses do.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1281.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using the \"conservative\" estimate that addition of a citizenship question would cause a 5.1% decline in self-response among noncitizen households, the January 19 Memo explained that adding a citizenship question would produce 432,000 fewer correct enumerations and would cost at least $27.5 million more.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1282. The Memo stressed that its estimates of the decline in data quality and increase in cost associated with Alternative C were \"conservative\" and that the true numbers could be \"much greater.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   20. The January 19 Memo also discussed Alternative C in more depth. It summarized the Census Bureau's evidence that Alternative C - linking a citizenship variable from administrative records to the census microdata files - \"is comparatively far less costly than Alternative B, does not increase response burden, and does not harm the quality of the census count.\" AR 1277. The Memo noted that the Census Bureau had been testing its ability to link administrative data to census data in that manner since the 1990 census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For the 2020 census, the Census Bureau had already begun \"regularly ingesting and loading administrative data from the Social Security Administration, Internal Revenue Service and other federal and state sources into the 2020 Census data systems.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   21. Significantly, in its analysis of Alternative C, the January 19 Memo again noted that Alternative C was likely to yield more accurate citizenship data than Alternative B would yield.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1277. First, the Memo explained that comparisons of ACS data and federal administrative records revealed that somewhere between 23.8% and 30% of people whom administrative records indicate are noncitizens report that they are citizens on the ACS.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1283. This suggests that self-reported citizenship status is of dubious accuracy. Second, the sampling techniques used for ACS data may not accurately predict the citizenship status of those who do not respond. The sampling techniques assume that those who do not respond to any given question are statistically similar to those who do - an assumption contradicted by the data.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1283-84. As a result, the ACS imputes citizenship responses based on data that is not predictive of the missing set.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   22. The January 19 Memo acknowledged that the Numident database might be missing citizenship data for older citizens who obtained SSNs before the SSA required proof of citizenship, for naturalized citizens who have not communicated the fact of their naturalization to the SSA, and for noncitizens who do not have a SSN or other taxpayer identification number.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1285. \"All three of these shortcomings,\" however, \"are addressed by adding data from [USCIS].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Memo concluded, \"the administrative records citizenship data would most likely have both more accurate citizen status\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   fewer missing individuals than would be the case for any survey-based collection method.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The January 19 Memo estimated that the cost of using administrative records to obtain block-level CVAP data would be between $500,000 and $2 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Secretary Ross's February 12, 2018 Meeting with the Census Bureau\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   23. On February 12, 2018, Secretary Ross met with Dr. Abowd and others from the Census Bureau to discuss the various alternatives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 9450. The Administrative Record contains only one document concerning what was discussed at the meeting: an email dated February 13, 2018, from an attendee at the meeting, \"identif[ying]\" action items and items for future consideration that were discussed at the meeting. AR 9450. The Administrative Record otherwise contains no record - contemporaneous or otherwise - of what was discussed during the meeting. Nor is there is any indication in the Administrative Record of any other meeting between Secretary Ross and Census Bureau officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   24. The Administrative Record does reveal that sometime before March 1, 2018, Secretary Ross asked the Census Bureau to analyze a fourth option - \"Alternative D\" - that would combine Alternative B (adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census) and Alternative C (relying on administrative records to generate block-level CVAP data).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1308-12 (\"March 1 Memo\"), at AR 1309.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Census Bureau's Analysis of Alternative D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   25. Dr. Abowd transmitted a detailed analysis of Alternative D to Secretary Ross in a memorandum dated March 1, 2018. The March 1 Memo explained at length that Alternative D (combining the addition of a citizenship question to the census with the use of administrative records) would entail \"all the negative cost and quality implications of Alternative B\" (that is, simply adding the citizenship question) and would still produce \"poorer quality citizenship data than Alternative C\" (that is, linking data from administrative records to data from the census).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 1 Memo at AR 1312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   26. The March 1 Memo described, first, how the various sources of administrative records interact to supplement and correct for one another's \"gaps.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1309-10. It then identified seven \"[r]emaining citizenship data gaps\" in the administrative records: (1) \"U.S. citizens from birth with no SSN or U.S. passport\"; (2) U.S. citizens from birth born outside the United States without a passport who applied for an SSN before they were required to provide proof of their citizenship to do so; (3) U.S. citizens naturalized before 2001 who did not inform the SSA of their naturalization; (4) U.S. citizens who were automatically naturalized if they were under eighteen when their parents were naturalized after 1999, but did not inform USCIS or receive a U.S. passport; (5) lawful permanent residents (\"LPRs\") who obtained that status before 2001, but lack an SSN or received an SSN before the SSA asked about citizenship; (6) noncitizen, non-LPR residents who do not have an SSN (or other taxpayer identification number) and who have not applied for a visa extension; and (7) persons for whom citizenship does appear in administrative records, but for whom it is not possible to link those records with decennial census data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1310-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   27. The March 1 Memo explained that, perhaps counterintuitively, \"survey data\" (that is, data from a citizenship question) would not \"help fill the ... gaps\" in the administrative records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1311.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   This is because a \"significant, but unknown, fraction\" of people whose citizenship status is unknown fall into \"Category Six\": noncitizen, non-LPR residents without SSNs or taxpayer IDs. These people have a \"strong incentive to provide an incorrect answer\" or no answer to a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . And, because \"there is no feasible method of independently verifying their non-citizen status,\" identifying false reports of citizenship on the census would be \"an inexact science.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Instead of doing that inexact science, the \"survey response[s] of 'citizen' would be accepted as valid\" for large numbers of people who are not, in fact, citizens.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Making matters worse, if a household does not self-respond in order to protect one household member in Category Six, this problem would apply to the entire household.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1311-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   28. Second, the March 1 Memo explained that, like Alternative B, Alternative D would lower self-response rates and \"push[ ] more households into ... NRFU.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1311. That would lower the quality of the data in two ways. First, as explained above, NRFU procedures yield more \"erroneous enumerations\" and \"whole-person imputations\" than self-responses do. January 19 Memo, at AR 1281. Second, NRFU procedures produce more responses that cannot be linked to administrative records (due to lower-quality personal identifying information) and linking to administrative records helps improve the accuracy of the survey data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 1 Memo, at AR 1311. For responses gathered through NRFU procedures, only 81.6% can be linked to people recorded in administrative records, compared to 96.7% for self-responses in the 2010 census.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   29. Additionally, the March 1 Memo concluded that Alternative D would likely increase the number of proxy responses required, another less accurate type of enumeration.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   This is because those who do not self-respond because of the presence of the citizenship question are especially likely not to respond in NRFU as well.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Proxy responses also lead to even lower rates of linkage to administrative data on citizenship: only 33.8%.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   30. The March 1 Memo concluded that Alternative D was plainly inferior to Alternative C: It \"would result in poorer quality citizenship data than Alternative C,\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   it \"would still have all the negative cost and quality implications of Alternative B\" summarized in the January 19 Memo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1312. The March 1 Memo remarked that \"[u]sing the 2020 Census data only to fill in gaps for persons without administrative data on citizenship would raise questions about why 100 percent of respondents are being burdened by a citizenship question to obtain information for the two percent of respondents where it is missing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   31. In another memorandum, undated but obviously written in this same March 2018 timeframe, Dr. Abowd presented Secretary Ross with numerical estimates illustrating the differences between Alternative C and Alternative D.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1304-06 (\"Key Differences Memo\"). The Key Differences Memo illustrated that, under Alternative C, the Census Bureau expected to link 295 million people - 89.4% of the population - to high-quality citizenship data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1306. It would be unable to identify the citizenship status of 35 million people through linking, leaving those to be modeled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Key Differences Memo illustrated these numbers for Alternative C in the following flowchart:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   AR 1306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   32. The Key Difference Memo explained that, under Alternative D, the Census Bureau expected to receive responses to the citizenship question from 294.6 million people.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1307. Of those responses, 263 million could be confirmed through linkages to administrative records; 9.5 million responses could be linked to,\n   <em>\n    but would be inconsistent with\n   </em>\n   , citizenship data in administrative records; and 22.2 million responses would not be linked to administrative records at all.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   On top of that, the Census Bureau expected that approximately 35.4 million people's citizenship would not be measured by the 2020 census, either due to non-response or NRFU failure.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Approximately 21.5 million non-respondents could be linked to administrative records containing citizenship data, while approximately 13.8 million would have to have their citizenship status modeled.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Once again, the Key Differences Memo illustrated the numbers for Alternative D with a flowchart:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   AR 1307.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   33. These numbers reveal that Alternative D would produce\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   people who\n   could not be linked to administrative records: 36 million people in Alternative D as compared to 35 million in Alternative C.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1306-07. Of the unlinked people in Alternative D, 13.8 million would have their citizenship modeled (or \"imputed\"),\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1307, while 22.2 million would have their citizenship status evaluated through their census responses, despite the known likelihood that a high rate of noncitizens (just under 500,000, according to the Census Bureau's estimate) would be incorrectly enumerated as citizens through the survey process.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1305-07; March 1 Memo, at AR 1311. That would leave 9.5 million people whose census responses would conflict with administrative records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Key Differences Memo, at AR 1307. For these people, the \"[h]istoric Census Bureau practice is to use self-reported data in these situations,\" even though \"the Census Bureau now knows from linking ACS responses on citizenship to administrative data that nearly one third of noncitizens in the administrative data respond to the questionnaire indicating they are citizens, indicating that this practice should be revisited in the case of measuring citizenship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1305.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   34. Put differently, Alternative D would provide no improvement to the citizenship data available under Alternative C for 90.4% of the population. For 6.7% of the population, Alternative D would produce\n   <em>\n    lower\n   </em>\n   quality data than Alternative C because the Census Bureau would have to use survey responses that are, generally speaking, less accurate than the imputation methods the Census Bureau would deploy under Alternative C.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   And finally, for 2.9% of the population, Alternative D would create a problem that would not exist under Alternative C: conflicts between the survey data and the administrative data, with no reliable method for discerning accurate data amidst the conflict.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   35. The Key Differences Memo summarized the implications of these comparative predictions. He acknowledged that \"all possible measurement methods will have errors\" and that the Census Bureau \"cannot quantify the relative magnitude of the errors across the alternatives at this time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1305. Nevertheless, Alternative C would involve some risk of error in the administrative record data, but that would be \"relatively limited\" thanks to the procedures used by the SSA, USCIS, and the State Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alternative C would also be subject to some prediction error in the 35 million cases that would have to be modeled, which would be a similar, but lesser issue in Alternative D.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By contrast, Alternative D would be subject to an error that is \"only an issue in Alternative D\": the \"response error.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Abowd noted that while \"[s]tatisticians often hope\" that such response errors \"are random and cancel out,\" the Census Bureau \"know[s] from prior research\" that they are \"systematically biased for a subset of noncitizens.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Communications with Stakeholders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   36. While the Census Bureau was analyzing the citizenship question, the Commerce Department was communicating with stakeholders about the question. At the February 12, 2018 meeting with Dr. Abowd and other representatives of the Census Bureau, Secretary Ross requested a list of stakeholders with whom to discuss the addition of the citizenship question to the census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 9450. During the outreach to stakeholders after the meeting, however, Commerce Department officials struggled to find anyone willing to express support for adding the question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 3274-75 (\"Email re AEI\"); AR 4853-55 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   37. For example, on February 13, 2018 - only one day after the meeting with Secretary Ross - Dr. Jarmin emailed someone at the American Enterprise Institute (\"AEI\"): \"We are trying to set up some meetings for Secretary Ross to discuss the proposed citizenship question on the 2020 Census with interested stakeholders.\n   <em>\n    Most stakeholders will speak against the proposal. We're looking to find someone thoughtful who can speak to the pros of adding such a question\n   </em>\n   .\" Email re AEI, at AR 3275 (emphasis added). Later the same day, Michael Strain of the AEI responded: \"None of my colleagues at AEI would speak favorably about the proposal. Is it important that the person actually be in favor of the proposal?\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   38. Dr. Jarmin responded the same day, noting: \"We are trying to find someone who can give a professional expression of support for the proposal in contrast to the many folks we can find to give professional statements against the proposal. Interesting, but perhaps not so surprising, that no one at AEI is willing to do that.\" AR 8325. Less than two minutes later, Dr. Jarmin forwarded his email exchange with the AEI to then-Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, Karen Dunn Kelley, noting: \"Appears no one at AEI willing to speak in favor of putting question on the 2020.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 3274.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Administrative Record reflects that only two organizations supported the citizenship question: the Center for Immigration Studies and the Heritage Foundation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1206; AR 8325.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   39. By contrast, between December 12, 2017 (the date of the Gary Letter) and March 26, 2018 (the date of Secretary Ross's decision), the Commerce Department received many communications opposing addition of a citizenship question to the census, from former directors of the Census Bureau, business groups, civil rights groups, social science groups, members of Congress, and state and local officials.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Joint Proposed Post-Trial Findings of Fact, Docket No. 545 (\"Pls.'

For instance, on January 5, 2018, the American Sociological Association (\"ASA\") wrote to Secretary Ross to urge him to reject DOJ's proposal to add a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 787. The ASA letter predicted that if a citizenship question were added, \"the integrity of the 2020 Census data will be fundamentally compromised.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Including a citizenship question,\" the ASA continued, \"is likely to keep some people from responding to the questionnaire and others from responding truthfully, thereby undermining the accuracy of the data. In addition ..., [w]ith little time left before the 2020 launch, a new question could not be subject to standard rigorous testing, which would further undermine the quality of the data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   41. Similarly, on January 9, 2018, members of the Census Scientific Advisory Committee (\"CSAC\") wrote to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary Ross, and others, calling inclusion of a citizenship question \"a serious mistake which would result in a substantial lowering of the response rate.\" AR 794. The CSAC members noted that \"[a]dding a citizenship question to the main Census questionnaire is almost certain to jeopardize the cooperation of at least some community partners and lead to a lower response rate, hurting the reputation of the Census Bureau.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 794-95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   42. On January 10, 2018, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights (the \"Leadership Conference\") wrote to \"urge\" Secretary Ross \"to reject the Department of Justice's untimely and unnecessary request for a new citizenship question on the 2020 Census, which would threaten a fair and accurate decennial census.\" AR 798. Adding a citizenship question \"would destroy any chance for an accurate count, discard years of careful research, and increase costs significantly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the Leadership Conference continued, adding a citizenship question was \"unnecessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 799. \"The Justice Department has never needed to add this new question to the decennial census to enforce the Voting Rights Act before, so there is no reason it would need to do so now.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   43. On January 26, 2018, Secretary Ross received a letter from six former Directors of the Census Bureau - John Thompson, Robert Groves, Steven Murdock, Kenneth Prewitt, Martha Farnsworth Riche, and Vincent Barabba - expressing concern about the possible addition of a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 8555-56. The former Directors said they were \"troubled to learn that the Department of Justice has recently asked the Bureau to add a new question on citizenship to the 2020 census.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 8555. They were \"deeply concerned about the consequence of this possible action and hope[d] that [their] objective observations provide a useful perspective before a final decision is made on this issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   44. In particular, the former Directors expressed concern that the question had not been appropriately tested. They noted that \"[t]here is a great deal of evidence that even small changes in survey question order, wording, and instructions can have significant, and often unexpected, consequences for the rate, quality, and truthfulness of response.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 8556. That is why \"[t]here is a well-proven multi-year process to suggest and test new questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 8555. They wrote that they \"strongly believe[d] that adding an untested question on citizenship status at this late point in the decennial planning process would put the accuracy of the enumeration and success of the census in all communities at grave risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   45. On March 19, 2018, Secretary Ross received a letter from the Latino Community Foundation, which \"strongly urge[d Secretary Ross] to reject the inclusion of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.\" AR 1222. The Foundation explained: \"Including a citizenship question to the census will add to an extensive list of concerns that can and will suppress Latino participation. Increased immigration enforcement, anti-immigrant rhetoric in our political discourse, and privacy concerns have already meshed together to create a climate of fear and aversion of the federal government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   46. On March 22, 2018, Secretary Ross received a letter from Ready Nation, a council of \"American business leaders,\" who wrote \"to express [its] deep concern about the Department of Justice's request that the Census Bureau include an untested question about citizenship in the 2020 Census questionnaire.\" AR 3608. The business leaders were concerned because \"[t]he decennial Census provides critical data that informs decisionmaking in both the private and public sectors\"; they expressed the worry that \"[a]dding a new question this late in the decennial Census process could reduce the accuracy\" of the census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   47. On March 23, 2018, Secretary Ross received a letter from members of the scientific community, including the Acting President of the Federation of American\n   Scientists, the Director of 2020 Census Counts, and the President of the American Political Science Association.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1269-71. The letter stated that the DOJ request \"is ill-conceived for a number of reasons. We have more accurate methods for measuring and studying non-citizenship, for example through anonymous surveys. Imposing a citizenship question would lead to a lower participation rate and substantial undercount of certain geographic regions and demographic populations, undermining the scientific integrity of the entire project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1269.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   48. That same day, Secretary Ross spoke with Christine Pierce, Senior Vice President of Data Science for Nielsen, a private survey company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1276. According to the Commerce Department notes of the conversation, Pierce expressed concern that the addition of the citizenship question \"could lead to a lower response rate,\" which \"is very important.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pierce said that \"including a question on citizenship could make people less likely to respond, but that there is no data to predict how much lower the response rate might be.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pierce explained that at Nielsen, when the company was considering asking a sensitive question that was expected to depress response rates, the company \"conducts a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether it is worth asking the question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She \"noted the importance of testing questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With regard to the federal government's questions, Pierce described that Nielsen once added the ACS questions about birthplace and date of arrival in the United States to one of its surveys.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She explained that although the company was \"concerned about response rates declining, ... Nielsen did not observe lower response rates to the survey.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, Pierce noted, Nielsen would have offered a cash reward to incentivize participation in that survey.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Secretary Ross's March 26, 2018 Memorandum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   49. As noted, on March 26, 2018, Secretary Ross issued his memorandum announcing the decision to adopt Alternative D (which he referred as \"Option D\"), which included adding the citizenship question to the 2020 census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ross Memo 1, 4, at AR 1313, 1316. Secretary Ross wrote that \"[f]ollowing receipt\" of the Gary Letter on December 12, 2017, he had \"set out to take a hard look at the request and ensure that [he] considered all facts and data relevant to the question so that [he] could make an informed decision on how to respond.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1313. \"To that end,\" he wrote, the Department of Commerce \"immediately initiated a comprehensive review process led by the Census Bureau.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   50. Secretary Ross said that his decision \"prioritized the goal of obtaining\n   <em>\n    complete and accurate data\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). He wrote that \"Congress has delegated to me the authority to determine which questions should be asked on the decennial census, and I may exercise my discretion to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census, especially based on DOJ's request for improved CVAP data to enforce the VRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1314. Secretary Ross did not cite any authority for the proposition that the DOJ's request expanded his discretion to determine the content of the decennial census questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Nor did Secretary Ross address whether he was required to comply with DOJ's request in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   51. Secretary Ross noted that \"collection of citizenship data by the Census [Bureau] has been a long-standing practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . He gave as examples of this \"long-standing practice\" the fact that a citizenship question had appeared on decennial\n   censuses up until 1950; that the 2000 \"long form\" survey \"distributed to one in six people in the U.S.[ ] included a question on citizenship\"; and that the ACS (which replaced the \"long form sample\") had \"included a citizenship question since 2005.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). From this, he concluded that \"the citizenship question has been well tested.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Secretary Ross did not, however, detail any such testing or address how the testing would apply to a question in 2020 on a census questionnaire distributed to the entire population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   52. Secretary Ross explained that DOJ had stated \"that the current data collected under the ACS are insufficient in scope, detail, and certainty to meet its purpose under the VRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For that reason, DOJ sought \"CVAP data for census blocks, block groups, counties, towns, and other locations where potential Section 2 violations are alleged or suspected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Secretary Ross explained that the \"Census Bureau ha[d] advised [him] that the census-block-level citizenship data requested by DOJ are not available using the annual ACS, which ... does ask a citizenship question and is the present method used to provide DOJ and the courts with data used to enforce Section 2 of the VRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   53. Secretary Ross then discussed the four alternatives he had considered in reaching his decision: Alternatives A, B, C, and D (albeit referring to them as \"Options\" A, B, C, and D).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1314-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   54. The Ross Memo described Alternative A as rejecting the DOJ request entirely and relying entirely on existing citizenship data.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1314; January 19 Memo, at AR 1279. Secretary Ross rejected this option because, \"[u]nder Option A, the 2020 decennial census would not include the question on citizenship that DOJ requested and therefore would not provide DOJ with improved CVAP data.\" Ross Memo 2, at AR 1314. The existing block-level CVAP data obtained through the ACS, he noted, \"has associated margins of error because the ACS is extrapolated based on sample surveys.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Secretary Ross reasoned, \"[p]roviding more precise block-level data would require sophisticated statistical modeling,\" requiring \"the Census Bureau ... to deploy a team of experts to develop model-based methods that attempt to better facilitate DOJ's request for more specific data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Secretary Ross's problem with this option was that \"the Census Bureau did not assert and could not confirm that such data modeling is possible for census-block-level data with a sufficient degree of accuracy,\" and, \"[r]egardless, DOJ's request is based at least in part on the fact that existing ACS citizenship data-sets lack specificity and completeness,\" such that \"[a]ny future modeling from these incomplete data would only compound that problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1314-15. In summary, Secretary Ross wrote that he rejected Alternative A because it \"would provide no improved citizenship count, as the existing ACS sampling would still fail to obtain\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   , complete number counts, especially for certain lower population areas or voting districts, and there is no guarantee that data could be improved using small-area modeling methods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1315.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   55. Secretary Ross then turned to Alternative B, \"which would add a citizenship question to the decennial census.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Secretary Ross acknowledged that \"[t]he Census Bureau and many stakeholders expressed concern that Option B ... would negatively impact the response rate for non-citizens,\" which \"could reduce the accuracy of the decennial census and increase costs for non-response followup ('NRFU') operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted). \"However,\" he continued, \"neither the Census Bureau nor the concerned\n   stakeholders could document that the response rate would in fact decline materially.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Secretary Ross cited three sources for this conclusion. First, he stated that he had \"discuss[ed] the question with the national survey agency Nielsen\" and that Nielsen had \"stated that it had added questions from the ACS on sensitive topics such as place of birth and immigration status to certain short survey forms without any appreciable decrease in response rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, \"the former director of the Census Bureau during the last decennial census\" said \"that, while he wished there were data to answer the [citizenship] question, none existed to his knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Third, \"Nielsen's Senior Vice President for Data Science and the former Deputy Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Census Bureau under President George W. Bush also confirmed that, to the best of their knowledge, no empirical data existed on the impact of a citizenship question on responses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   56. Secretary Ross noted that \"the Census Bureau attempted to assess the impact that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the decennial census would have on response rates by drawing comparisons to ACS responses,\" as the Census Bureau had done in the January 19 Memo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   January 19 Memo, at AR 1279-80. Secretary Ross wrote that \"such comparative analysis was challenging, as response rates generally vary between decennial censuses and other census sample surveys.\" Ross Memo 3, at AR 1315. For example, the Census Bureau attributed higher response rates on the decennial census to \"greater outreach and follow-up associated with the ... decennial census\" and to the comparatively short length of the decennial census questionnaire compared to the ACS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   57. Secretary Ross also assessed the empirical data showing that Hispanics were disproportionately likely not to self-respond to citizenship questions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1315-16. With regard to the ACS, he pointed out that many questions other than the citizenship question also have significant nonresponse rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1315. But in citing those other questions, he did not acknowledge any comparative response rates by race or ethnicity, citing only average nonresponse rates.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   With regard to the decennial census, Secretary Ross acknowledged the Census Bureau's data showing that noncitizen households (compared to citizen households) were disproportionately less likely to self-respond to the 2000 long-form census questionnaire, which included a citizenship question, than to the short-form questionnaire, which did not.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1316. But, Secretary Ross wrote, the Census Bureau \"was not able to isolate what percentage of decline was caused by the inclusion of a citizenship question rather than some other aspect of the long form survey.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He concluded that \"while there is widespread belief among many parties that adding a citizenship question could reduce response rates, the Census Bureau's analysis did not provide definitive, empirical support for that belief.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   58. Secretary Ross next evaluated Alternative C, which would use administrative records\n   <em>\n    instead\n   </em>\n   of adding a citizenship question to the decennial census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He acknowledged that the Census Bureau had used administrative record data \"since the early 20th century\" and that administrative records often yield \"more accurate\" citizenship data than self-responses do.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"However,\" he wrote, \"the Census Bureau is still evolving its use of administrative records, and the Bureau does not yet have a complete administrative records data set for the entire population.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also acknowledged that the Census Bureau was able to match 88.6% of the population \"with what the Bureau considers credible\n   administrative record data\" in the 2010 census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, he wrote, \"[w]hile impressive, this means that more than 10 percent of the American population - some 25 million voting age people - would need to have their citizenship imputed by the Census Bureau. Given the scale of this number, it was imperative that another option be developed to provide a greater level of accuracy than either self-response alone or use of administrative records would presently provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   59. Secretary Ross explained that he had \"asked the Census Bureau to develop\" an Alternative D, which \"would combine\" Alternatives B and C.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   His \"judgment,\" the Memo announced, was that Alternative D \"will provide DOJ with the most complete and accurate CVAP data in response to its request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1317. Secretary Ross explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   Asking the citizenship question of 100 percent of the population gives each respondent the opportunity to provide an answer. This may eliminate the need for the Census Bureau to have to impute an answer for millions of people. For the approximately 90 percent of the population who are citizens, this question is no additional imposition. And for the approximately 70 percent of non-citizens who already answer this question accurately on the ACS, the question is no additional imposition since census responses by law may only be used anonymously and for statistical purposes. Finally, placing the question on the decennial census and directing the Census Bureau to determine the best means to compare the decennial census responses with administrative records will permit the Census Bureau to determine the inaccurate response rate for citizens and non-citizens alike using the entire population. This will enable the Census Bureau to establish, to the best of its ability, the accurate ratio of citizen to non-citizen responses to impute for that small percentage of cases where it is necessary to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   60. Secretary Ross addressed the possible effect on self-response rates of the citizenship question as set forth in Alternative D.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1319. He opined that \"even if\" addition of a citizenship question had \"some impact on responses, the value of more complete and accurate data derived from surveying the entire population outweighs such concerns. Completing and returning decennial census questionnaires is required by Federal law, those responses are protected by law, and inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census will provide more complete information for those who respond.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Secretary Ross then stated, without reference to any evidence or to the Census Bureau's conclusion that adding a citizen question would produce \"substantially less accurate citizenship status data than are available from administrative sources,\" January 19 Memo, at AR 1277, that \"[t]he citizenship data provided to DOJ will be more accurate with the question than without it,\" Ross Memo 7, at AR 1319. He wrote that this \"accura[cy]\" was \"of greater importance than any adverse effect that may result from people violating their legal duty to respond.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   61. Secretary Ross concluded: \"I have determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census is necessary to provide complete and accurate data in response to the DOJ request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1320. He also announced his decision to place the question \"last on the decennial census form\" to \"minimize any impact on decennial census response rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Secretary Ross's Testimony Before Congress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   62. As the foregoing makes clear, the chronology of events in the initial Administrative\n   Record produced on June 8, 2018, largely conformed to the chronology in the Ross Memo. According to the Ross Memo, the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census began with the December 12, 2017 request from Arthur Gary, a career official at DOJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ross Memo 1, at AR 1313. \"Following receipt\" of the Gary Letter, Secretary Ross claimed, he had \"set out to take a hard look at the request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Memo did not mention any earlier discussions and efforts to propose addition of a citizenship question or any role in those discussions by White House personnel, political appointees at DOJ, or political appointees at the Commerce Department.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1313-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   63. In sworn testimony before Congress around the same time, Secretary Ross repeated that the decision to add a citizenship question began with the Gary Letter and denied White House involvement in the decision and discussions leading to the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   64. Before the House Appropriations Committee on March 20, 2018, for example, Representative Jos\u00e9 Serrano asked Secretary Ross whether \"the President or anyone else in the White House [had] directed [him] to add this or a similar question to the 2020 census.\"\n   <em>\n    Hearings Before Subcomm. on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies of the H. Comm. on Appropriations\n   </em>\n   , 115th Cong. 15 (2018) (admitted as an audio file at PX-491). Secretary Ross responded that the Department of Commerce was \"responding\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   to Department of Justice's request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Later in the same hearing, Representative Grace Meng asked Secretary Ross whether \"the President or anyone in the White House discussed with you or anyone on your team about adding this citizenship question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38 (admitted as an audio file at PX-493). Secretary Ross answered: \"I am not aware of any such.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   65. Secretary Ross testified similarly before the House Ways and Means Committee on March 22, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See Hearing with Commerce Secretary Ross: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Ways and Means\n   </em>\n   , 115th Cong. 1 (2018) (admitted as PX-480). Most relevant here, Representative Judy Chu asked if Secretary Ross could tell her \"whether the Department of Commerce plans to include the citizenship question in the 2020 Census.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51. Secretary Ross responded that the \"Department of Justice, as you know,\n   <em>\n    initiated\n   </em>\n   the request for inclusion of the citizenship question\" to the decennial census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   66. Finally, before the Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies on May 10, 2018, Secretary Ross testified again that DOJ had initiated the request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hearing on the F.Y. 2019 Funding Request for the Commerce Dep't Before the S.

Defendants'\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   interpretations of Secretary Ross's sworn statements to Congress are unconvincing. Viewed individually, even in context, none of the statements are limited in the ways Defendants suggest. And viewed together, the statements afford only one conclusion: Secretary Ross intended to convey the impression that the Gary Letter - and the Gary Letter alone - prompted consideration of whether to add a citizenship question to the census; that neither he nor anyone else at the Commerce Department prompted DOJ's request; and that he had not discussed the matter with White House officials before 2018. Moreover, nothing in Secretary Ross's March 26, 2018 Memorandum, in the rest of the Administrative Record, or in the relevant statutes and regulations supports the purported distinction between an \"informal\" and \"formal\" process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Secretary Ross's first version of events, set forth in the initial Administrative Record, the Ross Memo, and his congressional testimony, was materially inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   70. The first concrete sign of the inaccuracy came on June 21, 2018, when - \"to provide further background and context regarding\" Secretary Ross's decision - Defendants added a one-page \"Supplemental Memorandum\" signed by Secretary Ross himself, to the Administrative Record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 189.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Supplemental\n   Memorandum, Secretary Ross admitted that \"[s]oon after [his] appointment as Secretary of Commerce,\" he had begun considering \"whether to reinstate a citizenship question.\" AR 1321 (\"June 21 Supplemental Memo\"). He also acknowledged that \"other senior Administration officials had previously raised\" the issue, but he did not identify the officials by name.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . He continued: \"My staff and I thought reinstating a citizenship question could be warranted, and we had various discussions with other governmental officials about reinstating a citizenship question to the Census.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He then disclosed that, \"[a]s part of that deliberative process,\"\n   <em>\n    he and his staff\n   </em>\n   had \"inquired whether the Department of Justice ... would support,\n   <em>\n    and if so would request\n   </em>\n   , inclusion of a citizenship question as consistent with and useful for enforcement of\" the VRA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   71. After receiving Secretary Ross's Supplemental Memorandum, the Court ordered Defendants to complete the Administrative Record and authorized discovery beyond the Administrative Record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 199;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   July 3rd Tr. 76-89.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   72. The evidence disclosed as a result reveals a very different set of events from the one described in the initial Administrative Record, the Ross Memo, and Secretary Ross's congressional testimony. In particular, as outlined in depth below, the evidence shows that shortly after his confirmation as Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Ross discussed the addition of the citizenship question with then-White House advisor Steve Bannon, among others; that Secretary Ross wanted to add the question to the 2020 census prior to, and independent of, DOJ's December 12, 2017 request; that the Secretary and his aides pursued that goal vigorously for almost a year, with no apparent interest in promoting more robust enforcement of the VRA; that, believing they needed another agency to request and justify a need for the question, Secretary Ross and his aides worked hard to generate such a request for the citizenship question from DOJ; that these efforts included a direct intervention by Secretary Ross with Attorney General Sessions; and that these efforts ultimately\n   succeeded, resulting in DOJ's request for a citizenship question. The evidence also reveals that DOJ deliberately (and unusually) did not explore whether there was a way to obtain the data it purportedly needed that would not involve a citizenship question on the census. The Court now turns to this more complete story of Secretary Ross's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Secretary Ross's Early Interest in Adding the Citizenship Question\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   73. The Senate confirmed Secretary Ross as Secretary of Commerce on February 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   163 CONG. REC . S1421, S1455 (2017). Two days later, on March 1, 2017, the Census Bureau briefed Secretary Ross on the census and the upcoming deadline to notify Congress about the proposed subjects for the census questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1410, 3685-86; PX-193 (\"Ross Calendar\"), at 1; Docket Nos. 510-2, 510-3 (together, \"Langdon Dep.\") at 81, 93-98;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   74. At some point between February 27 and March 10, 2017, Secretary Ross asked his Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Policy, Earl Comstock, why there was no citizenship question on the census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 490-2 (\"Comstock Dep.\") at 55. Comstock responded that he did not know, but would \"check.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On March 10, 2017, Comstock sent Secretary Ross an email with the subject line: \"Your Question on the Census.\" AR 2521. The email reported that the Census Bureau's webpage on apportionment was \"explicit\" that \"all people (citizens and noncitizens) with a usual residence in the 50 states are to be included in the census and thus in the apportionment counts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The email also included the text of a\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   article titled \"The Pitfalls of Counting Illegal Immigrants,\" which, Comstock noted, \"confirms that neither the 2000 nor the 2010 Census asked about citizenship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   75. Around this same time, Secretary Ross's interest in adding a citizenship question to the census first surfaced. Comstock, for example, first heard \"about the notion of adding a question about citizenship to the decennial census\" from the Secretary himself, \"shortly after the confirmation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, some evidence suggests that Secretary Ross went even further in these early weeks and had actually decided to add the citizenship question already. According to Comstock, for example, Secretary Ross actually made a \"request\" to add the citizenship question \"sometime in the spring\" - \"[p]otentially\" as early as March 10, 2017 (when Comstock had emailed him the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   article).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   76. Although Secretary Ross acknowledges speaking with various \"senior Administration officials\" and \"other governmental officials\" about adding a citizenship question to the census around this time, AR 1321, the record is largely (and somewhat surprisingly) void of details regarding when these conversations occurred and with whom. But it does reflect that Secretary Ross discussed the topic with at least three outside officials. First, Secretary Ross discussed the topic with Attorney General Sessions \"in the Spring of 2017 and at subsequent times.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 379-1 (\"Defs.' Second Supp. Interrog.\"), at 2-3 (admitted as PX-302). Second, on or about April 5, 2017, Secretary Ross spoke with White House advisor Steve Bannon, who asked \"if he would be willing to speak to Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach about Secretary Kobach's ideas about a possible citizenship question on the decennial census.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; AR 763-64, 2561. Third, complying with Bannon's request, Secretary Ross spoke with Kobach (who also served as Vice Chair of the since aborted Presidential Commission on Election Integrity).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 763-64, 2561; Defs.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Second Supp. Interrog. at 2-3; Docket Nos. 509-2, 509-3 (together, \"Teramoto Dep.\") at 38-47.

AR 763-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   77. After these conversations, Secretary Ross and his staff began to take action on the citizenship question, in part by contacting Mark Neuman, who was not then a government official but had served as the point person on census-related issues for the Trump Administration's transition team. Teramoto Dep. 126-27. On April 11, 2017, Neuman emailed Comstock a link to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    League of United Latin Am. Citizens v.

On April 13, 2017, Comstock asked Neuman by email when the Census Bureau would need to \"notify Congress\" regarding census questions. AR 3709. Neuman responded the next day, informing Comstock that the notification deadline for census topics had already passed, but there would \"be another opportunity next year\" when the report of specific questions was due to Congress. AR 3709.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   78. Secretary Ross soon began to express frustration with his staff's lack of progress on the citizenship question issue. On April 20, 2017, for example, he emailed Comstock, copying Wendy Teramoto, who was then his Senior Advisor and Chief of Staff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 3694; Teramoto Dep. 78.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the email, he noted that then-Director of the Census Bureau John Thompson was scheduled to meet with the Census National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic and Other Populations on April 29, 2017, and he noted: \"We\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   get our issue resolved before this!\" AR 3694 (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Comstock Dep. 137-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   79. On May 2, 2017, Secretary Ross expressed even greater frustration. He emailed Comstock that he was \"mystified why nothing ha[s] been done in response to [his]\n   <em>\n    months old request\n   </em>\n   that we include the citizenship question.\" AR 3710 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   80. A few hours later, Comstock responded. \"On the citizenship question,\" he declared, \"we will get that in place.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; PX-298(R), at RFA 63;\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Comstock Dep. 151-52. He explained that the specific questions on the census questionnaire were not due to Congress until March 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 3710. In the meantime, Comstock wrote, \"[w]e need to work with Justice to get them to request that citizenship be added back as a census question, and we have the court cases to illustrate that DoJ has a legitimate need for the question to be included.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

Later that day, Davidson wrote to Comstock, Uthmeier, and Teramoto expressing \"concern[ ] about\" directly contacting Kobach - whom Secretary Ross had mentioned in the September 6, 2017 meeting. PX-614 (AR). Instead, Davidson recommended contacting a \"trusted\" advisor, such as Neuman, \"before we do anything externally.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   97. Consistent with that recommendation, Uthmeier sent Neuman an email on September 8, 2017, with the subject line \"Questions re Census,\" and asking if Neuman had a \"few minutes\" that morning \"to discuss.\" AR 2051. That same day, Comstock sent Secretary Ross a memorandum reporting on his - as yet unsuccessful - efforts to find an agency that would request addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 12755; PX-298(R) at RFA 96.

Secretary Ross's Intervention with the Attorney General\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   98. By sometime in late summer 2017, Secretary Ross was plainly out of patience with Comstock's failed efforts to get DOJ to request the citizenship question and decided to take matters into his own hands by contacting Attorney General Sessions directly. The precise date of his first communication on the census topic with the Attorney General during that period is unclear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1321; Gore Dep. 83-84;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

But around Labor Day, the Attorney General spoke then-Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights John Gore (\"AAAG Gore\") about requesting the addition of a citizenship question. Gore Dep. 83. AAAG Gore learned that Secretary Ross had \"initiated\" an earlier discussion with Attorney General Sessions about a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    at 83-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   99. Until September 13, 2017, the conversations between the Commerce Department and DOJ about the citizenship question had been \"initiated by the Department of Commerce.\" Gore Dep. 67-68, 91-98. But on that date, AAAG Gore initiated contact with Teramoto. He sent Teramoto an email introducing himself and asking \"to talk about a DOJ-DOC\" issue, referring to the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census. AR 2628-29, at AR 2629; AR 2634-35 (same email chain); Gore Dep. 95-97. And for the next couple months, AAAG Gore served as the primary contact at DOJ about the citizenship question issue. Gore Dep. 91-92, 94-95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   100. A few days later, on or about September 16, 2017 (a Saturday), AAAG Gore and Teramoto spoke by telephone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 2628-29, at AR 2628; AR 2639. Later that day, AAAG Gore put Teramoto in touch with Danielle Cutrona, an aide to Attorney General Sessions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 2639. In his email introducing them, AAAG Gore explained that \"Danielle is the person to connect with about the issue we discussed earlier this afternoon,\" namely the citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .; AR 2651-52; AR 2653-54; Gore Dep. 102-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   101. Teramoto asked Cutrona to \"let [her] know when the AG is available to speak to Secretary Ross.\" AR 2639. In response, Cutrona sent Teramoto Attorney General Sessions' cellphone number and stated: \"From what John [Gore] told me, it sounds like we can do whatever you all need us to do and the delay was due to a\n   miscommunication. The AG is eager to assist.\" AR 2651; Gore Dep. 105-06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   102. On September 18, 2017, Secretary Ross spoke again to Attorney General Sessions about adding a citizenship question to the census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 2528; AR 2636; Gore Dep. 111-12. The next day, on September 19, 2017, Secretary Ross sent an email with the subject \"Census\" to Davidson. AR 2528. The email said: \"Wendy [Teramoto] and I spoke with the AG yesterday. Please follow up so we can resolve this issue today.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <strong>\n    5. AAAG Gore Ghostwrites the DOJ Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   103. Over the next three months, relying heavily on the VRA rationale first proposed by the Department of Commerce, political appointees in DOJ - led by AAAG Gore - drafted the letter requesting addition of the citizenship question on the decennial census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   104. Notably, in drafting the letter, AAAG Gore relied not only on the Commerce Department's proposed rationale, but also on its work product and its advisors. For example, he spoke with Uthmeier, the Commerce Department lawyer who had drafted the August 11, 2017 legal memorandum on the issue for Secretary Ross.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gore Dep. 117-19. After they spoke, AAAG Gore received a copy of the memorandum and a handwritten note from Uthmeier.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 2461 (email referencing August 11 memo).

Davidson responded: \"I'm on the phone with Mark Neuman right now ... he is giving me a readout of his meeting last week.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)

And as former Census Bureau Director Thompson explained, input from subject matter experts - usually consisting of \"staff from both the Census Bureau and the requesting agency\" - is \"essential to the development of a new question\" for a survey.

In fact, the Census Bureau's \"Statistical Quality Standards,\" issued in 2010, explicitly require pre-testing of any question to be added to a survey such as the census, unless the Census Bureau obtains a waiver or uses a question that has \"performed adequately in another survey.\" PX-260, at vii, 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX-364 (\"If there is insufficient evidence about how well a question performs, the question must be subjected to some form of questionnaire pretest.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   125. Initial plans for the 2020 census adhered to the Census Bureau's historical practices and Statistical Quality Standards. All questions on the 2010 census had been the subject of extensive cognitive testing and field testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 997.

Despite that extensive testing, the Census Bureau opted not to make the proposed changes to the questions on race and ethnicity because a final decision had not been made as of December 31, 2017, leaving inadequate time to deliver the final question wording to Congress two years prior to the census, as required by Section 141(f)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    \u00b6 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   126.

Despite these plans and the Census Bureau's Statistical Quality Standards, neither the Census Bureau nor the Commerce Department conducted any pretesting of the citizenship question before Secretary Ross made the decision to add it to the 2020 census questionnaire.

And while Secretary Ross opted to use a question that had previously appeared on the ACS, the record establishes that it has not \"performed adequately\" within the meaning of the Census Bureau's Statistical Quality Standards.

He did not, however, describe that testing or even define what he meant by \"well tested.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at AR 1313-20. Nor did Secretary Ross make any effort to reconcile his characterization of the question as \"well tested\" with the poor performance of the question on the ACS - that is, the high disagreement rate between survey responses and administrative records.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at AR 1316. Ironically, Secretary Ross himself noted this high disagreement rate when explaining his reasons for rejecting Alternative C.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   131. There is no basis in the record to dispute Dr. Abowd's assessment - which he conveyed to Secretary Ross in advance of the March 26, 2018 Memorandum - that the citizenship question was \"well tested\" for purposes of the ACS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1254-55, 1288;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 568 (testimony of Thompson, former Census Bureau Director, that testing of the citizenship question for use on the ACS was \"complete and thorough\"). But the fact that the question was \"well tested\" for purposes of the ACS does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   mean that the question is well tested for purposes of the decennial census. Nor does it mean that the testing was consistent with the Census Bureau's own standards and historical practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   132. To the contrary, the record supports the conclusion of experts in the field that the question was not well - or even adequately - tested for purposes of the decennial census questionnaire. That view is shared by: (1) six former Census Bureau Directors, in both Republican and Democratic Administrations, including Dr. Thompson (whom Defendants' own expert described as \"the expert in this trial who's most deserving of weight on his testimony), AR 8555-56; Tr. 1192; Thompson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-96; (2) Plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Hillygus and Dr. Barreto, Tr. 157, 737-38; (3) the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Committee on National Statistics' Task Force on the 2020 Census, PX-539; and (4) the American Statistical Association, the American Sociological Association, and the Population Association of America, \"three leading national associations of professional and academic statisticians, sociologists and demographers,\" Brief of the American Statistical Association et al. as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   Supporting Plaintiffs, Docket No. 420-1, at 1, 4-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   133. Defendants did not present any evidence to dispute the conclusion that the citizenship question has not been \"well tested\" for purposes of the 2020 census questionnaire. Instead, their own expert, Dr. Abowd, agreed that \"[i]t would not be appropriate to describe it as well-tested in the context of the 2020 questionnaire. That is simply not true.... It hasn't ever been tested in that context.\" Tr. 1330.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   134. There are several reasons that the testing conducted for the citizenship question on the ACS is not adequate for purposes of the decennial census questionnaire. First, although superficially similar, there are salient differences between the ACS and the decennial census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 456 (\"Defs.' Pretrial Reply Br.\"), at 5 (conceding that the ACS is \"a different instrument with different considerations and goals\"). The primary purpose of the census is to obtain an \"actual Enumeration\" of the entire population of the country,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3, while the ACS is \"intended to provide information on the characteristics of the population, and the social and economic needs of communities,\" Thompson Decl. \u00b6 32. And while the census strives for an \"actual Enumeration\" through an actual count of every household in the country, ACS estimates are statistical estimates based on a sample of United States households. Thompson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; Tr. 805, 1027-28. Additionally, the ACS is a much longer questionnaire than the decennial census questionnaire. It includes dozens of questions - depending on household composition and housing status, a household might have to answer more than seventy questions - while the 2020 census questionnaire will contain either ten or eleven questions (depending on whether the citizenship question appears on it).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 87, 889, 1146; Thompson Decl. \u00b6 63. A question concerning citizenship may take on added significance in the context of the much shorter decennial census questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Thompson Decl. \u00b6 63; Tr. 87-88. Thus, a test of the question in the context of the ACS questionnaire has only limited relevance to how the question will perform in the context of the census questionnaire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   135. Second, and related, the question order and context for the question in the ACS (as well as on the 1950 census questionnaire and the long-form questionnaire, both of which were also referenced by Secretary Ross in his March 26, 2018 Memorandum) are different than they would be on the census questionnaire. On the online ACS (and the prior census questionnaires), the question was preceded by a question about \"nativity\" - that is, place of birth - and only those who indicated that they were born outside of the United States were asked to disclose citizenship status. Tr. 159-60, 1274-75. By contrast, at present, the 2020 decennial census will ask about citizenship without a preceding nativity question - and it will be asked of all respondents. PX-489; Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 22-23; Thompson Decl. \u00b6 66; Tr. 1275. Such differences in \"sequencing\" and context can affect response rates. Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 14; Tr. 159-60; Thompson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-66.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   136. Finally, the ACS was last tested in 2006, and the macroenvironment has changed in important ways since then.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 737, 1252, 1258-59. In particular, the undisputed evidence - including the Census Bureau's own research - indicates that respondents are likely to react differently to a citizenship question in 2020 than they would have reacted only three years ago, let alone thirteen years ago.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    at 616, 619-20, 737, 1258-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, testing conducted thirteen years ago has only limited relevance to how the question will perform on the 2020 census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   137. In short, while the citizenship question may have been \"well tested\" for the purposes of the ACS (and earlier versions of the census questionnaire, including the \"long-form\" questionnaire used until 2000), it is not \"well,\" or even adequately, tested for purposes of the 2020 census questionnaire. Thus, Secretary Ross's statement that the question is \"well tested\" is misleading at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Commerce Department Revises the Census Bureau's Description of the \"Well-Established Process\" for \"Adding or Changing Content on the Census\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   138. The record contains evidence of another, more deliberate, effort to downplay the degree to which Secretary Ross's decision to add the citizenship question deviated from the Census Bureau's past practices and standards. In late January 2018 - after the Census Bureau's initial, critical assessments of DOJ's request to add the question - senior aides to Secretary Ross, including Comstock and Uthmeier, developed a set of thirty-five questions for the Census Bureau to answer for the Secretary. AR 1976-78; Tr. 1004-05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   139. Dr. Abowd took the lead in coordinating the Census Bureau's responses to the questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1005. In particular, he maintained the \"control\" or \"master\" copy of the responses to the questions, which represented the final and official position of the Census Bureau, as Dr. Abowd understood them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    1010-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After some back and forth with aides to Secretary Ross about some of the responses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1005, 1013-14; AR 9190, 13023; AR 2292; AR 2294-2305, Dr. Abowd provided a final set of responses on March 1, 2018 (with his memorandum comparing Alternatives C and D),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 9812-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   140. The thirty-first question on the list asked: \"What was the process that was used in the past to get questions added to the decennial Census or do we have something similar where a precedent was established?\" AR 1296; AR 2303-04; AR 9832-33; AR 10900-01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   141. Victoria Velkoff, Chief of the American Community Survey Office at the U.S. Census Bureau, drafted the initial answer to this question on behalf of the Census Bureau. It stated in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-298\">\n   The Census Bureau follows a well-established process when adding or changing content on the census or ACS to ensure the data fulfill legal and regulatory requirements established by Congress. Adding a question or making a change to the Decennial Census or the ACS involves extensive testing, review, and evaluation. This process ensures the change is necessary and will produce quality, useful information for the nation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   AR 2303;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 7644, 10950. The draft answer then described the \"formal process for making content changes\" laid out by the Census Bureau and OMB. AR 2304; AR 9832; AR 7644; AR 10901. That description was consistent with other Census Bureau documents describing the process to add a question or change the content of the decennial census, which are discussed above. AR 3560; AR 3890-91; PX-271, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   142. Michael Walsh, Deputy General Counsel of the Commerce Department, and Sahra Park-Su, then Senior Policy Advisor at the Commerce Department, removed all references to the \"well-established process\" for adding or changing content on the census,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 494-2 (\"Park-Su Dep.\") at 142; Tr. 1006-14; AR 9190, 13023. The answer to Question Thirty-One, as revised by Walsh and Park-Su, read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-301\">\n   No new questions were added to the 2010 Decennial Census, so there is no recent precedent for considering a request to add questions to a decennial census. Consistent with longstanding practice for adding new questions to the ACS survey, the Census Bureau is working with relevant stakeholders to ensure that legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled and that the question would produce quality, useful information for the nation. As you are aware, that process is ongoing. Upon its conclusion, you will have all of the relevant data at your disposal to make an informed decision about the pending request from the Department of Justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   AR 9190, 13023.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   143. The final version of the response to Question Thirty-One included in the original Administrative Record was further modified to read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   Because no new questions have been added to the Decennial Census (for nearly 20 years), the Census Bureau did not feed bound by past precedent when considering the Department of Justices' request. Rather, the Census Bureau is working with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that legal and regulatory requirements are filled and that questions will produce quality, useful information for the nation. As you are aware, that process is ongoing at your direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   AR 1296 (errors in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   144. Dr. Abowd did not receive, review, or approve any of these revisions to the response to Question Thirty-One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1010-11.

Based on an assessment of Comstock's demeanor and a review of the other evidence in the record, the Court declines to credit that testimony. For one thing, the entirety of the January 19 Memo is consistent with, and supports, the statement that adding a citizenship question to the census would be \"very costly, harm[ ] the quality of the census count, and would use substantially less accurate citizenship status data than are available from administrative sources.\" January 19 Memo at AR 1277-85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   159. For another, there is no indication anywhere else in the record that, in the February 12, 2018 meeting or otherwise, Dr. Abowd or his colleagues at the Census Bureau ever retreated from the statement. To the contrary, Dr. Abowd testified at trial (credibly) that he adhered to the statement and conclusions in the January 19 Memo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 882-92, 922-23, 950-54, 958-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   160. In fact, if anything, the Census Bureau's assessment of the harms and costs of adding a citizenship question only grew\n   <em>\n    more pessimistic\n   </em>\n   after the January\n   19 Memo. While the January 19 Memo conservatively estimated that adding the citizenship question would cause a 5.1% increase in the non-response rate of noncitizen households, AR 1280, the Census Bureau has since updated its estimate of that figure to 5.8%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX-162 (\"Brown Memo\"), at 38, 42. And while the January 19 Memo conservatively estimated that adding the citizenship question would increase the costs of the 2020 census by at least $27.5 million (a figure that did not even include anticipated increases in communications costs), AR 1282, the Census Bureau's current best estimate is that it would cost $82.5 million more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 952, 1249-50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   161. During his deposition, Comstock also acknowledged his awareness of the Census Bureau's view (set forth in the March 1 Memo) that Alternative B (adding the citizenship question) \"would result in poorer quality citizenship data\" than Alternative C (using administrative records) \"and still have all the cost and quality implications of Alternative B\" outlined in the January 19 Memo.

The revisions to the Question Thirty-One response were not the only thing about which Dr. Abowd and his colleagues at the Census Bureau were left in the dark. They were also never told that Secretary Ross had begun considering a citizenship question in early 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   164. Indeed, it was not until Secretary Ross's June 21, 2018 Memo and the subsequent disclosures in this litigation (some of which are now part of the Administrative Record and some of which are not) that Dr. Abowd and others at the Census Bureau learned that Secretary Ross had begun considering a citizenship question in early 2017; that, as part of that consideration, Secretary Ross communicated with Bannon and Kobach; that, as early as May 2017, Secretary Ross had expressed frustration about nothing having been done about his \"months old request\" to \"include\n   the citizenship question\"; that the Commerce Department had initiated conversations with DOJ about requesting the citizenship question rather than the other way around; and that the Attorney General himself directed the technical experts at DOJ not to meet with the Census Bureau to discuss alternative options.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 964, 1016-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   165. Of course, Secretary Ross and his aides were not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to inform Dr. Abowd or others at the Census Bureau that they were considering whether to add a citizenship question to the census. As a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   matter, however, the degree to which the origins of the decision were kept from those who worked hard to promptly evaluate DOJ's request was unusual and noteworthy. Moreover, had Secretary Ross and his aides involved the Census Bureau earlier, the experts there might have been able to conduct appropriate testing of the question in the context of the census itself. Indeed, by not revealing his consideration of the citizenship question before December 2017, Secretary Ross prevented those experts from conducting a study to quantify whether and to what extent the question would result in a differential undercount even with NRFU operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1291, 1301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   166. A poignant exchange between counsel and Dr. Abowd at trial highlights the unusual - and impactful - nature of Secretary Ross's failure to consult the Census Bureau earlier. When asked whether he had been under the impression that all his work in the wake of DOJ's request \"mattered as far as the Secretary's decision-making process,\" Dr. Abowd responded: \"I was under the impression that it mattered in the conduct of the 2020 census, yes.\" Tr. 1021. Counsel then asked: \"And no one ever told you during that entire period of time that Commerce Department officials had initiated this entire process, correct?\" Dr. Abowd then answered: \"No one told me that, but I am still under the impression it matters for the 2020 census.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    at 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Findings Regarding the Timing of, and Reasons for, Secretary Ross's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   167. It is hard, if not impossible, to identify with precision when Secretary Ross first made the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census - particularly in the absence of a deposition of Secretary Ross himself. But based on the foregoing record, the Court finds - by well more than a preponderance of the evidence - that Secretary Ross had made the decision months\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   DOJ sent its letter on December 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   168. That conclusion is supported by evidence in the Administrative Record alone. First and most obviously, it is supported by Secretary Ross's May 2, 2017 email to Comstock expressing \"mystif[ication]\" as to why \"nothing\" had been done \"in response to\" his \"\n   <em>\n    months old request\n   </em>\n   that we include the citizenship question,\" AR 3710 (emphasis added), and Comstock's reply later the same day that \"we will get that in place\" and \"[w]e need to work with Justice to get them to request that citizenship be added back as a census question,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   On its face, Secretary\n   Ross's email supports the conclusion that he had made the decision to \"include\" the question before May 2, 2017 - and thus before receiving DOJ's request on December 12, 2017. After all, his reference was not to a \"months old\" request to\n   <em>\n    analyze\n   </em>\n   inclusion of the question, but to his request, from a supervisor to his staff, to \"include\" it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   169. Second, the conclusion that Secretary Ross actually made the decision before DOJ sent its letter in December 2017 is further supported by Comstock's August 11, 2017 email to Secretary Ross emphasizing the \"need to be diligent in preparing the administrative record\" because the \"issue will go to the Supreme Court.\" AR 12476. Plaintiffs characterize that email as evidence that \"Secretary Ross and his senior staff agreed ... to whitewash the administrative record.\" Plaintiffs' Joint Proposed Post-Trial Conclusions of Law, Docket No. 545-1 (\"Pls.' Proposed Conclusions\"), \u00b6 354. The parsimonious nature of the initial Administrative Record in these cases, and the steps that Secretary Ross and his aides took to downplay, if not conceal, the significance of his decision, do provide some basis to draw such an uncharitable inference. But there is no need to do so in light of a more obvious and significant inference to be drawn from Comstock's email. That is, the email makes clear that, by August 11, 2017, Secretary Ross had already decided to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census. After all, the only reason to believe that \"the issue\" would definitely \"go to the Supreme Court\" was if Secretary Ross had decided to add the question; if there was a chance that Secretary Ross, after considering the issue with an open mind, was going to preserve the status quo, Comstock would have had no reason to state with confidence that the issue \"will\" go to the Supreme Court. Nor would there have been any reason to \"prepar[e] the administrative record\" to memorialize or justify a decision that might never even be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   170. Third, the same conclusion is supported by Uthmeier's August 11, 2017 email to Comstock, which attached his legal memorandum concerning the citizenship question that was later used by AAAG Gore in drafting the Gary Letter. PX-607 (AR). In that email, Uthmeier stated that he had \"some new ideas/recommendations on\n   <em>\n    execution\n   </em>\n   \" and that \"our hook\" was that \"[u]ltimately, we do not make decisions on how the data should be used for apportionment, that is for Congress (or possibly the President) to decide.\" PX-607 (AR) (emphasis added). As with Comstock, Uthmeier's choice of words makes sense only if he understood that there was already a decision to \"execut[e].\" Taken together, therefore, the record evidence reveals an agency staff in search of a rationale for a decision their boss had already made, before December 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   171. More broadly, the Court's conclusion is supported by the general chronology leading up to the decision, as revealed by evidence in the supplemented Administrative Record. That evidence makes clear that Secretary Ross and his staff did more than merely \"inquire[ ] whether the [DOJ] would support,\n   <em>\n    and if so would request\n   </em>\n   , inclusion of a citizenship question as consistent with and useful for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act,\" AR 1321 (emphasis added) - although that alone would have been significant. Instead, the evidence reveals that Secretary Ross was aggressively pressing to add a citizenship question to the census before the idea of justifying it on the basis of VRA enforcement was first floated, AR 3702, 3710; that, prompted by Neuman, Secretary Ross's own aides came up with the legal rationale DOJ could rely upon for addition of the question, PX-188 (AR), PX-565 (AR); that,\n   believing they needed another agency to justify adding the question, they actively lobbied other agencies to make the request and, when that initially proved unsuccessful, explored whether they could do it themselves, AR 12755-56; that, undeterred by the lack of any interest from DOJ staff, Secretary Ross intervened directly with Attorney General Sessions in order to secure the request they believed they needed, AR 1321, 2528, 2636, 4004; and that Secretary Ross's aides then fed DOJ with the rationale for the request rather than vice-versa, AR 2461; PX-607 (AR).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   172. Notably, all of this evidence is in the Administrative Record alone - not in Defendants' initial production, to be sure, but in the Administrative Record as stipulated by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 523, at Joint Stip. \u00b6 63. What little evidence remains \"outside\" the Administrative Record after the parties' stipulations, however, only strengthens the conclusion that Secretary Ross had made his decision even before DOJ's request. Most notably, Comstock - the aide more involved in Secretary Ross's early deliberations on the issue than any other - testified that the Secretary had made a \"request\" to add the citizenship question \"sometime in the spring\" - \"[p]otentially\" as early as March 10, 2017. Comstock Dep. 146;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (conceding that the \"initial impetus for putting the citizenship question on the 2020 census\" was Secretary Ross, not DOJ, and that, \"shortly after he was confirmed,\" he \"request[ed] the question be put on the census\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   173. Secretary Ross's actual reasons for his decision are even foggier than the precise timing of his decision. There is no writing of any kind - either in the Administrative Record or produced in discovery, either authored by Secretary Ross or by anyone else - that describes the reasons why Secretary Ross wanted to add a citizenship question within weeks of his confirmation as Secretary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1-13024. Moreover, Comstock testified that Secretary Ross never disclosed why he wanted to add a citizenship question to the census -\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that Comstock never asked him, perhaps because Comstock believed that the reason might or might not be \"legally valid.\" Comstock Dep. 267;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    at 112, 171-72, 251-55, 340-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Teramoto, Secretary Ross's own Chief of Staff, similarly testified that she had no knowledge of why Secretary Ross wanted to add a citizenship question. Teramoto Dep. 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   174. While the Court is unable to determine - based on the existing record, at least - what Secretary Ross's real reasons for adding the citizenship question were, it does find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that promoting enforcement of the VRA was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   his real reason for the decision. Instead, the Court finds that the\n   VRA was a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationale for a decision that Secretary had already made for other reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   175. Once again, that conclusion finds support in the Administrative Record alone. For one thing, it finds support in the very same evidence that supported the conclusion that Secretary Ross committed to adding the citizenship question months before he even received the request from DOJ. By definition, Secretary Ross's original and actual rationale could not have been promotion of better VRA enforcement because the record reveals that he had made up his mind well before DOJ even agreed to submit the request to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   176. Moreover, it finds support in the sheer number of Commerce Department communications predating the DOJ letter - with staff, with Kobach, and with DOJ and DHS - none of which mention the VRA rationale, but all of which reflect Secretary Ross's anxious desire to add a citizenship question to the census.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 763-64, 2424, 2458, 2521, 3710, 3984, 4004. And it finds support in Comstock's aggressive - and initially unsuccessful - efforts to lobby DOJ and DHS officials with no responsibility for VRA enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 2458, 2462; PX-298(R), at RFA 73, 91-95. Those efforts make clear that the goal of Secretary Ross and his aides was to launder their request through another agency - that is, to obtain cover for a decision that they had already made - and that the reasons underlying any request from another agency were secondary, if not irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   177. Once again as well, extra-record evidence merely strengthens the conclusion that Secretary Ross's actual rationale was something other than VRA enforcement - and that a belief that he needed another agency to request the question, rather than a belief that adding a citizenship question was necessary to enhance VRA enforcement, motivated his aggressive efforts to stimulate a request from DOJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   178. First, notwithstanding his otherwise self-serving testimony, Comstock conceded in his deposition testimony that he did not believe that Secretary Ross's unstated reasons to add a citizenship question in early 2017 would \"clear [the] legal thresholds\" set by OMB and federal law. Comstock Dep. 153-54. Indeed, he admitted that he viewed his job as finding a \"legal rationale\" to support the Secretary's request (and then finding an agency to make the ask) and that he did not \"need to know what\" the Secretary's actual \"rationale might be, because it may or may not be one that is ... legally-valid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    at 181, 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That testimony constitutes a near-confession that the VRA rationale was a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   concoction to justify a decision made for other reasons - that is, that Comstock felt the need to launder the request through another agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   179. Second, there is reason to doubt that\n   <em>\n    DOJ itself\n   </em>\n   believed the VRA rationale in the Gary Letter. The VRA was enacted in 1965, fifteen years after a citizenship question last appeared on the decennial census questionnaire for all households. Yet, until Secretary Ross and his senior aides planted the seed, DOJ had never before cited a VRA-related need for citizenship data from the decennial census; never before asserted that it had failed to bring or win a VRA case because of the absence of such data; and never before claimed that it had been hampered in any way by relying on citizenship estimates obtained from sample surveys. After fifty-four years of VRA enforcement, it was the Department of Commerce that first proposed the idea. In fact, DOJ did not even take the bait when Comstock first approached staff with the idea. It was not until Secretary Ross intervened directly\n   with Attorney General Sessions that DOJ agreed to carry the baton forward based on the rationale that Secretary Ross's aides had come up with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   180. Additionally, AAAG Gore, the actual author of the Gary Letter, acknowledged that none of the DOJ components with principal responsibility for enforcing the VRA requested the addition of a citizenship question; instead, he drafted the letter solely in response to the Secretary's request. Gore Dep. 64-67, 94-95. He also testified that he drafted the letter without knowing if citizenship data based on responses to a citizenship question on the census would have smaller or larger margins of error, or would be any more precise, than the existing citizenship data on which DOJ currently relies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    at 225-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   181. Beyond that, the odd nature of DOJ's request and events thereafter suggest that the goal was not to obtain better CVAP data for purposes of VRA enforcement, but merely to provide cover for Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question. It would have been one thing for DOJ to ask the Commerce Department for better CVAP data and leave it to the Commerce Department, which is ultimately tasked with deciding how to obtain needed data, to figure out how best to meet that need. But DOJ went further and, going beyond its role, explicitly asked the Commerce Department to add the citizenship question to the census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   182. Of course, there is no mystery why DOJ did so. By Secretary Ross's own admission, the Department of Commerce did not merely ask DOJ if existing data was adequate; instead, making clear that he had prejudged the solution to a problem that DOJ might or might not even have, he and his staff affirmatively asked DOJ if it \"would support, and if so would request,\n   <em>\n    inclusion of a citizenship question\n   </em>\n   .\" June 21 Supplemental Memo (emphasis added). And, despite the DOJ staff's own lack of interest, Attorney General Sessions was only happy to oblige. As his aide put it to Teramoto: \"[W]e can do whatever you all need us to do .... The AG is eager to assist.\" AR 2651.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   183. Further, when the Census Bureau sought to meet with representatives of DOJ to discuss other, less harmful ways of meeting its need for data, Attorney General Sessions vetoed any such meeting. Had DOJ's interest genuinely been to get better CVAP data, rather than providing a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationale for Secretary Ross's resolve to add a citizenship question to the census, there is no explanation for that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   184. Finally, the Court's conclusion is supported by the sheer number of ways in which Secretary Ross and his aides tried to avoid disclosure of, if not conceal, the real timing and the real reasons for the decision to add the citizenship question.

First, it establishes that, in regulating the federal courts' power to dispense prospective relief, Article III is concerned with the\n   <em>\n    risk\n   </em>\n   of future injury, rather than its ultimate realization. After all, the Court found that Davis had standing even though the harm he feared never materialized. Second, the opinion makes plain that the risk of future injury may\n   satisfy Article III's injury and causation requirements even if several steps on the causal chain still stand between a defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injury when the case is filed. Davis, for example, was at least three steps away from suffering any concrete harm: He had to spend a sufficient amount of his own money; his opponent had to refrain from a comparable level of self-funding,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 729 &amp; n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the heightened contribution limits were triggered when \"a statistic that compares the expenditure of personal funds by competing candidates\" reached a particular level);\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   his opponent had to then take advantage of the law by accepting heightened contributions. Even so, the Court found that Davis faced \"a real, immediate, and direct injury ... when he filed suit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n    at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, and related,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   underscores that, under longstanding precedent, a party can establish standing to challenge government action even where its theory of injury depends on \"choices made by independent actors not before the courts,\" so long as - through statistical analysis, common sense, or record evidence - the court can \"predict\" that those independent actors will respond to the government action in a way that causes the injury.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's theory of injury depended on the assumption that his opponent would be sufficiently incentivized to take advantage of the heightened contribution limits, once triggered. The Court deemed that assumption valid based on little more than evidence that \"\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   candidates who had the opportunity to receive expanded contributions had done so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 735,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

For example, in the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the Census Bureau used public advertising campaigns that included paid media in over a dozen languages to reach hard-to-count immigrant communities and to improve their responsiveness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.

The central pillar of the Census Bureau's efforts to count everyone - and the means through which the majority of people are counted, AR 172 - is self-response to a questionnaire that the Census Bureau tries to send to every housing unit in the United States,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Joint Stips. \u00b6 7. If there is net differential decline in self-response rates among a particular group (in other words, if the rate of self-response to the census questionnaire declines by a certain amount among a particular group, but not other groups) then that decline will, if left uncured, translate into a net differential undercount of that group (in other words, an undercount of that group that does not affect other groups).\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs have proved that the addition of a citizenship question will cause precisely that outcome with respect to noncitizen and Hispanic households.

With respect to Hispanic households, by contrast, Plaintiffs have managed to prove only that there will be such a decline; the evidence is not sufficient to quantify the decline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   190. The Court begins, as the census does, with self-response to the census questionnaire. The evidence in the trial record overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census will cause a significant net differential decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households (that is, households with at least one noncitizen). Significantly, that is the Census Bureau's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   considered view.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Brown Memo at 39, 54. Indeed, several persuasive Census Bureau analyses support this position, and no evidence in the record - from Defendants or otherwise - contradicts it. Defendants do attack the Census Bureau's own analyses in one respect, discussed below, but the proposition that addition of the citizenship question will cause a net differential decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households is otherwise undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   191. The Census Bureau's conclusions are spelled out in three memoranda. First, the Census Bureau's December 22 Memo summarized evidence that a citizenship question would cause a then-estimated 5.1% decline in self-response rates among noncitizens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 22 Memo, at AR 11639-40. It noted that \"this evidence is consistent with citizenship questions being more sensitive for household with noncitizens,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 11640, a fact that is not in dispute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PX-297 at RFA 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   192. Second, the Census Bureau's January 19 Memo similarly concluded that addition of a citizenship question would reduce self-response rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 19 Memo, at AR 1280. The Memo summarized \"[t]hree distinct analyses\" that \"support the conclusion of an adverse impact on self-response\" caused by the addition of a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . First, data show that, on the ACS survey, Hispanic households\n   are disproportionately less likely to respond to the citizenship question, whether responding by mail or online.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, a comparison of self-response rates for the 2000 census's long-form census questionnaire (which included a citizenship question) and its short-form census questionnaire (which did not) revealed that noncitizen households were 3.3% less likely than all-citizen households to respond to the long-form questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A similar comparison of 2010 census self-response rates to 2010 ACS self-response rates (the latter of which included a citizenship question) produced a similar result: Noncitizen households were 5.1% less likely than all-citizen households to respond to the survey containing a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Based on these comparisons, the Memo noted, it was a \"reasonable inference that a question on citizenship would lead to some decline in overall self-response\" and \"a larger decline in self-response for noncitizen households.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AR 1281. Finally, the Memo analyzed the \"breakoff rates\" (the rate at which a respondent stops responding to the survey when he or she comes to a particular question) on the 2016 ACS internet survey. Those rates indicated that Hispanics were disproportionately likely to \"breakoff\" in their responses when they came to the citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   193. Third, a comprehensive study by Census Bureau staff published on August 6, 2018 and referred to at trial as the Brown Memo (so named for its lead author) consolidated the existing data on the impact of a citizenship question. The Brown Memo also concluded that a citizenship question would disproportionately reduce noncitizens' self-response rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Memo at 1, 54. The Brown Memo presented data illustrating that Hispanics and noncitizens are disproportionately unlikely to respond to a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9. The data also showed that those subpopulations became even less likely to respond to a citizenship question during the middle of this decade.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10 (\"[T]hat sensitivity has increased in recent years.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   194. Whereas the January 19 Memo had predicted that addition of the citizenship question would cause a 5.1% differential decline in noncitizen household self-response rates,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   January 19 Memo, at AR 1280, the Brown Memo updated that figure to 5.8% on the basis of more recent data,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Brown Memo at 39. Notably, it emphasized that the 5.8% estimate was still \"conservative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 900-01. It was conservative, the Memo explained, because the analysis supporting the estimate relied on ACS data, and the effect of a citizenship question on the ACS may have been muted by its presence among the large number of questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Memo at 39;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 87, 89, 901-02. A citizenship question on the shorter 2020 census questionnaire \"will be more visible\" and thus likely to produce a more pronounced effect. Brown Memo at 39. And changes in the macroenvironment since the ACS data was collected, including a higher \"level of concern about using citizenship data for enforcement purposes,\" could also exacerbate the effects of adding a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   195. Separate and apart from its effects on self-response rates among noncitizen households, the Brown Memo supports the conclusion that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census will disproportionately depress self-response rates among Hispanic households (some, but not all, of which are also noncitizen households). The Brown Memo showed that Hispanics were more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to skip the citizenship question on the ACS and that the differential in such item nonresponse rates increased between 2013 and 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10. Other ACS questions did not produce the same differential effects.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   And the Memo found that the citizenship-question breakoff rate for Hispanics on the ACS was eight times higher than the breakoff rate for non-Hispanic whites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   January 19 Memo, at AR 1281.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   196. As the Census Bureau has observed, this differential breakoff effect is growing. The breakoff rate among Hispanics for the 2017 ACS citizenship question (which was not available in time to be incorporated into the Brown Memo's analysis) was\n   <em>\n    twelve\n   </em>\n   times higher than the breakoff rate for non-Hispanic whites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 12757-62; Tr. 916. Moreover, the breakoff rate for Hispanics, but not for non-Hispanic whites, increased between 2016 and 2017 - suggesting that the effects of a citizenship question on Hispanic self-responses have been \"increas[ing].\" AR 12757-62; Tr. 916-17. The Census Bureau believes that \"Hispanics are more sensitive to survey questions about citizenship than they were a few years ago\"; non-Hispanic whites \"are not.\" Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 366-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   197. Defendants' expert, Dr. Abowd, credibly testified to the soundness of the Census Bureau's analyses and conclusion that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census would result in a differential decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households. With regard to methodology, Dr. Abowd testified not only that the Brown Memo was \"methodologically appropriate,\" but also that it \"constitutes the best analysis that the Census Bureau can do of the consequences of adding the citizenship question to the 2020 census\" given the available data. Tr. 897. With regard to conclusions, Dr. Abowd testified that both he and the Census Bureau agreed that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census would lead to a lower self-response rate among noncitizen households.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 881-82.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Dr. Abowd agreed that \"[t]he bulk of the evidence suggests that the citizenship question is likely to be responsible for the decline in self-response,\" and that 5.8% was a \"conservative estimate\" of the likely differential decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households if a citizenship question were added to the 2020 census questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1352, 900-02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   198. Dr. Abowd testified that considerations beyond those mentioned in the Brown Memo further supported the view that the 5.8% estimate was \"conservative.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 944. For instance, he referred to the Census Bureau's Census Barriers, Attitudes, and Motivators Survey (\"CBAMS\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; PX-662. The CBAMS found that, in 2018, only 67% of people said they were likely to respond to the 2020 census, as compared to the 86% who had said in 2008 they were likely to respond to the 2010 census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX-662, at 12. It noted that \"[t]he citizenship question may be a major barrier\" in part because people believed that the census's \"purpose is to find undocumented immigrants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. Dr. Abowd testified that the increase in sensitivity to a citizenship question reflected in the CBAMS study \"would not be captured in the 5.8 percentage point estimate that is based on data only up through 2016.\" Tr. 944-45;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 902, 916-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   199. Testimony from at least three of Plaintiffs' expert witnesses bolsters the Census Bureau's and Dr. Abowd's conclusions about self-response rates. First, Dr.\n   D. Sunshine Hillygus credibly and reliably testified that \"noncitizens and Hispanics are differentially concerned about the confidentiality of a citizenship question\" and, thus, \"would be less likely to participate\" in a survey that includes such a question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-51;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-58. She noted that this concern has increased in the last few years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-53. Notably, Dr. Hillygus testified that a citizenship question would be likely to affect the response rates of all Hispanics, \"regardless of their own immigration or citizenship status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52, 1404;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX-152; PX-662; PX-663. That testimony is supported by evidence showing that Hispanics who are citizens are disproportionately hesitant to engage with the government by seeking food stamps or health care out of fear that a family member could be deported.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 52-54, 57, 85-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   200. Second, Dr. Matthew Barreto, \"an expert in survey methodology, public opinion polling, and racial and ethnic politics,\" credibly testified that \"the addition of a citizenship question ... in today's macro environment would result in reduced participation in Latino and immigrant communities in 2020.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 589, 620-21. He based this conclusion on a review of existing social science literature and on the results of a public opinion survey that he designed and conducted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 620, 643-44. On the basis of that evidence, Dr. Barreto credibly concluded that Hispanic households would be substantially less willing to participate in the census if there were a citizenship question, regardless of whether they were given assurances that their responses would be kept confidential. Tr. 682-85;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX-670.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   201. Third, Dr. Jennifer L. Van Hook's expert analysis of 2017 ACS data demonstrates that nonresponse to the ACS citizenship question has continued to increase among Hispanics relative to other subgroups since 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 489-3 (\"Van Hook Decl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 69-71. By contrast, there has not been a significant increase in nonresponse rates for the citizenship question for other racial groups.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. On an absolute basis, nonresponse rates for the citizenship question for Hispanics have also increased since 2013.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   202. Amazingly, despite all of the foregoing evidence - much of it from Defendants' own expert witness and the Census Bureau itself - Defendants contend that Plaintiffs failed to prove that addition of a citizenship question will cause these differential declines in self-response rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 8-16;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10, \u00b6\u00b6 94, 96. But that contention is without merit. First, it is based on a mischaracterization of the record evidence. For example, Defendants urge the Court to adopt a factual finding that, \"[w]hile the balance of available evidence suggests that including a citizenship question on the 2020 Census\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   lead to a lower self-response rate in households that potentially contain a noncitizen, the magnitude of any such decline is unknown.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, \u00b6 93 (emphasis added and citation omitted). It goes without saying that the magnitude of any decline in self-response to the 2020 census questionnaire is, today, \"unknown\" (since the census has not yet occurred). But the weight of the evidence definitively shows the most that evidence about future events can ever show: a probable range of \"magnitudes,\" all illustrating the overwhelming likelihood that the \"magnitude\" of the differential decline in self-responses among noncitizens and Hispanics will be quite high - in the case of noncitizen households, conservatively estimated to be 5.8% or higher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   203. Second, Defendants' argument fails because it relies heavily on misguided criticism of the Census Bureau's own research. For instance, Defendants argue that the Brown Memo \"cannot assign causation to the citizenship question\" because it is merely a \"natural experiment,\" as opposed to \"a randomized control trial,\" and because it \"did not, and to a certain extent could not\" control for every confounding variable. Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 10, \u00b6 96. But the Brown Memo\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   conceive of, and control for, numerous potentially confounding variables in its analysis of the citizenship question's effect on self-response rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Memo at 74-77 (Tables A13-A14); Tr. 1151. As Dr. Abowd explained, for example, the factors controlled for in that analysis were the \"groups of questions that ... might plausibly be related to other sensitive questions for some subpopulation.\" Tr. 1150. That is, although it is true that no \"natural experiment\" could ever control for\n   <em>\n    all possible\n   </em>\n   confounding factors, this experiment\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   control for all\n   <em>\n    plausible\n   </em>\n   confounding factors associated with other questions on the ACS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1150-55. And, although Defendants argue that the Brown analysis did not control for the sheer length of the ACS,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 10, \u00b6 96, the Brown analysis largely did control for that factor by controlling for household size, \"which has the biggest effect on the number of questions that you have to answer in the [ACS].\" Tr. 1152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   204. Finally, Defendants suggest that the Brown Memo is incomplete because it \"could not account for the changing macro environment\" and that it could be that the macroenvironment, rather than the citizenship question, explained why noncitizen households responded to the ACS at lower rates than all-citizen households.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 10, \u00b6 96. But, as Dr. Abowd explained, the macroenvironment is \"constant\" or \"almost constant\" across the groups. Tr. 1153. That means that even though the kind of natural experiments described in the Brown Memo \"can't make ... sophisticated controls for the macro environment,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , any meaningful effects\n   should be muted because the same macroenvironment affects all ACS respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   205. In sum, the trial evidence clearly shows, and certainly shows by a preponderance of the evidence, that the citizenship question will cause a significant differential decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households. Notably, even Defendants conceded at oral argument that there is \"credible quantifiable evidence\" that \"the citizenship question could be expected to cause a decline in self-response.\" Tr. 1453.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   206. More specifically, the Court finds that the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census will cause an incremental net differential decline in self-responses among noncitizen households of at least 5.8%. The Court further finds that that estimate is conservative and that the net differential decline could be much higher. Further, the evidence demonstrates, and the Court finds, that the citizenship question will also cause a significant decline in self-response rates among Hispanic households. Although it is harder to quantify the likely magnitude of that decline (or to isolate the decline from the citizenship question's effects on self-response rates among noncitizen households) based on the record here, the evidence of a decline in self-response rates among Hispanic households supports the overall conclusion that the 5.8% estimate captures only part of the citizenship question's differential effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   <strong>\n    3. NRFU Operations Will Not Cure the Differential Drop in Self-Response Rates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   207. The Court turns next to the Census Bureau's procedures (referred to as Non-Response Follow-Up, or NRFU) for attempting to make up for the large number of households that do not self-respond to the census questionnaire. If a known household fails to self-respond, it is shifted into the Census Bureau's NRFU workload.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stips. \u00b6 8. NRFU includes a range of operations designed to obtain data about those households that do not volunteer the information themselves: in-person visits to households by \"enumerators\"; use of administrative records; collection of information from \"proxies,\" such as neighbors or landlords; and \"imputation,\" a process through which the Census Bureau extrapolates data about households from supposedly comparable household data.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-12; Tr. 33-34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2026643\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. 26643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26648-49 (June 8, 2018) (admitted as PX-655).

The evidence demonstrates that each of NRFU's steps will replicate or exacerbate the effects of the net differential decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   208. Even before the addition of the citizenship question, the Census Bureau had been anticipating a somewhat larger NRFU workload for the 2020 Census. Rates of self-response to Census Bureau surveys have been in general decline, \"as people are overloaded with requests for information and [are] increasingly concerned about sharing information.\" AR 162, 172. With the addition of the citizenship question and the corresponding decline in self-response rates it will cause, however, the Census Bureau now expects a previously unanticipated increase in NRFU cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 3 Memo, at AR 5474; Brown Memo at 43. That is, the decline in self-response rates caused by the citizenship question will force the Census Bureau to \"try to enumerate more people through nonresponse follow-up efforts.\" Tr. 950-52;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   January 19 Memo, at AR 1279-82. Moreover, because\n   the decline in self-response rates will be disproportionately greater among noncitizens and Hispanics, the Census Bureau expects an increased use of NRFU operations in an effort to enumerate a disproportionate number of noncitizen and Hispanic households.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Memo at 42-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   209. The resulting increase in NRFU workload will be enormous. The Census Bureau estimates that nearly ten percent of all households \"potentially contain at least one noncitizen.\" Brown Memo at 42. Based on this, it estimates that the addition of a citizenship question will cause approximately 2,090,000 additional households (approximately 6.5 million additional people) to go into its NRFU procedures, because of the citizenship question's effects on self-response among noncitizen households alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2026643\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   210. The Census Bureau strives to maximize self-response rates - rather than relying on the collection of data through NRFU operations - for two reasons. First, NRFU operations are more expensive than self-response, so maximizing self-response reduces the costs of administering the census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 33. Second, the data collected through self-response is more accurate and complete than the data collected through NRFU operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-35, 292, 325. Accordingly, the Census Bureau places a high priority on obtaining self-responses from as many households as possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 163, 165.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   211. Significantly, NRFU has not remedied net undercounts in prior censuses. For example, in prior censuses, the net undercounts of Hispanics were estimated at 1.54% (2010), 0.71% (2000), and 4.99% (1990) even after NRFU procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX-267, at 18 (Table 7);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1364-65. As Dr. Hillygus testified, these translated into differential undercounts of Hispanics, as compared to non-Hispanic whites, of 2.38% (2010), 1.84% (2000), and 4.31% (1990).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 95-97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   212. Moreover, historical data show that substantial post-NRFU undercounts can manifest in specific locations, including at the neighborhood level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 407, 412-14, 416, 452-53. The 2010 Census, for example, omitted approximately 65,000 people in minority neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens, despite NRFU efforts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 452-53. That 2010 undercount involved an erroneous enumeration (that is, an overcount) of 8.4% in non-Hispanic white neighborhoods and an omission (that is, undercount) of over 10% in high-minority neighborhoods of Brooklyn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 412-413, 414, 452-53. Thus, although there was no net undercount in Brooklyn as a whole, the offsetting enumeration errors and NRFU failures yielded erroneous data at the neighborhood level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 412, 414.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   213. The record shows that if a citizenship question is added to the 2020 census, NRFU procedures will fail to cure the resulting differential decline in self-response rates among noncitizen and Hispanic households. As the Court lays out in more detail below, each step of the NRFU process will fail to prevent such a decline from translating into a differential undercount of people who live in such households, and will likely even exacerbate the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   214. In the first place, the evidence shows that NRFU cannot - and does not even try to - fix undercounts caused by households leaving certain individual members off their questionnaire, a phenomenon that will be more common among noncitizen and Hispanic households. That is, when a household\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   self-respond, but omits one or more household members from its response, the Census Bureau simply assumes it has counted everyone at that address. NRFU does not even attempt to fix this problem, meaning that\n   the uncounted household member will stay uncounted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1309-10; Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 459. This precise phenomenon has contributed to net undercounts of certain subpopulations in the past - including Hispanics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1306;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 394. And indeed, the evidence shows that noncitizens and Hispanics are both disproportionately likely to be omitted from self-responses in this way, particularly if the citizenship question is added to the census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 124-26;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1308-10. Dr. Abowd testified that it is \"fair\" to say that NRFU \"would not meaningfully address\" any undercount caused by this type of omission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1326. In fact, because such households would count as having self-responded, they would never enter the NRFU workload, and, for that matter, would not even count toward the 5.8% decline in self-response. That is, the phenomenon of household roster omissions helps explain both why the 5.8% figure is conservative and why NRFU will fall short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   215. Second, even where NRFU does attempt to address the decline in self-responses among noncitizen households, it is at least as likely to fail at that task as the decline in self-response is likely to occur in the first place. This is because many of the reasons that the citizenship question will cause a decline in self-response also apply to NRFU, and will also make NRFU less effective at remedying that decline. For example, to the extent that the macroenvironment will magnify the effects of the citizenship question on self-response, it will also render NRFU operations less effective among the subpopulations that are less likely to self-respond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 314-15; Tr. 96, 100. As Dr. Abowd testified, the Census Bureau has not tested the efficacy of NRFU operations in the presence of a citizenship question. Tr. 1303. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, introduced persuasive evidence that NRFU operations will not succeed in remedying the differential decline in self-response caused by the addition of the citizenship question because each successive step of the NRFU process will reinforce or exacerbate the differential undercount of noncitizens and Hispanics. As the Court discusses below, this will happen in four primary ways: (1) noncitizens and Hispanics who do not self-respond to the census because of the presence of a citizenship question are similarly unlikely to respond (or to give a complete response) to in-person NRFU enumerators; (2) in some cases, NRFU will enumerate non-self-responding households using administrative records that, while the most accurate source of citizenship information, still tend to undercount noncitizens; (3) to the extent NRFU relies on \"proxy\" responses from third parties, those proxies are disproportionately unlikely to give information about noncitizen and Hispanic households and likely to underestimate their size when they do; and (4) imputation will reinforce or exacerbate the net differential undercount because it will extrapolate data about uncounted households - including a disproportionate number of noncitizen and Hispanic households - from a data set in which noncitizens and Hispanics are disproportionately underrepresented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   216. To begin, NRFU's first step - an in-person visit from a NRFU enumerator - is likely to disproportionately undercount noncitizens and Hispanics. As the Census Bureau itself acknowledges, households that refuse to self-respond to the census questionnaire because of the presence of a citizenship question are \"particularly likely to refuse to respond in NRFU as well.\" March 1 Memo, at AR 1311. The Census Bureau's specific analysis of the effect of the citizenship question on the\n   NRFU process bears this out: That analysis concluded that \"[h]ouseholds deciding not to self-respond because of the citizenship question are likely to refuse to cooperate with enumerators coming to their door.\" Brown Memo at 41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42 n.19; Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 425; Tr. 1336-37. Defendants' own expert, Dr. Abowd, testified that the same considerations leading such households not to self-respond are likely to lead them not to respond to NRFU in-person enumerators. Tr. 1312. And as the authors of the Brown Memo concluded, given this resistance to in-person enumerators, the undercount attributable to a citizenship question \"may not be avoidable ... by spending more money on fieldwork. Once a household decides not to cooperate, it may not be possible to obtain an accurate enumeration no matter how many times an enumerator knocks on their door.\" Brown Memo at 43 n.60. Based on the evidence, the Court finds that households that do not self-respond to the census questionnaire because of the citizenship question are similarly unlikely to respond to NRFU enumerators - or to give a complete and accurate accounting of the people who live in their households when they do. This step in NRFU will therefore only replicate the citizenship question's differential effects on self-response, thereby failing to counteract a differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen and Hispanic households.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   217. The same will be true of what comes next for some households, after in-person NRFU attempts fail - the use of administrative records. After a NRFU enumerator's first visit to an address, if high-quality administrative records about that address are available,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 67 &amp; n.4, the enumerator may consult those records to determine whether the address is vacant or should be deleted from the Master Address File or MAF, or even to enumerate the people who live there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1116, 1201-02, 1207-08;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2026643\">\n    83 Fed Reg. at 26649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the use of administrative records in these ways will reinforce, rather than cure, the differential undercount of noncitizens and Hispanics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-408\">\n   218. First, although the evidence does not strongly suggest that it will disproportionately affect noncitizen or Hispanic households, using administrative records to mark addresses as vacant or for deletion from the MAF will negatively affect the quality of data obtained through NRFU procedures. When an address is marked as \"vacant\" or flagged for deletion from the MAF, it is \"enumerated\" as containing no people, and all further efforts to count people living there stop; no subsequent imputation is made to count people at that address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 368. Put differently, \"[i]mputation,\" the next step in NRFU, \"is not required because you have essentially said there aren't any people there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 367. But, according to the Census Bureau's own limited studies, roughly twenty percent of addresses that administrative records suggest should be deleted or marked as vacant are actually occupied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 314;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1199. Nor do the Census Bureau's future plans to address this error rate - which include adding\n   an additional direct visit by an enumerator before marking an address \"vacant\" or \"delete,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1199-1200 - solve the problem. As a preliminary matter, it is not clear that the Court can even consider that possibility given that the parties' stipulations about NRFU procedures do not include such a step.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stips. \u00b6\u00b6 8-11. But it is not clear that the plans will reduce the error either. The Census Bureau has performed no testing of how effective the new procedures will be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1378-79. And when it attempted something similar in 2010 - that is, sending an enumerator to independently verify the status of any housing unit identified as vacant - the process still remained error-prone.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 351-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   219. Thus, the Court finds that the process of marking as vacant or deleting addresses from the MAF will result in the misidentification of occupied addresses as vacant or \"should be deleted.\" This will undermine NRFU's ability to correct for any decline in the self-response rate on the 2020 census. Additionally, the Court finds that these errors will be particularly large in the 2020 census because the addition of the citizenship question and consequent decline in the self-response rates among noncitizen and Hispanic households will push more of these households into the NRFU process, where the errors will manifest. Although there is no evidence in the record to suggest that the errors introduced at this step will aggravate or ameliorate any net undercount of noncitizens or Hispanics, they will be one more mechanism through which the citizenship question will degrade the quality of resulting census data, by causing more households to be enumerated through this process, rather than through more accurate self-responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   220. Whether and how administrative records will be used to\n   <em>\n    enumerate\n   </em>\n   non-self-responding households in NRFU is uncertain, as the procedure has not yet been approved by OMB, and the Census Bureau \"hasn't made a decision yet about how it will process responses to the citizenship question alongside\" those records. Tr. 1030. If administrative records are used for that purpose, however, they will reinforce the net undercount of people who live in noncitizen households and Hispanics. The Census Bureau has no data to show that using administrative records would cure a differential drop in self-response rates, Tr. 1340, and when asked whether there was evidence that \"populations that are likely to see an increase in nonresponse due to the citizenship question can be successfully enumerated on a wide scale using administrative records,\" Dr. Abowd answered that \"the administrative record actually shows that [the Census Bureau] concluded the opposite,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the evidence shows that, if the process is used, it will actually differentially undercount Hispanics and people who live in noncitizen households because the quality of administrative record data varies for different groups.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104. If such records are used, they will be used to enumerate only \"a limited number of those households for which there is high quality administrative data about the household.\" Joint Stips. \u00b6 9. Noncitizen and Hispanic households are less likely to be accurately represented in quality administrative records than other groups.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1340-41; Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 252-23, 389-91; Tr. 104. As a result, the Census Bureau expects that it will fail to link Hispanics to administrative records at a higher rate than non-Hispanic whites; that enumeration using administrative records will be less successful for noncitizens than for citizens; and that undocumented immigrants will be even harder to enumerate using administrative records because they are less likely to appear in such records at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1340-41; Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 389-91. Thus, although in a simple one-to-one comparison, the administrative records available to the Census Bureau are a more reliable source of accurate answers to questions about a person's citizenship status than survey questions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1285, the administrative records proposed to be used for this purpose would still tend to undercount people who live in noncitizen households. In any event, the Court declines to place much weight at all on a step that, Defendants admit, remains a hypothetical possibility rather than part of a finalized plan to address the effects of the citizenship question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   221. Third, the use of proxies at the next step of the NRFU process is also unlikely to cure the decline in self-response among noncitizens and Hispanic households. Indeed, as with other NFRU procedures, households that fail to self-respond because of the citizenship question will be relatively unlikely to be successfully enumerated through proxies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1342. For one thing, proxy responses are more likely to result in errors and omissions of household members than self-responses are, further degrading the quality of the resulting census data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 382-83. For example, the Census Bureau's analysis of the 2010 Census found that proxy responses resulted in a correct enumeration only 70.2% of the time, as compared to 97.3% of the time for self-responding households.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 19 Memo, at AR 1282 (citing PX-267 at 33, Table 21). For another, the Census Bureau has found that proxies generally \"supply poor quality individual demographic and socioeconomic characteristic information about the person on behalf of whom they are responding.\" Brown Memo at 41, 42 (Table 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   222. In fact, the evidence suggests that the use of proxies will reinforce or exacerbate the net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen and Hispanic households attributable to the citizenship question. The record contains no evidence suggesting that households that fail to respond to the census because of a citizenship question will be enumerated through proxies as successfully as other non-responding households, Tr. 1342; to the contrary, the evidence suggests that households that fail to self-respond because of the citizenship question will be relatively unlikely to be successfully enumerated through proxies, even as compared to households that fail to self-respond for other reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   223. For instance, the Census Bureau's evidence shows that people who live in areas with higher percentages of noncitizen households are less likely to give proxy responses than people in other areas are.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 386. In other words, people who live in communities with high rates of noncitizens are disproportionately less likely to provide information about their neighbors to the government. Moreover, when proxies do answer, they are less likely to provide accurate information than self-responders are.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 19 Memo, at AR 1282; Brown Memo at 41. Some proxies give incorrect information because they \"have less information about the household than a member of the household [does].\" Tr. 107. As Dr. Hillygus testified, proxy responders are especially likely to underestimate the size of noncitizen and Hispanic households because they do not know the true size of the household due to complexities in living arrangements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1397-1400. And some proxies give incorrect information because they have an incentive to do so. For example, landlords concerned about violating the law might intentionally underreport the number of occupants in a household or fail to report residents lacking legal status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 107-08, 336. And other proxies may choose not to reveal information for fear that it will cause negative consequences like deportation for their neighbors.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . at 110-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1398-1400. A preponderance of the evidence thus shows - and the Court finds - that the use of proxies in NRFU will systematically underestimate the size of noncitizen and Hispanic households.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   224. Fourth, the final stage of the NRFU process - imputation - will also reinforce or exacerbate a differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen and Hispanic households. \"Imputation\" means, essentially, modeling or predicting information about the uncounted households based on the information already gathered from counted households.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1232, 1350-51. For the census, a household is \"imputed\" only if it remains uncounted after all the other NRFU steps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1231, 1350. At that point, the Census Bureau imputes the number and characteristics of the people living in the household.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-14. As practiced by the Census Bureau in NRFU operations, imputation has two components: \"count imputation,\" which imputes the\n   <em>\n    size\n   </em>\n   of a household; and \"whole-person imputation,\" which includes \"count imputation\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   imputation of all other characteristics to the people in the household.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . at 113-14, 1193-94; January 19 Memo, at AR 1281. In each case, accurate imputation depends on an accurate starting point; \"if there are errors in the data collected, those errors are then carried over into the imputation.\" Thompson Decl. \u00b6 117;\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   , January 19 Memo, at AR 1282.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   225. NRFU's imputation procedures will reinforce or exacerbate the net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen and Hispanic households because the Census Bureau's imputation model incorrectly assumes that it is starting with accurate data. As Dr. Barreto credibly explained, when imputing characteristics from a group of counted (or \"known\") people to a group of unknown (or \"missing\") people, it matters whether the \"missing\" group is a random selection of the population or whether it is instead missing for a particular reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 702-03. If the \"missing-ness\" of a group is correlated with a particular characteristic, that will make it impossible to accurately impute characteristics from the known group to the missing group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . For example, if the group of \"missing\" households still uncounted after NRFU's first three steps is disproportionately composed of noncitizens and Hispanics compared to the known (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , counted) households, then imputing the missing household characteristics from the known population (in which noncitizens and Hispanics are\n   <em>\n    under\n   </em>\n   represented) will not yield accurate data about the \"missing\" households (in which noncitizens and Hispanics are\n   <em>\n    over\n   </em>\n   represented).\n   <em>\n    See also id.\n   </em>\n   at 702-03, 1236-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   226. That is precisely the problem here. For all the reasons explained above, when the Census Bureau performs its imputation calculations, noncitizen and Hispanics households will be underrepresented in the \"counted\" or \"known\" population and overrepresented in the \"unknown\" or \"missing\" population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 119, 1352-54, 1401; PX-400, at 3. Because the Census Bureau \"do[es] imputation based on those self-responding ..., enumerated households,\" and because self-response to the Census is correlated with citizenship status (that is, citizens are more likely to self-respond to the census than noncitizens, as discussed above), the set of known households from which imputation proceeds will be disproportionately composed of all-citizen households. Tr. 1351-52;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Brown\n   Memo at 44.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Noncitizen and Hispanic households are therefore more likely to be counted using imputation. But because that imputation will extrapolate their numbers from an unrepresentative sample (which undercounts them), that imputation will lead to an erroneous under-enumeration of people who live in both noncitizen and Hispanic households. The Census Bureau knows that its imputation model will be biased in this way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 114-19, 1353-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   227. Dr. Abowd acknowledged that imputation \"disadvantages hard-to-count subpopulations\" such as noncitizens and households containing noncitizens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1384-85. And Census Bureau data suggest that, historically, increased rates of imputation lead to undercounts in the imputed population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX-267, at 16-17 &amp; Table 9. Additionally, the Census Bureau has historically treated household size as an \"ignorable\" characteristic, one that can be safely assumed to occur randomly throughout both the known and unknown populations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 113-17;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX-478 at 5-7. But the available data show that household size is not an ignorable trait. Because Hispanic and noncitizen households tend to be larger than other households, and because such households are underrepresented in the known sample (and overrepresented in the \"missing\" group), imputing household size from the known sample to the missing group leads to an undercount of the missing group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 115-21. Imputing missing household figures from data that already undercount noncitizens and Hispanics, as the Census Bureau plans to do, will only extrapolate that undercount into the imputed data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   228. The Census Bureau has not yet finalized its imputation algorithm for the 2020 Census.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at. 1351. Dr. Abowd testified that the Census Bureau has set up an \"expert panel\" empowered to modify the imputation algorithm \"if they can figure out a way to do so successfully,\" but \"no such modification has been proposed to date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1353. And, speaking more generally, Dr. Abowd testified that the Census Bureau \"[does not] plan to modify the NRFU operation to address the citizenship question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   229. For all of these reasons, NRFU operations will fail to prevent the net decline in self-response rates among noncitizen (and likely Hispanic) households from translating into a net differential undercount of people who live in such households - instead, it will reinforce or exacerbate that decline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   230. In the face of Plaintiffs' considerable evidence that NRFU will fail to remedy the differential decline in self-response among Hispanic and noncitizen households - or, worse, even exacerbate the decline - Defendants offer no evidence to support their claim that NRFU will be adequate to the task. And indeed, the available evidence supports exactly the opposite conclusion. Where specific subpopulations have self-responded at relatively lower rates before, NRFU has failed to compensate for the difference, leading to net undercounts of those populations. As Plaintiffs' expert Dr. William P. O'Hare demonstrated based on his study of the last three censuses, for example, negative net differential self-response rates among demographic groups have reliably translated into net undercounts of those demographic groups\n   <em>\n    despite the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Census Bureau's\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NRFU operations\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 507-1 (\"Corr. O'Hare Aff.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 28-30, 38-39, 43-44. That is powerful evidence that NRFU is generally unable to prevent self-response declines from translating into net undercounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   231. Dr. O'Hare opined further that declines in self-response rates\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   net undercounts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-55. In response, Defendants are quick to recite the old saw that correlation alone does not imply causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 16, \u00b6 123. Dr. O'Hare recognized that, however, and was accordingly careful in his conclusions. And, as Dr. O'Hare correctly pointed out, a correlation of the strength and character that he described may be evidence of causation, even if it is incapable of establishing it beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corr. O'Hare Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   232. The Court concludes just that: Dr. O'Hare's testimony provides affirmative evidence that self-response declines among specific subpopulations directly cause net undercounts of those subpopulations. For the purposes of this litigation, a preponderance of the evidence supports that conclusion. More importantly, however, Dr. O'Hare's testimony illustrates the historical inability of NRFU to\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   net undercounts of particular subpopulations in the presence of a decline in self-response rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   233. Despite this evidence about the inadequacy of NRFU procedures, Defendants claim that NRFU efforts will be sufficient \"to mitigate any decrease in the initial self-response rate.\" Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 16, \u00b6 127. But Defendants offer no evidence to support their claim and, as noted above, the evidence strongly supports the opposite conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-426\">\n   234. It is worth stepping back to view the evidence on this point as a whole. As is essentially undisputed, differential rates of self-response among different subpopulations are common, and the Census Bureau struggles to cure the defects caused by those differentially low self-response rates with its NRFU operations. For the 2020 census, the Census Bureau plans to add a question about citizenship that it knows will cause an additional, incremental differential decline in self-response rates in a defined subpopulation. But, Defendants argue, this will not result in a net undercount of that subpopulation, because its NRFU operations - which\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   work perfectly - will somehow work perfectly this time. Meanwhile, Plaintiffs have introduced overwhelming evidence (most of which is acknowledged, accepted, or generated by the Census Bureau itself) that, in this context, the Census Bureau's NRFU operations will instead work\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   well than ever - specifically with respect to the very people whose households will be differentially likely not to self-respond to the census questionnaire. Indeed, the evidence demonstrates that NRFU operations will simply replicate the same problems as the original attempt to obtain self-responses from those households.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   235. Seen in that light, it is impossible to accept Defendants' interpretation of the facts. In the face of Plaintiffs' strong evidence that the citizenship question will cause a differential decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households, Defendants demand that Plaintiffs also rebut their unsupported assurances that the Census Bureau will figure out a way to fix the problem, even though it has never done so before. To the extent that Plaintiffs must carry that additional burden, they have done so, as their evidence about NRFU's inadequacies in this context is far more persuasive than Defendants' conclusory assertions that NRFU will suddenly work exactly as hoped. In any event, on the whole, a preponderance of the evidence establishes that the incremental net differential\n   decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households caused by the citizenship question, and any similar decline among Hispanics, will remain uncured by NRFU, and will thus ripen into an incremental net differential undercount of the people who live in such households.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   236. In sum, the Court finds that the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census will cause an incremental net decline in self-response rates of at least 5.8% among noncitizen households, and a significant but unquantified net decline in self-response rates among Hispanic households. The Census Bureau's NRFU operations will not remedy those declines, which means that they will translate into an incremental net differential undercount of people who live in such households in the 2020 census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   237. Admittedly, it is difficult to precisely quantify the exact size of the net differential undercounts attributable to the citizenship question. Significantly, though, that is because of the difficulty of quantifying the exact effects of the\n   <em>\n    Census Bureau\n   </em>\n   's efforts to fix the problem, a subject about which there is frustratingly little quantitative evidence in the record. Starting with the conservative estimate of a 5.8% net decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households, the Court can find little justification in the record to depart from that estimate when arriving at a finding of the likely net undercount of people who live in noncitizen households. Indeed, as already discussed at great length, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that NRFU operations will simply replicate all of the same effects on noncitizen response that will cause the decline in self-response in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 213-29. On the other side of the ledger, Defendants have offered no quantifiable evidence of their own to support, much less quantify, their assertions of NRFU's hoped-for curative effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   238. The record does allow the Court to calculate a minimum likely net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households. If household size were distributed evenly across all households, both counted and uncounted, it would be possible to predict that an uncorrected 5.8% decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households would translate directly into a 5.8% net undercount of the people who live in those households. But the record evidence in these cases indicates that household size is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   distributed equally among self-responding and non-self-responding households: instead, households that do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   self-respond are likely to be larger than those that do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 119-20, 733. The Court therefore finds that the 5.8% decline in self-response rates will translate into a net undercount of people who live in such households of\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   5.8%, and likely more. Providing further support for that conclusion is the disproportionate likelihood that noncitizen households that do self-respond will leave individuals off their questionnaires, contributing to a differential undercount of people who live in such households in a way not captured by the initial 5.8% estimate at all. The Court therefore finds that the addition of a citizenship question will cause an incremental differential net undercount of people who live in noncitizen households of approximately 5.8%, and likely more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   239. Quantifying the likely net undercount of Hispanics caused by the citizenship question is more difficult on the basis of the evidence in the record. Nevertheless, the Court finds that a preponderance of the evidence indicates that the citizenship question will cause a nonzero net undercount of Hispanics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   240. Defendants' objections to these factual findings rest primarily on Dr. Abowd's double-negative testimony that he has not seen any \"credible quantitative data\" that the Census Bureau's NRFU operations will not prevent net undercounts of noncitizen and Hispanic populations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1214. But Defendants' reliance on that testimony is ultimately unpersuasive, for two reasons. First, Dr. Abowd did not opine (and no other record evidence suggests) that NRFU operations\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   remedy any undercounts caused by the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Instead, he opined, \"in a very careful way,\" only that he had not seen evidence sufficient to prove to his own standards that a net differential undercount would in fact result.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 925-26, 1165-66.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even so, Dr. Abowd testified that the Census Bureau had not run the type of randomized controlled trial that would have met his own standard of \"credible, quantitative evidence,\" but was nevertheless relying on the results of the \"natural experiment\" analyzed in the Brown Memo to plan for the 2020 census because, as he testified, the Census Bureau \"believe[d] they are the best available data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 926;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 923-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   241. Second, although Dr. Abowd's credibility, expertise, and dedication to public service impressed the Court in almost every respect, his opinion on this point does not shake the Court's confidence in its finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the addition of a citizenship question will cause a net differential undercount of noncitizens and Hispanics. For one thing, as Chief Scientist of the Census Bureau, his responsibilities are vastly different than those of a federal court, and his testimony and written analyses make clear that he and the Census Bureau insist (at least in the abstract) on a far greater degree of statistical confidence than that which applies in federal civil litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court's task is not to determine whether the evidence on the net differential undercounts caused by the citizenship question can satisfy the Census Bureau's high statistical standards. It is, instead, to determine whether Plaintiffs have proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the addition of a citizenship question will cause such undercounts. For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Effects of the Citizenship Question on Apportionment Among and Within States\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   242. Next, Plaintiffs have also proved that the net differential undercount of people\n   who live in noncitizen households will translate into several further concrete harms. First, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the addition of a citizenship question will cause or is likely to cause several jurisdictions to lose seats in the next congressional apportionment and that it will cause another set of jurisdictions to lose political representation in the next round of intrastate redistricting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   243. To begin, the Court finds that several states, including some that are Plaintiffs here and some in which NGO Plaintiffs' members reside, will lose at least one seat in the congressional reapportionment based on the 2020 census data. Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Christopher Warshaw modeled the effects of a net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households on congressional apportionment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 526-1 (\"Warshaw Decl.\"). (Dr. Warshaw also independently modeled the effects of various net differential undercounts of people who live in noncitizen households\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Hispanics together.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). Using the Method of Equal Proportions, which Congress adopted as the apportionment method in 1941, Dr. Warshaw calculated that an incremental 5.8% net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households will make California \"extremely likely\" to lose a congressional seat that it would not lose otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (Table 6) &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 42-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   244. Dr. Warshaw's findings also support the conclusion that, in the event that the net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households reaches 10% - or if there is a mere 5.8% differential undercount both of people who live in noncitizen households\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Hispanics - then Texas, Arizona, Florida, and Plaintiffs New York and Illinois will face a significant risk of an apportionment loss.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. As noted above, the Court cannot quantify exactly how much higher than 5.8% the noncitizen net differential undercount is likely to be and how high the Hispanic net differential undercount will be.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 238-39. But, based on the risks discussed above, the Court can say, and does find, that Texas, Arizona, Florida, and Plaintiffs New York and Illinois face a substantial risk of losing a seat in the next congressional reapportionment because of the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   245. The Court finds that Dr. Warshaw's calculations are credible and persuasive. As they are the most credible quantitative evidence in the record about the apportionment consequences of adding a citizenship question to the census questionnaire, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that California residents face a certainly impending loss of representation in the House of Representatives. Similarly, Texas, Arizona, Florida, New York, and Illinois face a substantial risk of losing a seat. In other words, based on the facts as proved here by a preponderance of the evidence, the Court finds that residents of those states face a substantial risk of a loss of representation in the House of Representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   246. The Court finds further that the citizenship question will have similar effects on\n   <em>\n    intra\n   </em>\n   state apportionment. States - including Plaintiffs here - rely on federal decennial census data to carry out their own\n   <em>\n    intra\n   </em>\n   state redistricting.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Del.

Dr. Warshaw analyzed the impact of the citizenship question on intrastate redistricting, and credibly found that a mere\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   percent differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households will lower the population enumerations, and statewide population shares, of several jurisdictions that are home to a disproportionate share of their states' populations living in noncitizen households.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Warshaw Decl. 28 (Table 8) &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 53-55, 57-59. New York City is a prime example. New York City contains approximately forty-three percent of the total state population, but approximately seventy-one percent of the state's noncitizen population. Docket No. 504-1 (\"Breitbart Aff.\") \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 504-2 (\"Supp. Breitbart Aff.\"). Dr. Warshaw calculated that if the citizenship question causes a mere two percent net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households, that will lower the statewide population shares of Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles County, California; Monterey County, California; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Prince George's County, Maryland; New York City; Columbus, Ohio; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Central Falls, Rhode Island; Providence, Rhode Island; Cameron County, Texas; El Paso County, Texas; Hidalgo County, Texas; and Seattle, Washington. Warshaw Decl. 28 (Table 8) &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 53-55, 57-59. The effect will be particularly pronounced for Plaintiffs Central Falls and Providence, Rhode Island; Cameron, Hidalgo, and El Paso Counties, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Miami, Florida; and New York City.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55, 59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   248. Any net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households, and especially a net differential undercount of 5.8%, will dilute the political power of such jurisdictions. Similarly, the people who\n   <em>\n    live\n   </em>\n   in those jurisdictions will suffer a corresponding decrease in political power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   249. The Court also finds, based on Dr. Warshaw's credible calculations, that Plaintiff Colorado will suffer a net undercount of its total population of at least 0.7%, an estimate Dr. Warshaw calculated using the conservative projection of an estimated 5.8% net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Warshaw Decl. 19 (Table 5). Furthermore, because Colorado is home to a significant population of people who live in noncitizen households,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   net differential undercount of that population greater than zero will cause Colorado's enumerated population to be lower than it otherwise would be.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX-324 (illustrating that if there is a 2% undercount of noncitizens in Colorado, the state's population will be undercounted by 0.2%).

Effects of the Citizenship Question on Funding to, and Within, States\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   250. A net undercount of people who live in noncitizen households will also cause states (and their residents) to lose access to federal funding from domestic financial assistance programs that allocate funding based on census-tied geographic formulas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 508-1 (\"Reamer Decl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 15-17, 83. A large number of federal domestic financial assistance programs rely on census data to allocate money. In fiscal year 2016, for example, at least 320 such programs allocated about $900 billion using census-derived data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Plaintiffs' expert witness Dr. Andrew Reamer calculated the effects of a net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households on several such programs. Of the programs Dr. Reamer analyzed, eighteen are \"state-share\" programs, which rely in whole or part on the state's share of the total U.S. population.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 16-17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The rest are programs that use the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (\"FMAP\") reimbursement formula.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   These programs - and many others, including those that rely on decennial census data less directly,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-29 - are sensitive to changes in the decennial census count. Dr. Reamer calculated that a net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Hispanic populations of as little as two percent - much lower than the net differential undercount would likely be - will cause Plaintiffs New York and New Jersey, as well as California, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and Hawaii, to lose funding under the state-share programs, and would cause Arizona, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and Hawaii to lose funding under the FMAP programs.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 33, 35 &amp; 16, 17, 20, 23, 27 (Tables). Larger net undercounts would, naturally, lead to correspondingly larger losses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   251. The Court finds Dr. Reamer's testimony to be credible, and his analysis persuasive. Accordingly, the Court finds that even under an almost implausibly conservative projection of the net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households, Plaintiffs New York and New Jersey, along with Arizona, California, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and Hawaii will lose some amount of federal funding as a result of the addition of the citizenship question. More specifically, the Court finds that Plaintiffs New York and New Jersey, along with California, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and Hawaii, would lose funding under the WIC, Social Services Block Grants, and Title I Grants to LEAs programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reamer Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 51-52, 61-62. Those are merely illustrative; as Dr. Reamer testified, those states would lose funding from other state-share programs as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 517-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   252. The Court further finds, based on Dr. Reamer's testimony, that a two percent net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households will cause Plaintiffs Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Washington, and the District of Columbia to lose funding under the Title I LEA Grant program and the Social Services Block Grant Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reamer Decl. 17 (Table), 20 (Table) &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, 61-62. A net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households of at least two percent will also cause Plaintiffs Illinois and Washington to lose Medicaid funds, and Plaintiffs Oregon, New Mexico, and Washington to lose CHIP funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, 27 (Tables) &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 70-71, 81-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   253. In addition to the state-share programs Dr. Reamer testified about, Plaintiffs have proved that even a tiny net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households will cause several Plaintiffs to lose funds from federal programs that distribute resources on the basis of census-derived data, including Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention (\"CBCAP\") Grants, Older Americans Act (\"OAA\") Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging, Title II, Part A and Title IV, Part A funding under the Every Student Succeeds Act, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (\"TANF\") funding, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, Program (\"LIHEAP\") funding, and Community Services Block Grants (\"CSBG\"). Docket No. 498-12 (\"Haney Aff.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 5-8; Docket No. 498-14 (\"Harmon Aff.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 10-13, 17; Docket No. 498-5 (\"Franklin Aff.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 6-10; Docket No. 501-1 (\"Tiema-Massie Aff.\"), \u00b6 11. Some such programs require states to use census-derived data to distribute funding to City and County Plaintiffs, including the Victims of Crime Act program, TANF, LIHEAP, the WIOA program, and CSBG. Franklin Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 6-10; Tiema-Massie Aff. \u00b6 11. The City and County Plaintiffs receive funds under these programs based on their relative share of the relevant population within a state. For instance, states are required to distribute TANF, LIHEAP, WIOA, and CSBG funds to localities based in part on the number of low-income\n   individuals who reside in the jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franklin Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 10; Tiema-Massie Aff. \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   254. Similarly, many federal funding programs provide direct funding to localities based on census-derived information, including the Community Development Block Grant (\"CDBG\"), Emergency Solutions Grant (\"ESG\") program, and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 498-7 (\"Freedman Aff.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10, 12. These programs provide funding to cities and counties based at least in part on such jurisdictions' share of the overall population count relative to other metropolitan areas and share of the population in poverty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   255. Dr. Warshaw's testimony shows that under any plausible net differential undercount scenario resulting from the addition of a citizenship question, nearly all Plaintiff Cities and Counties will lose population shares relative to their states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Warshaw Decl. 28 (Table 8) &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 59-61. Those cities and counties - specifically, Cameron, Hidalgo, and El Paso Counties, Texas; Monterey County in California; and Providence and Central Falls in Rhode Island,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (Table 7) - will lose funds under these programs, whether the funds are routed through state governments or distributed from the federal government directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   256. The Court also finds - based on uncontradicted evidence in the record - that Plaintiff MRNY has identified several members by name who reside in New York City and who benefit from the federal funding programs that Plaintiffs have shown are tied specifically to federal census data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 503-1 (\"Altschuler Decl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 24-30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 503-2 (\"Supp. Altschuler Decl.\"); Tr. 472. MRNY members Julissa Bisono and Diana Zarumeno are both residents of Queens County, New York, whose children attend public schools that receive Title I funding.

Altschuler Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; Supp. Altschuler Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Altschuler also identified an unnamed MRNY member who is a U.S. citizen and a resident of Long Island, New York. Altschuler Decl. \u00b6 16; Supp. Altschuler Decl. \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   257. The Court also finds, based on uncontradicted testimony and undisputed documentary evidence in the record, that ADC has members residing in all fifty states and in the District of Columbia, including 172 in Arizona; 1,441 in California; 1,296 in the District of Columbia; 551 in Florida; 437 in Illinois; 612 in Maryland; 819 in New York; 341 in Ohio; 1,341 in Pennsylvania; 30 in Rhode Island; 408 in Texas; and 186 in Washington State.

For example, ADC members Dr. Souhail Toubia, Dr. Diane Shammas, and George Majeed Khoury reside in California; Dr. Debbie AlMontaser resides in New York; Shatha Atiya resides in Florida; Dr. Safa Rifka and Dr. Doo'a Taha reside in the District of Columbia; and Abed Awad resides in New Jersey. Khalaf Aff. \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-453\">\n   258. Finally, to the extent relevant here, the Court finds that Plaintiff NYIC has members who benefit from census-tied\n   funding programs. NYIC member Chhaya Community Development Corporation (\"Chhaya\") receives funding through the Community Development Block Grant program. Docket No. 498-19 (\"Plum Aff.\"), at \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 498-20 (\"Supp. Plum Aff.\"). NYIC members Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, Little Sisters of the Assumption Family Health Services (\"LSA\"), Korean Community Services of Metropolitan New York, and Planned Parenthood of New York City all receive funding through Medicaid to provide community health services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. NYIC member Chinese-American Planning Council receives funding through the WIOA for education and training services for job-seekers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-454\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Effects of the Citizenship Question on the Quality and Accuracy of Census Data\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-455\">\n   259. Next, the Court finds that the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census will harm the quality of the resulting census data regardless of whether it also leads to a net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen and Hispanic households. Much of that decline will be attributable to the fact that, because of the decline in self-response rates, more enumerations will be conducted through NRFU efforts. March 1 Memo, at AR 1311. As all agree, NRFU generates lower quality data than self-responses - in large part because it relies more heavily on proxies and imputation. Tr. 33-35; January 19 Memo, at AR 1281. There is essentially no dispute about this point. Dr. Abowd - Defendants' expert - \"consistently characterized data produced by lower self-response rates as being less accurate\" in his testimony, Tr. 882;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   March 1 Memo, at AR 1311, and described how that inaccuracy would hamper the work of demographers and policymakers at all levels of government,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1222-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-456\">\n   260. Credible testimony confirms that the citizenship question and consequent decline in self-response rates are likely to harm the resulting data in several ways. For instance, information about subgroups that comprise a jurisdiction - called local-level \"characteristic data\" - will decline in quality, even if the\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   population count within that jurisdiction is accurate. Tr. 302-04. This will be true regardless of whether NRFU is able to remedy the decline in self-response rates for the jurisdiction as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1221-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-457\">\n   261. In fact, NRFU operations may actually make the problem worse. The Census Bureau's own analysis concluded that enumeration errors are more common in NRFU because NRFU data \"are much more likely to be collected from a proxy rather than a household member,\" and proxies have \"less accurate information\" about the household than self-responders. January 19 Memo, at AR 1282. In particular (and as discussed above), proxies result in correct enumerations only about seventy percent of the time, compared to ninety-seven percent for self-responses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And proxies \"supply poor quality individual demographic and socioeconomic characteristic information about the person on behalf of whom they are responding.\" Brown Memo at 41. As Dr. Jarmin put it, the accuracy of NRFU \"is less than self-response\" and, within NRFU, \"proxy response\" is less accurate still. Jarmin Dep. 308.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-458\">\n   262. Dr. Abowd testified that, whatever else happens as a result of the citizenship question, \"gross omissions\" - people left off self-response, responses to in-person NRFU enumerators, and proxy responses - will increase. Tr. 1221. In Dr. Abowd's view, this will harm the quality of the data, regardless of what happens to the overall count.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1222. Indeed, even\n   where a decline in self-response does not lead to an overall net undercount, it will create inaccuracies in subgroup data - particularly at the local level - that can be quite serious in and of themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 309, 351-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-459\">\n   263. Several Governmental Plaintiffs proved that they rely on accurate data to perform essential governmental functions. New York City, for example, makes important decisions about how to allocate public services in reliance on demographic data derived from the census, as when its Department of Education redraws school zone boundary lines, Tr. 305-06; when its Department of Health deploys resources based on its best understanding of the age, race, and Hispanic origin characteristics within particular communities,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 307-08; and when the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs distributes English-language services based on its understanding of where the highest concentration of limited-English-proficient (\"LEP\") populations live,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 307. Dr. Salvo also testified that New York City is expecting a forty-six percent increase in its sixty-five-and-over population by 2040, and is currently attempting to project where and when that demographic change will be felt so that it can design and deploy appropriate infrastructure and physical accommodations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 356-57. A decline in the quality of decennial census data will degrade the City's ability to make and implement such policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-460\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Secretary Ross's Decision Has Caused Plaintiffs to Divert Resources\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-461\">\n   264. Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question to the census will cause, and has already has caused, another harm to Plaintiffs: the diversion of precious resources. The NGO Plaintiffs - NYIC, MRNY, ADC/ADCRI, and CASA - have already diverted significant resources from their organizational missions and other priorities to address the effects of a citizenship question. Each of the NGO Plaintiffs is deeply committed to a laudable mission of increasing political participation, promoting civic engagement, and advancing the interests of immigrant communities, especially immigrant communities of color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-462\">\n   265. Plaintiff NYIC is an \"umbrella policy and advocacy organization for nearly 200 groups in New York State.\" Docket No. 489-1 (\"Choi Decl.\"), \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 489-2 (\"Supp. Choi Decl.\"); Tr. 21-22. NYIC aims to \"unite immigrants, members, and allies so that all New Yorkers can thrive,\" is devoted to \"advanc[ing] the interests of New York's diverse immigrant communities,\" and \"advocates for laws, policies, and programs that lead to justice and opportunity for all immigrant groups.\" Choi Decl. \u00b6 3. NYIC has a \"fundamental interest in ensuring as complete and accurate a Decennial Census as possible,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6, partly because its member organizations receive funding through census-tied federal funding programs,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and partly because the communities its member organizations serve will only receive the full political representation to which they are entitled if the people in those communities are fully counted,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. For that reason, NYIC has committed itself to ensuring a complete and accurate census count since at least 2010. During the 2010 cycle, NYIC engaged in widespread efforts to encourage participation, including by coordinating public service announcements in sixty-nine newspapers (and in twenty-four languages), and by holding press briefings with elected officials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-463\">\n   266. NYIC has already started similar efforts with respect to the 2020 census. In March 2018, for instance, NYIC helped\n   launch New York Counts 2020, a coalition of New York stakeholders committed to a \"fair and complete\" census count.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. More broadly, NYIC has been investing its organizational resources in outreach, education, and advocacy to increase participation in the 2020 census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Before the addition of the citizenship question was announced, NYIC planned to spend approximately $625,000 on such education and outreach efforts over a three-year period leading up to the 2020 census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. NYIC testifies that it has increased that spending by approximately sixty percent \"as a result of the decision to add a citizenship question,\" and will now spend approximately $1 million on its efforts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 498-19 (\"Plum Decl.\"), \u00b6 14 (stating that the extra spending \"represents an increase of approximately 60% over what the organization would have spent in the absence of a citizenship question\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 286. Of that additional amount (roughly $375,000), NYIC has already spent about $93,000 in funds it would not have spent absent the addition of the citizenship question. Choi Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-464\">\n   267. The Court also finds, based on the undisputed testimony of NYIC's Vice President of Policy Elizabeth Plum, that NYIC has diverted, and will continue to divert, resources from its organizational mission because of the citizenship question. As Plum testified, NYIC \"was undertaking a study and publication on adult English literacy and workforce development, which examines the critical role of English language acquisition in integrating immigrants into the workforce and preparing them to earn higher wages,\" but \"that project has been postponed indefinitely because of the resources required to perform additional Census outreach and education work.\" Plum Decl. \u00b6 23. Plum also testified that \"NYIC and some of its member organizations will have to divert resources that would have been spent on education and outreach efforts to increase Census response rates among immigrant communities of color towards addressing the heightened fear generated by the citizenship question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-465\">\n   268. Notably, Defendants dispute none of this. They merely contend that the cause of NYIC's increased spending is not the citizenship question itself, but the macroenvironment of fear and distrust of government. Defs' Post-Trial Br. 39-42, \u00b6\u00b6 261, 272. The Court is not persuaded. Plaintiffs' testimony credibly makes clear that NYIC increased its expenditures \"as a result\" of the addition of the citizenship question - a statement made all the more credible and persuasive given that the macroenvironment prevailing at the time NYIC made its initial funding decisions was similar to the macroenvironment at the time it made the decision to\n   <em>\n    increase\n   </em>\n   those expenditures. Choi Decl. \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 616-17, 942-44. The Court has no trouble concluding by a preponderance of the evidence that NYIC has incurred (and will continue to incur) these extra expenses, and has diverted resources away from its organizational mission, because of the citizenship question and not because of Defendants' proposed alternative causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-466\">\n   269. Plaintiff MRNY is a nonprofit membership organization with offices and service centers in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Suffolk County, and White Plains, New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Altschuler Decl. \u00b6 2. MRNY's mission is to \"build the power of immigrant and working-class communities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. MRNY has an \"ongoing commitment to promoting engagement in the Decennial Census among its members and constituents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. During the 2010 cycle, MRNY spent about $150,000 and more than one thousand personnel hours on its census education and outreach efforts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. MRNY is conducting similar outreach\n   and education programs this time around, and has already begun creating informational resources and training staff members to conduct outreach and encourage census response, \"particularly\" among Spanish-speaking communities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   270. Daniel Altschuler, MRNY's Director of Civic Engagement and Research,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, testified that the organization \"will be forced to expend more resources than initially anticipated to try to reduce the negative effect\" of the citizenship question among \"the immigrant communities of color it serves.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. More precisely, MRNY \"anticipates expending at least double the amount on 2020 Census education and outreach\" than it did for the 2010 census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Altschuler testified that \"[b]ecause of the need to increase the time and money spent on Census outreach due to the addition of the citizenship question, MRNY will need to divert resources from other areas critical to its mission[,] including civic engagement and community organizing on other issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Indeed, MRNY has already done so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Separate and apart from the diversion of those resources, MRNY has diverted resources towards participating in this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-468\">\n   271. Once again, Defendants contest very little of Altschuler's credible testimony about MRNY's activities, focusing only on the causal connection between the citizenship question and MRNY's additional expenditures and noting that MRNY \"acknowledges that there is a general increased fear due to the Trump Administration.\" Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 39 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). But MRNY has submitted evidence of a causal connection between the citizenship question itself and the diversion of its resources in the form of Altschuler's credible testimony, and Defendants offer nothing at all in rebuttal. Once again, the Court has no trouble concluding by a preponderance of the evidence that MRNY has doubled its 2020 census expenditures because of the addition of the citizenship question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-469\">\n   272. Plaintiffs ADC and ADCRI were founded by Senator James G. Abourezk - the first Arab American to serve in the United States Senate - in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Khalaf Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. ADC is a \"civil rights membership organization that is committed to defending and promoting the rights and liberties of Arab Americans and other persons of Arab heritage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. ADC and ADCRI have long track records of census-related work. For example, ADC has served on Census Bureau advisory committees \"in numerous capacities\" since the 1980s, and has conducted census-related campaign and policy initiatives since the 2000 census cycle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. ADC and ADCRI have increased their planned spending on 2020 census education and outreach by $150,000 compared to 2010, \"largely\" because of \"the presence of the citizenship question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. As with MRNY, Defendants do not dispute any of these facts, except to object that ADC has not \"analyze[d] any incremental increase in expenditures due to the citizenship question.\" Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 39, \u00b6 260. Again, however, Defendants offer no evidence to rebut Plaintiffs' credible testimony that precisely such an incremental increase is occurring, and the Court finds that it is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-470\">\n   273. Plaintiff CASA is a nonprofit membership organization headquartered in Maryland, with additional offices in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Docket No. 498-3 (\"Escobar Decl.\"), at \u00b6 4. CASA is the largest membership-based immigrants' rights organization in the mid-Atlantic region.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   CASA's mission is \"to create a more just society by increasing the power of and improving the quality of life of low-income immigrant communities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-471\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. CASA offers social, health, education, job training, employment, and legal services to such communities, serving \"nearly 20,000\" people each year through its physical offices alone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Part of CASA's work in service of its mission is \"promoting engagement in the Decennial Census among its members, constituents, and communities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. George Escobar, the organization's Chief of Programs and Services,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, testified that \"[m]ember participation in the Decennial Census advances CASA's mission by increasing the political power of low-income immigrant communities and improving quality of life for those communities through increased population-driven government funding,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-472\">\n   274. Given its thirty-year history working with immigrant communities, CASA has \"consistently been a 'go-to' organizational partner\" for outreach and education efforts concerning the census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Because of the addition of a citizenship question, CASA is now \"diverting [its] limited resources in an effort to encourage participation in the Decennial Census.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Indeed, CASA is planning a \"massive response\" to mitigate the effects of the citizenship question,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25, and \"will have to reorganize its communication team and reassign staff to Census outreach and education to a level not previously anticipated,\"\n   <em>\n    id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   26. Given the unanticipated nature of those expenses, CASA will have to fund these efforts through \"other sources\" - \"perhaps including CASA reserves\" - and additional volunteers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CASA has already begun some of these efforts.\n   <em>\n    Id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   27. Defendants, for their part, nowhere dispute (or even discuss) any of these facts. Instead, Defendants level the same highly general objection to CASA's account as with the other NGO Plaintiffs, namely that Plaintiffs have not \"shown any analysis to account for the incremental increase due to the citizenship question.\" Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 39, \u00b6 259.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is unpersuaded by Defendants' objection to CASA's lack of detail in accounting for the precise incremental increase in expenditures which, by definition, have not happened yet, and finds - by a preponderance of the evidence - that CASA will divert a significant portion of its organizational resources because of the addition of the citizenship question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-473\">\n   275. The Court also finds, based on the undisputed record evidence, that Plaintiffs New York City and the City of Chicago have diverted or will divert resources in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the citizenship question. New York City had originally allocated $4.3 million to its efforts to increase participation in the 2020 census, and then - after Secretary Ross announced his decision - increased that funding to $5.5 million. Tr. 426-29. Plaintiffs also introduced uncontroverted evidence that the City of Chicago will expend additional resources to combat the citizenship question's effects on self-response among immigrant communities in Chicago.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 488-1 (\"Rodriguez Aff.\"), at \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 11-12, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-474\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusions of Law Related to Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-475\">\n   The Court turns, then, to its conclusions of law with respect to standing. Plaintiffs advance at least five distinct theories of how they have been, or will be, injured due to the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, namely: (1) diminished political representation, both between\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   within states; (2) loss in government funds, again both between\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   within states; (3) harm to the sovereign interests of state and local governments caused by degradation of the census data upon which they rely; (4) diversion of resources; and (5) loss of privacy. The Court begins by addressing the question of certain NGO Plaintiffs' standing to pursue claims based on any of those theories on behalf of their individual members (in addition to any standing they may have to pursue such claims in their own right). The Court then explains its conclusions as to whether each of these forms of injury is legally cognizable and, if so, whether Plaintiffs proved by a preponderance of the evidence that they have been, or will be, injured in that manner. As the Court will explain, it concludes that all five forms of injury are legally cognizable and that, for all but one of the theories - namely, the loss of privacy - at least some Plaintiffs proved by a preponderance that they have suffered, or will suffer, injury in fact sufficient to support standing. The Court then turns to whether Plaintiffs proved that those forms of injury are fairly traceable to Secretary Ross's decision to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census and whether they are redressable by a favorable decision. Answering both questions in the affirmative, the Court concludes that most, if not all, Plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring the claims in these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-476\">\n   The Court notes that, aside from challenging each of Plaintiffs' theories of injury on \"traceability\" grounds, Defendants make only limited objections to each individual theory of injury. Specifically, Defendants challenge Plaintiffs' apportionment-loss and funding-loss theories only on the ground that they are insufficiently \"imminent,\" Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 67-68, \u00b6\u00b6 11-14; the resource-expenditure theory only on the ground that Plaintiffs' expenditures do not qualify as legally cognizable injuries-in-fact,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 69-70, \u00b6\u00b615-19; and the data-degradation theory only on the ground that it is not a sufficiently \"concrete\" and \"tangible\" injury for purposes of Article III,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 70, \u00b6\u00b620-21. Defendants do not explicitly address Plaintiffs' theory of harm to their privacy interests anywhere in their Proposed Conclusions of Law. The Court cannot ignore the omitted objections given its independent obligation to assess its jurisdiction.

Associational Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-478\">\n   Before turning to Plaintiffs' theories of injury, however, the Court briefly addresses the issue of associational standing - namely, whether any of the NGO Plaintiffs have standing to bring claims on behalf of their individual members (in addition to any standing they may have to pursue such claims in their own right). An organization has \"associational\" standing to bring claims on behalf of its members if \"(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-479\">\n   <em>\n    Food and Commercial Workers v.

The second and third prongs of the analysis can be swiftly addressed.

As for the second prong of the analysis, which Defendants also fail to contest, the Second Circuit has explained that an interest is \"germane\" to an organization's purpose if the lawsuit would \"reasonably tend to further the general interests that individual members sought to vindicate in joining the association and ... bears a reasonable connection to the association's knowledge and experience.\"\n   <em>\n    Bldg. &amp; Constr.

Although proof of a mere \"statistical probability that some of [an organization's] members are threatened with concrete injury\" is not enough to satisfy the first prong of associational standing, an organization can meet the first prong by offering \"specific allegations\" (along, at this stage, with proof) \"establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Summers v.

More specifically, NYIC has standing to the extent that its members who receive funds from census-tied programs would have standing. MRNY has standing to the extent that its individual members residing in New York State generally, and Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Long Island specifically, would have standing and to the extent that its individual members whose children attend Head Start programs or public schools that receive Title I funding would have standing. And ADC has standing to the extent that its individual members residing in all fifty states and the District of Columbia - and certainly those residing in California, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida, Rhode Island, Washington State, Arizona, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia - would have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-483\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Injury in Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-484\">\n   With that, the Court turns to Plaintiffs' five theories of injury: (1) loss of political representation, both between states (in congressional reapportionment) and within states (in redistricting); (2) loss of federal funds, also both between and within states; (3) harm to important sovereign interests caused by degradation of the census data on which state and local governments rely; (4) injury to organizations and local governments through the diversion of, and strain inflicted upon, organizational resources; and (5) infringement of privacy interests in the information collected by\n   the census. As noted, the Court concludes that all five forms of injury are legally cognizable and that, as to four of the five - namely, all except the privacy-infringement theory - at least some Plaintiffs have proved by a preponderance of the evidence that they have suffered, or will suffer, injury in fact sufficient to support standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-485\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Diminished Political Representation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-486\">\n   First, Plaintiffs have proved that several states are likely to lose one or more seats in the next round of congressional redistricting if the citizenship question is added to the census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recitation of Facts \u00b6 243-45. The Supreme Court has squarely held that the loss of a seat or seats in the House of Representatives \"undoubtedly satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III standing\" because of the dilution of political power that results from such an apportionment loss.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076553\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/316/#p341\">\n    525 U.S. at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076553\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/316/#p341\">\n    119 S.Ct. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carey v.

The Colorado \"Taxpayer's Bill of Rights,\" ratified into the Colorado Constitution, limits the \"maximum annual percentage change in state fiscal year spending\" to \"inflation plus the percentage change in state population in the prior calendar year, adjusted for revenue changes approved by voters after 1991,\" and provides that \"[p]opulation shall be determined\" for that purpose \"by annual federal census estimates and such number shall be adjusted every decade to match the federal census.\" Colo.

Whether characterized as a loss in funding, or a loss in the ability to spend for the general welfare of its residents (and, thus, an infringement on Colorado's sovereign interests), Colorado will suffer an Article III injury if its population is undercounted by even the smallest amount. Given the Court's findings as to the likely net undercount of Colorado's population,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Recitation of Facts \u00b6 249, the Court concludes that Colorado faces a \"certainly impending\" injury traceable to the addition of the citizenship question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-498\">\n   In sum, given the remarkably low net undercount of noncitizens that would prompt the foregoing losses of funding, Governmental Plaintiffs Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington State, and the District of Columbia; and NGO Plaintiffs ADC, MRNY, and NYIC have established an injury in fact that is \"certainly impending.\" At a minimum, there is no doubt that these Plaintiffs have demonstrated a \"substantial risk\" that they will suffer such injuries. In either case, these Plaintiffs have satisfied Article III's injury-in-fact requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-499\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Harm to the Quality and Accuracy of Data\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-500\">\n   Next, the Governmental Plaintiffs proved that they will suffer injury in fact from the degradation in data quality that would occur if the citizenship question appears on the 2020 census. At the outset, there is no reasonable dispute that Plaintiffs proved by a preponderance of the evidence that addition of the citizenship question would result in that harm. Indeed, the evidence at trial was undisputed that, regardless of how successful NRFU operations are in remedying a net differential undercount due to a differential decline in self-response rates, the addition of the citizenship question\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   result in harm to the quality of census data. First, as noted above, that was the original position of the Census Bureau in connection with its review of DOJ's request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recitation of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 8, 19, 28-30, 34. Second, Defendants own expert, Dr. Abowd, agreed, testifying that the addition of a citizenship question would harm the overall quality of 2020 census data regardless of any net undercount scenario.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 882, 952-53, 1221-22, 1251. And third, Plaintiffs' experts testified credibly in the same manner. Tr. 302-04. Additionally, Dr. Salvo, the Director of the New York City Department of City Planning's Population Division, explained credibly that the degradation in quality of the data would harm New York City's ability to allocate educational and public health resources efficiently and effectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recitation of Facts \u00b6 263.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-501\">\n   Crucially, these harms will occur\n   <em>\n    whether or not there is a net undercount\n   </em>\n   - meaning that this theory of injury does not depend on the causal chain of events connecting the decline in self-response rates among noncitizen households to a net differential undercount of people who live in such households.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-502\">\n   Understandably, then, Defendants raise no objections in their post-trial filings to the imminence, traceability, or redressability of this harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

If the inability to obtain information is a cognizable form of injury for Article III purposes, it follows\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   that the inability to obtain accurate information would be as well. After all, there is no interest in obtaining false or faulty information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   To be sure, many of these cases involved statutory entitlements to certain information - the classic example of such an entitlement (although, interestingly, the example least discussed in the context of Article III standing) being the Freedom of Information Act. That is no objection to the conclusion that the Supreme Court has recognized the denial of information as an Article III injury, however, because if such an injury were not already \"concrete\" enough for Article III purposes, Congress could not make it so. As the Supreme Court recently clarified, \"Congress' role in identifying and elevating intangible harms\" does not allow it to grant standing on the basis of pure statutory violations - instead, \"Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1540.

Suppose a state were to premise certain of its policies on a person's lawful presence in the United States - for example, suppose that it chose to deny certain benefits to undocumented immigrants or required its law-enforcement officials to inquire into the immigration status of any person detained in state custody for any reason. \"The accepted way\" for states \"to perform [such] status checks\" - and surely the most reliable - is to contact the DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), the federal agency that accepts and responds to such inquiries from interested states.\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

Now suppose that ICE were to degrade the quality of its data set, thereby undermining its usefulness to the state as a tool for implementing its policy priorities. If this hypothetical state were to challenge the decisions causing the degradation in immigration-status data, the federal agency could certainly defend its actions on the grounds that they were lawful. But could it seriously deny that the state had suffered a cognizable injury for purposes of standing? Surely not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   Indeed, ample case law supports the proposition that a state has a strong sovereign interest in conducting its own policy, the burdening of which causes an injury in fact for Article III purposes.

In that case, Texas led a coalition of states in a challenge to the Obama Administration's Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program (\"DAPA\").

It would be illogical to recognize that organizations may be injured by expenditures made in response to future injuries, as the Supreme Court continues to do,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    568 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   414 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but to hold that that doctrine applies only in cases in which it would be superfluous. Indeed, that would render the category of plaintiffs that could establish standing under a\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty\n   </em>\n   theory a null set. Conspicuously, though, Defendants cite no Supreme Court case holding (or even hinting) that\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty\n   </em>\n   has been so cabined, much less overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   Applying\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty\n   </em>\n   here, the Court finds that the NGO Plaintiffs plainly have standing to challenge Secretary Ross's decision. That is, all four NGO Plaintiffs have proved that the citizenship question will cause them - indeed, already is causing them - to divert organizational resources away from their core missions and towards combating the negative effects of the citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recitation of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 265-74.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' arguments to the\n   contrary are somewhat ironic because the record makes clear that the Census Bureau itself relies on organizations like the NGO Plaintiffs to ensure a successful census - and will rely on them to counteract the indisputably negative effects of the citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Recitation of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 187-88, 274. In fact, Dr. Abowd, Defendants' own expert, explicitly conceded that addition of the citizenship question on the census will make the \"job[s]\" of these organizations \"harder.\" Tr. 1303-05. In other words, Defendants' own arguments against the NGO Plaintiffs' injury depend on their prediction that any impending decline in self-response rates will be mitigated, in part by organizations such as the NGO Plaintiffs that will spend money and devote organizational resources to combat the citizenship question's negative effects. Defendants' own arguments against Plaintiffs' other theories of standing therefore serve to confirm this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   In contending that the NGO Plaintiffs have not proved this theory of injury, Defendants also fault the NGO Plaintiffs for the lack of any testimony \"that their expenditure of resources took into account the extent to which the Census Bureau's [NRFU] procedures would mitigate any differential net undercount attributable to the citizenship question.\" Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 40, \u00b6 262. In other words, Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs should be denied standing to seek a remedy in federal court because they should have trusted the same parties who caused their injuries in the first place to fix them. That may be the kind of thing the fox would say to the henhouse, but it is not what one would expect the federal government to say to a coalition of civil rights organizations challenging what they believe to be unlawful governmental action. In any event, the argument is unpersuasive on its merits, too, as it has a circular quality: As noted above, Defendants' own efforts to mitigate a decline in self-response depend in part on organizations like the NGO Plaintiffs expending resources to counteract such a decline. That is, to the extent that Defendants' NRFU efforts are successful in any respect, it will be in part because the NGO Plaintiffs have expended resources in aid of those efforts. And in any event, the Court has already found, based on the evidence at trial, that Defendants' NRFU efforts will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   succeed in eliminating a net differential undercount as a result of the citizenship question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   Defendants' only remaining objection to this theory of injury is without merit. They assert that the NGO Plaintiffs have \"not met their burden of proving\" a \"direct conflict between their missions and the reinstatement of a citizenship question on the census.\" Defs.'

Here, of course, Plaintiffs have proved, as a factual matter, that Defendants' conduct will - absent an expenditure of resources - harm their core missions of advancing the interests, and enhancing the political power, of the communities they serve.

That said, Plaintiffs did not prove that such an injury is sufficiently imminent to satisfy Article III in these cases.

Tr. 1033. To be sure, those techniques may reduce the fitness of the data for DOJ's purposes - an issue addressed below. And, in theory, the statutory prohibition could be changed by a future Congress. But it is pure speculation to suggest that the Census Bureau will not comply with its legal obligations to ensure the privacy of respondents' data or that those legal obligations will be amended. And given that, the fact that NGO Plaintiffs may be subjectively fearful that the government will misuse citizenship data obtained through the census,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Traceability and Redressability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-530\">\n   In short, Plaintiffs proved that some have suffered, or will suffer, injury in fact in at least four ways: (1) diminished political representation, between and within states; (2) reductions in federal funding, again both between and within states; (3) harm to the accuracy and quality of census data; and (4) the diversion of resources. Thus, the Court turns to the second element of standing, which requires that Plaintiffs prove a \"causal connection\" between their injuries and the conduct they challenge in this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"446\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"447\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-531\">\n   Plaintiffs have done so here. First, the evidence at trial proved beyond any doubt, and certainly by a preponderance of the evidence, that the addition of a citizenship question will cause a disproportionate decline in self-response rates among households containing at least one noncitizen individual and that that, in turn, will force substantially more such households into the Census Bureau's NRFU process. Right off the bat, that will cause a decline in the accuracy and quality of the data generated by the census, which will injure the Governmental Plaintiffs that rely on that data to make and enforce their laws. On top of that, the Court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the decline in self-response will translate into a net differential undercount of people who live in noncitizen households of at least 5.8%. That net differential undercount will, in turn, cause the harms set forth in the prior section of this Opinion. In arguing otherwise, Defendants attack the \"traceability\" of Plaintiffs' injuries to the citizenship question in startlingly cursory fashion. After previewing these arguments with such fanfare,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Pre-Trial Br. 6 n.2;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-20, Defendants devote a scant two paragraphs of their Proposed Conclusions of Law to contesting \"traceability\" on various grounds, each of which amounts to little more than a conclusory citation to the record, and each of which - even lending it the most charitable interpretation, despite Defendants' near-abandonment of their supporting arguments - is ultimately unavailing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 70-71, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-532\">\n   The first such ground is the most familiar: Defendants argue that the connection between the citizenship question and Plaintiffs' injuries is simply too \"speculat[ive],\" relying on too many \"inferences\" to satisfy Article III. Post-Trial Br.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-533\">\n   67-68, \u00b6\u00b6 11-14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   That argument, however, misunderstands both the law and the facts. Courts often dismiss claims for prospective relief because the plaintiffs' claims that defendants will imminently cause them injury are too \"speculative\" to satisfy Article III.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"448\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    568 U.S. at 410-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, as the term suggests, the bar on \"speculative inferences\" in the standing analysis refers to\n   <em>\n    speculation\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    inferences\n   </em>\n   , as opposed to evidence and proof. To be sure, at the pleading stage, a plaintiff must plausibly allege facts connecting his or her injuries to the defendant's conduct, and cannot substitute \"speculative inferences\" for plausible factual allegations of causation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simon v.

But here, with a full trial record, the Court need not speculate: Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    proved\n   </em>\n   each factual step in the causal chain and that each step is fairly traceable, at least in part, to the addition of a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendia v.

Because the facts show both that Plaintiffs' injuries are imminent and fairly traceable to Defendants' conduct, this is not a case in which \"[s]peculative inferences are necessary to connect [Plaintiffs'] injury to the challenged actions of [Defendants].\"\n   <em>\n    Simon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"456\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p42\">\n    426 U.S. at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p42\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the facts underlying the chain of causation connecting Defendants' conduct to Plaintiffs' injuries here is far stronger than those the Supreme Court found sufficient in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-534\">\n   In fact, to the extent that either side in these cases invites the Court to substitute \"speculation\" for proof, it is\n   <em>\n    Defendants\n   </em>\n   , not Plaintiffs, who do so. Defendants assert that NRFU operations will remedy any decline in the self-response rate attributable to the citizenship question, Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 16-20, \u00b6\u00b6 127-141, but, at the end of the day, they offer little more than a hope and prayer in support of that assertion. As discussed, NRFU operations have historically failed to remedy differential declines in self-response rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recitation of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 211, 230. And Defendants offer no evidence in support of their claim that NRFU operations will do so this time; indeed, they have not even determined the imputation formulae that they will use in the 2020 census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1350-51. As a matter of fact, and as discussed at length above, there are several demonstrable reasons to believe that NRFU operations will do a\n   <em>\n    worse\n   </em>\n   job this\n   time around than in past years in addressing any decline in response rate among Hispanic and noncitizen households. Considerable testimony supports the conclusion that NRFU will suffer from many of the same defects as the initial attempts to obtain answers through self-response. Dr. Hillygus testified that \"all of the issues ... with respect to confidentiality concerns associated with the citizenship question that the Census Bureau acknowledges and has shown to have an impact on the self-response, all matter for cooperation with a census enumerator\" in NRFU, too. Tr. 97;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"458\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p42\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"458\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p42\">\n    at 99-100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the likelihood that confidentiality concerns and the macroenvironment will hamper NRFU efforts more than in previous years). Dr. Barreto's testimony supports the same conclusion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 643-44, and also suggests that attempts to reassure potential NRFU respondents with confidentiality concerns will be disproportionately less effective for Hispanic and immigrant populations. Tr. 688. Notably, these opinions were based in part on the Census Bureau's own conclusions and studies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Memo at 43 n.60;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PX-152; PX-662; PX-663. On top of that, it is undisputed that NRFU operations do nothing to address an undercount attributable to households that do self-respond but omit noncitizen members from those responses, Tr. 1309-10, a phenomenon that is substantially likely to rise in direct response to a citizenship question appearing on the census questionnaire,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Recitation of Facts \u00b6 214. In short, Plaintiffs proved that they will imminently suffer a variety of harms that are fairly traceable to Secretary Ross's decision; Defendants' unsupported assertion that they will cure or mitigate those injuries before they materialize, supported by nothing more than a promise - and contradicted by both history and expert testimony about the conditions of the 2020 census - is not enough to render Plaintiffs' injuries \"speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duke Power Co. v.

Post-Trial Br. 41-42, \u00b6\u00b6 272-76. But this is not how the \"traceability\" requirement works. A plaintiff must \"demonstrate\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   causal nexus between the defendant's conduct and the injury\" to satisfy Article III's traceability requirement - nothing more.\n   <em>\n    Rothstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541192\" index=\"463\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/82/#p91\">\n    708 F.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). And in these cases, overwhelming evidence (much of it from the Census Bureau itself and Defendants' own expert witness, Dr. Abowd) supports the Court's factual finding that Hispanic and noncitizen households will be less likely to respond to the 2020 census questionnaire if it includes such a question. That means that the addition of a citizenship question will - obviously - be a \"but\n   for\" cause of the decline in self-response rates among those communities. It may well be true (and indeed, the trial evidence suggests) that adding a citizenship question in the current \"macroenvironment\" will lead to a\n   <em>\n    greater\n   </em>\n   decline than it would in another \"macroenvironment.\" But it would be perverse to suggest that merely because the background context for Secretary Ross's decision will\n   <em>\n    exacerbate\n   </em>\n   its negative effects, that the decision is somehow not itself a cause of those effects. Even in a dry season, it is fair to trace the fire to the arsonist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-536\">\n   Defendants' contrary argument - that the decline in self-response will be traceable to the macroenvironment, not the citizenship question - implies that Article III permits only one legally responsible cause per injury.

Defendants' argument - for which they cite no supporting authority, from the Supreme Court or otherwise - may deserve points for creativity, but it gives way under the strain of only a little thought. For one thing, the purpose of standing doctrine is to \"ensure[ ] that courts exercise power that is judicial in nature\" - that is, the power to adjudicate \"cases\" and \"controversies\" that Article III confers on the judicial branch (and keeps away from the other branches).\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1930 (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1547 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art.

Thus, while declaring one of the intervening steps in a causal chain to be unlawful might affect the underlying merits of a given claim, it would not, and could not, change whether adjudicating that claim qualified as an exercise in the \"judicial power\" as defined by Article III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-540\">\n   Defendants' argument appears also to suffer from a common confusion between the standing and merits inquiries, which - of course - are conceptually distinct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Whitmore v.

The question whether Plaintiffs' injuries are \"fairly traceable\" to Defendants' conduct is not a merits inquiry, as for example the question of proximate causation in tort liability would be; with respect to the latter, Defendants would surely have a colorable argument that they should not be held\n   <em>\n    liable in damages\n   </em>\n   for the unlawful intervening actions of another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 448 (noting that, absent certain circumstances, \"[t]he act of a third person in\n   committing an intentional tort or crime is a superseding cause of harm to another resulting therefrom\").

The Article III standing inquiry is entirely different: It looks to the chain of causation connecting Defendants' conduct to Plaintiffs' injuries, and it asks whether Plaintiffs have shown that one is sufficiently traceable to the other so as to give Plaintiffs a sufficiently \"personal stake\" in the outcome of their challenge to create the adverseness required by Article III.

The touchstone\n   of any Article III standing injury is whether the plaintiff has suffered, or is likely to suffer, an injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and redressable by the relief sought. Although congressional action can obviously affect whether particular injuries are \"redressable\" by creating (or not creating) causes of action, the \"injury in fact\" and \"traceability\" inquiries are fundamentally practical inquiries, grounded in the real-world consequences of human interaction - the sorts of things that give rise to \"concrete and particularized\" injuries that give plaintiffs a \"personal stake\" in federal litigation. In both cases, Article III demands something less than an ultimate merits inquiry might require: only that the defendant's conduct was a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   cause of the plaintiff's injury, not that it was the \"legal\" or \"proximate\" cause.\n   <em>\n    Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3608883,1587251\" index=\"507\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/793/1303/\">\n    793 F.2d at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, while all three strikes are proximate causes of the strikeout, the last domino to fall is fairly traceable to the first. On Defendants' theory of traceability, Congress could abrogate standing to sue for that last domino falling by declaring it unlawful for the intervening dominoes to fall. But an injury's traceability for purposes of Article III - like Plaintiffs' injuries here - does not depend on whether the dominoes have congressional permission to fall; it depends only on whether, in fact, they\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   . Taking a practical look at the facts of these cases, the Court would have no trouble concluding that the apportionment losses, funding losses, and harms to data quality that Plaintiffs have proved were\n   <em>\n    proximately\n   </em>\n   caused by Secretary Ross's decision. It is even easier to conclude, as the Court does, that Plaintiffs' injuries are fairly traceable to that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-543\">\n   That leaves only the element of redressability. Conspicuously, Defendants make no argument whatsoever concerning redressability - a tell, if there ever was one, that their arguments about traceability are themselves ultimately lacking.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184358\" index=\"508\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/151/#p161\">\n    454 U.S. at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184358\" index=\"509\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/151/#p161\">\n    102 S.Ct. 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a plaintiff must \"show that there is a 'fairly traceable' causal connection between the injury it claims and the conduct it challenges,\n   <em>\n    so that if the relief sought is granted, the injury will be redressed\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) (citation omitted) ). In any event, given the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law, it follows that Plaintiffs have proved that their injuries are \"likely\" to \"be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"510\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"511\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). That is, if Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census is set aside or enjoined, as Plaintiffs request in these cases and as the Court concludes it must be, it is likely that its effects on the net differential undercount will be mitigated to the point of relieving Plaintiffs' injuries. Notably, to satisfy Article III's redressability requirement, a plaintiff must show that the requested relief will remedy \"\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   injury\" to the plaintiff, not \"\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

And here, although the data generated by the 2020 census may still be less than perfect (no census is perfect, after all), and the resulting political apportionment and funding allocations may not be accurate to the seat or dollar, Plaintiffs have proved that their injuries specifically caused by the citizenship question will be mitigated, if not wholly remedied, by its removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-544\">\n   <strong>\n    RIPENESS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-545\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that most, if not all, Plaintiffs have standing to bring the claims pressed here - well more than the one Plaintiff with standing that the Court would need for jurisdiction. Before turning to the merits,\n   however, there is one more threshold issue to address: ripeness. On December 28, 2018 (after trial ended), Defendants submitted the proposed census questionnaire, with the citizenship question, to OMB for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"515\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2062713\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. 62713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dec. 28, 2018). As of today, OMB has not acted on the submission, and indeed it need not affirmatively approve the questionnaire for Secretary Ross's decision to be effective. Moreover, in the forty-two years since the enactment of the Paperwork Reduction Act, OMB has apparently never rejected a proposed census questionnaire. Nevertheless, Defendants assert that \"because the citizenship question has not ... received clearance ... and may be rejected by OMB,\" Plaintiffs' claims are \"unripe for judicial resolution.\" Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 72-73, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-546\">\n   Notably, Defendants did not raise the issue of ripeness until their post-trial briefs - and then raised it only in response to a query from the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1482-84; Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 72, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; Docket No. 551 (\"Defs.' Post-Trial Reply Br.\"), at 7. Furthermore, they now concede that \"prudential ripeness,\" rather than jurisdictional ripeness, is \"the appropriate framework\" for analyzing these cases. Defs.'

That concession alone is fatal to their argument because a prudential ripeness argument, unlike a jurisdictional ripeness argument, can be waived,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"519\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    559 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   670 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"520\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and by failing to make the argument in their motion to dismiss, in a motion for summary judgment, or in their pretrial briefing, Defendants did just that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-547\">\n   In any event, Defendants' belated ripeness argument would fail on the merits. As the Supreme Court has explained, the ripeness doctrine \"is designed to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio Forestry Ass'n, Inc. v.

To evaluate a claim's ripeness for judicial review, therefore, a court must consider three factors: \"(1) whether delayed review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs; (2) whether judicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action; and (3) whether the courts would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 733,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504230\" index=\"527\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/726/#p732\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In these cases, as Defendants all but concede, all three factors weigh heavily in favor of judicial review now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-548\">\n   First, there is no question that delayed review would cause hardship to Plaintiffs. As discussed above, the NGO Plaintiffs are\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   suffering harm from the addition of the citizenship question due to the diversion of valuable resources. And more broadly, as the Court explained in denying Defendants' attempts to stay trial, time is of the essence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528340\" index=\"528\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/345/444/#p452\">\n    345 F.Supp.3d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452-55, No. 18-CV-2921 (JMF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"529\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205791968\">\n    2018 WL 5791968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-*7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2018). According to Defendants themselves, the Census Bureau\n   \"need[s] to begin printing the 2020 census questionnaire\" in June 2019. Docket No. 540, at 3. In light of that deadline, Defendants concede that even with this Court issuing a ruling now, \"it is extremely unlikely that full merits briefing and argument in the Second Circuit, let alone the Supreme Court, would be possible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"530\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205791968\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It follows that dismissing the case as unripe pending OMB clearance later this year would almost certainly preclude Plaintiffs from obtaining a final ruling on their claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076553\" index=\"531\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/316/#p341\">\n    525 U.S. at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076553\" index=\"532\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/316/#p341\">\n    119 S.Ct. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a \"pause\" in litigation \"would result in extreme - possibly irremediable - hardship\" to plaintiffs challenging how the census was to be conducted). Indeed, when pressed at oral argument on whether it would make sense for the Court to dismiss the case as unripe given the time sensitivities and the limited opportunity for review after OMB clearance, defense counsel answered, with admirable candor, that \"it probably does not.\" Tr. 1484. He further noted that \"the hardship to the parties waiting for judicial review is a significant factor here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1485. In sum, there is little or no dispute that the first ripeness factor weighs heavily in favor of prompt review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-549\">\n   Defendants do not even argue about the second and third factors, and for good reason. With respect to the second factor, judicial review at this stage would not inappropriately interfere with further administrative action. There is no dispute the Secretary Ross's decision constitutes \"final agency action\" reviewable under the APA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1482. OMB could ultimately take the view that the decision to add a citizenship question fails even the most rudimentary cost-benefit analysis. But in that event, a judicial decision implying or concluding the same thing would hardly \"interfere\" with administrative action. To the contrary, both processes would act as complementary restraints on unlawful (the courts) or inefficient (OMB) governmental action. With respect to the third factor, Defendants can hardly maintain that the Court would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented. For one thing, Defendants have spent months arguing - and are still arguing, before the Supreme Court - that these cases should proceed to final judgment with\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   of a factual record. More importantly, the absence of Secretary Ross's deposition notwithstanding, the administrative and trial records in these cases are plainly sufficient to present the issues in a manner fit for judicial decisionmaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-550\">\n   <em>\n    CTIA - The Wireless Ass'n v.

In other words, while a preliminary showing of \"bad faith\" can entitle a plaintiff to discovery on the question,\n   a plaintiff must then prove \"actual\" bad faith in order to prevail on an APA claim. Similarly, if a plaintiff is able to prove that the agency's stated reasons for acting were not its \"real\" reasons, then the plaintiff has proved that the agency's decision was not \"reasonably explained\" as the APA requires it to be. On that score, Defendants have wisely conceded that if Plaintiffs establish that Secretary Ross's \"stated rationale [was] pretextual, that would be a basis for\" relief under the APA.

First, the Court concludes that Secretary Ross ignored and violated a clear statutory duty to rely on administrative records (rather than direct inquiries) to the \"maximum extent possible,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"675\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), rendering his decision \"not in accordance with law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"676\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). Second, even if that statute did not exist, Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question rather than collect citizenship data through more effective and less costly means was \"not supported by the reasons [he] adduce[d],\"\n   <em>\n    Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Service\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471674\" index=\"677\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/359/#p374\">\n    522 U.S. at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471674\" index=\"678\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/359/#p374\">\n    118 S.Ct. 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , making it \"arbitrary and capricious\" in violation of Section 706(A). Third, although a closer question, the Court finds that Secretary Ross failed to satisfy the statutory requirement that he report any plan to address the subject of citizenship to Congress at least three years before the decennial census, in violation of Title 13, United States Code, Section 141(f)(1). And fourth, the Court concludes that Secretary Ross's decision was pretextual - that the rationale he provided for his decision was not his real rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-576\">\n   In reaching these conclusions, the Court is mindful of the dispute between the parties, finally ripe for resolution, about whether and to what extent the Court may consider evidence beyond the Administrative Record. Consistent with the standards discussed above, the answer differs depending on the nature of Plaintiffs' specific claims. Specifically, the Court may not - and does not - consider or rely on material outside the Administrative Record in evaluating whether Secretary Ross's decision was \"arbitrary and capricious,\" except to the limited extent that Secretary Ross is alleged to have \"entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"679\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p52\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"680\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p52\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or that such material would further illuminate the issues before the Court (albeit, in that case,\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   substituting any such material proffered by Defendants for the reasons given by Secretary Ross),\n   <em>\n    Ass'n of Pac.

Similarly, the Court may not - and does\n   not - consider any extra-record evidence (and materials of which the Court may take judicial notice) in evaluating Plaintiffs' arguments that Secretary Ross's decision was \"not in accordance with law\" or \"without observance of procedure required by law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"687\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A), (D), because he failed to comply with Sections 6(c) and 141(f). By contrast, the Court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   consider material outside the administrative record in evaluating whether Secretary Ross's decision was made in bad faith or was pretextual. Ultimately, however, the issue does not matter for purposes of Plaintiffs' APA claims because the Court would reach the same conclusions with respect to those claims whether it is limited to the Administrative Record or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-577\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Secretary Ross's Decision Was Not in Accordance with Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-578\">\n   First and foremost, Secretary Ross's decision was unlawful because it was \"not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"688\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). As discussed above, Congress has delegated to the Secretary broad discretion over the conduct of the census. Critically, however, that discretion is not unlimited and, in opting to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire in the manner that he did, Secretary Ross violated two of those limits. First, and most blatantly, he violated the mandate in Section 6(c) of the Census Act to \"acquire and use information\" derived from administrative records \"instead of conducting direct inquiries\" to the \"maximum extent possible.\" And second, he did not include citizenship as a subject to be included on the 2020 census questionnaire in a report to Congress, as required by Section 141(f) of the Census Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court plainly has authority to set aside Secretary Ross's decision on the basis of the former violation - indeed, to do otherwise would be to sanction a blatant disregard of a critical substantive limitation on the Secretary's delegated powers. Whether the Court has the same authority with respect to Secretary Ross's violation of Section 141(f) is a closer question, but in the circumstances presented here, the Court concludes that it does. The Court will address each defect in turn, limiting its discussion to evidence contained in the Administrative Record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-579\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

First, by its terms, the statute is mandatory where it applies: The Secretary \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   acquire and\n   use\" data gleaned from administrative records.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"699\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added). Second, it imposes an affirmative duty not only to use such data, but also to\n   <em>\n    acquire\n   </em>\n   more of it when appropriate to fulfil the Secretary's other statutory responsibilities. Third, the statute explicitly requires the acquisition and use of such administrative-record data\n   <em>\n    instead\n   </em>\n   of asking questions through \"direct inquiries\" on the decennial census or other surveys - a clear, direct command that the Secretary\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   add additional questions to the census or other survey questionnaires where administrative records would suffice. Fourth, Section 6(c) requires the acquisition and use of administrative records instead of collecting data through direct inquiries \"[t]o the maximum extent possible\" - confining the Secretary's duty to the bounds of the possible, but requiring him to exhaust that limit. And finally, the statute requires the \"maximum ... possible\" use of administrative records \"consistent with the kind, timeliness, quality and scope of the statistics required,\" authorizing departures from Section 6(c)'s obligation only where certain characteristics of \"required\" statistics justify them. To the extent relevant here, the upshot is that, if the collection of data through the acquisition and use of administrative records would be as good or better than collection of data through the census, Section 6(c) leaves the Secretary no room to choose; he may not collect the data through a question on the census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-587\">\n   Considering these features here, the Court easily concludes that Secretary Ross's decision ran afoul of Section 6(c). For one thing, Secretary Ross nowhere mentions, considers, or analyzes his statutory obligation to \"acquire and use\" administrative records \"[t]o the maximum extent possible ... instead of conducting direct inquiries.\" Agency action taken in ignorance of applicable law is arbitrary and capricious, and must be vacated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts Pers.

Granted, he expressed a preference for data compiled entirely of survey self-responses and hypothesized that giving every person an opportunity to self-respond \"may eliminate the need\" for any imputation.

On the latter score, Secretary Ross is not excused from compliance with Section 6(c)'s dictates merely because another federal department asks him to add a \"direct inquir[y]\" to the census, as DOJ did here (at least formally). By its plain terms, Section 6(c) constrains the authority of \"\n   <em>\n    the Secretary\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"708\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delaware Dep't of Nat.

Post-Trial Br. 77, \u00b6 58. Defendants are certainly correct that, even as he acknowledged evidence that administrative records are more accurate than self-responses \"in the case of non-citizens,\" Secretary Ross\n   <em>\n    tried\n   </em>\n   to justify his decision not to rely on administrative records in lieu of a direct inquiry. AR 1316. \"[T]he Census Bureau,\" he claimed, \"is still evolving its use of administrative records, and the Bureau does not yet have a complete administrative records data set for the entire population.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"712\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Secretary Ross, that meant that \"using administrative records alone to provide DOJ with CVAP data would provide an incomplete picture\"\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   namely, that roughly ten percent of the American population \"would need to have their citizenship [status] imputed by the Census Bureau.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"713\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Given the scale of [that] number, it was imperative that another option be developed to provide a greater level of accuracy than either self-response alone or use of administrative records alone would presently provide.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"714\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The problem is that, even on its own terms, that explanation does not come close to meeting Section 6(c)'s requirements for collecting citizenship data through a direct inquiry, let alone a direct inquiry on the census, rather than through administrative records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-590\">\n   For one thing, Secretary Ross appears to have misunderstood his own options. Alternative B (merely adding a citizenship question to the census) would not have relied on \"self-response\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   \" to capture citizenship data - far from it, given that the addition of a citizenship question would cause a\n   <em>\n    decline\n   </em>\n   in self-response and lead to more households having citizenship data collected through in-person enumeration, administrative records, proxy response,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   imputation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1280-82. And Alternative C would not have relied on \"administrative records alone,\" given the necessity of imputing citizenship status to some number of households. AR 1305, 1311. Instead,\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   alternatives would have involved some degree of imputation - i.e., \"modeling\" - of responses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"715\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The difference, as the record overwhelmingly demonstrates, is that Alternative B - and, by extension, Alternative D, which Secretary Ross adopted - would have introduced errors into citizenship self-responses, corrupting both that data and the data generated by extrapolating from self-responses through imputation. AR 1278, 1280-82, 1305. In other words, and as explained in more detail below in assessing the substantive reasonableness of Secretary Ross's decision, every relevant piece of evidence in the Administrative Record supports the conclusion that Alternative D would produce\n   <em>\n    less accurate citizenship data\n   </em>\n   than Alternative C - and\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   supports the conclusion that Alternative D would yield more accurate citizenship data given Secretary Ross's own criteria or the parameters discussed in the Gary Letter. Given that, it cannot be said, even in spirit, that \"the kind, timeliness, quality and scope of the statistics\" allegedly \"required\" for DOJ's VRA enforcement efforts justified the use of a census question under Section 6(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-591\">\n   Defendants' only other attempt to justify Secretary Ross's failure to heed Section 6(c) is to argue that \"there is no apparent distinction between the citizenship question and a number of other questions on the decennial census for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"716\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c),\" such as the questions about sex, race, and ethnicity.

And because \"no one would suggest that the statute prohibits the Census Bureau from including\n   <em>\n    those\n   </em>\n   questions,\" they continue, it cannot be read to prohibit the citizenship one either.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"717\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). But that argument falls short for three independent reasons. First, as noted, it is a \"foundational principle of administrative law that a court may uphold agency action\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action,\"\n   <em>\n    Michigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591135\" index=\"718\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2699/#p2710\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added), and, as discussed above, Secretary Ross's March 26, 2018 Memorandum contained no analysis whatsoever of his statutory obligations under Section 6(c) - let alone this specific argument, which Defendants present for the first time through their counsel in this litigation. Second, collection of data about sex, race, and ethnicity through direct inquiries rather than administrative data may or may not be justified under the standards set forth in Section 6(c) - the Administrative Record in these cases obviously does not speak to that question and the parties have not briefed it. And third, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that collection of such data\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be reconciled with the statute's text, Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that\n   <em>\n    those\n   </em>\n   violations of Section 6(c) would justify\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   one. Two statutory wrongs do not make a right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-592\">\n   \"[T]he Constitution vests\n   <em>\n    Congress\n   </em>\n   ,\" not the Executive, \"with wide discretion over ... the conduct of the census,\"\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin\n   </em>\n   , 517 U.S. at 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"719\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p19\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added), and it is only because of Congress's statutory delegations that the Secretary of Commerce has any authority to design and conduct the decennial census at all. It goes without saying that that authority extends only as far as Congress has provided, ends where Congress says it ends, and can only be exercised subject to the conditions and constraints that Congress has imposed. Here, Congress has spoken clearly: To the maximum extent possible and given the kind, timeliness, quality and scope of the data required, Secretary Ross\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   gather data through the acquisition and use of administrative records, not by adding direct inquiries to the census or other surveys.

The report stated that \"[a] question about a person's citizenship is used to create statistics about citizen and noncitizen populations\" and that \"[t]hese statistics are essential for enforcing the Voting Rights Act and its protections against voting discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (capitalization altered). Notably, it claimed that a question about citizenship had been asked in 1820, 1830, 1870, and from \"1890 to present.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That claim, of course, is flat wrong in one respect (citizenship did not appear on the 2010 census at all) and materially misleading in another (the citizenship question was not asked of every household in 1960 or thereafter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-602\">\n   Defendants try to excuse Secretary Ross's conceded failure to include citizenship as a subject of the census in the Section 141(f)(1) report by contending that the Section 141(f)(2) report satisfied the requirements of Section 141(f)(3), which allows the Secretary to add subjects or questions to the census \"after submission of a report under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection and before the appropriate census date.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 80, \u00b6 65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that argument is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, by its terms, Section 141(f)(3) conditions the belated addition of a new subject or question on a \"find[ing]\" by the Secretary that \"new circumstances exist which necessitate that the subjects, types of information, or questions contained in reports so submitted be modified.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"724\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3). And, putting aside the question of whether any such findings would be subject to judicial review, there is no evidence - in the\n   Section 141(f)(2) report, in Secretary Ross's March 26, 2018 Memorandum, or anywhere else in the Administrative Record for that matter - that Secretary Ross ever made such a finding. Second, again by its own terms, Section 141(f)(3) requires the Secretary to submit a separate report to the relevant congressional committees if he finds, after having submitted the \"subject\" report, that new circumstances necessitate modifying the subjects to be asked on the census. But if the Section 141(f)(2) report could satisfy Section 141(f)(3) when the Section 141(f)(1) report was to be modified, then there would have been no reason for Congress to mention Section 141(f)(1) in Section 141(f)(3). The Secretary could always modify the \"subject\" report required by Section 141(f)(1) by simply submitting a \"question\" report with a new question, rendering Section 141(f)(3)'s reference to \"paragraph (1) ... of this subsection\" superfluous. Construing the statute in that manner would violate the canon that courts must give effect to all of a statute's provisions \"so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\"\n   <em>\n    Corley v.

But as the Ninth and D.C.

And there are two critical distinctions between the situations in those cases (and in the other cases cited by Defendants, which follow\n   <em>\n    Guerrero\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hodel\n   </em>\n   ) and the situation here. First, the reports in those cases were not conditions\n   precedent to some other agency action subject to judicial review. In\n   <em>\n    Guerrero\n   </em>\n   , the statute at issue required the President (through his designee, the Director of the Office of Insular Affairs) to do no more than submit an annual report to Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684801\" index=\"741\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1190/\">\n    157 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1191-92 &amp; n.4. It did not require anything further from the Executive Branch, absent separate congressional action. And in\n   <em>\n    Hodel\n   </em>\n   , the statute required the Secretary of Interior to submit the report at issue to the President and Congress at the same time that he submitted a proposed final Outer Continental Shelf leasing program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526396,3465070\" index=\"742\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/865/288/\">\n    865 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   316 n.27. The statute required him to explain in the report \"why\" he had not \"accepted\" certain proposals for the leasing program, but it did not otherwise require him to take further action. Thus, in both\n   <em>\n    Guerrero\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hodel\n   </em>\n   , the reports were freestanding and \"purely informational.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684801\" index=\"743\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1190/\">\n    157 F.3d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The question presented was whether the reports themselves could be challenged, separate and apart from any other agency action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-609\">\n   The reporting requirement here is very different. Section 141(f) requires the Secretary to file reports before he may take other action delegated to him by statute - namely, to the extent relevant here, before he may add a new subject or question to the census questionnaire. In other words, \"legal consequences\" do \"flow\" from the Section 141(f) reports.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684801\" index=\"744\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684801\" index=\"744\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1190/\">\n    at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once he files the \"subjects\" report mandated by Section 141(f)(1), he is statutorily required to adhere to those subjects on the census questionnaire unless he finds \"new circumstances ... which necessitate that the subjects\" be modified and reports these modified subjects to Congress.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"745\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3). And it is the Secretary's ultimate decision - not, as in\n   <em>\n    Guerrero\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hodel\n   </em>\n   , the mere failure to submit an adequate report in itself - that Plaintiffs challenge. That makes all the difference in the world. Defendants concede that Secretary Ross's decision to add the citizenship question qualifies as \"final agency action\" for purposes of the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1482. Thus, it is, in\n   <em>\n    Hodel\n   </em>\n   's words, a \"prototypical exercise of agency power\" subject to \"the general presumption of reviewability of agency action\" and the \"congressional directive for judicial review of claims by non-congressional parties\" embodied in the APA.\n   <em>\n    Hodel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526396,3465070\" index=\"746\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/865/288/\">\n    865 F.2d at 318-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, through the APA, which was in effect when Section 141(f) was enacted, Congress has expressly authorized the court to \"hold unlawful and set aside\" that action if it was \"not in accordance with law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"747\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A), or taken \"without observance of procedure required by law,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"748\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 706(2)(D). By the same token, the relief requested by Plaintiffs is not the filing of \"a better report,\" as it was in\n   <em>\n    Guerrero\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hodel\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Guerrero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684801\" index=\"749\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1190/\">\n    157 F.3d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, Plaintiffs ask the Court to set aside Secretary Ross's decision to add the question, which - as discussed above - will indeed redress their injuries caused by that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-610\">\n   There is a second critical difference between the situations in\n   <em>\n    Guerrero\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hodel\n   </em>\n   and the one here. In each of those cases, the challengers' contention was emphatically not that the relevant Executive Branch official had \"failed entirely to report back to Congress,\" but rather that the statutorily mandated report had somehow been \"inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526396,3465070\" index=\"750\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/865/288/\">\n    865 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   318-19 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guerrero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684801\" index=\"751\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1190/\">\n    157 F.3d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the only controversy is whether the [challenged] report was adequate and what kind of information must be provided in future reports\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684801\" index=\"752\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1190/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1195 n.10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, by contrast, the issue is not\n   the adequacy of Secretary Ross's reports to Congress.

Congress may be in a better position than the courts to evaluate whether a given report is adequate and to \"take what it deems to be the appropriate action\" if the report is not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526396,3465070\" index=\"754\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/865/288/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526396,3465070\" index=\"754\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/865/288/\">\n    at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But there is no reason to believe that Congress is in a better position than the courts to determine whether a given report has been submitted at all; at most, that determination requires, as it does here, a construction of the relevant statute and a straightforward finding of fact, both matters well within the competence of courts. Relatedly, while evaluating \"[w]hether a report to Congress is sufficiently 'detailed' \" may well involve an \"inherently elusive\" inquiry,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526396,3465070\" index=\"755\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/865/288/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , there is nothing complicated or elusive about the inquiry required here. Indeed, given the Court's construction of the statute (namely, that Secretary Ross's Section 141(f)(2)\"questions\" report does not, as a matter of law, qualify as a Section 141(f)(3) supplemental \"subjects\" report), it is undisputed that Secretary Ross failed entirely to file the report required by Section 141(f)(3).

Secretary Ross's Explanations Ran Counter to the Evidence Before the Agency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-615\">\n   First, in a startling number of ways, Secretary Ross's explanations for his decision were unsupported by, or even counter to, the evidence before the agency. For instance, he sought to justify his decision on the ground that \"no one provided evidence that reinstating a citizenship question on the decennial census would materially decrease response rates.\" AR 1317. But that assertion is simply untrue. The Administrative Record is rife with both quantitative and qualitative evidence, from the Census Bureau itself, demonstrating that the addition of a citizenship question to the census questionnaire would indeed materially reduce response rates among immigrant and Hispanic households.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 1277, 1278; AR 5500, 5505-06; AR 10386. Most notably, by examining differential declines in self-response rates on past surveys and measuring differential sensitivity to citizenship inquiries as shown in item non-response rates and breakoff rates, the Census Bureau calculated in January 2018 that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census was likely to lead to a 5.1% differential decrease in self-response rates among noncitizen households. AR 5505-06. That analysis and others like it are the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   quantitative evidence in the Administrative Record on the\n   effect of the citizenship question on response rates. That is, despite Secretary Ross's claim to the contrary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1315, 1318, there is no evidence in the Administrative Record supporting a conclusion that addition of the citizenship question will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   harm the response rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-616\">\n   That is just the tip of the iceberg. For instance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-617\">\n   \u2022 Secretary Ross claimed that the citizenship question is \"no additional imposition\" for \"the approximately 90 percent of the population who are citizens\" and \"for the approximately 70 percent of non-citizens who already answer this question accurately on the ACS.\" AR 1317. But that claim is manifestly contrary to both evidence in the Administrative Record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1277, 1281, and common sense. Adding a question to a survey that is sent to every household in the country \"imposes\" an additional burden - one question's worth, per person, per household - on every respondent. And that is true whether or not the respondent can answer the question by truthfully affirming that he or she is, in fact, a citizen of the United States and whether or not the respondent answered the question correctly on another survey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1281 (\"Survey methodologists consider burden to include ... the direct time costs of responding ....\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"766\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203502\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (defining the term \"burden,\" for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, to mean \"time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, or provide information to or for a Federal agency, including the resources expended for ... reviewing instructions; ... completing and reviewing the collection of information; and transmitting, or otherwise disclosing the information.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-618\">\n   \u2022 Secretary Ross asserted that placing the citizenship question last on the census form will somehow \"minimize any impact on decennial census response rates.\" AR 1320. But the Administrative Record includes no evidence whatsoever to support that assertion. And the assertion is based on a fundamental\n   misunderstanding of the way the census is conducted. After all, respondents are directed to answer all questions on the questionnaire sequentially for each member of their household, which means that - in a multi-member household - a respondent would see the citizenship question when he or she answers as to the first member of the household before answering any questions about others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-619\">\n   \u2022 Secretary Ross stated that it was \"difficult to assess\" whether \"non-response follow-up increases resulting from inclusion of the citizenship question would lead to increased costs.\" AR 1319. But the Administrative Record reflects that, prior to the March 2018 decision, the Census Bureau estimated that the expected self-response decline from adding a citizenship question would result in an increased cost of at least $27.5 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1282.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-620\">\n   Any one of these errors or overstatements would arguably support a finding that Secretary Ross's decision was arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of the APA.

He stated, for example, that \"[t]he citizenship data provided to DOJ will be\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   accurate with the question than without it,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1319 (emphasis added), and that adding a citizenship question was \"\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to provide complete and accurate data in response to the DOJ request,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1320 (emphasis added).

The problem is that\n   all relevant evidence in the Administrative Record establishes that adding a citizenship question to the census will result in\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   accurate and\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   complete citizenship data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-622\">\n   First, as discussed above in reference to Section 6(c), all of the relevant evidence before Secretary Ross -\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of it - demonstrated that using administrative records (Alternative C) would actually produce more accurate block-level CVAP data than adding a citizenship question to the census (Alternative D).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 1277-78 (explaining that adding the citizenship question would result in \"substantially less accurate citizenship status data than are available from administrative sources\"); AR 1285 (\"[T]he administrative records citizenship data would most likely have both more accurate citizen status and fewer missing individuals than would be the case for any survey-based collection method.\"); AR 1293 (\"Q: Is using sample data and administrative records sufficient for DOJ's request? A: The 2020 Census data combined with Alternative C are sufficient to meet DoJ's request. We do not anticipate using any ACS data under Alternative C.\"); AR 1312 (\"Alternative D would result in poorer quality citizenship data than Alternative C.\"); AR 5475 (\"Alternative C delivers higher quality data than Alternative B for DoJ's stated uses.\"). That is because, as Secretary Ross himself acknowledged,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1316, survey data regarding citizenship is highly suspect: People who are identified as noncitizens in administrative respond on surveys that they are citizens approximately thirty percent of the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1283; AR 1311. And while it is true that Alternative C - using administrative records \"alone\" - would require the Census Bureau to \"impute\" the citizenship of a portion of the population,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ross Memo 4, at AR 1316, Alternative D would rely on imputation (not to mention proxy response) as well,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1305, 1307. The difference is that, in Alternative C, the missing citizenship data would be imputed from a more accurate source - namely, administrative records - than in Alternative D.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-623\">\n   Nor would adding the question to the census result in \"more complete\" citizenship data, whatever that may mean. It is certainly true that \"[a]sking that citizenship question of 100 percent of the population gives each respondent the\n   <em>\n    opportunity\n   </em>\n   to provide an answer.\" Ross Memo 5, at AR 1317 (emphasis added). But Secretary Ross identifies no independent value, let alone one supported by a rational policy objective, in providing an \"opportunity\" to respond if doing so does not yield more accurate and complete data. And the record is clear that many respondents will not take advantage of the opportunity (or, as discussed, will take advantage of it by providing inaccurate responses), forcing the Census Bureau to rely more heavily on NRFU operations, including proxy response and imputation, to fill in the missing data.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 1311. That result also undermines Secretary Ross's assertion that Alternative D \"would maximize the Census Bureau's ability to match the decennial census responses with administrative records.\" Ross Memo 4, at AR 1316. As the Census Bureau itself made clear, adding a citizenship question will drive down the self-response rate and push more households into NRFU operations, which, in turn, produces \"lower quality\" personal identifying information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1311. That, in turn, will actually increase \"the number of persons who cannot be linked to ... administrative data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-624\">\n   In short, Secretary Ross's decision is neither logical nor rational on its own terms.

That has two significant implications with respect to DOJ's purported desire for census-block CVAP data. First, it means that, even with a citizenship question on the census, there would not be a single census block (except for randomly) where citizenship data would actually reflect the responses of the block's inhabitants to the census questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Census Bureau 30(b)(6) Dep. 67-68, 70-71; Tr. at 1033.

Most glaringly, Secretary Ross's decision to add the question violates every component of OMB's SPD No. 2, which mandates that the Census Bureau \"design and administer\" the census \"in a manner that achieves the best balance between maximizing data quality and controlling measurement error while minimizing respondent burden and cost.\" PX-359, at 16, \u00a7 2.3. Since, as discussed above, Secretary Ross selected an option that is less accurate and less complete than an alternative that was presented to him, it goes without saying that his decision did not constitute \"the\n   <em>\n    best\n   </em>\n   balance between maximizing data quality and controlling measurement error.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Nor can it be said that he \"minimize[d] respondent burden and cost,\" since, as discussed above as well, adding a citizenship question to the census increases the burden on every household in the country and, by the Census Bureau's own calculations, would increase the costs of administering the census by tens of millions of dollars. In short, Secretary Ross's decision falls short on\n   <em>\n    all four\n   </em>\n   criteria set forth in SPD No. 2's Section 2.3 - maximizing data quality, controlling measurement error, minimizing respondent burden, and minimizing cost. Secretary Ross's failure to justify that departure qualifies as arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-638\">\n   Secretary Ross's decision departed without adequate justification from the Census Bureau's own Statistical Quality Standards and practices as well. As noted, the Standards require pretesting of new questions, except in two circumstances: first, where \"cost or schedule constraints ... make it infeasible,\" in which case a \"waiver\" is\n   required; or second, where the question \"performed adequately in another survey.\" PX-260, at 8. But there is no indication in the Administrative Record that the Census Bureau applied for, let alone received, a waiver. (And even if it had, Secretary Ross could hardly contend that \"cost or schedule constraints\" made pretesting infeasible, as any such constraints were a product of his own making - the Census Bureau would have had ample time to conduct thorough pretesting had Secretary Ross shared in early 2017 that he was considering the issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

And second, the Administrative Record - indeed, Secretary Ross's own Memorandum - establishes that the citizenship question has not \"performed adequately\" on the ACS. After all, analyses indicate that noncitizens \"inaccurately mark 'citizen' about 30 percent of the time\" on the ACS. Ross Memo 4, at AR 1316. Notably, Secretary Ross nowhere stated in his Memorandum that the question has \"performed adequately\" on the ACS. He did say the question had \"been well tested.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3613953\" index=\"805\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/686/7/#p21\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at AR 1314. But \"well tested\" and \"performed adequately\" are not synonyms. And in any event, given both the differences between the ACS and the decennial census, and the Census Bureau's own Standards and practices calling for pretesting of any new question in the context of the whole proposed questionnaire, there is no basis even to call the question \"well tested.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-639\">\n   Conspicuously, Defendants barely even try to argue that Secretary Ross's decision was made in compliance with OMB's Statistical Policy Directives and the Census Bureau's Statistical Quality Standards. Instead, they have made two arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-640\">\n   First, in their pretrial briefing, they argued that \"[t]he process that Plaintiffs claim was not followed was developed for the [ACS].\" Defs.' Pretrial Reply Br. 5. Stating that the ACS is \"a different instrument with different considerations and goals,\" Defendants contended that they \"reasonably determined that the ACS process did not apply to the decennial census here. Accordingly, the Secretary did not act arbitrarily by following a more informal process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Putting aside whether Defendants have abandoned this argument as it does not appear in their extensive post-trial briefing, it is, of course, close to a concession that Secretary Ross acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by relying on testing done for the purpose of the ACS (a conclusion for which there is plenty of evidence anyway). But the argument fails on its own terms for at least three reasons. First, the argument is a belated concoction of counsel; it appears nowhere in the Ross Memo or otherwise in the Administrative Record. Second, the argument finds no basis in the Census Bureau's Statistical Quality Standards. To the contrary, the Quality Standards explicitly apply \"to all information products released by the Census Bureau and the activities that generate those products,\" which includes both the ACS\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the decennial census. PX-260, at 6;\n   <em>\n    accord id.\n   </em>\n   at ii. And third, the argument does not pass the laugh test. The constitutionally mandated, once-in-a-decade census, which is used for many purposes, including apportionment of Representatives in Congress, is plainly more consequential than the annual ACS. Thus, if anything, the process used to vet any proposed changes to the decennial census questionnaire should be\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   rigorous than the process used to vet proposed changes to the ACS questionnaire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-641\">\n   In a last-ditch attempt to defend Secretary Ross's departures from the Census Bureau's well-established standards and practices, Defendants also contended at oral argument that the Statistical Quality Standards are not binding on the Secretary himself, citing\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp. v.

First, Defendants did not make the argument in either their pre-trial or post-trial briefs and, thus, waived it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norton v.

As detailed in the Administrative Record, when an agency requests data, it is standard operating procedure for the Census Bureau to meet with that agency to discuss the request, to drill down into the details of the data use, and to consider how best to meet the need presented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 3289, 5489-91, 8651;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Recitation of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 121-23. Consistent with that practice, the Census Bureau advised DOJ that it had a less burdensome proposal for meeting DOJ's purported need for CVAP data and reached out repeatedly to DOJ to set up a meeting between their respective experts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 3289, 8651. But DOJ rebuffed those requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 3460, 5489, 8651, 9074. Thus, there is no evidence in the Administrative Record that DOJ was apprised of the high inaccuracy rate of citizenship survey responses or of the potential implications of disclosure avoidance protocols for block-level CVAP data. That would be bad enough, but the trial record reveals that DOJ's refusal to meet with the Census Bureau was virtually unprecedented - particularly since it was done at the direction of the Attorney General himself. Gore Dep. 274; Tr. 963-65. Dr. Abowd testified at trial that he was not aware of a single other circumstance in which a Cabinet\n   Secretary had personally directed agency staff not to meet with the Census Bureau. Tr. 964-65.

It shows that Secretary Ross had decided to add the question for reasons entirely unrelated to VRA enforcement well before he persuaded DOJ to make its request. And it\n   <em>\n    certainly\n   </em>\n   shows that he was either \"unwilling or unable to rationally consider\" arguments against the question after he received DOJ's request, when he was allegedly engaged in the \"comprehensive review\" that led to his final decision. Ross Memo 1, at AR 1313. For one thing, given the extraordinary lengths to which Secretary Ross and his aides went to generate a request for the question, it is hard to imagine he would have been open to putting the brakes on his quest once he had finally succeeded in getting the request he felt he needed. For another, a decision-maker who was fairly and honestly considering the evidence before him would have been more likely to heed the legal obstacles in his path, including Sections 6(c) and 141(f), OMB's Statistical Policy Directives, and the Census Bureau's own pretesting requirements than Ross was; more likely to hesitate in the face of near uniform opposition to the request from stakeholders (notwithstanding an explicit effort to drum up support from outside groups); more likely to hit the pause button when experts at the Census Bureau warned that adding the question would increase the burden on respondents, harm the accuracy of the census count, and result in enormous extra costs, without providing as accurate and complete CVAP data as alternatives; and more likely to engage in, and encourage, dialogue with DOJ about whether there were other, less harmful ways to satisfy its purported needs. Secretary Ross's insistence on adding the question despite all of these obstacles and objections is strong evidence that he was unwilling or unable to rationally consider counterarguments to his plan once he had secured the request he felt he needed.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

In making that finding, the Court relied on several of the NGO Plaintiffs' factual allegations, construed in a manner most favorable to them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 811. The Court cited, among other things, \"departures from the normal procedural sequence,\" such as failing to test the citizenship question and ignoring the Census Bureau advisory committee's recommendations,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 808 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted); oddities in the \"specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,\" such as Secretary Ross's shifting and inconsistent explanations of his motivation for reinstating the citizenship question; and the seemingly transparent pretext of the VRA-enforcement rationale,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 809 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court cautioned, though, that without the benefit of inferences in their favor, such allegations might not be enough. Even if they established pretext, the Court explained, they \"did not necessarily\" establish \"pretext for\n   <em>\n    discrimination\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Court also considered the NGO Plaintiffs' allegations of statements made by President Trump around the time of Secretary Ross's decision that, \"while not pertaining directly to that decision, could be construed to reveal a general animus toward immigrants of color.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 810. The Court noted, however, that the President's statements were probative only if he was personally involved in Secretary Ross's decision.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Court found a basis to infer that President Trump was directly involved: Plaintiffs' allegation that his reelection campaign had sent an email announcing that he had \" 'officially mandated' \" Secretary Ross's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . All together, the Court held that \"drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor,\" these allegations, combined with the President's statements, \"nudge[d] [the] NGO Plaintiffs' claim of intentional discrimination across the line from conceivable to plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-670\">\n   In many respects, the trial evidence was consistent with Plaintiffs' original allegations. As discussed at length above, it included ample evidence of procedural irregularities\n   and substantive departures. That evidence, taken together, supports a finding that Secretary Ross's stated rationale was pretextual. But, for purposes of their equal protection claim, Plaintiffs must prove more than that.

But whether or not the trial evidence would support a finding that those advisors acted with a discriminatory purpose, the trial evidence does not establish that they communicated such a purpose to Secretary Ross, as would be necessary to impute their discriminatory purpose to him. Similarly, Plaintiffs failed to prove a sufficient nexus between President Trump and Secretary Ross's decision to make the President's statements or policies relevant to the equal protection analysis. In particular, Plaintiffs failed to back up the primary allegation in their pleadings that had supported finding such a nexus: the email from President Trump's reelection campaign announcing that he \"officially mandated\" the decision. The Court sustained Defendants objection to admission of the email on the ground that it was hearsay,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 539-1, at 35;\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   , 315 F.Supp.3d at 810 ; Tr. 1315, 1565-66, and Plaintiffs offered no other evidence of a\n   nexus between the President and Secretary Ross's decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1566-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-672\">\n   In short, the Court finds that Plaintiffs failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a discriminatory purpose motivated Defendants' decision to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 census questionnaire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be fair, it is possible that Plaintiffs could have carried their burden on that score had they had access to sworn testimony from Secretary Ross himself.

Secretary Ross's testimony could have revealed the nature of his conversations with Kobach, Bannon, and Attorney General Sessions, and whether President Trump directed the addition of the citizenship question. But Plaintiffs were denied the opportunity to depose Secretary Ross because the Supreme Court stayed this Court's Order authorizing such a deposition pending its resolution of Defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   , 139 S.Ct. at 17.

Significantly, it does not preclude Defendants from continuing to test the question or making whatever preparations they think appropriate in the event that the question is ultimately allowed to appear on the questionnaire. Moreover, the whole point of the parties' and the Court's haste in this litigation is that the census questionnaires have not yet been printed and that ordering any remedy\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they are printed would result in significantly greater disruption and expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-684\">\n   Defendants' final objection to the normal APA remedy of vacatur is that APA relief should\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   extend more broadly than the particular injuries proved by the plaintiffs in a given case. Defs.' Post-Trial Br. 85-87, \u00b6\u00b6 86-89, 95.

If Defendants are right that Article III constrains the Court's power to order relief beyond the parties who have demonstrated injury in a particular case, what kind of \"remand\" would ever be possible in an APA case? Do Defendants imagine that the Court should \"remand\" with respect to only certain Plaintiffs? Taken to its logical conclusion, Defendants' argument implies that the judicial review provision of the APA is inconsistent with Article III. But no court, least of all the Supreme Court, has suggested as much. Article III limits the federal courts' power to actual \"cases\" or \"controversies,\" which do not exist when there is no plaintiff who has a personal stake in the outcome of litigation. But once such a personal stake is present, the Court\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   have power to adjudicate the controversy, and\n   the question of what relief it may or must order is a \"merits\" question of substantive law that is ultimately for the legislature to decide (so long, of course, as any such relief has \"direct consequences on the parties involved\"),\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, Congress has required that agency action be reasonable and has prescribed that courts must set it aside where it is not - rather than, for example, awarding damages to compensate for the specific injuries suffered by plaintiffs as a result of unreasonable agency action. In short, assuming that a court has Article III jurisdiction - as this Court does - and that the APA's other statutory requirements are satisfied - as they are here - a court has both the power\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the duty to order the remedy Congress created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-685\">\n   Plaintiffs, meanwhile, seek the opposite remedy: vacatur\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   remand. PCOL \u00b6\u00b6 453-57. On its face, that request has some merit, if only because Defendants have never suggested an alternative basis for adding a citizenship question to the census, and it is doubtful that Defendants could cure the problems identified above by June, when the census questionnaires have to be printed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co. v.

Cir. 1994) (same). At the same time, however, it is not entirely clear what it would mean to refrain from remand in the circumstances of these cases. By analogy to appellate litigation, a remand is arguably necessary to restore an agency's \"jurisdiction\" where an adjudicatory decision or formal rulemaking was under review. Here, by contrast, Secretary Ross's \"jurisdiction\" over the 2020 census has presumably continued unabated throughout this litigation, and his ongoing obligation to execute his statutory duties with respect to the census will survive whatever remedy the Court orders. Put differently, it is hard to see how the Court's decision whether or not to \"remand\" in these cases could affect the Secretary's ongoing statutory authority over the form and content of the census questionnaire. Having said all that, and if only to avoid confusion, the Court will \"remand\" the case to the extent that such an order is necessary to restore the Secretary's jurisdiction over the census questionnaire. It goes without saying that such remand is limited to further action not inconsistent with the Court's Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-686\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-687\">\n   Thus, there is no basis to deviate from the standard remedy of vacatur and remand in these cases. Whether the Court should also issue an injunction is a closer question. Certainly, the four traditional factors governing the inquiry into whether to grant injunctive relief are satisfied. As discussed (at great length) above, Plaintiffs proved at trial that, if the citizenship question is added to the 2020 census questionnaire, they will suffer serious harm in the form of lost political representation, lost federal funding, and degradation of information that is an important tool of state sovereignty. And at least two of those injuries - the loss of political representation and the degradation of information - would be irreparable, without any adequate remedy at law.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

In\n   <em>\n    Monsanto\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court admonished that a district court vacating agency action under the APA should not grant an injunction if doing so would \"not have any meaningful practical effect independent of its vacatur.\"\n   <em>\n    Monsanto Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"988\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n    561 U.S. at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"989\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"An injunction,\" the Court reasoned, \"is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"990\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"990\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n    at 165-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644345,12455278\" index=\"991\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/139/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nevertheless, the Court concludes that granting an injunction would have two practical effects beyond mere vacatur of Secretary Ross's March 26, 2018 memorandum. First, in the absence of an injunction, Secretary Ross could theoretically reinstate his decision by simply re-issuing his memorandum under a new date or by changing the memorandum in some immaterial way. Secretary Ross retains the same statutory authority over the census that he had before the Court's decision today, provided (as always) that he exercises it consistent with the APA and applicable law (and the Court's order).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   , 315 F.Supp.3d at 804-06. In the circumstances of these cases, however, an injunction is necessary to make the Court's vacatur effective, as it prevents Secretary Ross from arriving at the same decision\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   curing the problems identified in this Opinion. Second, and related, an injunction will make it easier for Plaintiffs to seek immediate recourse from this Court in the event that Defendants seek to do anything inconsistent with this Opinion. The ability to seek immediate recourse is critical in these cases given the looming printing deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-690\">\n   Thus, in an exercise of its discretion, the Court does grant an injunction. In particular, the Court enjoins Defendants from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire based on Secretary Ross's March 26, 2018 memorandum or\n   based on any reasoning that is substantially similar to the reasoning contained in that memorandum. More specifically, Defendants are enjoined from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire unless the Secretary: exhausts the maximum possible usefulness of administrative records to acquire adequate information \"consistent with the kind, timeliness, quality and scope of the statistics\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"993\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added); submits a report to the relevant congressional committees \"containing [his] determination of the ... questions as proposed to be modified,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"994\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3) ; considers all relevant evidence and aspects of the problem; and provides, in support of the decision, his real rationale. To be clear, the Court does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   enjoin Defendants from continuing to study whether and how to collect data on citizenship as part of the census (or any other Census Bureau instrument). Nor does the Court enjoin Defendants from conducting tests with respect to the addition of a citizenship question or otherwise taking appropriate steps to prepare for the 2020 census - recognizing that, if a higher court disagrees with this Court's ruling, the citizenship question may well end up on the questionnaire and that Defendants should not be precluded from preparing accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-691\">\n   One final note about the scope of the Court's injunction.

Generally speaking, they do not preclude the Secretary from charting a new policy direction, even over the strenuous objections of career staff, or from recruiting other government officials to support such a change. Significantly, however, the discretion that they allow the Secretary is not unlimited. He must comply with the policy decisions that Congress - to which the Constitution gives authority over the census - has made and enshrined in statute, including but not limited to the preference for obtaining data through administrative records rather than through direct inquiries. He must follow the procedures mandated by law. And more broadly, the exercise of his statutory authority must \"be reasonable and reasonably explained.\"\n   <em>\n    Mfrs. Ry.
