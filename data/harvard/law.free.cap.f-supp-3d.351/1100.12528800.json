Plaintiff's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court must dispel Plaintiff's misconception of its burden on summary judgment. Plaintiff asserts that, because U.S. patents are presumed valid, \"a patentee who moves for summary judgment that its patent is not invalid need not introduce any evidence in order to prevail.\" (R. 130, Pl.'s Mot. at 5.) Without any argument about the merits of Defendant's invalidity defenses, Plaintiff then declares that it \"has met its burden\" as the party moving for summary judgment, and that the \"burden now shifts to Defendant to produce evidence from which a jury may find the '141 Patent invalid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Plaintiff appears to believe that the presumption of validity alone is sufficient to discharge its burden on summary judgment, but Plaintiff misunderstands its initial burden as the moving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is true that the claims of a U.S. patent are presumed valid and that the party contesting validity bears the ultimate burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20282\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp. v.

But it does not follow that the presumption of validity alone discharges Plaintiff's initial burden on summary judgment. Instead, \"a party seeking summary judgment\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Outlaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500031\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/833/#p837\">\n    259 F.3d at 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The party moving for summary judgment carries the initial burden of production to identify 'those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Logan v.

A patentee moving for summary judgment on an accused infringer's invalidity defense cannot, as Plaintiff supposes, merely stand on the presumption of validity and demand that the accused infringer put forth all its evidence of invalidity; the patentee must go further and \"identify[ ] those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(R. 130, Pl.'s Mot. at 6-8.) Plaintiff contends that Defendant's invalidity contentions are inadmissible because they relied on a claim construction for the term \"auscultation device\" that was not adopted by the Court, as shown by Defendant's prefatory statement in the contentions that \"[t]hese invalidity contentions are based upon Defendant's understand[ing] of how Plaintiff believes the claims should be construed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Plaintiff does not address the merits of the prior art relied on by Defendant, but reasons that if the invalidity contentions are stricken, Defendant would not \"have any admissible evidence on anticipation and obviousness\" and summary judgment is therefore warranted on these defenses.

Plaintiff further claims that Thomas Lechner (\"Lechner\"), who is Defendant's principal and who Defendant identified in interrogatories as having \"the most knowledge\" as to invalidity of the '141 Patent, cannot provide POSITA testimony because he admitted in his deposition to having no relevant training or experience. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.)

(R. 148, Def.'s Resp. at 2-6; R. 149, Def.'s Resp. to Facts \u00b6 16.) Defendant claims that, given the nature of the technology in this case, the invalidity issues are well within the comprehension of lay jurors. (R. 148, Def.'s Resp. at 4-6.) Defendant also argues that Plaintiff relies on a \"self-serving, conclusory opinion\" of the level of ordinary skill in the art in order to exclude Lechner as a potential POSITA, and that it also has a non-infringement expert who could provide POSITA testimony if necessary.

Non-infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The remainder of Defendant's motion seeks summary judgment of non-infringement on various grounds. The Court is not persuaded that Defendant's brief and conclusory arguments-each comprising just half a page and, for the most part, citing no legal authority-meet its burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law as to non-infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant first contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on the question of infringement because Plaintiff has failed to identify, in its Final Infringement Contentions, any specific person as the direct infringer to support its claims of indirect infringement. (R. 133, Def.'s Mem. at 4-5.) Plaintiff responds that it need not identify any specific direct infringer, and that circumstantial evidence of direct infringement\n   is sufficient to support a claim of indirect infringement. (R. 144, Pl.'s Resp. at 3-4.) Plaintiff asserts only indirect infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (c), (R. 133-1 at 10, Pl.'s Final Infringement Contentions at 2-3), and \"[i]ndirect infringement, whether inducement to infringe or contributory infringement, can only arise in the presence of direct infringement,\"\n   <em>\n    Dynacore Holdings Corp. v.

Regarding direct infringement, Plaintiff states in its Final Infringement Contentions that the asserted claims \"are directly infringed by users of the S-Scope when the S-Scope is used according to the instructions provided by [Defendant].\" (R. 133-1 at 10, Pl.'s Final Infringement Contentions at 22.) Although Plaintiff does not specifically identify any direct infringers by name or otherwise, \"a plaintiff s indirect infringement claims can succeed at trial absent direct evidence of a specific direct infringer,\" and the Federal Circuit \"has upheld claims of indirect infringement premised on circumstantial evidence of direct infringement by unknown parties.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Bill of Lading Transmission &amp; Processing Sys.

Accordingly, the Court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment of no contributory infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Last, Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted on Plaintiff's induced infringement claim because it relied on the advice of its counsel that the S-Scope did not infringe the '141 Patent, and therefore, it could not have the necessary intent to knowingly induce infringement under Section 271(b).

Ordinarily, it is unnecessary to resolve which class of subject matter an invention falls into, because if it falls into at least one category, it is patentable under Section 101.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ferguson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3362315\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/1359/#p1366\">\n     558 F.3d at 1365\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Although we need not resolve the particular class of statutory subject matter into which Applicants' ... claims fall, the claims must satisfy at least one category.\");\n    <em>\n     Nuijten\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698755\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/1346/#p1353\">\n     500 F.3d at 1354\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"If ... a court determines that a claim encompasses either a process or machine but is unsure which category is appropriate, it need not resolve the ambiguity.\"). But here the inquiry is indefiniteness under Section 112 rather than patentability under Section 101, and that inquiry is significantly affected by the proper classification of the claims. Accordingly, this case squarely presents an apparently unusual dispute over which statutory class of invention patent claims fall in.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Empirically, the three most common preambulatory terms by far are \"method,\" \"apparatus,\" and \"system.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dennis Crouch,\n    <em>\n     Patent Types: Method, Non-Method, or Both\n    </em>\n    , PatentlyO (Jan, 27, 2014),\n    <em>\n     https://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/01/patent-types-method.html\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The Court's conclusion is reinforced by the language of the other claims in the '141 Patent and language in the specification. While claims 1-11 are directed to \"an arrangement for auscultation training,\" claim 12 and its dependent claims are, in stark contrast, directed to \"[a]\n    <em>\n     method\n    </em>\n    for simulating auditory findings in an auscultation device\" (claim 12) or \"the\n    <em>\n     method\n    </em>\n    of claim [X]\" (claims 13-16). The specification similarly distinguishes between the claimed \"arrangement\" and the claimed \"method,\" explaining that that \"[t]he present application discloses [1] an arrangement and [2] method for auscultation training.\" (R. 54-1, '141 Patent, at col. 1 ll.41-42.) This is thus not a situation in which the applicant acted as his own lexicographer by idiosyncratically using the term \"arrangement\" to refer to a process or method.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Teleflex, Inc. v.
