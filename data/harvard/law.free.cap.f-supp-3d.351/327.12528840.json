(Dkt. 1).

Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. 8; Dkt. 10), and Plaintiff's reply (Dkt. 11). For the reasons discussed below, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 10) is granted and Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 8) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed her applications for DIB, CIB, and SSI on April 9, 2014.

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not attained the age of 22 as of March 31, 2013, the alleged disability onset date, and that Plaintiff met the insured status requirements of the Act through June 30, 2015. (Dkt. 6 at 141). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since March 31, 2013, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of \"lumbago, a depressive disorder, and an anxiety disorder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of \"rule-out slight levoscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, shoulder pain, knee pain, ankle pain, hand, wrist, and finger pain, headaches, weight gain, mild obesity, fatigue, pregnancy, abdominal pain, cellulitis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and sinusitis\" were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142-43). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.04, 12.04, and 12.06 in reaching his conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), because Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   is able to lift and/or carry twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, stand and/or walk for six hours in an eight-hour workday, and sit for six hours in an eight-hour workday.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 149).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of office helper, small products assembler, and mail clerk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150-51). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

(hereinafter, \"NP Cottrrell\"), relating to Plaintiff's ability to work and, even if the rejection was proper, the ALJ was required to develop the record. (Dkt. 8-1 at 12-21).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 6 at 216-26). Dr. Shapiro found that, despite Plaintiff's moderate limitations in accepting instructions and responding appropriately to criticism from supervisors, she had no significant limitations in her ability to interact appropriately with the general public, ask simple questions and request assistance, get along with co-workers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes, maintain socially appropriate behavior, and adhere to basic standards of neatness and cleanliness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223). Dr. Shapiro further opined that Plaintiff had no understanding and memory limitations, no sustained concentration and persistence limitations, and no adaptation limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222-23). In terms of Plaintiff's understanding and memory limitations, Dr. Shapiro explained that Plaintiff's recent and remote recall for discrete data was intact, with only slight difficulty with reverse digits, and that her memory skills were intact for day-to-day activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222). For concentration and persistence, Dr. Shapiro explained that Plaintiff cares for two young children, her performance at her consultative exam was not credible, and her level of day-to-day functioning showed that her attention and concentration skills were intact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Shapiro concluded that Plaintiff \"has a range of skills on par with cognitive level.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the written determination, the ALJ thoroughly discussed Dr. Shapiro's opinion (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 147) and afforded it \"very significant weight,\" based on her expertise, her review of Plaintiff's medical records, and the relative consistency of her opinion with the overall evidence, including Plaintiff's history of intermittent mental health treatment and reported good response to medication management (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 148). The ALJ specifically identified the opinions relating to Plaintiff's functional limitations issued by Ms. Seldon and Michelle DiRoumo, LMSW, as being consistent with Dr. Shapiro's assessed limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court has reviewed the opinion of Dr. Shapiro and finds that the ALJ's weighing of her opinion was proper. First, it is clear to the Court that the ALJ took into account the required considerations for weighing opinions from consultative sources. Second, Plaintiff contends that it is \"improper\" for an ALJ to rely on a non-treating, non-examining medical source and credit a state consultant over examining physicians. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-1 at 13). However, contrary to Plaintiff's assertions, it is well-settled that the opinion of a non-examining source may be credited over\n   that of an examining physician, particularly where the examining source's opinion is contradicted by the record.\n   <em>\n    Ridosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206171713\">\n    2018 WL 6171713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20199661\">\n    2018 U.S. Dist.

(Dkt. 8-1 at 15). Plaintiff points specifically to the April 2014 opinion of Ms. Seldon, which the ALJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   gave \"significant weight,\" in arguing that such limitations were necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On April 28, 2014, Ms. Seldon completed a psychological assessment for determination of employability for the Monroe County Department of Human Services, in which Ms. Selden found that Plaintiff had normal functioning in the following categories: following, understanding, and remembering simple instructions and directions; performing simple and complex tasks independently; regularly attending to a routine and maintaining a schedule; and maintaining basic standards of hygiene and grooming. (Dkt. 6 at 688). Ms. Selden found that Plaintiff was moderately limited (meaning unable to function between ten to twenty-five percent of the time) in maintaining attention and concentration for rote tasks, and in her ability to perform low stress and simple tasks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Selden did not find that Plaintiff was \"very limited\" or \"insufficient\" in any category of mental functioning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In the written determination, the ALJ discussed Ms. Selden's opinion relating to Plaintiff's moderate limitations for maintaining attention and concentration for rote tasks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147). The ALJ explained that he gave \"significant weight to the specific functional assessments of Ms. Seldon and Ms. DiRoumo in county employability reports due to their examinations of the claimant and the relative consistency of the opinions with each other and the overall medical evidence, including the well-supported opinions of psychologist Dr. Shapiro....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As noted above, the RFC limits Plaintiff to simple, routine, and repetitive tasks (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 145), which Plaintiff acknowledges (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-1 at 15). The Court concludes that the limitation for performing simple, routine, and repetitive tasks is consistent with Ms. Selden's assessment of Plaintiff's mental functioning, including her opinion that Plaintiff has moderate difficulties in maintaining attention and concentration, as well as other medical opinion evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

(Dkt. 8-1 at 16). Despite Plaintiff's contention, Ms. Selden's opinion does not include a specific opinion relating to the amount of time Plaintiff would be \"off task.\" Rather, Ms. Selden's opinion relating to Plaintiff's mental functioning, including Plaintiff's ability to maintain attention and concentration, is presented in a check-box form listing specific categories of mental functioning, a fact noted by the ALJ in the written determination.

As noted above, Ms. Selden found that Plaintiff's limitations for most categories of mental functioning were normal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 6 at 688). The ALJ specifically considered Ms. Selden's opinion that Plaintiff was moderately limited in maintaining attention and concentration (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 147), found that it was consistent with the similar limitations assessed by Ms. DiRoumo (who found that Plaintiff was \"very limited\" in her ability to maintain attention and concentration for rote tasks) and Dr. Shapiro (who found that Plaintiff had no sustained concentration or persistence limitations and no limitation in maintaining attention and concentration for extended periods) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 147-48), and included a limitation for performing simple, routine, and repetitive tasks in the RFC (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 145).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A physical examination revealed normal general appearance, gait, and heel and toe walking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 696). Plaintiff's systems were otherwise normal, except that she experienced pain to palpation of muscles in her thoracic and lumbar spine, with limited forward flexion of her back and limited ability to squat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 679). NP Cottrell found that Plaintiff was moderately limited (two to four hours per day) in her ability to walk, stand, and sit, and very limited (one to two hours per day) in her ability to push, pull, bend, lift, and carry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff had no limitations for her ability to see, hear, or speak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At step two, the ALJ assessed Plaintiffs lower back pain (lumbago) as a severe impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142). However, he also found that many of Plaintiff's alleged physical impairments, including rule-out slight levoscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, shoulder pain, knee pain, ankle pain, hand, wrist, and finger pain - were non-severe, because there was not enough documentation in the record to show that these conditions rose to the level of a severe impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff does not challenge this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In assessing Plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ gave \"very little weight\" to NP Cottrell's April 2014 opinion regarding Plaintiffs limitations for lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, bending, standing, walking, and sitting, as well as to her opinion that Plaintiff could work only twenty hours per week for at least three months, should refrain from pushing, pulling, and lifting more than fifteen pounds, and should change positions every two hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148). The ALJ explained that he assigned \"very little weight\" to NP Cottrell's opinion because she was a non-acceptable medical source, provided no support, explanation, or medical basis for her opinions, and her opinions were inconsistent with the rest of the evidence in the record, including Plaintiff's conservative treatment\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and activities of daily living. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court has reviewed the record, as well as NP Cottrell's opinion, and finds that the ALJ properly afforded it very little weight. As noted above, NP Cottrell's opinion was not entitled to any special weight.\n   <em>\n    Wider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274688\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/381/#p389\">\n    245 F.Supp.3d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, NP Cottrell's opinion regarding Plaintiff's ability to work - which is significantly restrictive - is inconsistent with her own physical examination of Plaintiff, which was mostly normal, save for back pain and limited forward flexion and ability to squat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelsey v.

As noted by the ALJ at step two of the disability analysis, a majority of Plaintiff's physical impairments were only briefly mentioned in the record, and the record lacked documentation showing that these physical impairments were severe and caused work-related functional limitations. (Dkt. 6 at 142). Plaintiff does not challenge this determination, nor does she point to any evidence in the record supporting NP Cottrell's assessment of Plaintiff's physical limitations. The Court has reviewed the medical record and agrees with the ALJ that NP Cottrell's opinion relating to Plaintiff's physical limitations is not supported by other medical evidence in the record, including relatively normal physical examinations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 568, 579, 589, 648, 696).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the alternative, Plaintiff contends that, even if the ALJ properly\n   afforded very little weight to NP Cottrell's opinions, his doing so created an evidentiary gap in the record that the ALJ was obligated to fill by developing the record.

In support of this contention, she cites to a case holding that if a physician's report appears inconsistent with her own records, the ALJ must seek clarification before rejecting the opinion. As an initial matter, Ms. Seldon is not a physician and, unlike a physician, her opinion is not entitled to any special deference. Further, \"[t]he mere fact that medical evidence is conflicting or internally inconsistent does not mean that an ALJ is required to re-contact a treating physician. Rather, because it is the sole responsibility of the ALJ to weigh all medical evidence and resolve any material conflicts in the record where the record provides sufficient evidence for such a resolution, the ALJ will weigh all of the evidence and see whether it can decide whether a claimant is disabled based on the evidence he has, even when that evidence is internally inconsistent.\"\n    <em>\n     Micheli v.
