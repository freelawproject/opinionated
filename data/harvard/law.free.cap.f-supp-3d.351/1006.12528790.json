On October 15, 2018, Defendant filed a response to the Government's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 35. In light of the split of authority that was developing among district courts as to\n   <em>\n    Pereira's\n   </em>\n   application in the context of \u00a7 1326(a) prosecutions, the Court vacated the Prior Order and requested supplemental briefing from each party on certain specific issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 36.

The Government directs the Court to a portion of the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   opinion in which the Supreme Court stated that \"[a] notice that does not inform a noncitizen when and where to appear for removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear under section 1229(a) ' and therefore does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205779491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2113 ). Based on that language, the Government states that \"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable\" because \"the 'stop-time' rule is not at issue\" in this case. Docket no. 26 pp. 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the Court's view, the Government's reading of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   places too much emphasis on the clause following the coordinating conjunction \"and.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pedroza-Rocha\n   </em>\n   , No. EP-18-cr-1286-DB, docket no. 53 p. 7. The first portion of the sentence cited by the Government appears to describe the Supreme Court's conclusion with respect to the requirements for an NTA under \u00a7 1229(a). The second portion of the sentence-on which the Government's position\n   is based-appears to describe the\n   <em>\n    application\n   </em>\n   of the Supreme Court's conclusion, as opposed to a\n   <em>\n    limitation\n   </em>\n   on that conclusion. \"Put another way, the Supreme Court stated that a notice to appear is invalid without designating the time and place and\n   <em>\n    it was on this basis\n   </em>\n   that the stop-time rule was not triggered.\"\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   , 347 F.Supp.3d at 407,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206012390\">\n    2018 WL 6012390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (emphasis added). This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   opinion also discusses the majority's general conclusion regarding the Notice to Appear in a separate context, outside the narrow scope of the \"stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2114-15 (discussing the need for the NTA to contain time and place information to give practical effect to \u00a7 1229(b)(1), which mandates that a hearing cannot be scheduled until at least 10 days after service of the NTA so that an alien has \"the opportunity to secure counsel\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, it would be incongruous to interpret the plain language of \u00a7 1229(a)(1) differently depending on the Government's stated purpose, and there is no reason to construe \"Notice to Appear\" differently for the purposes of the \"[i]nitiation of removal proceedings\"-notably, the\n   <em>\n    title\n   </em>\n   of \u00a7 1229 -than when applying it in the \"stop-time\" context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

Indeed, the majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   indicates that the \"stop-time rule\" was just one context in which the time and place requirements must be satisfied with respect to an NTA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen the term 'notice to appear' is used elsewhere in the statutory section,\n   <em>\n    including as the trigger for the stop-time rule\n   </em>\n   , it carries with it the substantive time-and-place criteria required by \u00a7 1229(a).\") (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court concludes that it would be inappropriate to limit\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's conclusion regarding \u00a7 1229(a)'s NTA requirements only to immigration proceedings involving the \"stop-time rule,\" given that the plain language indicates it is meant to apply to the initiation of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229a proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, the Government argues that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   should be distinguished from this case because Defendant received actual notice of the date and time of his hearing and thus was able to attend the removal proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 26 p. 4; docket no. 31 p. 13. Although this distinction\n   <em>\n    might be\n   </em>\n   relevant as to the determination of any \"actual prejudice\" suffered by Defendant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section III and note 18,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the fact that Defendant received actual notice does not make the legal holding of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   inapplicable in this case. The Government's argument appears to be premised on the idea that an incomplete NTA can be cured if the alien does in fact receive notice of the time and date of the removal hearing in a subsequent Notice of Hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 31 pp. 13-14. However, the Government made similar arguments during the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. for Resp't,\n   <em>\n    Pereira v.

Instead of adopting the Government's position, the Supreme Court appears to have rejected the argument by holding that a putative \"Notice to Appear\" lacking the hearing date and time is not merely an \"incomplete\" NTA, but it is instead not an NTA at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2113-14, 2116-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Section \u00a7 1229(a) does not say a 'notice to appear' is complete when it specifies the time and place of the removal proceedings.

Multiple courts in this District have concluded that the fundamental unfairness requirement in \u00a7 1326(d)(3) is satisfied when the underlying removal order was issued by an immigration judge lacking jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pedroza-Rocha\n    </em>\n    , No. 3:18-cr-01286-DB, docket no. 53 p. 10 ;\n    <em>\n     Lopez-Urgel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528872\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/978/\">\n     351 F.Supp.3d at 990-92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205984845\">\n     2018 WL 5984845\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7-8. At least one court in this District has also held that \"a removal proceeding in which the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction is so fundamentally unfair that [defendant] need not show prejudice.\"\n    <em>\n     Lopez-Urgel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528872\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/978/\">\n     351 F.Supp.3d at 991-92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205984845\">\n     2018 WL 5984845\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *8 (citing\n    <em>\n     Benitez-Villafuerte\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857864\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/651/\">\n     186 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    659 ). Here, it is not apparent that Defendant could demonstrate that he suffered \"actual prejudice\" as a result of the error in question, if he is required to do so as part of his \u00a7 1326(d) showing. Specifically, the record indicates that Defendant ultimately received the hearing's time and date information in the subsequent Notice of Hearing, appeared at his removal proceedings, was advised of his right to administrative and/or judicial review, and waived those rights. There is no obvious indication that anything would have occurred differently-at least with respect to Defendant's removal hearing and removal-had DHS complied with \u00a7 1229(a) and included the time and date of the hearing in Defendant's NTA rather than in Defendant's Notice of Hearing. However, in light of the Court's conclusions regarding the other requirements of \u00a7 1326(d) and the open question as to whether a jurisdictional defect could potentially be so \"fundamentally unfair\" as to excuse the showing of \"prejudice,\" the Court finds it unnecessary to make \"actual prejudice\" (or the lack thereof) a basis for the disposition of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
