The record does not include any physical assessments indicating that [Plaintiff] has physical limitations. I have considered the effect of obesity in determining her residual functional capacity and limitations are included therein. [Plaintiff] is obese and has osteoarthritis, which supports a residual functional capacity assessment of light. However, I note that [Plaintiff] has been a candidate for bariatric surgery. Treatment notes indicate that weight loss would likely reduce [Plaintiff's] symptoms associated with arthritis.

(Dkt. 10 at 23). None of these pieces of evidence shed any light on Plaintiff's physical functional limitations.

The Court has reviewed Plaintiff's medical records and finds that they lack information relevant to the type of functional limitations needed to properly assess a physical RFC, nor has Defendant identified any such evidence. Rather, Defendant explains that the ALJ considered that Plaintiff \"show[ed] improvement with treatment,\" her daily activities, her physical evaluations, and possible bariatric surgery, in assessing Plaintiff's RFC.

By 2015, Plaintiff had received at least one corticosteroid injection to her right knee, and x-rays showed \"significant medial osteoarthritis bilaterally with lateral and patellofemoral arthritis bilaterally.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 433-34). Treatment notes reveal that \"[g]iven the nature of her injury and the degenerative changes shown on her x-ray, she would be a good candidate for corticosteroid injection to the left knee in clinic today.... She has been given a script for physical therapy for strengthening and range of motion of bilateral knees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 434).
