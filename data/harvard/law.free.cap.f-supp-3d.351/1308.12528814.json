Dkt. # 31. The underlying dispute is a class action to recover money lost playing electronic gambling games available through a mobile app. Huuuge's Terms of Use, which include an arbitration provision, are made available when a user initially downloads the app and in the menu of the game itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Huuuge argues that the configuration of its app page and settings menu put a reasonable user on inquiry notice that playing Huuuge Casino entails agreeing to the Terms of Use. Wilson responds that he is not bound by Huuuge's Terms because the notice and URL were not sufficiently conspicuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed this Complaint against Huuuge on April 6, 2018, alleging that Huuuge Casino constitutes illegal gambling in violation of RCW \u00a7 4.24.070. Dkt. # 1, at 11-13. Huuuge Casino is a game available as a mobile app and allows users to play gambling games with virtual \"chips\" that may be purchased in the app after users run out of the initial free allotment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Despite the fact that these chips cannot be redeemed for actual money, Wilson alleges that they are nonetheless valuable because they can be used to continue playing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Therefore, Wilson alleges that Huuuge's game amounts to gambling as defined by statute and that he is entitled to recover the money he lost playing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Wilson downloaded Huuuge Casino from the Apple App Store. Motion, Dkt. # 31, at 2. When a user searches for the Huuuge Casino app, they first encounter a list of apps that match their search query. Dkt. # 37, Ex. A (video of user searching for, downloading, and playing Huuuge Casino). Each item on the list contains the name of the app, the developer, the app's user rating, a large picture showing the gameplay experience, and a blue \"GET\" button on the right that initiates downloading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If a user wants to learn more about the app before downloading it, they can click to visit the app's page, which includes more information and another place to download.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the bottom of the app page, a user can click an icon that says \"more,\" which reveals details about the game.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After scrolling through several screens' worth of text, a user eventually encounters the statement \"Read our Terms of Use,\" followed by a URL that a user can copy and paste into their web browser to access the Terms. Opp'n, Dkt. # 35, at 6-9. The following images depict the app page when a user first visits it, after clicking the \"more\" icon, and finally after scrolling down to the Terms of Use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once a user downloads the game, they can view another link to the Terms of Use by visiting the settings menu. Motion, Dkt. # 31, at 4. This menu is accessible via a button in the upper corner of the game screen. Opp'n, Dkt. # 35, at 13. The game screen and settings menu are depicted below.

While clickwrap agreements involve presenting the user with a list of terms and a button to manifest assent, browsewrap agreements present the user with just a hyperlink to the terms of use and do not necessarily require clicking a specific button to manifest assent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181388\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1171/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Several courts have observed that the law of other jurisdictions is similar to Washington law on this topic.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Domain Name Comm'n Ltd. v.

The court held that websites containing conspicuous hyperlinks but that \"provide[ ] no notice to users nor prompt[ ] them to take any affirmative action to demonstrate assent\" do not give inquiry notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202605270\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1179 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKee v.

Uber Technologies, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that a browsewrap agreement was formed where the notification and hyperlink regarding terms of use were \"spatially ...

However, even if a website or app contains just a hyperlink to the terms, courts have been more willing to find a valid agreement if the user is still forced to somehow manifest their assent to the terms, as opposed to passively browsing the site.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nicosia v.

In addition, the notification to \"Read our Terms of Use\" and the following URL are in generic black font and blend into the surrounding text such that a user would have no reason to notice them unless they were specifically hunting for them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkson v.

Here, the settings menu contains no such notification, so any increased likelihood of Wilson visiting the settings menu due to repeated use of the app is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nonetheless, Huuuge insists that, because Wilson played their game many times, insufficient notice is somehow made sufficient through shear repetition. Huuuge bases this theory primarily on the reasoning from\n   <em>\n    Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cairo, Inc. v. Crossmedia Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Register.com\n   </em>\n   , a user was charged with actual knowledge of website terms because, after each automated search on the website, they received the terms attached to each response.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785464\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/393/#p396\">\n    356 F.3d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396-97, 401-02 (2d Cir. 2004). Crucially, the user admitted to being \"fully aware of the terms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785464\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/393/#p396\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785464\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/393/#p396\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The user in\n   <em>\n    Cairo\n   </em>\n   also engaged in automated searching of the defendant's web pages, each of which included a prominent notification upon entry that using the site required agreeing to its terms. No. C 04-04825 JW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20756610\">\n    2005 WL 756610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2005). In addition to the user admitting to actual\n   knowledge, the court held that the \"repeated and automated use\" of the web pages meant that knowledge of the terms could be imputed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The holdings in\n   <em>\n    Register.com\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cairo\n   </em>\n   are simply inapplicable in a case like this where there is no actual knowledge or prominent notification.\n   <em>\n    Register.com\n   </em>\n   rested on the user's admission of actual knowledge, but Wilson does not make such an admission. To the extent that the reference to \"imputing knowledge\" in\n   <em>\n    Cairo\n   </em>\n   may be compared to putting a user on inquiry notice, the website in\n   <em>\n    Cairo\n   </em>\n   contained an \"explicit textual notice\" that informed users that they would be bound by the terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nguyen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181388\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1171/#p1176\">\n    763 F.3d at 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Cairo\n   </em>\n   ). Consequently, where courts have emphasized the user's repeated use of the site, it has been because the site had a prominent notification that was either unavailable on the initial search (making repeated use necessary for notice) or not viewed by an actual human.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Register.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785464\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/393/#p396\">\n    356 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   401 ;\n   <em>\n    Cairo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20756610\">\n    2005 WL 756610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 ;\n   <em>\n    Domain Name Comm'n Ltd. v.

None of these elements are present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Instead, Huuuge repeatedly conflates the consistent availability of the Terms of Use with actual or constructive knowledge of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion, DKt. # 31, at 15. However, a hyperlink may be tucked away in a corner of a website or buried beneath a mountain of text and still be theoretically \"available\" to a user.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While repeatedly playing a game may make it more likely that at some point the \"Terms of Use\" hyperlink will cross a user's field of vision,\n   <em>\n    Nguyen\n   </em>\n   specifically held that this is not enough for inquiry notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181388\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1171/#p1176\">\n    763 F.3d at 1178-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, after moving beyond the initial download, a user actually becomes\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   alert to binding contractual terms while casually using the product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263702\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/66/#p78\">\n    868 F.3d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It would be a different story, perhaps, if the terms popped up each time a user fired up the game or when they registered their account, but that is not the story here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263702\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/66/#p78\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Having failed to prove that its app can measure up to the standard set by other browsewrap cases, Huuuge argues in its Reply that \"[t]he Court should take judicial notice of ubiquitous online agreements when weighing the objective standard for reasonable prudence and inquiry notice.\" Dkt. # 39, at 4. In essence, Huuuge would like the Court to ignore all of the cases rejecting inconspicuous browsewrap and apply a blanket presumption that users these days just\n   <em>\n    assume\n   </em>\n   that every app they download is riddled with binding terms and provisions, many of which remove or limit important rights, and it is their duty to ferret out these terms wherever they may be. According to Huuuge, such an approach would avoid \"repercussions to the commercial paradigm that technology companies and consumers have embraced in an app-driven world.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court declines to adopt Huuuge's suggestion. While online users today are savvier than in the past, this does not\n   mean that the rules of contract law no longer apply. If an app developer wishes to bind a user to their copious terms, the onus is on the developer to at least provide reasonable notice and easy access. This is not a difficult thing to do when designing an app, despite Huuuge's protestations that the Court should devise some special rule for app store purchases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263702\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/66/#p78\">\n    868 F.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the Uber app formed a valid agreement under browsewrap case law);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rushing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204998139\">\n    2018 WL 4998139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (observing that there is nothing wrong with binding a user to terms upon downloading an app, but requiring sufficient notice to do so). The fact is, Huuuge chose to make its Terms non-invasive so that users could charge ahead to play their game. Now, they must live with the consequences of that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Huuuge's Motion to Compel Arbitration (Dkt. # 31) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Although Huuuge suggests in its Reply that Wilson was \"likely\" to have viewed the Terms at some point because he played the game many times, Huuuge does not present any evidence of Wilson's actual knowledge. Reply, Dkt. # 39, at 6. Given that the party seeking to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving that a contract was formed, this sort of speculation is not enough to prove actual knowledge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Huuuge is fond of the fruit stand metaphor employed in\n    <em>\n     Register.com\n    </em>\n    , and attempts to apply it to this situation. Reply, Dkt. # 39, at 11-12. In\n    <em>\n     Register.com\n    </em>\n    , the court explained that if a customer at a fruit stand saw a sign reading \"Apples - 50 cents apiece\" as he exited the stand with a half-eaten apple, he could not claim to be unbound by those terms in future dealings with the stand.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785464\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/393/#p396\">\n     356 F.3d at 401\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, if the sign was not clearly visible upon exiting but was instead on the far end of the stand and read \"see reverse side for details about these apple,\" the customer would not be bound.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
