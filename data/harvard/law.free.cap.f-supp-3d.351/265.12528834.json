(Dkt. 1). Plaintiff alleges that defendant C.O. Pearson (\"Defendant\") failed to protect him from an assault by another inmate. Following discovery, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 40), which was subsequently denied (Dkt. 44). A jury trial is scheduled to begin on March 18, 2019. (Dkt. 47). Presently before the Court are Plaintiff's motions to appoint counsel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 49; Dkt. 50; Dkt. 51).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff states that he has made \"numerous attempts\" to retain legal representation on his own, but despite his efforts he has failed to secure counsel. (Dkt. 49 at \u00b6 3). Plaintiff also argues that he is \"truly in need of counsel\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2), and that he does not \"understand what to do or how to prepare for a trial\" (Dkt. 51 at 3). Lastly, Plaintiff contends that he has \"been having some medical problems (HERNIA )\" and will be undergoing surgery related to that medical issue, which \"will take more time away\" from his trial preparation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Civil litigants, unlike criminal defendants, do not have a constitutional right to the appointment of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Foggie ex rel.

Plaintiff has also been granted leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis.\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 4). In his\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   application, Plaintiff stated that he was incarcerated, had not worked within the past 12 months, and his gross monthly income was about $40.00. (Dkt. 2 at 1-2). A prison official certified that Plaintiff held $19.51 on account to his credit at the Sullivan Correctional Facility, and that Plaintiff's average account balance for the previous six months was $64.13. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). As a result, Plaintiff has conclusively shown that he is indigent, and has met the threshold test for appointing counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, on balance, the above-referenced factors weigh against appointing counsel at this time. As the Second Circuit has noted, \"[t]he vast majority of litigation on behalf of personal claimants is financed initially by lawyers who accept the representation for a contingent fee in the expectation of being rewarded by a share of the winnings.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530957\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/877/170/#p172\">\n    877 F.2d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff states that he has made \"numerous attempts\" to retain counsel on his own, but he has not been able to secure legal representation. (Dkt. 49 at \u00b6 3). Plaintiff lists the names of attorneys and law firms that have either affirmatively declined to represent him or have not responded to his inquiries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Plaintiff's papers reveal that he has made attempts to find counsel. However, this, in-and-of-itself, is insufficient to warrant the appointment of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff's claims revolve around a single violent alleged altercation between himself and another inmate. Plaintiff claims that on March 11, 2014, the prison cell doors were opened for commissary. (Dkt. 1 at 2). At that time, another inmate entered his cell and physically assaulted him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant, who was apparently operating the cell doors, locked the violent inmate in Plaintiff's cell and allowed the assault to persist despite Plaintiff's cries for assistance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4). Defendant eventually approached Plaintiff's cell about 30 or 35 minutes later and unlocked the door, asking the other inmate, \"Are you done?\" before the assault concluded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The foregoing demonstrates that Plaintiff's allegations of Defendant's failure to protect him from the assault \"satisfy the initial threshold showing of merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204608201\">\n    2018 WL 4608201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mackey v.

However, the trial will likely turn on the jury's determination as to the credibility of the witnesses, not any complex factual or legal issues which Plaintiff is incapable of handling on his own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204533649\">\n    2017 WL 4533649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (\"[C]ontrary to plaintiff's contentions, the legal issues in this case-use of force and failure to protect-do not appear to be complex.\");\n   <em>\n    Paulin v.

Indeed, the primary factual issues appear to be whether Defendant locked Plaintiff and the other inmate in Plaintiff's cell, whether Defendant was aware that the assault was taking place, and whether Defendant ignored Plaintiff's plight. Such questions do not appear to require substantial or special factual inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Furthermore, the trial is unlikely to require extensive cross-examination for which experienced trial counsel is required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

In fact, the Court has held a prior appearance with Plaintiff and finds Plaintiff able to succinctly and competently articulate his thoughts in a manner which suggests that he is capable of presenting his case to a jury without the assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fowler v.

In sum. Plaintiff has submitted a Complaint that identifies the relevant factual background in this matter, and he has participated in discovery, which has revealed no novel or overly complex issues.
