Dkt. # 34. The underlying dispute is a class action to recover money lost playing electronic gambling games available through mobile apps. High 5 argues that the Complaint should be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Specifically, High 5 contends that it should not be subject to personal jurisdiction because it has no control over the physical location of users who download and use its apps. In addition, High 5 argues that its apps do not allow users to gamble for a \"thing of value\" and do not constitutes \"illegal gambling\" under Washington law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   High 5, a Delaware company headquartered in New York, markets apps that allow players to partake in popular gambling games, such as slot machine. Complaint, Dkt. # 1, at 2, 9. The apps allow users to play these games with \"virtual coins\" that may be won or purchased in the app after users run out of the initial free allotment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Wilson purchased $1.99 worth of coins that he subsequently lost playing High 5's games.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Despite the fact that these coins cannot be redeemed for actual money, Wilson alleges that they are nonetheless valuable because they can be used to continue playing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Therefore, Wilson alleges that the games on High 5's apps constitute gambling as defined by RCW 9.46.0285 in violation of RCW 4.24.070.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13. Wilson also alleges two derivative claims for violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86.010, and unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When a defendant moves to dismiss a complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction,\n   the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p800\">\n    374 F.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800 (9th Cir. 2004). A plaintiff cannot simply rest on the bare allegations of its complaint, but rather is obligated to come forward with facts, by affidavit or otherwise, supporting personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Amba Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Jobar International, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"980361\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/551/784/#p787\">\n    551 F.2d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 787 (9th Cir. 1977). Where the motion is based on written materials rather than an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts.\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p800\">\n    374 F.3d at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A prima facie showing means that the plaintiff has produced admissible evidence, which if believed, is sufficient to establish the existence of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Ballard v. Savage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414697\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/1495/#p1498\">\n    65 F.3d 1495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1498 (9th Cir. 1995). Conflicts in affidavits must be resolved in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414697\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/1495/#p1498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    b. Application\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   High 5 contends that Wilson lacks personal jurisdiction to sue in Washington both because High 5 is not headquartered or incorporated in the state and because it merely placed its app in the stream of commerce and did not direct its activities at Washington. Wilson concedes that general jurisdiction is lacking, but argues that specific jurisdiction is satisfied because High 5 entered into numerous contracts with consumers in Washington who had downloaded their app. Essentially, the parties quarrel over whether the \"purposeful direction\" or \"purposeful availment\" test for jurisdiction applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A court's personal jurisdiction analysis begins with the \"long-arm\" statute of the state in which the court sits.\n   <em>\n    Glencore Grain Rotterdam B.V. v. Shivnath Rai Harnarain Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509209\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/284/1114/#p1123\">\n    284 F.3d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1123 (9th Cir. 2002). Washington's long-arm statute extends the court's personal jurisdiction to the broadest reach that the United States Constitution permits, so the jurisdictional analysis under state law and federal due process are the same.\n   <em>\n    Byron Nelson Co. v.

The Ninth Circuit applies the \"effects test,\" under which \"the defendant allegedly must have (1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Mavrix Photo, Inc. v.

In contrast, the \"purposeful availment\" analysis is most often used in suits sounding in contract, and often requires\n   \"evidence of the defendant's actions in the forum, such as executing or performing a contract there.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/\">\n    at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When deciding whether to apply the purposeful availment or direction analysis, courts look to the underlying dispute to determine whether it primarily sounds in contract or tort. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Boschetto v.

On the one hand, Wilson's claims sounds in contract since he is essentially trying to recover for numerous transactions that he now argues were illegal. On the other hand, Wilson's claims also rest on the design of High 5's app as a whole, since he can only succeed if this novel form of online gaming constitutes \"gambling\" under Washington law. In this way, Wilson's suit resembles a product liability action in which High 5 allegedly designed a dangerous product that allows people to gamble online.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, the essence of Wilson's claim is that High 5 entered into a series of contracts with consumers that should be rescinded on the basis of illegality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   High 5 cites a number of older cases stating that the penalties imposed by anti-gambling laws do not derive from contractual obligations, but these same cases also acknowledge, as they must, that such laws were created to make gambling contracts void for illegality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mozorosky v.

Illegality is often an affirmative defense through which a defendant can escape the enforcement of a contract, since courts will not aid parties who have agreed to illegal terms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Entm't Publications, Inc. v.

Mass. 1999). Here, of course, illegality is being asserted under the auspices of a statute as a means of recovering money otherwise lost in an exchange.

First, High 5 argues that the use of the term \"without charge\" in RCW 9.46.0285 means that the \"previously referenced 'entertainment' or 'game' is not free to experience or play.\" Dkt. # 22, at 20. Thus, because High 5's app can be downloaded for free and never requires players to bet their own money, the statutory language cannot apply. However, High 5's construction is far from the only reasonable one. While it is true that players never directly bet their own money in High 5's games, the games can only be played with virtual coins, which do cost money once a player runs out of them. The plain meaning of \"without charge\" is that the \"credits\" or, in this case, virtual coins allow a user to continue playing the game without direct payment. This is exactly what the Ninth Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   , and there is no reason to depart from that holding here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516483\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/784/#p785\">\n    886 F.3d at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, High 5 argues that the facts of this case are materially different from\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   because High 5's apps give out additional free allotments of coins after players initially download the game. The appellee in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   also raised this argument, but the court declined to address it because the complaint did not allege sufficient facts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516483\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/784/#p785\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, High 5 urges the Court to go beyond the Complaint and consider High 5's publicly-available website and the declaration of its Vice President of Integrated Marketing, which describe how High 5's games distribute free coins to users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   These documents may only be considered if they fall within the exceptions to the \"general rule [that] 'a district court may not consider any material beyond the pleadings in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Even if they are generally accurate, the statements on High 5's website may leave out key information, such as how many coins are actually awarded, how much gameplay they allow, and how these free coin allotments may fluctuate based on different factors. Consequently, the Court will not take judicial notice of the FAQ page's factual assertions. For similar reasons, the Court will not consider the Declaration of Patrick Benson to supplement the allegations in the Complaint. Dkt. # 23, at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   High 5 argues that the Court should consider its supplemental evidence because the allegations in Wilson's Complaint are false. But High 5's issues with the Complaint boil down to interpretive differences. In paragraph 25, the Complaint states, \"Once a player runs out of their allotment of free chips, they cannot continue to play the game without buying more chips for real money.\" Dkt. # 1, at 7. Contrary to High 5's contention, this statement does not necessarily imply that players cannot obtain more free coins at some point after running out of the initial allotment. Instead, it merely asserts that players must buy more coins\n   <em>\n    at the moment\n   </em>\n   they run out of their free allotment if no additional free awards are available. The fact that most players opt to wait until they receive more free chips rather than pay is neither here nor there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply, Dkt. # 53, at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    c. Whether High 5's Games are \"Bona Fide Business Transactions\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   High 5 also argues that its games are exempt from the statutory prohibition on gambling because they fall within the \"bona fide business transaction\" exception. This exception reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Gambling does not include fishing derbies as defined by this chapter, parimutuel betting and handicapping contests as authorized by chapter 67.16, bona fide business transactions valid under the law of contracts, including, but not limited to, contracts for the purchase or sale at a future date of securities or commodities, and agreements to compensate for loss caused by the happening of chance, including, but not limited to, contracts of indemnity or guarantee and life, health, or accident insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   RCW 9.46.0237. According to High 5, its games involve \"bona fide business transactions\" because players merely pay for the privilege of entertainment. The fact that players do not know how much entertainment they will receive does not make their games any different from buying tickets to a boxing match, which could last only a few rounds or many.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Wilson responds that \u00a7 9.46.0237 contains a non-exhaustive list after \"bona fide business transactions valid under the law of contracts\" that identifies the purchase of securities and insurance as two examples. Wilson contends that, applying Washington principles of statutory interpretation, the exception should be limited to transactions similar to insurance and securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   When construing a state statute, a federal court must apply that state's principles of statutory interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc. v.

To determine what constitutes a \"similar\" item, courts look to the \"clearly stated legislative intent\" behind the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20740\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20740\">\n    at 741-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Here, the list clearly contemplates excluding purchases of securities or other investments and insurance. Buying virtual coins is not \"similar in nature\" to either of these transactions because the buyer is not protecting themselves against a fortuitous risk or obtaining a stake in a company. High 5 argues that it is similar to buying a ticket to a sports event, which is obviously legal, but that does not mean that transactions of this nature are the object of this particular exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   High 5 argues that \"bona fide business transactions valid under the law of contracts\" is a broad category that unambiguously includes the sale of credits used for amusement games. In support of this, High 5 points to RCW 9.46.010, which states that the Washington Gambling Act seeks to \"avoid restricting participation by individuals in activities and social pastimes.\" However, the rest of this sentence limits the types of social pastimes to those that are \"more for amusement rather than for profit, do not maliciously affect the public, and do not breach the peace.\" RCW 9.46.010. While the wording is ambiguous regarding\n   <em>\n    whose\n   </em>\n   profit is at issue, High 5 certainly profits from its games and Wilson would argue that they have a malicious effect on the public. The legislative intent therefore does not support High 5's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In any case, High 5 misconstrues the nature of the \"transaction\" at issue in this case. Whereas traditional gambling consists of a single transaction (money for a chance to win), High 5's apps divvy up this process between two connected transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although the first transaction allows a user to obtain the virtual coins, the second transaction of spending them in High 5's games is what fits the statutory definition of gambling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 9.46.0237 (defining gambling as \"staking or risking something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under the person's control or influence\"). Consequently, regardless of whether purchasing coins from High 5 is similar to buying securities or tickets to a baseball game, buying coins and then using them to play High 5's games is not a \"bona fide business transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20740\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    d. Whether High 5's Apps Facilitate \"Illegal Gambling\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   High 5 essentially argues that the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of RCW 9.46.285 and 4.24.070 cannot be correct because it is contrary to RCW 9.46.010's statement of the legislature's intent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516483\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/784/#p785\">\n    886 F.3d at 787, 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, as previously stated, RCW 9.46.010 is not necessarily in tension with categorizing High 5's games as \"illegal gambling\" because they allow High 5 to profit and may have a malicious effect on those predisposed to gambling addiction. Furthermore, this Court will not contradict the Ninth Circuit's clearly stated interpretation in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   on the basis of an ambiguous statement of legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, High 5 argues that the Court should disregard the Ninth Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   as contrary the Washington Gambling Commission's statements regarding \"social gaming.\" To support its position, High 5 asks the Court to take judicial notice of a pamphlet released by the Commission in 2014, a PowerPoint presentation, minutes from a public meeting, and a recent statement by the Commissioner regarding the Ninth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   . Dkt. # 26-1, 26-2, 26-10, 26-11, &amp; 26-12. These are public records that the Court can properly take judicial notice of.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   However, they do not support the conclusions that High 5 hopes for. While the pamphlet offered by High 5 does state that social gaming is not gambling if there is no prize, it also purports to provide only \"general guidance\" to consumers. Dkt. # 26-12. The Ninth Circuit already declined to defer to this pamphlet or the meeting minutes because they did not express a \"formal position\" of the Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516483\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/784/#p785\">\n    886 F.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court will not act differently here. Likewise, the Commissioner's statement regarding the Ninth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   ruling merely asserts that the Commission did not participate in the case and it may be appealed. It does not express any specific position with respect to the underlying issues.

Cal. May 13, 2013) ;\n    <em>\n     TRC Tire Sales, LLC v. Extreme Tire &amp; Serv., Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. CV-08-015-FVS,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203200727\">\n     2008 WL 3200727\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (E.D.

Cal. 2007). However, as one district court observed, a court may also apply both standards \"in order to avoid any doubt about the propriety of jurisdiction.\"\n    <em>\n     Oakley, Inc. v. Donofrio\n    </em>\n    , No. SACV1202191CJCRNBX,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012126017\">\n     2013 WL 12126017\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (C.D. Cal. June 14, 2013).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Some courts have foregone such notice where the motion to dismiss alternatively requests conversion to summary judgment and both parties rely on the same documentary evidence.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Silk v.
