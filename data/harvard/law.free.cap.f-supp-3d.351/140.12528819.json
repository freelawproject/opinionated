That subpoena arose from a civil action that began nine years ago and is currently pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

In that civil action, Respondents alleged that the PBGC violated Title IV of ERISA and the United States Constitution when it was forced to wrongfully terminate Respondents' pension. Respondents' theory of the\n   case is that the \"termination occurred as the result of politics, with Treasury having impermissibly pressured the PBGC to acquiesce in the Plan's termination as part of Treasury's political goals in restructuring the auto industry in general, and GM in particular.\" Renewed Mot.

This invocation stands on different ground than the invocations made in other presidential communications privileges cases which were expressly made either by a President, past or current, or made on behalf of the President, rather than one made on behalf of the Office of the President generally.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   744-46 n.16 (noting former White House Counsel's affidavit stated he was specifically directed by the President to invoke the privilege).

To that end, the Court allowed the parties to engage in discovery related to the substantive component of Count Four--whether the PBGC had met the statutory requirements for termination under Section 1342(a). Accordingly, discovery is limited to whether the PBGC terminated the plan because it had \"not met the minimum funding standard,\" was \"unable to pay benefits when due,\" or \"the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As stated above, Respondents' theory of the case is that the termination of the pension plan \"occurred as the result of politics, with Treasury having impermissibly pressured the PBGC to acquiesce in the Plan's termination as part of Treasury's political goals in restructuring the auto industry in general, and GM in particular.\" Renewed Mot. Compel, ECF No. 70 at 10. Therefore, the issues the Respondents expect to be central at trial include whether GM could have reassumed the Salaried Plan thereby continuing the pension plan and avoiding termination, and whether Treasury influenced the PBGC to terminate the plan despite its viability through GM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    at 27-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Respondents' discovery request can be grouped into three categories: (1) Draft memoranda from staffers to Dr. Lawrence Summers, the Director of the National Economic Council, Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and co-chair of the Auto Task Force; (2) electronic mail conversations among Auto Team members concerning advice provided to President Obama; and (3) personal requests for information by President Obama along with Treasury emails and a memorandum in response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The first group of documents, \"[d]raft memoranda from staffers to Dr. Lawrence Summers\" providing updates regarding GM and Delphi, comprise the majority (53 of 61) of the withheld documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   These documents are iterations of 13 memoranda from Autoteam staffers to Dr. Summers written between the months of February and August 2009.

These memoranda cover Treasury's views on several topics that are relevant to Respondents' theory of the case. Furthermore, Respondents' discovery efforts have revealed that at the time the salary plan was terminated it was a \"relatively well-funded plan.\" Renewed Mot., ECF No. 70 at 25 (citing Watson Wyatt Actuarial Certification, ECF No. 19-5 at 2). Respondents have also discovered the fact that, prior to Treasury's proactive involvement, the PBGC was advocating for a circumstance under which the pension plan remained in effect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D. Cann. Dep. Tr., ECF No. 11-6, 67:6-14 (stating PBGC was \"cheerleading\" for the transfer of the plan). A critical issue in the Michigan action will be the reason for the sudden change in strategy. The documents in the first group which relate to Treasury's\n   interactions with the PBGC and its impressions about \"Delphi and its pensions liabilities\" as well as Treasury's \"impressions ... on GM and Chrysler restructuring plans,\" ECF No. 70 at 29, are documents that go to the heart of that issue and are clearly relevant to Respondents' claim of undue influence by Treasury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The second group consists of four documents which are a series of email chains from March 28, 2009 to May 28, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The emails relate to discussions between the Auto Team and Dr. Summers about GM and Delphi (No. 621); a presidential announcement regarding GM's restructuring (Nos. 610 and 776); and emails relating to the disparity between GM and Toyota's labor rates (No. 358). The Court holds that document numbers 610, 621 and 776 in this group likely contain important evidence. Although not dispositive, the timing of the documents is important: They were created at a time during which there was a mediation with important parties including the PBGC, Delphi, and GM relating to the bankruptcy proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   House Dep. Tr., ECF No. 11-8, at 143:9-22. Critically, these documents relate to GM's restructuring and there is no question that the resolution of the pension fund was a significant issue related to GM's restructuring through the bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Document number 358, however, relates to \"the cost gap between GM and Toyota labor rates;\" and there is no indication, other than the timing of these emails, that the evidence is related to a central issue at trial. Respondents argue that the timing of these emails, May 26 through 28, is sufficient. Under that logic, however, Respondents would be entitled to any email written by the Auto Team or Treasury around that time period regardless of the email's relevance to the issues in this case. The issues regarding \"the cost gap between GM and Toyota labor rates\" without some connection to GM's restructuring or the pension fund, is the sort of \"tangentially relevant\" request for documents that the D.C. Circuit has instructed will not meet the important evidence prong of the needs test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating \"tangentially relevant\" documents or evidence that \"would relate to side issues\" would not satisfy the need requirement). Accordingly, the Court finds that only document numbers 610, 621 and 776 in this group are likely to contain important evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The third group consists of five documents that are related to a draft letter from President Obama containing a request to Dr. Summers regarding the Delphi Salaried plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The documents at issue in this group likely relate to a \"Draft memorandum regarding [the PBGC's] decision to take over the salaried and hourly pension plans of Delphi.\" Treas. Original Privilege Log, ECF No. 35-5 at 140. These documents relate to the decisions about the salaried pension fund that are significant\n   to the claims in the civil action. The Court finds that all the documents in this category meet the important evidence component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In short, with the exception of document number 358, the email string relating to automotive labor rates, the Court finds the evidence sought in the three categories are \"directly relevant to issues that are expected to be central to the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Availability of the evidence elsewhere\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Under the second component of the need inquiry a party challenging the claim of privilege must demonstrate \"that [the] evidence is not available with due diligence elsewhere.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Renewed Mot., ECF No. 70 at 39-42. Respondents point out the fact that they have conducted discovery from all other key parties in this case and have not received information that speaks to the issues related to the subjects in their discovery request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. Respondents also note that the PBGC interacted with Treasury almost exclusively through Joe House, the Director of the Department of Insurance Supervision and Compliance at the PBGC, and Matthew Feldman, a member of the Auto Team at Treasury. And that Mr. House failed to recall anything of significance related to Treasury's involvement with the PBGC during his deposition in the civil action. Renewed Mot., ECF No. 70, at 39-40 (citing ECF No. 11 at 19-20 and n.10 (noting approximately 60 instances in Mr. House's deposition transcript where he states his inability to recall events related to Delphi's plans) ). Last, Respondents argue that information related to Treasury's Auto Team's determination that GM could not reassume the pension plans, an issue of critical importance to its claims, is uniquely in the possession of Treasury. Renewed Mot., ECF No. 70 at 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Treasury's lone response is that Respondents have scheduled a deposition of Mr. Feldman, a member of the Auto Team, and can question him about Treasury's influence into PBGC's pension negotiations. Treas. Opp'n, ECF No. 74 at 8-9. Therefore, Treasury argues, the information is available from another source. But, as Respondents point out, a deposition almost a decade after the events that give rise to the claims in this case is not equivalent to documentary evidence prepared at the time of the controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dellums\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3529232,882605\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/561/242/\">\n    561 F.2d at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (affirming district court ruling which noted that a deposition is \"far more inferior to the actual contemporaneous\" documentary evidence related to the allegations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court concludes that Respondents have met their burden in showing that the evidence they seek is \"not available with due diligence elsewhere.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Respondents have had considerable difficulties obtaining information related to Treasury's interactions with the PBGC vis-\u00e0-vis the termination decision. Deposition attempts have failed to uncover this sort\n   of evidence because the person who would have this information, Mr. House, simply cannot remember. Respondents have run into similar roadblocks in their attempts to obtain this sort of information from the other key players in this case because these parties do not have the information Respondents seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Respondents have made a showing of substantial need for overcoming the general claim of privilege asserted by Treasury. The D.C. Circuit has explained that upon a sufficient showing of need the Court is to review\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   the subpoenaed documents to \"identify and release specific items of evidence that might reasonably be relevant to\" the claims at issue in the case.\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, this Court will order the following documents to be filed for in camera review: 67, 72, 84, 94, 275, 560, 593, 596, 599, 601, 603, 605, 610, 611, 621, 623, 627, 629, 631, 633, 638, 668, 670, 672, 674, 676, 692, 758, 759, 760,761, 762, 763, 764, 765, 766, 767, 770, 776, 777, 849, 856, 859, 860, 863, 944, 948, 950, 956, 1006, 1089, 1091, 1094, 1152, 1166, 1168, 1217, 1219, 1221, and 1223. Treasury should provide a justification sheet for each document explaining why the document does not contain evidence that may be reasonably relevant to the claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This case calls upon the Court to \"strike a balance between the twin values of transparency and accountability of the executive branch on the one hand, and on the other hand, protection of ... the President's ability to obtain candid, informed advice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.
