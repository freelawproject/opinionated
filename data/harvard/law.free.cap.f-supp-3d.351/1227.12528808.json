Ryu, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a wrongful death action arising out of the death of Neil Lewis who was killed during an incident on July 7, 2015. Plaintiff Tiffany Hodges is the guardian ad litem to Lewis's minor children and sole heirs, D. Lewis and J. Lewis. Plaintiffs Karen Joyce Lewis and Alfredo Lewis are Lewis's parents. Plaintiffs filed this survival and wrongful death action against Defendants The Hertz Corporation (\"Hertz\"), Firefly Rent A Car LLC (\"Firefly\"), Rental\n   Car Transport, LLC (\"RCT\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   DTG Operations, Inc. (\"DTG\") and Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. (\"Dollar Thrifty\") (collectively \"Defendants\"). Defendants now move for summary judgment, or in the alternative, for partial summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims. [Docket No. 61.] The court heard oral argument on September 13, 2018. Having considered the parties' oral argument and written submissions, the court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants object to the entirety of Plaintiffs' expert evidence, namely the Declaration of Lloyd D. Rae (Docket No. 73-1); the Expert Report of Kathleen Bonczyk, Esq. (Ex. 12); the Report of Aviation Security Expert Jeffrey C. Price, MA, CM (Ex. 32); and the Report of Premises Liability Expert Ron Martinelli, Ph.D., CLS (Ex. 36). Defendants also object to Exhibits 1, 2, 3-9, and 11-36 attached to the Declaration of Joseph P. Brent (\"Brent Decl.\"). Plaintiffs filed an administrative motion for leave to file the Supplemental Brent Declaration, which addresses Defendants' objections to all but Exhibit 17 and attempts to cure the evidentiary deficiencies identified by Defendants. [Docket No. 82.] Exhibit 17 is addressed in Plaintiffs' Objections to New Evidence (Docket No. 79), which is discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Expert Declarations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since the court did not consider Plaintiffs' expert declarations in determining whether summary judgment is proper, Defendants' objections are denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exhibits 1, 3-9, 11, 13-31, 33-35\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants object to Exhibits 1, 3-9, 11, 13-31, and 33-35 primarily on the grounds that they are not authenticated. Defendants also object on the basis of hearsay and lack of personal knowledge, but fail to make any arguments to support those objections. The court will therefore ignore the hearsay and personal knowledge objections for purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The authenticity objections are overruled. Defendants argue that, even though the exhibits are attached to and described in the Brent Declaration, there is no \"evidence\" to substantiate \"what any of the attached documents are or who any of the people are.\" Defs.' Reply at 1:20-22. However, it is clear from the description of each exhibit, and the exhibit themselves, that the documents are what they purport to be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(4) (a document's \"appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the circumstances\" is evidence sufficient to satisfy the authentication requirement). Additionally, many of these exhibits are Hertz's own documents and witness deposition testimony, and are also attached as exhibits to Defendants' request for judicial notice, so Defendants' objections are not well-taken.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. 1, 8-9, 13-15, 18, 30, and 31. The court notes that Defendants' complaint about Plaintiffs' alleged failure to proffer evidence to authenticate these exhibits is also perplexing given that Defendants offered no evidence to authenticate many of their own exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Orr v.

This is incorrect.

Accordingly, district courts in this circuit have routinely overruled authentication and hearsay challenges at the summary stage where the evidence could be presented in an admissible form at trial, following\n   <em>\n    Fraser.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v.

The juvenile dependency court released these records pursuant a protective order which specified that the records could only be used in Williams's murder case, and permitted no other disclosure or use. Defs.' Reply at 5:6-22; Ex. 17 (Protective Order). Plaintiffs explain that they obtained Williams's juvenile record from the appellate record in his state court appeal from his murder conviction. Plt.'s Opp'n at 7:27-8:1; Plt.'s Objects. to New Evidence at 2:24-3:19 [Docket No. 79.] According to Plaintiffs, since the appellate record is open and available to the public, Williams's juvenile record may be used in other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument contravenes California law. California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code Section 827(a)(4) provides that \"[a] juvenile case file, any portion thereof, and information relating to the content of the juvenile case file, may not be disseminated by the receiving agencies to any persons or agencies, other than those persons or agencies authorized to receive documents pursuant to this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20827\">\n    Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code \u00a7 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). Additionally, \"a juvenile case file, any portion thereof, and information relating to the content of the juvenile case file, may not be made as an attachment to any other documents without the prior approval of the presiding judge of the juvenile court, unless it is used in connection with and in the course of a criminal investigation or a proceeding brought to declare a person a dependent child or ward of the juvenile court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20827\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs did not obtain prior approval of the presiding judge of the juvenile court. The fact that Defendants directed Plaintiffs\n   to Williams's trial and appellate record for copies of his criminal history does not overcome the specific statutory requirement that Plaintiffs obtain a prior court order to use his juvenile records for a use not specified in the protective order. Plaintiffs cite to no case, nor could this court locate any, in which a court found that a court order authorizing the attachment of the juvenile records in an unrelated case was not necessary. Defendants' objection to Exhibit 17 is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In sum, the court overrules Defendants' objections as to Exhibits 1, 3-9, 11, 13-31, and 33-35. The court sustains the objection to Exhibit 17. Plaintiffs' administrative motion for leave to file the supplemental declaration is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This wrongful death action arises out of a July 7, 2015 incident involving RCT employees Neil Lewis and Rodney Williams that occurred near a Hertz rental car facility at San Francisco International Airport (\"SFO\") and resulted in Lewis's death. RCT is in the business of providing \"hikers\" to rental car companies such as Hertz. Hikers transport rental cars to and from rental car facilities and the airport. Williams and Lewis were RCT hikers who transported Hertz rental vehicles between Hertz's rental facility and SFO. On the day of the incident, Williams and Lewis each drove Hertz vehicles to an area near the Hertz rental car facility at SFO and engaged in a physical altercation. During the fight, Williams fatally stabbed Lewis. Williams subsequently was convicted of second degree murder for Lewis's death. Plaintiffs seek to hold Defendants liable for Lewis's death. They assert various theories of negligence, including Defendants' failure to require RCT to adhere to reasonable hiring practices such as conducting pre-employment criminal background checks, and failure to adequately supervise and control RCT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Hertz's Corporate Structure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Hertz, DTG, Dollar Thrifty and Firefly are rental car companies that own and operate their own rental car brands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   2012, Hertz acquired DTG and Dollar Thrifty; as a result, Hertz owns the Dollar and Thrifty rental car brands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hertz owns and operates the Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty brands under one corporate structure, allegedly in addition to the Firefly brand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, contractors who perform work for one brand can bill the work to another brand because it makes no functional difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Hertz's Operations at SFO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Hertz operates the Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty on-site rental car facilities at SFO pursuant to lease agreements with the City and County of San Francisco.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lease Agreement for Rental Car Operations by and between The Hertz Corporation, as tenant, and City and County of San Francisco Acting By and Through Its Airport Commission, as landlord (Ex. 1) to Brent Decl.

Contractors such as RCT are tenant entities for the purposes of the SFO Lease Agreements and are\n   therefore required to comply with all applicable laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Hertz's Contracts with Hiker Companies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   During the relevant time period, Hertz hired three companies to provide hikers for its SFO rental car facility: RCT, FleetLogix (July 1, 2014 - April 2016), and EDS Facility Services, Ltd. (\"EDS\") (November 9, 2016 to the present). FleetLogix and EDS signed a Master Service Agreement (\"MSA\") with Hertz, but RCT did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FleetLogix MSA (Ex. 11) to Brent Decl. (under seal); EDS MSA (Ex. 28) to Brent Decl. (under seal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Pursuant to the MSAs, FleetLogix and EDS, who are \"Suppliers,\" agreed to provide \"Transporters/Service Agent services to the Hertz location\" at SFO, and to \"provide the Services using Supplier Employees who met \"each of the Hertz requirements as set forth herein or as may be requested from time to time.\" FleetLogix MSA, Ex.

Hertz's Relationship with RCT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Hertz's relationship with RCT began as a continuation of RCT's preexisting relationship with DTG. Prior to Hertz's acquisition of DTG and Dollar Thrifty, RCT provided hikers to DTG at its San Diego and SFO rental car facilities. Following the acquisition, DTG's supervisors communicated to Hertz's corporate management that RCT had a good reputation and history with DTG. Harvey, Hertz's Vice President, had a conversation with DTG's supervisors regarding RCT's performance to determine whether Hertz should continue DTG's relationship with RCT. DTG's supervisors told Harvey that RCT performed just fine. Based on these assurances, Hertz continued DTG's relationship with RCT and did not enter into a new agreement with RCT. Although it is not clear whether anyone reviewed RCT's contract with DTG on Hertz' behalf, Harvey testified that he personally did not review the contract because RCT was already a vendor for DTG, which was a reputable company. It is not clear whether Hertz inquired into whether DTG imposed requirements on vendors similar to those imposed by Hertz, including a pre-employment criminal background check. However, Harvey testified that he assumed that DTG had similar requirements including a pre-employment criminal background check, and did not further investigate because he did not feel it was necessary given that DTG was a reputable company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The parties dispute whether and to what degree Hertz was involved in RCT's operations, namely hiring, firing, and how RCT employees performed their job for Hertz.

The July 7, 2015 Incident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The July 7, 2015 incident stems from rising tensions between Lewis and Williams over Lewis's contact with Williams's girlfriend. According to the trial testimony of Lewis's co-workers and friends at Williams's murder trial, prior to July 7, Lewis complained that he had been receiving threats from a male co-worker (later identified as Williams), who believed that Lewis was texting his girlfriend.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Testimony of Melvin Boyd, K.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on all claims. First, they argue that they are not vicariously liable for the actions of RCT and its employee Williams as a matter of law. Next, Defendants argue that they are not liable for the actions of RCT and Williams on a theory of direct negligence because they did not owe any legal duty to Lewis. Plaintiffs contend that there are genuine disputes of material facts as to whether Defendants are vicariously liable for the actions and/or inactions of RCT and its employee Williams. They also argue that Defendants owed a duty to Lewis to use due care, and there are triable disputes regarding foreseeability and causation that preclude summary judgment on the direct negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hertz's Vicarious Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants argue that they have no vicarious liability for the acts of Williams, who was an RCT employee. Their arguments build from the premise that a hirer (Hertz) of an independent contractor (RCT) is not generally liable for the actions of the independent contractor under California law. Defendants concede that there are a number of exceptions to the \"no hirer liability\" rule, but assert that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they meet any of the six exceptions that they anticipate Plaintiffs will raise. For their part, Plaintiffs concede that RCT is an independent contractor and that Defendants generally are not liable for the actions of independent contractors such as RCT. Instead, they argue that there are genuine disputes of material fact as to three exceptions to the no-hirer liability rule: the exception outlined in\n   <em>\n    Hooker v.

According to Leslie Smith, who worked for RCT from 2012 to 2016 and was a leader driver and manager, Hertz instructed RCT to fire an RCT employee who was involved in a three-car collision with two other Hertz vehicles. Such conflicts and nuances in the evidence must be evaluated by the finder of fact at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   There are also triable disputes as to whether Hertz controlled the manner in which RCT hikers performed their work for Hertz. For example, Defendants contend that Hertz was not otherwise involved in the daily operations of RCT, and cite as examples the fact that Hertz was not involved in the scheduling of specific RCT drivers for the hours they needed, and Hertz did not communicate with RCT employees. However, Smith testified that she and Lewis and Williams did \"whatever Hertz told [them] to do.\" Smith Depo. (Ex. 25) to Brent Decl. at 56:17-21; Smith Decl. \u00b6 4. Smith testified that she and other lead drivers received direction on what to do with the rental vehicles at SFO from Hertz or DTG dispatchers and managers, and that she would then tell other RCT employees including Lewis and Williams what their jobs were for the day. She also testified that if Hertz needed RCT employees to perform a task, it could ask for a specific employee by name. On occasion, a Hertz dispatcher asked an RCT employee named Ratish to take customers to the airport, because Ratish was known as a peaceful and kind person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   There are also triable disputes as to whether Hertz required RCT hikers to perform their work in a safe manner. Such disputes could form the basis for a reasonable jury to infer that Defendants retained control over the safety conditions of the job. Hertz's Rule 30(b)(6) deponent testified that Hertz expected contractors such as RCT to follow Hertz's safety precautions including its lot rules, as well as rules relating to the speed limit, seat belts, parking in certain locations, driving in certain traffic patterns, and leaving keys at a certain place or in the car. Smith testified that Hertz and DTG controlled how she and other RCT employees, including Lewis and Williams, performed their work in many ways, including how to drive their vehicles. Smith testified that Hertz's instructions to RCT employees included how fast they could drive Hertz vehicles, where they could drive Hertz vehicles, the routes they could take inside SFO with Hertz vehicles, the places where they could park Hertz vehicles, the places they could wash Hertz vehicles, the stalls in which they had to park Hertz vehicles, which Hertz vehicles should be washed, when the headlights had to be turned on in Hertz vehicles, when to set the parking brake, when RCT employees could listen to the radio in\n   Hertz vehicles, what settings to leave the air condition/heat fan on, when RCT employees had to wear seat belts, where to smoke cigarettes (RCT employees were not permitted to smoke cigarettes in Hertz vehicles), and how and when to clean the interior of Hertz vehicles. She also testified that Hertz instructed RCT on proper attire for its employees driving Hertz vehicles; specifically, RCT employees could not wear shorts and men could not wear baggy pants or hats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, there are triable disputes on the question of whether Defendants retained control over safety conditions for RCT hikers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Affirmative Contribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendants next argue that even if Hertz retained control over RCT safety conditions, there is no evidence that Hertz retained control in a manner that affirmatively contributed to Lewis's death. Defendants assert that Williams's murder of Lewis was an independent act that was completely unrelated to the control that Defendants exercised over RCT's work. Plaintiffs counter that Defendants affirmatively contributed to Lewis's death by failing to implement specific safety measures on RCT, including pre-employment criminal background checks, even though Defendants implemented such procedures on its two other hiker contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Under California law, \"the failure to institute specific safety measures is not actionable unless there is some evidence that the hirer or the contractor had agreed to implement these measures.\"\n   <em>\n    Tverberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4245841\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/202/1439/#p1446\">\n    202 Cal.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Tverberg\n   </em>\n   held that a reasonable jury could find that the contractor's failure to cover the bollard holes in the absence of the available equipment constituted a negligent omission of an implicit duty or responsibility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20521\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In this case, there is a triable dispute as to whether Hertz implicitly agreed or promised to undertake a specific safety measure, namely requiring all contractors including RCT to perform pre-employment criminal background checks on its employees. The record shows that Hertz had a business practice of requiring contractors such as RCT to sign an MSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FleetLogix MSA (Ex. 11) to Brent Decl. (under seal); EDS MSA (Ex. 28) to Brent Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (under seal). Pursuant to the MSAs, the contractors each agreed to \"provide the Services using Supplier Employees who met \"each of the Hertz requirements as set forth herein or as may be requested from time to time.\" FleetLogix MSA, Ex. A, \u00b6 8 at HERTZ 00709; EDS MSA, Ex. A, \u00b6 8 at HERTZ 00757. Such Hertz requirements include \"passing a pre-employment criminal record check.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20521\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The contractors were also required to \"warrant and covenant that it [had] in place appropriate procedures for conducting background checks\" and \"other reasonable screening of Supplier Employees who [were] to perform the Services.\" FleetLogix MSA, \u00a7 4.12; EDS MSA, \u00a7 4.12. The record also shows that Hertz did not investigate whether RCT required pre-employment criminal background checks because it assumed that it did, based on RCT's prior relationship with DTG. Given that Hertz had a specific safety policy that required its contractors to sign MSAs which mandated that contractor employees had to pass pre-employment criminal background checks, a reasonable jury could infer that Hertz implicitly agreed to impose that policy on RCT. Similar to the contractor's implicit promise to cover the bollard holes in\n   <em>\n    Tverberg\n   </em>\n   , a jury could infer that Hertz implicitly promised that it would enforce a pre-employment criminal background check requirement on RCT. Hertz's negligent omission in failing to ensure that RCT imposed a criminal background check requirement permitted RCT to hire Williams, who had a significant criminal history. Thus, a reasonable jury could conclude that Hertz's negligent omission affirmatively contributed to Lewis's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

The language of section 411 also makes clear that the negligent hiring exception to the \"no hirer liability\" rule is about the hirer's negligence in hiring a contractor, not a particular employee of a contractor. Here, Plaintiffs do not argue that Hertz negligently hired its contractor, RCT. Although Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs could not succeed on a negligent hiring theory under\n   <em>\n    Camargo\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs have presented triable disputes that Hertz is liable under the retained control exception to the \"no hirer liability\" rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In sum, the court finds that there are triable disputes as to whether Defendants are vicariously liable to Plaintiffs on the theory that Hertz negligently exercised its retained control through negligent omission to impose a safety rule on RCT that it imposed on its other hiker contractors. The court therefore denies summary judgment on this basis. As the case may proceed to trial due to the existence of material disputed facts regarding application of the\n   <em>\n    Hooker\n   </em>\n   exception, the court declines to rule on the two other exceptions to the \"no hirer liability\" rule proffered by Plaintiffs (i.e., non-delegable duties based on contractual relationship and public authority/franchise).\n   <strong>\n    The court expresses serious doubt that either of the two remaining exceptions apply here.

Plaintiffs disagree, contending that Defendants owed a duty to Lewis to use due care based on Hertz's own business practices, and the special relationship between Defendants and Lewis created by the SFO Lease Agreements.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Defendants owed a duty to Lewis on two bases: 1) as a third-party beneficiary to the SFO Lease Agreements; and 2) by failing to enforce their own standard business practices on RCT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the SFO Lease Agreement created a special relationship between Hertz and Lewis because Sections 3.09 and 3.14 intended to benefit Lewis. Under these sections, Hertz agreed that it and its contractors such as RCT would comply with all laws including a number of workplace safety laws, and that it would not conduct business that interfered with airport safety. Hertz SFO Lease Agreement, \u00a7\u00a7 3.09, 3.14. Plaintiffs contend that Lewis would have clearly benefitted from Defendants' obligation to ensure that RCT complied with all workplace safety laws, including complying with Hertz's own standard business practice to require contractors to perform pre-employment criminal background checks as part of the hiring process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiffs' arguments fail. With respect to their theory that Lewis is a third-party beneficiary to the SFO Lease Agreements,\n   Plaintiffs present no evidence that the SFO Lease Agreements were intended to benefit the employees of contractors to the lease holder. In fact, the SFO Lease Agreements specifically and unambiguously state that there \"are no third-party beneficiaries to this Lease.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Hertz SFO Lease Agreement, \u00a7 19.8. Given the agreement's explicit disclaimer of any third-party beneficiaries, the court finds that Plaintiffs' interpretation of the SFO Lease Agreements is untenable and cannot be the basis for a duty under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that Defendants \"created a risk of harm\" to Lewis by negligently failing to enforce their standard business practices on RCT, specifically the requirement to conduct pre-employment criminal background checks as part of the hiring process. Plaintiffs point to evidence that Hertz had an established business practice of requiring its other hiker contractors to perform pre-employment criminal background checks in the hiring process, but that it negligently failed to enforce that requirement on RCT. Plaintiffs contend that Hertz's decision not to require such background checks allowed RCT to hire Williams, which resulted in the death of Lewis. As discussed above, the court can only find that Defendants owed a duty of care to Lewis by applying the\n   <em>\n    Rowland\n   </em>\n   factors and determining at a generalized (rather than fact-specific) level that imposing such a duty is justified by clear considerations of policy. Here, Plaintiffs make no effort to apply the\n   <em>\n    Rowland\n   </em>\n   factors, and the court is not required to guess at what their arguments might be. Plaintiffs' argument fails on that basis alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Instead of addressing the\n   <em>\n    Rowland\n   </em>\n   factors, Plaintiffs rely on general language regarding duty in\n   <em>\n    Seo v. All-Makes Overhead Doors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1066685\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/97/1193/#p1202\">\n    97 Cal.

Plaintiffs cite no case where a court concluded that a duty existed under circumstances similar to those presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Therefore, the court finds that Plaintiffs have not established that Defendants owed a duty to Lewis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the court has concluded that a duty does not exist, it need not consider the remaining elements of negligence, foreseeability and causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In sum, the court grants summary judgment in favor of Defendants as to the direct negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Objections to Defendants' Reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In their reply, Defendants responded to the arguments in Plaintiffs' opposition, and attached additional evidence that was not included in the moving papers.

Although styled as an \"Objection to New Evidence,\" Plaintiffs' filing amounts to an unauthorized sur-opposition in disguise. It contains no objections to the new evidence.
