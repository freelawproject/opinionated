INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner Aarno Liuksila is wanted for prosecution in Finland for making false statements during an official government proceeding. He petitions this court for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that Finland's extradition request does not satisfy two conditions under the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Finland. First, he asserts that the principle of dual criminality is not satisfied, because the crime with which he is charged in Finland is not a crime under any federal or state law in the United States. Second, he maintains that the five-year statute of limitations to prosecute him for a comparable offense in the United States has run, and so too has the Finnish ten-year limitations period. A magistrate judge of this District Court found neither of these arguments compelling and ordered Petitioner's extradition. Petitioner now turns to this court for habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the court denies the writ. Petitioner has failed to establish that the conduct at issue in Finland would not be unlawful if comparable conduct occurred in the United States. Likewise, he has not carried his burden to show that the statute of limitations has expired either in the United States or in Finland. Petitioner therefore cannot avoid extradition-at least before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court's conclusion comes with a major asterisk, however. When deciding whether the five-year limitations period under U.S. law has expired, the court cannot simply add five years from the date of the alleged offense and compare it against the date on which Finland initiated charges. Rather, it must apply U.S. federal law as written and as judicially interpreted, including for purposes of tolling. The U.S. Code provides that \"[n]o statute of limitations shall extend to any person fleeing from justice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203290\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A nearly 80-year old case from the D.C. Circuit,\n   <em>\n    McGowen v. United States\n   </em>\n   , interprets section 3290's text to mean that the limitations period tolls upon a person's physical departure from the prosecuting jurisdiction, regardless of whether the person intends to evade justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1056314\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/105/791/#p792\">\n    105 F.2d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 792 (D.C. Cir. 1939). Under this reading, known as the \"mere absence\" rule, if a person leaves the prosecuting jurisdiction, even when no prosecution is pending or the person has no reason to believe one is imminent, the limitations period automatically stops running. All that matters is the person departed; the reason why is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The unfairness\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   creates in this case is apparent. Petitioner left Finland within five years of the offense conduct, at a time when there was no prosecution pending nor was one imminent. But no matter. The moment Petitioner left Finland for the United States the\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   limitations period for extradition purposes tolled and never restarted because\n   Petitioner never went back to Finland. So, the fact that Finnish authorities waited more than five years to initiate a prosecution provides no protection to Petitioner. His prosecution under U.S. law is timely simply because he left Finland before the five-year period expired, even though it would appear he had no intent to abscond from or evade Finnish prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court respectfully submits that the D.C. Circuit should revisit\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   and the mere absence rule. The decision is problematic for a host of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First, the mere absence rule conflicts with the plain meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203290\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By using the phrase \"fleeing from justice\" in the statute (\"No statute of limitations shall extend to any person fleeing from justice\"), Congress surely meant that a person had to be actively evading prosecution for the limitations period to toll; physical absence for reasons other than evasion cannot be enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, the Circuit's reading conflicts with Supreme Court precedent. In\n   <em>\n    Streep v. United States\n   </em>\n   , decided in 1895, the Supreme Court interpreted a predecessor of section 3290, which also used the words \"fleeing from justice,\" as requiring flight with the intention of avoiding prosecution.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701529\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/160/128/#p133\">\n    160 U.S. 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701529\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/160/128/#p133\">\n    16 S.Ct. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701529\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/160/128/#p133\">\n    40 L.Ed. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1895).\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   's mere absence rule arises from a misreading of\n   <em>\n    Streep\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Third,\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   represents the minority view among the federal appeals courts. Since\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   , the circuit courts almost uniformly have rejected the mere absence rule and, instead, have held that the limitations period is tolled under section 3290 only if the person absents himself from the jurisdiction in order to avoid prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, the D.C. Circuit's minority view affects a particularly harsh result in this case. Had Petitioner lived a few miles away in Virginia or Maryland, he would not be subject to extradition, as the Fourth Circuit requires evidence of an intent to evade justice for section 3290 tolling to go into effect. Such disparate application of federal law to an extradition treaty is simply unjust. This court therefore respectfully urges the D.C. Circuit to reconsider and overturn\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

McDonald, ECF No. 21-2, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The prosecution for which Petitioner is sought in Finland has no exactly perfect analog in the United States. Petitioner stands accused of making false statements in a \"debt enforcement proceeding.\" Under Finnish law, a Finnish government official, known as a \"bailiff,\" can convene a debt enforcement proceeding to aid in the enforcement of private debts, including by compelling the debtor to identify his assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ltr. from Dr. Jussi Tapani, ECF No. 21-1, at 89.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is in this proceeding that Petitioner is alleged to have lied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Petitioner's prosecution has its roots in a real estate transaction.

The Finnish authorities viewed the sale suspiciously based on a few peculiarities: no money exchanged hands, the trade register numbers and business codes of the buyer were not assigned at the time of sale, and Petitioner continued to collect rent on the property well after the sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Liuksila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n    74 F.Supp.3d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (D.D.C. 2014). Based on this evidence, Finnish authorities concluded that the sale was a sham transaction, by which Petitioner simply transferred the real property from one company he controlled to another.

The Particular Act Charged\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In front of Judge Robinson, the United States advanced two offenses under Finnish law as the basis of the extradition request: \"aggravated fraud by a debtor, committed on January 24, 2002, or alternatively, aggravated dishonesty by a debtor, committed between January 1, 2000 and August 2, 2001.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Formal Extradition Request at 35. The United States advocated that the conduct comprising\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   charge satisfied the dual criminality requirement. Judge Robinson disagreed, finding that \"the allegation that [Petitioner] transferred the shares 'knowing that due to his already existing and expected financial difficulties his act may harm the financial interests of his creditors,' does not rise to the level of a fraudulent scheme [under U.S. law]\" and therefore aggravated dishonesty of a debtor is not an offense that satisfies the dual criminality requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Liuksila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n    74 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   12 (citing Formal Extradition Request at 42). In this proceeding, the United States does not challenge that determination. Instead, it seeks extradition only on the other ground: aggravated fraud by a debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp.'s Opp'n to Pet.'s Supp. Mem. [hereinafter Resp.'s Opp'n.], ECF No. 25, at 7-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr., Oct. 26, 2016, at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As to the aggravated fraud charge, the parties disagree about the particular acts that comprise the offense. Petitioner believes that Finnish authorities have accused him of making \"a compelled, unsworn, and unrecorded misrepresentation ... in a private debt collection proceeding.\" Pet.'s Supp. Mem. at 1. The United States takes a broader view. It asserts that Petitioner is being extradited \"for his efforts to engineer a fictitious sale of shares of real estate,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the false statements he made to a Finnish official in an attempt to conceal his misdeeds.\" Resp.'s Opp'n at 1 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Petitioner has the better of the argument. Under Finnish law, aggravated fraud by a debtor occurs when \"[a] debtor who, in order to obtain unlawful financial benefit for himself or herself or another\n   <em>\n    in bankruptcy, enforcement, debt adjustment or restructuring proceedings\n   </em>\n   conceals his or her property ... [or] gives other false or misleading information on a circumstance that is significant from the point of view of the creditors.\" Formal Extradition Request at 53 (quoting Fin. Crim. Code Ch. 39, Sec. 2) (emphasis added). The Finnish aggravated fraud statute thus criminalizes the giving of false or misleading testimony about information material to creditors \"in\" an official government proceeding-not the conduct that occurs outside of such proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In Petitioner's case, the charged conduct consists of the discrete act of making false statements to a bailiff during a debt enforcement proceeding concerning his purported sale of the stock holding company's shares. The Application for Summons made to the Turku District Court makes this clear. The Application identifies the offense of aggravated fraud by a debtor as having occurred on a single date-January 24, 2002, the date of the debt enforcement proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Formal Extradition Request at 42.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   During that proceeding, Petitioner is accused of \"[giving] false and\n   misleading information on a circumstance that is significant from the point of view of the creditors,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n    at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , specifically \"[Petitioner] has untruthfully announced that he has sold the shares ... before the date of distraint ... and that the bank had made the transaction on its own initiative,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, Petitioner \"was informed that provision of false information is a punishable criminal offense, a fraud by a debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n    at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As these official Finnish records establish, the particular act for which extradition is sought is making false statements about the bona fides of the housing share sale, not the legality of the sales themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The United States' position that the charged conduct is broader and involves the acts undertaken to execute the fraudulent conveyance is unconvincing. Recall, in these proceedings, the United States does not advocate that the alternative charge of\n   <em>\n    dishonesty\n   </em>\n   by a debtor is an extraditable offense. Yet, it is only this alternative charge that reaches Petitioner's alleged acts of fraudulently conveying the shares. Again, the Application for Summons makes this clear. It alleges that, for the offense of aggravated dishonesty by a debtor, Petitioner \"without acceptable reason transferred the shares ... to the possession of the four companies administered by himself in order to place the shares beyond the reach of the creditors....\" Formal Extradition Request at 42. Additionally, the Application dates the \"[t]ime of commission\" of that offense as the period from \"1 January 2000 [to] 2 August 2001.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Conversely, with regard to the charge of aggravated fraud, the charging documents, as discussed, refer only to events on January 24, 2002, the date of the debt enforcement proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226294\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/4/#p6\">\n    at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the acts occurring\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the debt enforcement proceeding and encompassing the broader scheme do not comprise the charged conduct for which extradition is sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The primary case on which the United States relies,\n   <em>\n    In re Zhenley Ye Gon\n   </em>\n   , to broaden the charged conduct is inapposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp.'s Opp'n at 8 (citing\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804681\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/768/69/\">\n    768 F.Supp.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2011) ). The United States contends that the court in\n   <em>\n    Zhenley Ye Gon\n   </em>\n   considered \"surrounding circumstances not essential to proof of the Mexican charge\" of possession of firearms reserved for the military-the charge for which petitioner was being extradited.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804681\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/768/69/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Not so. There, the court specifically identified facts that were critical to its dual criminality assessment, such as the location of the weapons in rooms controlled by the petitioner and the nearby presence of drugs and money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhenley Ye Gon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804681\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/768/69/\">\n    768 F.Supp.2d at 86-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court did not treat these facts as tangential, but rather, as facts bearing on whether the petitioner's conduct, if it had occurred in the United States, would violate federal and District of Columbia law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804681\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/768/69/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, by contrast, the United States asks the court to find that the predicate conduct for the discrete charge of aggravate fraud of a debtor encompasses acts that go beyond the commission of the offense itself.\n   <em>\n    Ye Gon\n   </em>\n   does not support doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The United States also suggests that the court can consider the acts constituting the alleged fraudulent conveyances as part of the charged conduct because evidence relating to those acts would be admissible either as substantive evidence, presumably to show the falsity of Petitioner's statements, or under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) to prove his intent, plan, or absence of mistake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp.'s Opp'n at 9-10. But the United States cites no case for the proposition that acts not constituting the offense itself but necessary to proving it can be bootstrapped into the dual criminality inquiry. The court therefore does not\n   consider as part of the charged conduct any act other than Petitioner's making of false statements during the debt enforcement proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    2. Whether There is a Comparable U.S. Crime\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Having established Petitioner's charged conduct as false statements made during the debt enforcement inquiry, the court must decide whether such conduct is criminal in the United States. Despite a habeas proceeding's general burden on petitioner, it is fair to place the initial burden on the United States to identify a comparable domestic crime. The petitioner should not have to guess at which of the myriad of federal or state criminal laws his foreign conduct purportedly would violate if committed domestically.

To the contrary, he describes it to be a \"somewhat informal proceeding\" that occurs\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a court judgment on the debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Dr. Jussi Tapani, ECF No. 21-1, at 89.

A, ECF No. 25-1, at 2 (describing a debt enforcement proceeding as \"closely linked to court proceedings,\" but in fact, \"an independent administrative procedure subsequent to court proceedings\"). Moreover, the bailiff is not like a judicial officer in the United States. Dr. Tapani states that he is \"an employee of the executive branch.\" Declaration of Dr. Jussi Tapani, ECF No. 24-1, at 3. His job is to question the debtor about what assets may be used to \"satisfy the creditor's judgment ...

Petitioner therefore cannot avoid extradition based on the judicial proceedings exception contained in section 1001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Third,\n   </em>\n   Petitioner argues that he cannot be extradited because the \"Finnish proceedings conducted in this case also lacked the requisite procedural protections to form the basis of a charge for false statements under U.S. law.\" Pet.'s Supp. Mem. at 13. Petitioner claims three such procedural violations: (1) the Finnish \"summons\" fails to identify with specificity the false statements Petitioner is alleged to have made, in the same manner as would a grand jury indictment under U.S. law; (2) Finnish authorities violated Petitioner's rights under Finnish law by not affording him the opportunity to review \"a written protocol\" of the debt enforcement proceedings, so that he could review the accuracy of his responses; and (3) Petitioner had no right against self-incrimination in the debt enforcement proceeding, a deficiency the European court of Human Rights and the Finish Supreme Court later recognized as violative of a debtor's rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. None of these arguments is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As to the first, Petitioner cites to no provision of the U.S.-Finland Extradition Treaty nor to any legal authority that renders an extradition unlawful simply because the requesting country's charging instrument does not satisfy the notice standards of the requested country. Even if there were such a requirement, the Finnish charging papers are sufficient to place Petitioner on notice of his alleged false statements. The Application for Summons provides that Petitioner \"has untruthfully announced that he has sold the\n   shares ... to [three entities] before the date of distraint ... and that the bank had made the transaction on its own initiative.\" Formal Extradition Request at 42. Therefore, Petitioner is on notice about what Finnish authorities allege were false statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With respect to his contention that his particular debt enforcement proceeding did not conform with Finnish law by failing to provide a written protocol, it is not the province of this court to make such an inquiry. \"[D]istrict judges considering habeas petitions challenging extradition orders [ ] should not engage in an analysis of the demanding country's laws and procedure, except to the limited extent necessary to ensure that the requirements of the federal extradition statute and the applicable extradition treaty have been satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    Skaftouros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048451\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/144/#p158\">\n    667 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   156 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santos v.

Petitioner makes no argument here that the failure of the Finnish authorities to follow its own procedures violated the U.S.-Finland Extradition Treaty or the federal extradition law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, as to Petitioner's complaint that he enjoyed no right against self-incrimination in the debt enforcement proceeding, nothing in the Treaty or the law requires as a precondition of extradition that the petitioner enjoyed in the requesting country the same rights afforded by the requested country. Indeed, the opposite is true. Courts consistently have held that the absence of comparable rights in the requesting country is no bar to extradition.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holmes v.

Cir. 1972) (holding in the context of an extradition proceeding to face trial in a foreign country, \"a surrender of an American citizen required by treaty for purposes of a foreign criminal proceeding is unimpaired by an absence in the foreign judicial system of safeguards in all respects equivalent to those constitutionally enjoined upon American trials\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hilton v.

In his supplemental reply brief, Petitioner slightly modifies this argument to suggest that, in the absence of a right against self-incrimination, a compelled statement, even if false, cannot form the basis for liability under section 1001. Pet.'s Supp. Reply, ECF No. 26, at 10 (arguing that \"statements given under actual compulsion ... cannot properly fall within Section 1001's ambit\"). But the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Brogan v. United States\n   </em>\n   flatly rejected the notion that the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination \"confers a privilege to lie.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471744\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/398/#p404\">\n    522 U.S. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471744\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/398/#p404\">\n    118 S.Ct. 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471744\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/398/#p404\">\n    139 L.Ed.2d 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Thus, the mere fact that Petitioner's debt enforcement proceeding did not afford him the right to remain silent does not relieve him of responsibility for uttering a falsehood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated, the court finds that Petitioner has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that the charged conduct underlying the offense of aggravated fraud on a debtor does not satisfy the dual criminality principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Mail and Wire Fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In the interest of completeness, the court concludes that Petitioner's charged conduct would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   constitute a crime under the federal mail and wire fraud statutes. Central to any charge of mail or wire fraud is the existence of a \"scheme or artifice to defraud.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1343 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

The court might feel differently if Petitioner's fictitious sale occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the distraint of his assets. Say, for example, Petitioner received the notice of distraint, used fictitious sales to hide his assets, and then lied about possessing those assets. The false statement in that setting arguably would be an act in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. But that did not happen here. Instead, Petitioner fictitiously sold the housing shares on January 1, 2000, and then over sixteen months later, on May 8, 2001, the government notified him that it had distrained his assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Formal Extradition Request at 42, 51. Given that large gap in time, it is not reasonable to infer that Petitioner conducted the 2000 sale as part of a plan to lie during an unforeseen future debt enforcement proceeding.

Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The court now turns to Petitioner's contention that the Finnish charges against him are time barred, thereby rendering extradition unlawful. The U.S.-Finland Extradition Treaty forbids extradition if the statute of limitations has lapsed either under Finnish or U.S. law. The Treaty provides: \"Extradition shall be refused if the prosecution or the enforcement of the penalty for the offense for which extradition is requested has become barred by lapse of time according to the law of the requesting or requested State.\" Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and Finland, June 11, 1976, ECF No. 21-2, at 20 [hereinafter Extradition Treaty].

Such evidence, he contends, is not sufficient to establish service and the consequent tolling of the Finnish statute of limitations. That argument has it precisely backwards. In these proceedings, Petitioner is presumed to have been served, and the burden rests on him to prove otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skaftouros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048451\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/144/#p158\">\n    667 F.3d at 162-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On that score, Petitioner comes up empty. Petitioner puts forth no evidence-not even his own affidavit-that would support a finding that he was never served. Notably, the Certified Mail Postal Receipt that Petitioner maligns contains a signature affirming receipt of the mailing, presumably the summons. Petitioner does not deny the signature as his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Without any evidence to conclude otherwise, the court finds that the Finnish statute of limitations did not lapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    2.

In\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   , shortly after he committed the alleged crime of forgery, the defendant left the District of Columbia and remained absent for more than three years-the then-federal limitations period-during which time he was mostly in prison in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1056314\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/105/791/#p792\">\n    105 F.2d at 791-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Applied here, the mere absence rule works to Petitioner's detriment. It does not matter why he left Finland. It only matters that he left prior to the five-year limitation period's expiration and, once he did, the limitations period automatically tolled. What's more, it remains tolled to this day, as he has never returned to Finland, thereby making the Finnish prosecution timely under U.S. law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The mere absence rule adopted by the D.C.

Indeed, as explained below, in the court's view,\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   's erroneous reading of section 3290 stems from a fundamental misreading of\n   <em>\n    Streep\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Petitioner urges the court not to follow\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   , arguing that it \"retains no validity today.\" Pet.'s Mem. at 16. For support, Petitioner points to the above-cited cases from outside this Circuit, which interpret \"fleeing from justice\" to include an element of intent. Those decisions, however, no matter how persuasive, do not grant the court license to disregard D.C. Circuit precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706212,11989316\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/115/1033/\">\n    115 F.3d 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1036 (D.C.

Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Singleton\n   </em>\n   , adopted a \"contradictory holding\" to\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   . Pet.'s Mem. at 18. In\n   <em>\n    Singleton\n   </em>\n   , the defendant remained\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the District of Columbia while evading authorities, so the question before the court was whether a person could be \"fleeing from justice\" under section 3290 without physically leaving the jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847945,3641293\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1159/\">\n    702 F.2d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1169 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The court held that \"flight from the jurisdiction is not required to trigger the tolling provision,\" but in that case found that \"the Government failed to show that Singleton acted with the intention of avoiding prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847945,3641293\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847945,3641293\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1159/\">\n    at 1169, 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though\n   <em>\n    Singleton\n   </em>\n   recognized that \"fleeing from justice\"\n   <em>\n    inside\n   </em>\n   a jurisdiction necessitates an intent to evade prosecution, the court explicitly left for another day whether to revisit the mere absence rule of\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   for defendants found\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of the jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   These cases [i.e.,\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ], both involving defendants who had left the District of Columbia, suggest that the defendant's intent is irrelevant in determining whether he has fled justice ... In this case, the Government has offered no proof that appellee left the jurisdiction. It is therefore unnecessary for us to decide whether the rule of law set forth in these early cases-that mere absence from the jurisdiction is sufficient to toll the statute-retains its vitality today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847945,3641293\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1169 n.32 (citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   , therefore, remains the law to which this court is bound. And it applies directly to this case because Petitioner left Finland-the jurisdiction in which he allegedly committed the crime-thereby tolling the U.S. limitations period. It matters not why he left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Next, Petitioner grapples with the reality of\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   as binding precedent but tries to distinguish it. He argues that\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   was not an extradition case \"governed by congressionally ratified treaties.\" Pet.'s Mem. at 20. Pointing out that the U.S.-Finland Extradition Treaty expressly forbids extradition upon the expiration of either country's statute of limitations, Petitioner maintains that applying\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   's mere absence rule here \"would entirely undo the congressional purpose of including the U.S. limitations requirement in the Treaty in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. That consequence arises, Petitioner insists, because an extraditee will always, by nature, be outside the requesting jurisdiction and therefore can never benefit from the Treaty's protection against stale prosecutions if the mere absence rule applies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pet.'s Supp. Mem. at 5. To avoid this purported conflict, he urges the court to read section 3290 as requiring an intent to evade justice to toll the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   These arguments suffer from two problems. First, the Treaty between Finland and the United States forbids extradition if the penalty has \"become barred by lapse of time\n   <em>\n    according to the law of the\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    requested State\n   </em>\n   .\" Extradition Treaty at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Thus, to determine whether time has lapsed, the court must look to the law of the United States, which includes section 3290 and the cases interpreting it.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Man-Seok Choe v. Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3583884\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/733/#p741\">\n    525 F.3d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 (9th Cir. 2008) (applying section 3290 to extradition proceedings);\n   <em>\n    Ross v. U.S. Marshal for Eastern Dist. of Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644115\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/1190/#p1193\">\n    168 F.3d 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1193-94 (10th Cir. 1999) (same);\n   <em>\n    Jhirad v.

The Treaty does not contemplate a special application of the requested country's law during an extradition proceeding. Second, as a practical matter, Petitioner is wrong that someone who leaves Finland and is found in the United States can\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   benefit from this country's statute of limitations period if the mere absence rule applies. If Petitioner had left Finland more than five years after the alleged crime-instead of four-the U.S. statute of limitations would have lapsed, and the Treaty's limitation provision would have protected Petitioner. Although it did not aid Petitioner here, the Treaty's protection has power, notwithstanding\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   , for those who remain in the jurisdiction where the offense took place for at least five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Relatedly, the court does not agree with Petitioner that applying\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   \"transgress[es]\" the Treaty through inconsistent administration of section 3290. Pet.'s Supp. Mem. at 6. The fact that an intent to avoid prosecution is required when someone is found in Arlington, Virginia or New York City, but is not in Washington D.C., is a result of the U.S. bedrock principle allowing federal Circuit Courts of Appeals to reach different legal conclusions on American law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Arthur M. Brown,\n   <em>\n    Comity in the Federal Courts\n   </em>\n   , 28 HARV. L. REV. 589, 590 (1914) (\"Each District Court is independent of every other District Court, each Circuit Court of Appeals of every other Circuit Court of Appeals.\").

He says that his case is distinguishable because, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   , he took affirmative steps to notify both U.S. and Finnish authorities of his intention to depart Finland and the Finnish authorities always knew his whereabouts in Washington, D.C., after he left.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325538\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/992/637/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But these factual distinctions do not immunize Petitioner from the effect of\n   <em>\n    McGowen\n   </em>\n   . Under the mere absence rule, upon his departure from Finland in 2006, the U.S. statute of limitations stopped running.

A \"fugitive\" is understood to be \"[a] criminal suspect or a witness in a criminal case who\n   <em>\n    flees, evades, or escapes arrest, prosecution, imprisonment, service of process, or the giving of testimony\n   </em>\n   .\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   These definitions comport with common sense.
