RUFE, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiff Charmaine Prater, a regular\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant in this Court, filed this civil action against the American Heritage Federal Credit Union, \"Vice President Brian Hahn,\" \"President Bruce Foulke (CEO),\" Lynette Smart (identified as assistant to Brian Hahn), John Doe (former manager of Red Lion Customer Service), Jane Doe (Supervisor of Red Lion customer service), Jane Doe (Loan Department/Back Office Manager), John Doe (quality control/credit reporting/bureau reporting IT Department), John Doe (Hunting Park Location Teller/Clerk), Jane Doe (Hunting Park Location Teller/Clerk), Stephanie Pompey (with the notation \"Esquire of Drive here and Private Practice\"), Matthew James (with the notation \"Operator Manager of Drive Here\"), and Thomas F. Chapman (identified as Chairman of the Board and CEO of Equifax, Inc.). Prater has also filed a Motion for Leave to Proceed\n   <em>\n    In Forma Pauperis.\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 1.) For the following reasons, the Court will grant Prater leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss her Complaint with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The basis for Prater's claims is somewhat difficult to understand due to the manner in which the Complaint is pled and the occasional difficulty in reading Prater's handwriting. Prater alleges that \"dating back to 2016\" and \"on going currently,\" the Defendants \"have taken control over [her] accounts and allowed or/and created unauthorized auto etc. accounts accept payments for [her] but applied it elsewhere ....\" (Compl. at 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She claims that she is \"at major risk due to fraud discrimination and retaliation action by defendants who have full control over [her] accounts at the American Heritage Credit Union.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It appears Prater is alleging that the Defendants \"erroneously reported duplicated accounts\"-apparently duplicate accounts related to her car loan-and listed different balances on those accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 &amp; 9.) The Court understands her to be claiming that a payment for her car loan was erroneously applied to a vacation loan based on a false allegation that Prater requested her payment be applied in such a manner. Prater also alleges that she was \"barred ... from the Credit Union after she requested copies of her statements from the Credit Union ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) She further contends that she \"addressed the manager at Red Lion Rd that her and her husband had disability [sic] they took advantage of them and [unintelligible] ... who failed to due diligence but went along [unintelligible].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prater indicates that \"this matter involves civil rights violations [and] securities violation frauds\" as well as \"Disability violation,\" \"identify theft,\" \"Housing discrimination,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Due process violation,\" as well as other violations of federal laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) She claims that she suffered from \"displacement and other harms\" as a result of the Defendants' conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) She seeks compensatory and punitive damages for a total amount of $180,000. She also wants the Court to prevent the repossession of certain of her property, presumably her car, although that is unclear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court will grant Prater leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   because it appears that she is not capable of paying the fees to commence this civil action. Accordingly, Prater's Complaint is subject to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii), which requires the Court to dismiss the Complaint if it fails to state a claim.

Failure to Comply with Rule 8\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is difficult to determine whether Prater has a basis for a plausible claim due to the manner in which the Complaint is pled. She does not identify which Defendants are responsible for which conduct, and appears to group different incidents together, making it difficult to understand how the events relate to each other. Indeed, it would be difficult for any Defendant to meaningfully respond to Prater's Complaint because it is not clear what each Defendant is alleged to have done and how each Defendant is liable to Prater.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawal v. McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3813386\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/546/107/#p113\">\n    546 F. App'x 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113 (3d Cir. 2014). Accordingly, the Complaint fails to comply with Rule 8 as pled. There are also other deficiencies in Prater's\n   claims-to the extent they can be understood-which the Court will address below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Civil Rights Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prater appears to be raising civil rights claims, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\"\n   <em>\n    West v.

Here, nothing in the Complaint suggests that any of the Defendants are state actors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James v. Heritage Valley Fed. Credit Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8450009\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/197/102/#p106\">\n    197 F.

Accordingly, there is no basis for any constitutional claims here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Claims for Securities Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prater also appears to be attempting to raise claims for securities fraud in light of the fact that she refers to securities fraud in her Complaint and indicated on the Court's Designation Form that this is a case under the Securities Acts. \"The elements of an implied \u00a7 10(b) cause of action for securities fraud are (1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Amgen Inc. v.

Nothing in the Complaint supports a cause of action for securities fraud because nothing relates to the purchase or sale of securities or misrepresentations related to securities. Accordingly, the Court will dismiss any such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Claims Related to Disability and Housing Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Complaint suggests that Prater is claiming she was discriminated against due to a disability and in relation to housing. However, none of her allegations clarify those claims. It is not clear what disability she is claiming, how she was discriminated against because of that disability, or how she was discriminated against in housing based on her membership in a protected class. Accordingly, her discrimination claims are based solely on conclusory allegations and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Claims for \"Identity Theft\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Prater also claims to be a victim of identity theft. However, the federal statute criminalizing identity theft, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, does not give rise to a civil cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riga v. Benezette\n   </em>\n   , No. 612CV4140RL19DAB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012910269\">\n    2012 WL 12910269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (M.D. Fla. July 12, 2012) (\"Plaintiff is a private citizen and does not have standing to bring a case under section 1028A because it is a criminal statute\"). Accordingly, if Prater sought to bring a federal claim on that basis, her claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Other Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Liberally construing the Complaint, it also appears that Prater may be raising claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"). The FCRA was enacted \"to ensure fair and accurate credit reporting, promote efficiency in the banking system, and protect consumer privacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Safeco Ins.

It appears that Prater may be alleging that accounts appeared on her credit report that were misrepresented in certain ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To state a claim under the FCRA against a furnisher of credit information, as opposed to the credit reporting agency itself, a plaintiff must allege that \"[s]he filed a notice of dispute with a consumer reporting agency; the consumer reporting agency notified the furnisher of information of the dispute; and the furnisher of information failed to investigate and modify the inaccurate information.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Although Prater alludes to a car loan, a misapplication of a payment to a vacation loan, and duplicate accounts, her disjointed allegations do not set forth a clear basis for a FCRA claim. She has not clearly identified the accounts or inaccuracies at issue, alleged that she filed a notice of dispute with any credit reporting agency, or explained how furnishers of her account information failed to investigate any dispute. Accordingly, the Complaint does not state a FCRA claim as pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, in the event Prater sought to raise claims under state law, there is no independent basis for jurisdiction over those claims. The only independent basis for the Court's jurisdiction over state law claims is pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which grants a district court jurisdiction over \"all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between ... citizens of different States.\" Diversity jurisdiction requires \"complete diversity,\" which in turn requires that \"no plaintiff be a citizen of the same state as any defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Zambelli Fireworks Mfg.

Accordingly, Prater has not met her burden of establishing that subject matter jurisdiction exists over any state law claims. Furthermore, as all of the parties appear to be located in Pennsylvania, it seems unlikely that the parties are diverse for purposes of \u00a7 1332(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Prater leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss her Complaint. This dismissal will be without prejudice to Prater's right to file an amended complaint within thirty (30) days in the event that she can cure the defects noted above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grayson v.
