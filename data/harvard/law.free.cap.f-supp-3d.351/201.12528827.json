The Defendants had adequate notice and time to respond to the proposed amended complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\"), and thus the Court will consider the motion to dismiss in light of the new allegations in the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eskenazi-McGibney v.

Einstein, P.C. is a professional corporation doing business in New York State, whose principal purpose is the collection of debts using the mail and telephone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.

The Plaintiff alleges that she received said Income Execution, and that the Income Execution was the first and only communication received by the Plaintiff from the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. The Amended Complaint alleges that the Income Execution lacks the language required by FDCPA Sections 1692e(11) and 15 USC 1692g(a).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, the Amended Complaint claims that the Income Execution falsely indicated that there was a valid judgement against the Plaintiff from a company called Rushmore Recoveries X, LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. In particular, the Income Execution sought to enforce a $1,219.61 default judgment issued by the New York State District Court for the County of Suffolk on September 16, 2005. ECF 21, Ex. B. The Plaintiff alleges that this judgment is invalid, because the Defendants obtained it without serving her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-17. According to the Plaintiff, the Defendants employed the law firm of Mel S. Harris and Associates, who, through a process server company called SamServe, obtained the default judgment pursuant to a false affidavit of service signed by a SamServ employee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-22. The Plaintiff also claims that no attorney meaningfully reviewed the Income Execution prior to serving it, and that the Defendants knew or should have known that the service obtained by SamServe was invalid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 24, 2016, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a class action settlement vacating more than 200,000 default judgments obtained by the Mel Harris Firm and SamServe.\n   <em>\n    Sykes v.

ECF 14-2 \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 27, 2017, the Plaintiff commenced this action against the Defendants alleging violations of FDCPA Sections 1692e, 1692e(3), 1692e(10), 1692e(11), 1692f(1), 1692f(6)(A), 1692g(a). ECF 1. The Plaintiff seeks to bring the action on behalf of herself and a class consisting of all consumers residing in the State of New York who, according to the Defendants' records received an income execution materially identical or substantially similar to the one she received. ECF 14-2 \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 26, 2018, the Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. ECF 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 19, 2018, the Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the September 16, 2005 default judgment against her in the New York State District Court of the County of Suffolk. ECF 21, Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 20, 2018, the Plaintiff opposed the motion to dismiss and filed a motion seeking leave to amend the Complaint. ECF 14; ECF 15. The proposed Amended Complaint withdrew the Plaintiff's claims under GBL \u00a7 349.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 4, 2018, the Defendants filed a reply in support of their motion to dismiss. ECF 20. The Defendants limited their opposition to the Plaintiff's motion to amend to the argument that any such amendment would be futile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 30, 2018, the Plaintiff submitted a letter motion informing the Court that the New York State District Court of the County of Suffolk vacated the default judgment against her.

The Court disagrees. The Defendants' argument hinges on their false characterization that the \"entire basis\" of the Plaintiff's claim is that the Income Execution failed to disclose that it was a communication from a debt collector in relation to the collection of a debt. ECF 11 at 8. That is\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   component of the Plaintiff's claim, but not the entirety of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The gravamen of the Plaintiff's allegations is that the Defendants sent the Income Execution knowing full well the invalidity of the judgment they sought to enforce. Without providing any explanation of the underlying debt, or background regarding the judgment creditors, the Income Execution mandates the garnishment of wages to collect the judgment. Further, the Amended Complaint alleges that the Income Execution made no reference to the issues relating to the Mel Harris firm and SamServe, even though the Defendants possessed actual or constructive knowledge of those agents' pervasive use of sewer service to secure default judgments.

If the Income Execution in fact was the first communication the Plaintiff received regarding the judgment, as the Amended Complaint alleges, then requiring the disclosures mandated by Section 1692e(11) would certainly advance the goals of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avila v.

Pa. Jan. 21, 2016) (finding writ of execution covered by Section 1692e(11) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The rationale underlying each line of cases is compelling. On the one hand, the Court is hesitant to subject communications\n   to the FDCPA when the debt collector is not the one conveying the message and has no control over the form of the message.\n   <em>\n    Zevgolis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20251024\">\n    2011 WL 251024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3. In addition, the Court agrees that it is counterintuitive that the FDCPA would exempt debt collectors from disclosures in their initial interaction with a debtor via an initial pleading but require disclosures in subsequent court filings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stephens v. Manley Deas Kochalski, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-2470,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205454458\">\n    2017 WL 5454458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 14, 2017). On the other hand, the term \"formal pleading\" has a specific meaning, one which Congress was certainly aware of when revising the statute. If Congress intended a broader exemption, covering all court filings and not just pleadings, it certainly would have chosen different language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206977695\">\n    2014 WL 6977695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Ultimately, the Court finds the latter explanation to be persuasive. \"When construing a statute, [the Court must] begin with its language and proceed under the assumption that the statutory language, unless otherwise defined, carries its plain meaning....\"\n   <em>\n    Chen v. Major League Baseball Props., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331281\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/72/#p76\">\n    798 F.3d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 (2d Cir. 2015). Both the federal and New York rules of civil procedure expressly limit pleadings to an enumerated set of documents at the opening stage of the lawsuit, such as the complaint and the answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 7(a) (\"Only these pleadings are allowed...\"); N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3011 (\"There shall be no other pleading unless the court orders otherwise.\"). Notwithstanding the potential anomalous results this conclusion requires, nothing in the statute, its legislative history, or Second Circuit case law construing the statute hints that Congress intended the exemption extend beyond this traditional understanding of a pleading. Indeed, despite characterizing the exclusion as \"broad,\" the Second Circuit nonetheless limited it to documents attached or related to filings necessary to complete the initiation of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277161\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/207/#p212\">\n    852 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   213 ;\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517875\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/75/#p88\">\n    897 F.3d at 87-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Until it receives further guidance from the Second Circuit, the Court is not free to depart from the clear language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Further, the Court does not believe that this holding will be of much import on most court cases involving debtors and debt collectors. Although court filings after the pleadings may theoretically fall under the ambit of Section 1692e(11), they only trigger the provision's disclosure requirements if they are the debt collector's first communication with the debtor, that is, the debt collector never properly served their pleading on the debtor. In these circumstances, the fact that the debt collector does not control the form of the document seems less important, considering the statute's protections will only apply due to the debt initial failure to effect service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Therefore, the Court denies the Defendants' motion to dismiss with regard to the Defendants' contention that the Income Execution is not a communication under Section 1692e(11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    F. AS TO WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF STATES A CLAIM UNDER SECTIONS 1692E(2), 1692E(3), 1692E(4), 1692E(5), 1692E(10) 1692F(1) AND 1692F(6).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff fails to state a claim because she was not a member of the classes obtaining vacations of the Mel Harris default judgments in\n   <em>\n    Sykes v. Mel S. Harris &amp; Assoc. LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073876\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/70/#p75\">\n    780 F.3d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75 (2d Cir. 2015). The Defendants assert that, because the default judgment against the Plaintiff is owed to Rushmore Recoveries X, a wholly separate and distinct entity from the defendants in the\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   action, the debt at issue is valid, and thus there is no false or misleading information contained in the Income Execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In further support of this argument, the Defendants point to the fact that, at the time of filing the initial complaint, the Plaintiff had neither sought nor obtained vacation of the judgment against her. Again, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that the Defendants obtained the default judgment against her using the Mel Harris firm, SamServe, and Todd Fabacher - the exact law firm, process service company, and process server targeted by the\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   action. In\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs alleged, and submitted evidence in support of those allegations, that these exact actors obtained fraudulent default judgments against over 200,000 defendants through widespread use of \"sewer\" service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   , 285 F.R.D. at 285. Based on these allegations, the plaintiffs obtained mass vacatur of those judgments before the Defendants submitted the Income Execution. The Plaintiff claims that, given the outcome of the\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   action, the Defendants knew or should have known that the default judgment obtained using these agents was fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Defendants' sole defense in this regard, that because\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   related to a different creditor and thus cannot apply to their judgment against the Plaintiff, is unavailing. The Plaintiff bases her claim on the agents who effected service in the\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   action, not the defendants. While the Plaintiff may be ultimately unable to prove that the Defendants in fact possessed such knowledge, the Amended Complaint certainly alleges that the Defendants made a knowing misrepresentation by submitting the Income Execution notwithstanding their actual or constructive knowledge that it was improperly obtained using sewer service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sykes v. Mel Harris &amp; Assocs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273329\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/757/413/\">\n    757 F.Supp.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 n.9 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (denying motion to dismiss where plaintiffs \"pled facts that, if proven, show that the Mel Harris and Leucadia defendants knew Samserv's affidavits of service were 'highly likely to be false' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Defendants cannot escape this reality simply because the default judgment had not been vacated at the time the Plaintiff filed the complaint, because the relevant issue is not simply the validity of the judgment itself, but rather the Defendants knowledge about the validity of the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v. Abderrahman\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-cv-3641,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201077842\">\n    2012 WL 1077842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11-12 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2012) (denying motion to dismiss where state court had not yet vacated a default judgment allegedly obtained via sewer service)\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

May 24, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Defendants' arguments similarly fall short in the context of the Section 1692e(3) claims. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants robosigned the Income Execution, and that meaningful review of the underlying judgment would have revealed their reliance on sewer service in light of the agents used to obtain the default judgment. The Second Circuit permits claims under Section 1692e(3) for allegations that debt collectors sent documents on behalf of an attorney without meaningful attorney involvement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9360769\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/321/292/#p304\">\n    321 F.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (2d Cir. 2003). Courts have generally allowed claims to proceed past the pleading stage under this theory when the plaintiffs allege that the defendant sought to enforce a judgment without first reviewing the underlying judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Musah v. Houslanger &amp; Assocs., PLLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876943\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/636/#p640\">\n    962 F.Supp.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640-41 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (denying motion\n   to dismiss based on attempt to enforce judgment without reviewing case file to determine if party had notice of the assignment);\n   <em>\n    Baltazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203941943\">\n    2018 WL 3941943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Therefore, the Court denies the Defendants' motion to dismiss with regard to the Plaintiff's claims under Sections 1692e(2), 1692e(3), 1692e(4), 1692e(5), 1692e(10) 1692f(1) AND 1692f(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    G. AS TO WHETHER THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BARS THE PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Defendants claim that the statute of limitations bars the Plaintiff's claims, because the default judgment underlying the Income Execution occurred on September 16, 2005. This argument lacks merit. Under the FDCPA, plaintiffs must commence an action a claim must be commenced \"within one year from the date on which the violation occurs.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d). In\n   <em>\n    Benzemann v. Citibank N.A.\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that an FDCPA violation only occurs when a plaintiff has both a complete cause of action and notice of the FDCPA violation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358425\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/98/#p102\">\n    806 F.3d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102-03 (2d Cir. 2015). Here, the Plaintiff's claim accrued upon receipt of the Income Execution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCrobie v.

Nov. 3, 2017) (\"Therefore, this Court holds, consistent with a number of district courts in this Circuit, that the one-year statute of limitations period for an FDCPA violation begins to run on the date that the consumer receives the debt collection letter.\") (collecting cases). Therefore, the Court denies the motion to dismiss in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    H. AS TO WHETHER THE COURT MUST DISMISS THE 1692F CLAIMS AS DUPLICATIVE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff cannot assert a violation of Section 1692f based on the same conduct underlying Section 1692e claims. The Second Circuit has expressly rejected the argument that \" sections 1692e and 1692f are mutually exclusive and that the same conduct by a debt collector cannot violate both sections at once.\"\n   <em>\n    Arias v. Gutman, Mintz, Baker &amp; Sonnenfeldt LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263686\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/128/#p135\">\n    875 F.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135-36 (2d Cir. 2017). The cases drawn by the Defendants all predate this on point authority from the Second Circuit. Therefore, the Court denies the motion to dismiss based on alleged duplicative claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendants' motion to dismiss and grants the Plaintiff's motion to amend the Complaint.
