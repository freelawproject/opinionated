Rusinko\") and Carl Jason (\"P.O. Jason\") unlawfully arrested him and subjected him to an unwarranted and illegal body cavity search in order to obtain information about crimes unrelated to his parole status. (Dkt. 1). Plaintiff also alleges that Parole Officer Kathryn VanDusen (\"P.O. VanDusen\") unlawfully arrested him on a separate occasion without a warrant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16). Plaintiff asserts claims against P.O. Rusinko, P.O. Jason, and P.O. VanDusen (collectively, \"Defendants\") under the Federal and New York State Constitutions,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the New York Civil Rights Law, and New York common law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 5). For the following reasons,\n   Defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's Complaint unless otherwise indicated and are assumed true for purposes of this motion. (Dkt. 1). On April 22, 2015, Plaintiff, who had been released on parole supervision, received a telephone call from P.O. Rusinko, who requested information about \"another person supervised\" by the New York State Division of Parole (the \"Division\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 10-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). At the time he received the call, Plaintiff was in a convenience store to purchase several items. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). Sataira Carter (\"Carter\"), Plaintiff's girlfriend, arrived at the convenience store shortly thereafter, and exited the driver's side of the vehicle to greet Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). Although Plaintiff \"was not allowed to drive a car while he was being supervised,\" he entered the driver's side of the vehicle to speak with Carter inside the car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). While Carter and Plaintiff were inside the vehicle, P.O. Jason drove up next to the car, and said, \"Now you're going to jail for driving.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite Plaintiff's insistence that \"the car wasn't on and he was just in the driver's side,\" P.O. Jason had Plaintiff exit the vehicle and then handcuffed him before placing Plaintiff in the parole car with an unidentified parole officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20). P.O. Rusinko drove up to the parole vehicle and said to Plaintiff, \"Why the fuck you couldn't just give us the information? We would have let you go.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). Plaintiff informed the parole officers that he had to urinate before they left for the Division's Rochester office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 29). During the drive, P.O. Jason said to Plaintiff, \"Why do you keep moving around back there? Are you putting drugs in your ass?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After arriving at the Division's Rochester office, the parole officers brought Plaintiff into a bathroom and assisted Plaintiff to urinate while he remained handcuffed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-39). P.O. Jason then stated to Plaintiff that \"we got a call that you have drugs in your ass.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40). Plaintiff indicated that \"he did not have any drugs in his rectum,\" as P.O. Rusinko placed two plastic gloves over his hands and lubricated them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43-44). P.O. Rusinko then forced his hand into Plaintiff's rectum, but he did not find any drugs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the body cavity search concluded, P.O. Jason said, \"Oh, you're not going to jail,\" and noted that Plaintiff \"should have helped us.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57-58). P.O. Rusinko then asked Plaintiff questions about \"an unrelated crime,\" but Plaintiff \"did not answer any questions because of his emotional state.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-62). P.O. Rusinko helped Plaintiff urinate in the bathroom once more before driving him to the Monroe County Jail, where he was placed in custody. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 63-73, 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). During the drive, P.O. Rusinko stated, \"I need the information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   P.O. Rusinko returned to the Monroe County Jail two days later to serve a notice of violation of release upon Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77). At this time, Plaintiff told P.O. Rusinko \"that what he did was wrong and that he was going to challenge the violation because he was sodomized.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78). In response, P.O. Rusinko said, \"You're really gonna go forward with this? I'm gonna make sure you get 18 months in prison.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Over a year later, or about August 8, 2016, Plaintiff was \"stabbed ... 20-30 times by someone alleged to be supervised by\" the Division. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 138). At some point after the alleged stabbing took place, P.O. VanDusen arrested Plaintiff without a warrant and before any criminal charges\n   had been filed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 137, 139). Plaintiff was then imprisoned until September 8, 2017.

Although Plaintiff argues that \"[t]he complaint never states that Defendants were acting within the scope of their employment or in their official capacity\" (Dkt. 7 at \u00b6 14), this argument overlooks how the salient facts fit within the\n   <em>\n    Riviello\n   </em>\n   factors.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's fourth cause of action, alleging a \u00a7 1983 claim for abuse of process, and his sixth cause of action, alleging a \u00a7 1983 claim for excessive force based upon the Fourth Amendment, may proceed as against P.O.

Jason and P.O. Rusinko, it is dismissed pursuant to Correction Law \u00a7 24 for the same reasons discussed in the preceding section. The fact that Plaintiff further alleges that P.O. Rusinko also improperly used the parole revocation process by threatening Plaintiff with 18 months' imprisonment in order to dissuade Plaintiff from challenging the parole violation does not remove P.O. Rusinko's conduct from the scope of his employment. It is the duty of a parole officer to ensure a parolee's compliance with his conditions of release and to initiate the process by which any alleged parole violation is reviewed. Indeed, P.O. Rusinko brought the notice of violation to serve upon Plaintiff before ever having made the alleged threat. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 77). In other words, the parole revocation process had already commenced prior to P.O. Rusinko's and Plaintiff's exchange. That P.O. Rusinko may have suggested he would pursue his duties more vigorously is immaterial.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205347468\">\n     2013 WL 5347468\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (applying Correction Law \u00a7 24 to acts allegedly \"carried out and condoned by [the plaintiff's] supervisors as part of a pattern of discrimination and retaliation\").
