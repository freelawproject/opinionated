(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.02, 5.00, 12.04, and 12.09 in reaching his conclusion, as well as considering the effect of Plaintiff's obesity as required by Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") 02-1p. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff perform:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) occasional climbing of ropes, scaffolds or ladders; (2) frequent climbing of\n   ramps or stairs; (3) frequent stooping; (4) frequent handling and fingering with the non-dominant right upper extremity; and (5) limited to simple tasks, simple instructions and simple work-related decisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of marker/labeler, cleaner, and produce weigher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff is not disabled as defined in the Act.

Dr. Levy noted that this abnormality was tender, and \"suggested the possibility of plantar tenosynovitis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Fine motor activity of the hands was intact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 339-42). Dr. Toor noted that Plaintiff used a cane, and observed the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Gait abnormal, unsteady, limping towards his right side with and without the cane. Heel-to-toe walking with and without the cane declined. Squatting 20% of full with and without the cane. Station normal. He cannot stand more than a few minutes without the cane.

Dr. Toor noted masses in Plaintiff's right wrist and abdomen, as well as callosities in both feet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On examination, Dr. Toor found: full flexion, extension, and lateral flexion of the cervical spine; limited range of motion of the lumbar spine; positive straight leg raise test, both sitting and supine bilaterally; full movement in the shoulders, elbows, and left wrists, but \"right wrist palmar flexion 10 degrees and dorsiflexion 10 degrees, tenderness and swelling\"; and full movement in the hips, knees, and ankles, with tenderness in the ankles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 341). Dr. Toor also found that Plaintiff's hand and finger dexterity was not intact in his right hand, and grip strength of \"2/5\". (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 342). Dr. Toor noted that Plaintiff had \"moderate-to-severe difficulty grasping, holding, writing, tying the shoelaces, zipping the zipper, buttoning the button, manipulating the coin, or holding an object with the right hand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Toor issued the following medical source statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Plaintiff] has moderate-to-severe limitation standing, walking, bending, lifting, and carrying. Pain interferes with his balance. He has moderate limitation sitting a long time. He has moderate-to-severe limitation doing fine motor activities with the right hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 342).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, on March 15, 2016, Dr. Fink completed a physical assessment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 539-42). Dr. Fink had performed Plaintiffs 2015 right wrist surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 540). Dr. Fink found that Plaintiff had no restrictions, limitations, or disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 540-42). The form completed by Dr. Fink is mostly blank, aside from notations of \"no disability\", \"no limitations\", and \"no restrictions.\" In other words, there are no attached notes relating to any physical examination performed by Dr. Fink in conjunction with his completion of the assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The ALJ assigned \"moderate weight\" to the opinion of Dr. Fink, because he treated Plaintiff only for his hand complaints, and the record conflicted with his assessment that Plaintiff did not have any physical restrictions using his right hand following surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32). The ALJ assigned Dr. Toor's 2015 opinion \"moderate weight,\" because it was not supported by\n   medical evidence in the record, and because it was \"vague\" and \"[did] not delineate the extent to which the claimant could perform certain activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). Finally, the ALJ assigned \"limited weight\" to the opinions of Drs. Boehlert and Levy, as well as the 2008 examination by Dr. Toor, because they \"significantly predate the claimant's present application for Supplemental Security Benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court has reviewed the record, and finds that the assessed RFC conflicts with much of the medical opinion evidence in the record, including Plaintiff's limitations for walking and standing; climbing ropes, scaffolds or ladders; climbing of ramps or stairs; and stooping. Multiple medical sources, including Drs. Torr, Levy, and Boehlert, issued opinions noting pain in Plaintiff's feet, and finding significant limitations in Plaintiff's ability to walk and stand. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 398 (In December 2008, Dr. Toor opined that Plaintiff had a moderate limitation for standing/walking for longer periods of time, due to pain in his feet due to callosities/corns, and that pain in Plaintiff's left knee, hips, and back also interfered with his physical activities, such as walking or standing for a long time);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 408 (In July 2011, Dr. Boehlert opined that Plaintiff had a moderate limitation to heavy ambulation or heavy exertion in the standing position due to foot pain);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 440 (in April 2012, Dr. Levy noted mass and tenderness on bottom of Plaintiff's foot, and opined mild limitations for walking and standing);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 342 (In 2015, Dr. Toor found that Plaintiff had a moderate-to-severe limitation standing, walking, bending, lifting, and carrying, and that pain interferes with his balance) ). In the report for the most recent opinion relating to Plaintiff's physical limitations (other than the opinion issued by Plaintiff's wrist surgeon), Dr. Toor also observed that Plaintiff's gait was abnormal, he was unsteady and limping, and significantly, \"\n   <em>\n    he needs the cane medically for standing and walking\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 340) (emphasis added). These limitations do not support an RFC for light work,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   with no additional limitations for standing or walking. None of the opinion evidence discussed by the ALJ supports the notion that Plaintiff is capable of \"a good deal of walking or standing,\" as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), for performing light work, particularly considering the most recent observations by Dr. Toor concerning Plaintiff's ability to ambulate. Similarly, the significant limitations relating to Plaintiff's ability to ambulate are not consistent an RFC requiring Plaintiff to occasionally climb ropes, scaffolds or ladders, frequently climb ramps or stairs, and frequently stoop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As noted above, the ALJ rejected portions of Dr. Toor's 2015 opinion because it was purportedly vague and was not supported by other evidence in the record. The ALJ's reasoning is flawed. For example, the ALJ found that Dr. Toor's 2015 opinion was \"somewhat vague\" because it \"[does] not delineate the extent to which the claimant could perform certain activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). However, the Court's review of the record reveals that most of the other medical opinion evidence discussed by the ALJ for Plaintiff's physical\n   impairments - save for the opinion issued by Dr. Fink, which is a form from the Monroe County Department of Human Services - is in almost the same format as the 2015 report issued by Dr. Toor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n    at 339-42, 395-99, 405-08, 436-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). All of the reports are structured with the same sections: chief complaint; past history; current medications; social history; activities of daily living; physical examination of systems; labs and other testing; diagnosis; prognosis; and medical source statement. When comparing the different reports, Dr. Toor's 2015 report appears to be among the more detailed of the group. That being the case, if Dr. Toor's 2015 opinion was not particularly useful because it did not contain information relating to Plaintiff's ability to perform certain activities, it follows that the remaining medical opinion evidence is also vague, and the ALJ should have worked to develop the record to obtain more useful evidence relating to Plaintiff's physical limitations. This error alone would require remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson v.

The Court disagrees. The medical opinion evidence relating to Plaintiff's physical limitations - which spans from 2008 through 2016 - shows consistent and increasing issues with Plaintiff's foot pain and his ability to ambulate. The so-called \"exacerbation\" of pain in 2015 required Plaintiff to ambulate with a cane, which Dr. Toor noted was medically necessary. In 2016, Plaintiff was scheduled for surgical excision of his left foot fibroma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 588). This progression of his impairments is consistent with Plaintiff's testimony at the October 2016 hearing that he had to begin using a cane, and that he didn't \"walk too much.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49). Further, review of the records pertaining to Plaintiff's foot impairment note continuing and worsening pain. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 585-86 (In June 2016, \"Pain in arch of both feet. Getting worse. Lumps in bottom of foot getting larger. Painful to palpation. Has tried change in shoes. NSAIDs, ice, warm soaks. Nothing helps,\" and \"plantar fibroma on palpation of plantar fascia painful to palpation ... painful to walk.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 587 (in July 2016, Plaintiff had continuing foot pain, which increased with walking and standing; because \"[c]onservative treatment has not lead to resolution of symptoms ... the patient wishes to proceed with surgery.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, the fact that Plaintiff's foot pain continued well into 2016 does not support \"a temporary exacerbation in pain\" in 2015. For these reasons, the Court finds that the ALJ's\n   weighing of Dr. Toor's 2015 opinion is flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court further finds that the ALJ improperly rejected the opinions of Drs. Boehlert and Levy, as well as the 2008 examination of Dr. Toor, on the sole basis that they predated the relevant period of disability. \"[A] medical opinion need not be rejected or ignored solely because it predates the relevant time period, particularly where the record otherwise contains limited information regarding the claimant's functional capabilities....\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

In light of the ALJ's finding that Dr. Toor's 2015 opinion was vague and lacked information relating to Plaintiff's functional limitations, the ALJ should have more meaningfully considered the opinions of Drs. Boehlert and Levy, as well as the 2008 opinion by Dr. Toor. This is particularly true in this case, where the opinions of Drs. Boehlert and Levy, as well as the 2008 opinion of Dr. Toor, are consistent with timely medical opinion evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court is cognizant that the opinions of consultative examiners are not entitled to the same deference as opinions by treating physicians,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judd v.
