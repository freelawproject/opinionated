In essence, SEB alleges that the defendants misrepresented and omitted facts regarding the safety of the reformulated drug and the results of surveillance data that significantly impacted the chances of obtaining FDA approval for abuse-deterrent labeling, which would make the drug more marketable. It contends the defendants, knowing the adverse consequences of the increase in intravenous abuse the data showed, consciously or recklessly, failed to disclose it. As the true facts were revealed and after the FDA requested that Endo withdraw the drug from the market or face FDA action forcing withdrawal, the market value of Endo stock plummeted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In moving to dismiss, Endo International plc and Endo Health Solutions Inc. (collectively, Endo) and the individual defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   argue SEB engages in \"hindsight pleading\" and alleges no facts suggesting any statements were false when made, the challenged statements were merely opinions and optimistic or forward-looking statements protected by the safe harbor provision of the Exchange Act, and the alleged facts do not establish that the defendants knew their statements were untrue. Invoking\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   abstention, they also maintain that the Securities Act claims should be dismissed because they are being litigated in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that SEB has stated causes of action for violations of the Exchange and Securities Acts. SEB has alleged that Endo and certain of its officers consciously or recklessly made material representations and omissions regarding the safety and efficacy of reformulated Opana ER, resulting in a significant drop in Endo's share price. Therefore, we shall deny the motion to dismiss, except as to certain individuals who made no misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    SEB's Allegations in the Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Endo is a global pharmaceutical company that markets and sells branded opioids.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July 2006, Endo introduced Opana ER, its extended-release pain relief pill designed to work over a twelve-hour period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time, it was the only extended release version of oxymorphone hydrochloride on the market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its formulation made it highly susceptible to abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the drug is crushed and taken intranasally, the extended-release mechanisms no longer remain intact and 43% of its active ingredient is released immediately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2010, Endo submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for a reformulated version of Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The new drug was designed to make it more difficult to crush the tablets, reducing its propensity for abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   To support its NDA, Endo\n   provided studies assessing the abuse-deterrent properties of the new formulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though the data indicated some resistance to crushing by a pill crusher, it showed that tampering with the drug by other means could compromise the extended release feature, immediately releasing a full dosage of the drug.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on this information, FDA reviewers recommended excluding language claiming it was crush resistant from the drug's label.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   That same year, Endo settled its patent infringement suit against Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax), which had submitted the first Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to introduce a generic version of original Opana ER in 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Impax agreed to delay launching its generic version of original Opana ER until January 1, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Impax enjoyed first-filer status, other generic manufacturers were precluded from entering the market until 180 days after Impax's generic launch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 9, 2011, the FDA approved reformulated Opana ER, but denied Endo's request to label the drug as abuse-deterrent because the data did not support such a finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Endo began selling reformulated Opana ER in February 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Three months later, Endo notified the FDA that it planned to discontinue original Opana ER for safety reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   It anticipated the FDA would act quickly to withdraw all generic versions of the drug, effectively blocking competition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 10, 2012, because the FDA had not acted, Endo filed a Citizen Petition asking the FDA to determine that original Opana ER was discontinued for safety reasons, to reject pending ANDAs for generic versions of original Opana ER, and to withdraw approval of any ANDA for original Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 26, 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a public health alert for reformulated Opana ER after a dozen illnesses resembling thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a potentially fatal blood clotting disorder, were observed among intravenous abusers in Tennessee starting in February 2012 after the drug had been placed on the market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nonetheless, two weeks later on November 13, 2012, Endo supplemented its Citizen Petition with post-marketing surveillance data from the National Addictions Vigilance Intervention and Prevention Program (NAVIPPRO) and the Researched Abuse Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance System (RADARS),\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   which it claimed \"indicate[d] that the reformulated Opana ER [was] having the desired effect\n   on the rates and routes of abuse[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reports were not public, allowing Endo's summary of the data to go unchallenged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Endo also compared the new Opana ER to reformulated OxyContin to support its contention that reformulated Opana ER provided superior safety benefits over the original formulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   It did so because reformulated OxyContin was less likely to be abused because it was more difficult to inject.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, it claimed the introduction of reformulated crush-resistant Opana ER caused a dramatic decrease in abuse rates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 30, 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Endo filed a lawsuit against the FDA seeking a mandatory injunction requiring the FDA to rule on its Citizen Petition by December 31, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same day, it issued a press release claiming that surveillance data submitted in support of the Citizen Petition showed a substantial decrease in abuse rates of reformulated Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the press release, Endo's then-President and chief executive officer (CEO), David Holveck, represented there was enough evidence to conclude that original Opana ER had been discontinued for safety reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court dismissed the lawsuit three weeks later as groundless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, Impax's generic version of Opana ER went on the market on January 1, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 15, 2013, despite the unfavorable court decision, Endo submitted a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) seeking FDA approval for placing abuse-deterrent language on reformulated Opana ER's label.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The application relied upon the post-marketing studies in Endo's Citizen Petition and the same studies that had been submitted with the original application, which the FDA had concluded were inadequate to support abuse-deterrent labeling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The application did not disclose that Endo's own consultant had found that data from substance abuse treatment facilities across the nation did \"not necessarily establish that the reformulated Opana ER is tamper resistant\" and also \"that there were reports of higher levels of abuse of reformulated Opana ER via injection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Endo's Chief Operating Officer Julie McHugh, Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) Ivan Gergel, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Alan Levin, claimed that additional data indicated reformulated Opana ER was misused at lower rates than the original formula and its generic versions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs, Blaine Davis, also commented on the drug's success in reducing intranasal abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citing this data, Endo represented that it had introduced a safer version of\n   Opana ER in the market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 21, 2013, in a second supplement to its Citizen Petition, Endo provided preliminary studies demonstrating lower abuse rates of reformulated Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   It continued to claim that the NAVAPPRO and RADARS data, which was not public, showed a reduction in abuse of intended and unintended routes of administration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Meanwhile, the FDA approved abuse-deterrent labeling for reformulated OxyContin and granted OxyContin manufacturer Purdue's Citizen Petition seeking a determination that original OxyContin had been withdrawn for safety reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Seeking a similar determination, Endo submitted a third supplement to its Citizen Petition on April 23, 2013, which analogized reformulated Opana ER to reformulated OxyContin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Endo's President and CEO at the time, Rajiv Kanishka Liyanaarchchie De Silva, explained the purpose of the supplement was to emphasize the similarities between Opana ER and OxyContin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The two drugs were not the same. They each had different abuse-deterrent properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reformulated OxyContin was difficult to inject.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, the FDA had determined that reformulated Opana ER could be \"readily prepared for injection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, Endo and its officers publicly claimed in a supplement to its Citizen Petition that similarities between original Opana ER and original OxyContin required the FDA to make the same determination that it had for OxyContin's Citizen Petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 10, 2013, the FDA denied Endo's Citizen Petition and its sNDA requesting abuse-deterrent labeling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   It determined there was insufficient data to conclude that reformulated Opana ER reduced the potential for abuse or that the benefits of original Opana ER no longer outweighed its risks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the FDA found that reformulated Opana ER's extended-release qualities could be compromised when the pill was cut, ground or chewed, and that it could more easily be prepared for snorting and injection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also found the post-marketing data to be \"preliminary,\" \"inconclusive,\" and replete with deficiencies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to the FDA's decision, the price of Endo's common stock declined 5.28% on May 10, 2013. By May 13, 2013, Endo's common stock declined another 3.60%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In a press release issued on May 10, De Silva, while expressing disappointment with the FDA's decision, reiterated that the company presented data indicating that for every 100,000 prescriptions issued, the rate of abuse of reformulated Opana ER in the past 30 days was 79% lower than for generic non-reformulated versions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   De Silva did not distinguish between intranasal and intravenous abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   At a healthcare conference later that year, he also announced that Endo was conducting an \"active clinical program\" that would hopefully allow it to reapply for abuse-deterrent labeling by 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   By September 2014, Endo completed an insufflation study designed to assess intranasal abuse of the reformulated drug.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   The results suggested a deterrent effect for intranasal abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, when compared with results from earlier studies, they revealed an increase in intravenous abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the data, the FDA concluded that after Opana ER's reformulation there was a shift from inhalation abuse to injection abuse, a significant increase in injection abuse call rates, and a higher abuse call rate than for other opioids.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On April 24, 2015, the CDC issued a public health alert warning of another cluster of HIV-infections among persons who abused Opana ER intravenously.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Less than a month later, in a quarterly earnings call on May 11, 2015, De Silva announced an upcoming meeting with the FDA in June.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though De Silva expressed hope the meeting would advance Endo's labeling efforts, he cautioned that the FDA could deem the insufflation study data inadequate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 2, 2015, Endo filed a Registration Statement and prospectus announcing a $1.75 billion public offering of common stock (June 2015 Offering).\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Registration Statement was signed by the Individual Securities Act Defendants, including CFO and Executive Vice President Suketu Upadhyay, Chief Accounting Officer and Vice President Daniel Rudio, and members of the Board of Directors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two days later, Endo offered an additional 24 million shares of common stock at a price of $83.25 per share.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the June 10 market close, Endo had issued over 27 million shares of common stock at $83.25 per share, yielding $2.3 billion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 10, 2015, in its second quarter earnings call to investors and analysts, Endo announced plans to submit a supplemental request for abuse-deterrent labeling by the end of 2015 or early 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its November 9, 2015 report, Endo stressed the crush resistance of reformulated Opana ER while withholding what it knew about the increase in intravenous abuse the post-marketing data had shown.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Endo did not reveal that the data demonstrated a rise in serious adverse events associated with intravenous abuse, particularly TTP and thrombotic microangiopathy\n   (TMA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   During the Stifel Nicolaus Healthcare Conference on November 17, 2015, De Silva reported to the attendees that Endo's submission for re-labeling would include the results of its insufflation study and two years of epidemiological data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time he expressed confidence in the sufficiency of the data, he cautioned that the FDA may have a different view.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On January 29, 2016, relying on the insufflation study and ongoing epidemiological studies based on NAVIPPRO and RADARS data, Endo re-submitted its sNDA requesting a label change.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his February 29, 2016 quarterly earnings call, De Silva opined that Endo's data package \"could support an abuse deterrent formulation label expansion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On June 16, 2016, the FDA announced that it would convene an advisory committee to review Endo's data and to gather input on abuse patterns associated with reformulated Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two months later, citing an August 11, 2016 discussion with the FDA, Endo unexpectedly withdrew the sNDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its press release, Endo's Executive Vice President and CSO, Susan Hall, announced that, despite the withdrawal, Endo planned to generate additional data to \"appropriately advance\" Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On January 10, 2017, the FDA announced a joint meeting of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively, Advisory Committee) to discuss the marketing data regarding abuse of reformulated Opana ER, the risk-benefit of the product, and abuse of generic oxymorphone ER and oxymorphone immediate-release products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to the announcement, the price of Endo common stock declined 6.70% and 8.49% on January 10 and 11, 2017, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Endo dismissed the importance of the Advisory Committee meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked about his level of concern, Endo's new President and CEO, Paul Campanelli, indicated that Endo's studies supported\n   the safety of the drug when used as intended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also suggested the meeting's purpose was to discuss all oxymorphone products, not just Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On March 9, 2017, in advance of the Advisory Committee meeting, the FDA published its briefing documents, which included its preliminary views on the safety and abuse-deterrent properties of reformulated Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   The documents reflected that Endo's post-marketing abuse data presented a \"compelling case\" that there was an overall increase in abuse and a shift from intranasal to intravenous abuse following reformulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to this news, the price of Endo common stock fell by 2.5% to $10.53 per share.\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At its meeting on March 14, 2017, the Advisory Committee concluded that the benefits of reformulated Opana ER did not outweigh its risks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   The price of Endo common stock declined 4.22% to $10.22 per share.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Analysts immediately issued reports commenting on the uncertainty of reformulated Opana ER's future and the possibility of the drug's withdrawal from the market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Addressing the Advisory Committee's action in a March 14, 2017 press release, Matthew Davis, a Senior Vice President, reiterated the company's confidence in its clinical research which he claimed demonstrated that Opana ER had \"a favorable risk-benefit profile\" when used as intended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   Campanelli indicated that, pending any follow up conversations with the FDA, it was still \"business as usual\" with Opana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On June 8, 2017, the FDA announced it had asked Endo to withdraw reformulated Opana ER from the market voluntarily.\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on its review of all available post-marketing data, the FDA concluded that Opana ER's reformulation caused a significant increase in intravenous abuse and serious outbreaks of HIV and hepatitis C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDA sought removal of the drug because the benefits no longer outweighed the risks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was the first time the agency had taken such action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the price of Endo common stock dropped 16.62% to close at $11.49 per share the next day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n

SEB claims that the Exchange Act Defendants knew as early as 2010 that reformulated Opana ER could be compromised. To support its New Drug Application filed in July 2010, Endo relied upon studies that, according to SEB, showed that reformulated Opana ER could still be ground, cut, or chewed to release a full dosage at once, and be more easily injected than the original formula.\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the FDA denied Endo's request for abuse-deterrent labeling in December 2011 because the drug provided limited resistance to abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In supplements to its Citizen Petition, Endo repeatedly claimed that NAVIPPRO and RADARS post-marketing reports from 2012 and 2013 showed significantly lower abuse rates for reformulated Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDA denied Endo's Citizen Petition in May 2013 because it found that the same data suggested that reformulated Opana ER's extended release features could still be compromised when cut, ground, or chewed, and that it was more readily prepared for injection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n   It concluded\n   that the data was preliminary, inconclusive and suffered from \"significant additional deficiencies,\" including the small sample size and the likely misclassification of drug exposure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDA found that even if the data had been reliable, it still suggested the \"troubling possibility\" that reformulated Opana ER was being abused intravenously at greater rates than the original drug.\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   SEB's allegations, if proven, will establish that when they made the statements, the defendants were aware of the negative information.

They express optimism and, at the same time, warn that the FDA may have a different review of the data. But, the statements are incomplete. They were not accompanied by disclosure of the actual increase in intravenous abuse. That increase in abuse was certain to negatively impact the FDA's decision. Thus, because they did not disclose facts that contradicted them, the statements do not qualify for protection under the safe harbor provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In an August 12, 2016 press release, Susan Hall, who was Executive Vice President and CSO at the time, was quoted, \"We anticipate the generation of additional data and we will seek collaboration with FDA to appropriately advance OPANA \u00ae ER.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   This statement was not \"false or misleading.\" Hall stated only that she believed that Endo would produce additional data and attempt to collaborate with the FDA to \"appropriately advance\" the drug. She did not comment on what that data might show, whether the FDA would agree to collaborate with Endo, and, even if it did, what might be the result of any \"appropriate advancement\" of Opana ER. Her statement was an accurate description of Endo's plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   A March 2017 press release quotes Matthew Davis, then Senior Vice President, Research &amp; Development Branded Pharmaceuticals, as saying, \"Endo remains confident that the body of evidence established through clinical research demonstrates that OPANA \u00ae ER has a favorable risk-benefit profile when used as intended in appropriate patients[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statement was true. It was also qualified because it used the words \"when used as intended in appropriate patients.\" Indeed, the press release, commenting on the Advisory Committee's vote, announced that it would \"evaluate the range of available options for maintaining access for legitimate use.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   The press release promised nothing more. Therefore, the statement was not a misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   During the May 9, 2017 quarterly earnings call, Paul Campanelli, the President and Chief Executive Officer, answered questions regarding Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   He claimed it was \"business as usual\" with the drug.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated that Endo was \"being a little proactive\" about the \"things that we had pitched at the Ad Com\" and that Endo wanted to \"follow up\" with the FDA regarding reformulated Opana ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated that Endo was \"in preparation on concepts and ideas\" that it wanted to communicate to the FDA, but acknowledged that at that time any such communications or follow up would be \"premature\" and that no formal discussions had taken place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   SEB characterizes these comments\n   as \"downplaying\" the import of the Advisory Committee's vote and \"touting\" the possibility that reformulated Opana ER would remain on the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Campanelli's optimism appears to be unwarranted in light of the Committee's vote that the drug's benefits did not outweigh its risks. However, he was not hiding anything. A few days prior to the vote, the FDA published briefing documents showing that Endo's own post-marketing surveillance data and the insufflation and epidemiological studies had demonstrated a shift to intravenous abuse. At that point, the truth was out. Campanelli's optimistic statements regarding future discussions with the FDA were mere puffery that did not alter the mix of substantive information available to investors. They also contained cautionary language regarding the \"premature\" timing of any discussions with the FDA and an acknowledgement that no formal discussions had occurred. His statements are not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In summary, the Exchange Act Defendants did not guarantee favorable outcomes. Nor did they represent the data was absolutely sufficient for FDA approval. They warned that the FDA may have a different view of the sufficiency of the data. They conveyed their personal assessments of the information.

But, when considered in context with the actual known data showing an increase in intravenous abuse, the statements of Blaine Davis, Gergel, McHugh, Levin and De Silva are not protected because they did not identify the data that contradicted those statements. These defendants expressed optimism that approval of abuse-deterrent labeling would come. When they did so, they emphasized the favorable abuse data in support of their FDA submissions without disclosing the unfavorable data. Withholding the evidence of increased intravenous abuse, undoubtedly would, as indeed it did, influence the FDA's decision.

If the new drug was not abuse deterrent, there was no chance of obtaining FDA approval of abuse-deterrent labeling. Thus, if the data showing an increase in intravenous abuse were known, investors would think that FDA approval would be jeopardized, in which case the new drug, without abuse-deterrent labeling, would be a less desirable product and less likely to be prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   De Silva's inaction advanced the fraud and makes him a culpable participant in the fraud. He had access to and knowledge of detailed information regarding the data for reformulated Opana ER. This data contradicted the statements made by those subordinate to him, but he failed to disclose it. Thus, SEB has stated a \u00a7 20(a) claim against De Silva.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   No other Individual Exchange Act Defendant controlled Levin, Gergel, McHugh or Blaine Davis at the time of their misleading\n   statements in February and March 2013.
