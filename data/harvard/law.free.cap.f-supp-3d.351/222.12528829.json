On April 23, 2013, this action was transferred from Judge Spatt to this Court. (04/23/13 docket entry.) Following the completion of discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment. (Dkts. 139, 140.) On May 22, 2015, the Court dismissed two of Plaintiff's three constitutional claims, leaving only the instant Second Amendment challenge to proceed to trial.\n   <em>\n    Maloney v.

At trial, Plaintiff presented the following evidence: (1) Plaintiff's own testimony about his history of nunchaku use; (2) testimony of retired Sergeant Kevin Orcutt of the Denver Police Department about his patented nunchaku, the Orcutt Police Nunchaku (\"OPN\"), which is used exclusively by law enforcement agencies; (3) purported expert testimony of a martial arts school (\"dojo\") operator, Christopher Pellitteri; (4) testimony of Susan Saraceni, Chief Financial Officer of Asian World of Martial Arts (\"AWMA\"), a martial arts weapons distributor, discussing AWMA's sales data; and (5) exhibits documenting various forms of martial arts practice that incorporate the use of nunchaku and AWMA's sales data for nunchaku. At trial, Defendant presented: (1) the testimony of Catherine Rice, an employee of the Nassau County Internet Technology Department, who testified about Nassau County's nunchaku crime statistics, and (2) exhibits documenting the legislative history of New York Penal Law \u00a7 265.01(1) and Federal Bureau of Justice statistics on weapons used in crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the trial, the parties submitted Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52. (Dkts. 184 (Plaintiff), 185 (Defendant).) However, after reviewing the trial record and the parties' post-trial submissions, the Court determined that both parties had neglected to consider the Second Circuit's leading case on Second Amendment challenges,\n   <em>\n    New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Cuomo\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    NYSRPA\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358143\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/242/\">\n    804 F.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2015), which was decided\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Court's summary judgment ruling, but\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   trial. (Dkt. 188.) In\n   <em>\n    NYSRPA\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , clarified that the\n   <em>\n    government\n   </em>\n   bears the burden of proving that the activity that is the subject of the challenged legislation falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358143\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/242/\">\n    804 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   257 n.73 (explaining that the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

(Dkt. 188.) The Court also admonished the parties for not addressing the level of constitutional scrutiny to be applied to Plaintiff's claim in their post-trial briefing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 6-7.) The Court re-opened the trial to allow the parties to conduct additional discovery and to supplement the evidentiary record at trial to address these errors. (Dkts. 188, 191, 192, 193.) In the end, the parties chose to stipulate to the admission of additional documentary evidence offered by each side and to supplement the trial record solely with paper exhibits and argument, and no additional live testimony. (Dkts. 195, 196, 199, 202, 203, 204, 206.) Plaintiff's lone additional exhibit was a video of a Subaru commercial in which a child\n   is shown with nunchaku in his backpack. (Dkt. 203.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant's additional evidence included: (1) legislative history materials of New York Penal Law \u00a7 265.01 ; (2) sales data for nunchaku from five additional manufacturers; and (3) a response to Plaintiff's Subaru commercial. (Dkts. 199, 199-1, 199-9, 199-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 1, 2018, after receiving the parties' supplemental trial submissions, the Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   amended its July 23, 2017 order to further clarify the applicable burden of persuasion.\n   <em>\n    Maloney v.

Oct. 1, 2018). The Court explained that, with respect to the threshold issue of whether the possession of nunchaku falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment, Defendant cannot meet her burden simply by demonstrating that nunchakus are not \"in common use,\" but that Defendant must show, at a minimum, that nunchakus are \"not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court permitted the parties to submit supplemental briefing in response to the Court's amended order; that briefing was completed on November 12, 2018. (Dkt. 212 (Plaintiff), 213 (Defendant).) On December 5, 2018, the Court held oral argument (\"Oral Argument\").

Maloney wishes to teach Shafan Ha Lavan to his twin sons, but is unable to do so due to New York's nunchaku ban.

The Nunchaku Ban: New York Penal Law \u00a7 265.01(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Since 1974, New York has had a complete ban on the possession of nunchaku by private citizens. (Dkt. 184, at 2;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 199-1.) New York Penal Law \u00a7 265.01(1) (\" Section 265.01(1)\") criminalizes possession of nunchaku, along with a host of other banned weapons, as a Class A misdemeanor. \"A person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree when: (1) [h]e or she possesses any firearm, electronic dart gun, electronic stun gun, gravity knife, switchblade\n   knife, pilum ballistic knife, metal knuckle knife, cane sword, billy, blackjack, bludgeon, plastic knuckles, metal knuckles,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     chuka stick\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , sand bag, sandclub, wrist-brace type slingshot or slungshot, shirken or 'Kung Fu star.' \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20265.01\">\n    N.Y.

The ban on nunchaku arose out of a concern that, as a result of the rising popularity \"of 'Kung Fu' movies and shows,\" \"various circles of the state's youth\"-including \"muggers and street gangs\"-were \"widely\" using nunchaku to cause \"many serious injuries.\" (Dkt. 199-1, at ECF\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   4-5 (letter from New York Attorney General Louis J.

It is primarily used for self-defense and as a weapon. (Tr. 212:25-213:6 (Testimony of Christopher Pellitteri).) There are no licensing or permit requirements for nunchaku possession in the United States. (Tr. 88:25-89:3 (Testimony of James Maloney).) There are two basic styles of nunchaku use: the traditional, \"practical\" style, which is \"striking and blocking,\" and freestyle, which is \"more flashy, spinning, less effective, [and] more coordination based.\" (Tr. 239:1-8 (Testimony of Christopher Pellitteri).) Additionally, the OPN is used by a number of law enforcement agencies across the country. (Tr. 119:12-16, 127:25-128:4, 130:9-12, 201:1-7, 209:5-7 (Testimony of Kevin Orcutt).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Data Regarding the Prevalence of Nunchaku\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At trial, the parties collectively submitted nunchaku sales data from six American nunchaku distributors: (1) American Nunchaku Company; (2) KarateDepot.com,\n   a.k.a.

I &amp; J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Based on the data provided, at least 64,890 metal and wood nunchakus were sold to individuals\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the United States between 1995 and 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   No evidence has been presented to explain what percentage of the United States nunchaku market share this data represents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 354:25-358:18 (Testimony of Susan Saraceni).) No reliable data was submitted about how many martial arts schools or dojos use nunchaku.

Plaintiff's Claim for Declaratory Relief and the Court's Limited Authority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court clarifies the scope of Plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief in terms of the remedy he is seeking and can obtain in this action. Despite the above-quoted language from the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has, at times, suggested that he does not seek to have New York's nunchaku ban struck down in its entirety, but rather, seeks to have Section 265.01(1) declared unconstitutional\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   as applied to home possession and use of nunchaku. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 212, at 4 (stating \"the challenge is solely to the ban as applied to simple in-home possession\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Tr. 66:21-67:22 (Plaintiff explaining that he is seeking a declaration that, under the Second Amendment, he should be allowed to use nunchaku in his home for \"[his] personal use, for home defense purposes, ... [a]nd for any other lawful use that they may have\").) However, while Plaintiff is clear about the relief he wants, i.e., to be able to legally use nunchaku in his home, he fails to appreciate that the Court lacks the authority to rewrite Section 265.01(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While courts, under some circumstances, might be able to reform a statute to make it constitutional by \"sever[ing] its problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact,\" that is not possible here given how Section 265.01(1) is constructed.\n   <em>\n    Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N.
