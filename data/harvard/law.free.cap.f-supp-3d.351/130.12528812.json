Office-initiated details occur if an office determines that it needs to detail an employee into an office unit to meet organizational needs. Def. SUMF, ECF # 30-1 \u00b6 3. Employee-initiated details, however, are based on an employee's desire to work outside her usual office, not organizational needs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Tran's request was employee-initiated.

The Treasury concedes that the Privacy Act protects employees' performance appraisals, the Treasury disclosed the record, and it did not get Ms. Tran's consent beforehand. But the Treasury argues that the disclosure\n   was permissible under the Privacy Act's \"routine use\" exception,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552a(b)(3), and its \"need-to-know\" exception,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552a(b)(1).

But disclosure is also proper where any of twelve enumerated exceptions applies, \u00a7 552a(b)(1)-(12). According to the Treasury, two enumerated exceptions apply here: the \"routine use\" exception, \u00a7 552a(b)(3), and the \"need-to-know\" exception, \u00a7 552a(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 552a(b)(3) allows agencies to disclose otherwise protected records \"for a routine use as defined in subsection (a)(7).\" A \"routine use,\" for the disclosure of a record, is the use of a record \"for a purpose which is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(a)(7). Agencies must publish in the Federal Register \"each routine use of the records contained in the system, including the categories of users and the purpose of such use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552a(e)(4)(D). These regulations are known as Systems of Records Notice (SORNs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Treasury maintains that SORN 36.003,\n   <em>\n    General Personnel and Payroll Records\n   </em>\n   , covers the disclosure here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2054101\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 54101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sept. 8, 2015). This SORN applies to current and former employees of the Treasury and covers records, like Ms. Tran's performance appraisal, in the employee's Employee Performance File. The Treasury first points to SORN 36.003(3), which allows it to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [d]isclose information to a Federal, state, local, or tribal agency, or other public authority, which has requested information relevant or necessary to hiring or retaining an employee, or issuing or continuing a contract, security clearance, license, grant, or other benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Next, the Treasury points to SORN 36.003(9), which allows it to \"[d]isclose information to a prospective employer of an IRS employee or former IRS employee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to the Treasury, it was a \"prospective employer\" of Ms. Tran and her detail request was a hiring action. Thus, it argues that either SORN 36.003(3) or 36.003(9) covers the disclosure of Ms. Tran's performance appraisal. But the Treasury has not shown that it was a \"prospective employer\" or that Ms. Tran's detail was a \"hiring\" action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The problem with the Treasury's theory is that when Ms. Tran requested a detail, the Treasury was already her employer. As discussed, Ms. Tran was an attorney with OPR, a Treasury component. The Treasury has not shown how it may qualify simultaneously as a current employer and a \"prospective employer\" under SORN 36.003(9), and it has cited no caselaw to support its position. Just as a hungry child may not have his cake and eat it too, so an agency may not employ someone and also be her prospective employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nor has the Treasury showed that a detail is a hiring action under SORN 36.003(3). As Ms. Tran points out, federal statutes and regulations that authorize executive agencies to hire non-employees are distinct from those that authorize agencies to detail current employees to different offices within the agency.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203301\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (appointments)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203341\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (details);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209510\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (c). When an agency details an employee, it has already hired her; the employee is merely being assigned temporarily to a different position within the employing organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Treasury complains that this reasoning relies on a too miserly a definition of \"hiring.\" It cites Black's Law Dictionary to define \"hire\": \"to engage the labor or services of another for wages or other payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10 ed., 2014). The Treasury argues that it was considering engaging Ms. Tran-for wages-in a position within the agency. But it was already true that the Treasury was engaging Ms. Tran's services for wages, and the Treasury has not established that a detail qualifies as a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   hiring action. Nor has it meaningfully addressed Ms. Tran's argument that details are distinct from hiring actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, the Treasury argues that the \"routine use\" exception applies because SORN 36.003(3) permits the agency to disclose \"information to a Federal ... public authority, which has requested information relevant or necessary to ... issuing or continuing a ... benefit.\" But when an agency publishes the routine uses for a record, it must include \"the purposes of such use,\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(3)(4)(D), and the broad term \"benefit\" does not provide adequate notice of the purposes for which the Treasury may release an employee's information.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Britt v. Naval Invest. Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531644\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/544/#p547\">\n    886 F.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547-48 (3d Cir. 1989).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Treasury has pointed to no authority for its argument that a work detail qualifies as a \"benefit\" under SORN 36.003(3), and reliance on such overboard terms to argue that a disclosure is permitted after the fact frustrates \u00a7 552a(3)(4)(D)'s publication requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This is especially true given the Treasury's proposed far-reaching definition of \"benefit\" under SORN 36.003(3). The Treasury claims that because employee-initiated detail requests give employees the opportunity to gain knowledge and experience outside their normal work section, \"such a detail is a 'benefit[.]' \" Def. Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF # 33 pp. 5-6. Essentially, the Treasury argues that anything that is desirable, beneficial, or helpful is a \"benefit\" under SORN 36.003(3). But such an open definition cannot satisfy \u00a7 552a(3)(4)(D)'s requirement that agencies notify individuals of the purposes for which their information may be used. What is more, the terms that immediately precede \"benefit\" in SORN 36.003(3)-\"contract, security clearance, license, grant\"-show that \"benefit\" denotes a narrower and more technical meaning. And the scope of routine uses is confined by the published definitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Fla.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"356406\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/768/1229/#p1231\">\n    768 F.2d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231-32 (11th Cir. 1985). The Treasury, however, has not shown that a work detail fits within this narrower universe of benefits contemplated under SORN 36.003(3). Thus, neither SORN 36.003(3) nor 36.003(9) covers the disclosure of Ms. Tran's performance appraisal, and the \"routine use\" exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Treasury's next argument is on the money. Section 552a(b)(1) is known as the intra-agency \"need-to-know\" exception.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174754\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/808/192/#p200\">\n    808 F.Supp.2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200-02 (D.D.C. 2011). It permits agencies to disclose otherwise protected records \"to officers and employees of the agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b)(1). The Treasury correctly contends that this section permits the disclosure of Ms. Tran's performance appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, the disclosure here was \"intra-agency,\" because both OPR and SB/SE are Treasury components. Ms. Tran does not argue otherwise. And other courts that have considered Privacy Act claims involving disclosures between separate offices within a department have evaluated claims from the Executive Department-level perspective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Sussman\n   </em>\n   considered whether the Marshals Service violated the Privacy Act by disclosing information to the FBI that implicated the plaintiff in various financial crimes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174754\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/808/192/#p200\">\n    808 F.Supp.2d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both the Marshals Service and the FBI are components of the Department of Justice.

The\n   court explained that from the department-level perspective, \"DOJ, insofar as it maintains the USMS records at issue, does not disclose those records to the FBI as a separate agency that does not maintain such records; instead, DOJ discloses those records to\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   , insofar as it maintains FBI records as well.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174754\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/808/192/#p200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174754\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/808/192/#p200\">\n    at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1561949\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/400/1/\">\n    400 F.Supp.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (evaluating disclosures among offices within the Department of State). So too here. While OPR and SB/SE are separate offices within the Treasury, from the department-level perspective the Treasury maintains the records of both offices and the disclosure was intra-agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, the Treasury employees who examined Ms. Tran's performance appraisal had a \"need-to-know\" the information. \"What matters ... is the 'need-to-know' of the agency official who\n   <em>\n    received\n   </em>\n   the disclosure....\"\n   <em>\n    Cacho v.

Nov. 28, 2006) (emphasis in original). And \"[s]ection 552a(b)(1) does not require an agency to list those of its officers eligible to look at protected records, nor does it demand that an agency official be specifically assigned to examining records.\"\n   <em>\n    Bigelow v.

Cir. 2000). Instead, the Court should determine \"whether the official examined the record in connection with the performance of duties assigned to him and whether he had to do so to perform those duties properly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11197688,3674967\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/875/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, did the examining official have a legitimate purpose for the review, or was he improperly accessing an employee's private records?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, the disclosure of Ms. Tran's performance appraisal to Ms. Romano, Mr. Rath, and the front-line managers in the D.C. field office falls comfortably within \u00a7 552a(b)(1). Remember that Ms. Tran began this disclosure-although perhaps unwittingly-by applying for a detail in this office. Mr. Meneely then tasked the Area Counsel and front-line managers with evaluating Ms. Tran's detail request and recommending whether to approve it. As he explained, \"[t]hey're the people that have to train and manage any potential detailee.\" Meneely Dep., ECF # 32-13 p. 52:18-20. The only time that these individuals examined Ms. Tran's performance appraisal was in performing their assigned duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   And they had a need-to-know the information in Ms. Tran's performance appraisal to perform their assigned duty properly. Agencies often invoke the \"need-to-know\" exception when they release records for a disciplinary investigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bigelow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11197688,3674967\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/875/\">\n    217 F.3d at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But it equally applies to a detail decision. Both are decisions about whether an employee is fit for a position within the agency or can perform certain duties. Both are triggered by the employee's actions, not supervisory caprice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In evaluating whether a potential detailee has the requisite experience to benefit SB/SE, it would be necessary to know certain information from the performance appraisal. For example, the performance appraisal rates employees on legal skills,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"Written Work,\" \"Oral Communication,\" and \"Legal Interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tran Performance Appraisal, ECF # 32-6. Because SB/SE's role is to provide legal advice and guidance on tax litigation, that information would be necessary to evaluating whether the office would benefit from the potential detailee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Privacy Act certainly does not require agencies to make uninformed personnel decisions. Indeed, courts have recognized that \"[t]he 'need-to-know' exception permits the disclosure of a person's protected record to a supervisor who needs the information contained in the record to assess the person's trustworthiness and make related personnel\n   decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Cacho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203422548\">\n    2006 WL 3422548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

And the front-line managers recommended against approving Ms. Tran's detail request in part because \"they did not believe that Ms. Tran had the litigation skillset needed to be a docket attorney in the D.C. field office.\" Meneely Dep., ECF # 32-13 p. 42:16-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But Ms. Tran complains that Mr. Meneely, who supervises the Area Counsel and front-line managers just discussed, did not need to view her performance appraisal to perform his duties. Not so. Of course, \"the need to know exception is not limited only to officers and employees within a certain office within an agency rather than to officers and employees of the entire agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780541\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/660/31/#p45\">\n    660 F.Supp.2d at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). In\n   <em>\n    Hanna v.

Courts have recognized that the \"need-to-know\" exception \"encompasses personnel matters,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Viotti v.

Colo. 1995), and Mr. Meneely would have needed to know the information disclosed about Ms. Tran because of his supervisory role in determining her suitability for a detail in his office.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780541\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/660/31/#p45\">\n    660 F.Supp.2d at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As the 'highest-ranking officers' in the office, with 'supervisory and disciplinary authority over the plaintiff,' the Criminal Chief and the Acting U.S. Attorney had a need to know the information disclosed about he plaintiff.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, Mr. Meneely examined Ms. Tran's performance appraisal only in the performance of duties assigned to him and he needed to know this information to perform those duties properly. Ms. Moe tasked Mr. Meneely with shepherding Ms. Tran's detail request through the process, reviewing the recommendation of the front-line managers, and making the final recommendation about her request. Mr. Meneely testified that when SB/SE received a detail request, Ms. Moe would route it \"to one of the deputy division counsel, either [Mr. Meneely] or Joe Spires ..., and [Ms.] Moe in 2016 would have tasked one of them with shepherding [the request] through the process.\" Meneely Dep. at p. 17:4-10. Ms. Moe included Mr. Meneely on her initial email about Ms. Tran's detail request to Ms. Manasevit. And she asked that Mr. Meneely speak with Ms. Tran's supervisor and stated that SB/SE would be seeking information about Ms. Tran's qualifications and performance history. More, Ms. Moe tasked Mr. Meneely with making the final recommendation for or against the detail to F&amp;M,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780541\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/660/31/#p45\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at pp. 24: 1-25:1, which he did in consultation with her,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780541\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/660/31/#p45\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at pp. 24: 19-25:1, 25:12-19, 49:3-18. To perform these duties properly, Mr. Meneely appropriately examined Ms. Tran's performance appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ms. Tran argues that Mr. Meneely relied heavily on front-line supervisors for a recommendation on her detail and that his concern was only that the detailee was licensed to practice before the U.S. Tax Court. She also notes that Mr. Meneely discussed the front-line manager's recommendation with Ms. Moe before relaying SB/SE's recommendation to F&amp;M. She suggests that he was just a go-between who had no substantive role in the decision,\n   making his peering into her records extraneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But just because Mr. Meneely delegated fact-finding tasks to front-line supervisors does not vitiate his responsibility to review their recommendation and make a final recommendation regarding the detail. Reviewing their recommendation properly involved reviewing the information on which they based their recommendation, including Mr. Tran's performance appraisal. And while Mr. Meneely may have deferred to his front-line managers about the specific skillsets that the detailee would need, he still would need confirm that Ms. Tran had at least a fully satisfactory rating on her performance appraisal under SB/SE's policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780541\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/660/31/#p45\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 21: 4-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, while Mr. Meneely discussed the front-line supervisors' recommendation with Ms. Moe before making a final decision, that does not create a genuine dispute about his duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, Mr. Meneely directly reported to Ms. Moe, and as Division Counsel, she had authority to recommend granting or denying the detail request. So even though she had referred Ms. Tran's request to Mr. Meneely, it would be reasonable for him to confer with her about the final recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Meneely testified that because Ms. Moe had initially assigned him Ms. Tran's detail request, he felt it necessary to \"keep her in the loop.\" Meneely Dep., ECF\n   <em>\n    #\n   </em>\n   32-13 p. 24:16-25:1. The record shows that he did review the front-line supervisors' recommendation and discussed it with Ms. Moe,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780541\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/660/31/#p45\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 24: 21-25:1, 49:3-18, before informing F &amp; M that SB/SE recommended against approving Ms. Tran's request,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780541\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/660/31/#p45\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at p. 25: 12-19. None of this undermines Mr. Meneely's testimony that Ms. Moe had delegated to him responsibility for Ms. Tran's detail request. Ms. Tran has failed to establish that there is a genuine issue of fact about Mr. Meneely's duties for her detail request or that in performing those duties he needed to know the information in her performance appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For all these reasons, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.
