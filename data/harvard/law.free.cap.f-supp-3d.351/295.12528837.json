(Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. 10; Dkt. 12), and Plaintiff's reply (Dkt. 13). For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 10) is granted, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 12) is denied, and the matter is remanded to the Commissioner for further administrative proceeds consistent with this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed her application for SSI on July 2, 2014.

A video hearing was held before administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") Paul Greenberg on July 22, 2016. (Dkt. 8-2 at 16, 34-65). Plaintiff appeared and testified in Rochester, New York, and the ALJ presided over the hearing from Alexandria, Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On December 7, 2016, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision. (Dkt. 8-2 at 10-27).

If the impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a Listing and meets the durational requirement (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.909), the claimant is disabled. If not, the ALJ determines the claimant's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), which is the ability to perform physical or mental work activities on a sustained basis, notwithstanding limitations for the collective impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ALJ then proceeds to step four and determines whether the claimant's RFC permits the claimant to perform the requirements of his or her past relevant work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(f).

The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's\n   medically determinable impairments of asthma, seizure disorder, sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hand dysfunction, and affective disorder, were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listing 1.04 in reaching his conclusion, as well as considering the effect of Plaintiff's obesity as required by Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") 02-1p. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   cannot climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds.

[Plaintiff] must be able to sit for five minutes after standing for 30 minutes, or stand for 5 minutes after sitting for 30 minutes, but she can continue working in either position. [Plaintiff] cannot work in a job where she is isolated from co-workers. She cannot work around unprotected heights or moving mechanical equipment.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of produce weigher, racker, and inspector and hand packager.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27).

Some of these reports are vague, checklist-type appraisals, while others (such as the medical source statement provided by Eun Ha Lee, M.D.) clearly state that the content was based on the claimant's 'verbal report' and was not assessed based on objective measures (Ex. 41F/2). Therefore, whether these were checkmark-type opinions generated in connection with the work requirements of the local jurisdiction, or just subjective assessments relying substantially on the claimant's self-reports, they do not apply the same standards as the Social Security Administration's disability processes. Furthermore, the opinions in some instances offer starkly different assessments, which highlights the difficulty in relying on these types of checklist forms as opposed to narrative-based explanations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Dkt. 8-2 at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court finds that the ALJ's collective consideration of these many medical opinions was error. As an initial matter, the ALJ failed to specifically mention the names of several of the sources of these medical opinions (save for Dr. Lee), and rather referred to exhibit numbers to identify the opinions. Missing from the laundry list of exhibits (\"Ex. 10F; 16F; 18F; 19F; 28F; 41F\") are the Exhibit numbers corresponding with the June 10, 2016 opinion by Dr. Weerasinghe (Ex. 35F) and the August 26, 2014 opinion by Dr. Henderson (Ex. 20F), which indicates that the ALJ did not even consider these opinions by Plaintiff's treating physicians. In fact, there is no mention of these opinions anywhere in the written determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Significantly, the June 10, 2016 opinion by Dr. Weerasinghe assessed serious limitations, inconsistent with the ability to perform light work. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-7 at 424-25 (according to Dr. Weerasinghe, Plaintiff's pain and symptoms would constantly interfere with the attention and concentration\n   needed to perform simple work tasks, Plaintiff could walk only one city block without rest or severe pain, and Plaintiff could only sit, stand, and walk about two hours in an eight-hour day) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ALJ's failure to consider and address these opinions alone was error warranting remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reiber v.

LEXIS 30627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2011). Likewise, it is unclear to the Court whether the ALJ intended to give Dr. Brownfeld's opinions \"limited weight\" or \"some weight\", as the ALJ first indicated that he gave limited weight to the opinion at Exhibit 19F (Dr. Brownfeld's opinion), but later stated that he gave \"some weight to the assessments of psychologist Adam Brownfeld, Ph.D. (Ex. 19F).\" Because the ALJ's reasoning for rejecting several opinions in the record is abundantly unclear to the Court, the matter must be remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, Drs. Henderson and Weerasinghe were Plaintiff's treating physicians and therefore, their opinions were entitled to controlling weight if well-supported by and not inconsistent with the other medical evidence of record. As noted above, the ALJ failed to discuss the August 26, 2014 opinion by Dr. Henderson and the June 10, 2016 opinion by Dr. Weerasinghe. He did cite to the October 24, 2014 physical assessment by Dr. Henderson and the May 6, 2016 physical assessment by Dr. Weerasinghe, at Exhibits 10F and 28F. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-2 at 24). The ALJ assigned only \"limited weight\" to these opinions; accordingly, pursuant to the regulations, the ALJ was required to consider: \"(i) the frequency of examination and the length, nature and extent of the treatment relationship; (ii) the evidence in support of the treating physician's opinion; (iii) the consistency of the opinion with the record as a whole; (iv) whether the opinion is from a specialist; and (v) other factors\n   brought to the Social Security Administration's attention that tend to support or contradict the opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n    362 F.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n    at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (when the treating physician's opinion is not afforded controlling weight, the ALJ must nonetheless \"comprehensively set forth reasons for the weight\" ultimately assigned to the treating source). Here, the ALJ's consideration of the October 2014 opinion of Dr. Henderson and the May 2016 opinion of Dr. Weerasinghe fell far short of the comprehensive explanation required by the treating physician rule, in that the ALJ failed to discuss the nature of the relationship between the medical sources and Plaintiff; the evidence in the record supporting the opinions; whether the opinions were from specialists; or whether the opinions were consistent with the record as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant argues that although the ALJ discounted medical opinions in the record \"as a group,\" this was proper because the \"form, cursory opinions warranted the analysis the ALJ provided.\" (Dkt. 12-1 at 24). However, \"[e]ven if [a treating source's] opinions do not merit controlling weight, the ALJ must explain what weight [he] gave those opinions and must articulate good reasons for not crediting the opinions of a claimant's treating physician.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-CV-958 (DLI),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202496585\">\n    2009 WL 2496585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2071740\">\n    2009 U.S. Dist.

In other words, the fact that an ALJ believes that a treating source opinion should not be afforded controlling weight does not excuse him from meaningfully considering the opinion and adequately explaining his reasons for not adopting the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While the Court is cognizant that \"[a]n ALJ does not have to explicitly walk through [all the relevant] factors, so long as the Court can conclude that the ALJ applied the substance of the treating physician rule,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scitney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343603\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/41/289/#p301\">\n    41 F.Supp.3d at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted), here, the ALJ simply afforded the opinions limited weight based on the fact that \"they do not apply the same standards as the Social Security Administration's disability processes.\" (Dkt. 8-2 at 24). It is not clear from the written determination that the ALJ even considered the requirements of the treating physician rule when weighing these opinions. On remand, should the ALJ assign less than controlling weight to the opinions of Drs. Henderson and Weerasinghe, he should explain his reasoning for doing so, paying particular consideration to the criteria of the treating physician rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Remaining Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As set forth above, Plaintiff has identified additional reasons why she contends the ALJ's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.
