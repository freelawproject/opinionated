Cox is currently serving a sentence of ten years imprisonment, followed by ten years of post-release supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cox was charged with one count of first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act. The victim, \"H.B.,\" alleged that Cox raped her and orally and anally sodomized her at her home on the evening of February 14, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After a non-jury trial, the court found Cox guilty of the two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act, but not guilty of first-degree rape. On appeal, the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, held that the third count, charging Cox with engaging in anal sexual contact with the victim by forcible compulsion, was rendered duplicitous by H.B.'s testimony. The court stated that because she testified that the acts of anal sexual contact occurred \"more than once\" over the course of a two-hour incident, \"such acts did not constitute a continuous offense.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184682\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/145/1507/#p1507\">\n    145 A.D.3d 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1507,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184682\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/145/1507/#p1507\">\n    44 N.Y.S.3d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Dep't 2016). The court reversed Cox's conviction on that count, and dismissed that count without prejudice to the state's \"re-present[ing] any appropriate charges under that count of the indictment to another grand jury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184682\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/145/1507/#p1507\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184682\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/145/1507/#p1507\">\n    at 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Appellate Division affirmed Cox's conviction on the second count, which charged forcible oral sexual contact. The court held that the verdict on that count was not against the weight of the evidence, and that the trial court was entitled to credit H.B.'s testimony that Cox forced her to have sexual contact, and to reject Cox's testimony that such contact was consensual.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184682\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/145/1507/#p1507\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also rejected Cox's other grounds for relief, including his contentions that the trial court erred in refusing to substitute new appointed counsel, and that the court abused its discretion in refusing to direct production of H.B.'s psychiatric records for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184682\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/145/1507/#p1507\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The New York Court of Appeals denied Cox's petition for leave to appeal,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12296963,12297091,12296840,12297104,12296849,12296982,12296864,12296992,12297122,12296874,12297004,12297135,12296882,12297018,12296897,12296906,12297038,12296790,12296920,12297054,12296933,12296813,12296943,12297074,12296828\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/29/1030/\">\n    29 N.Y.3d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20N.Y.S.3d%20299\">\n    62 N.Y.S.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20N.E.3d%20971\">\n    84 N.E.3d 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cox's petition before this Court, liberally construed, asserts three claims. First, he asserts that the trial court's verdict was inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The basis for the second ground for relief is not entirely clear. Cox asserts that he \"may have been convicted of a crime [he] was not indicted for,\" because both he and H.B. \"testified to engaging in oral sexual conduct more than once while engaged in a couple of rounds of sex.\" (Dkt. # 1 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The basis for the third ground is also difficult to discern. Cox states that the \"[a]ppellate court's weight of the evidence review was an unreasonable determination of the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.

Inconsistent Verdict\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his first ground for relief, Cox states that he was found not guilty on the first count, but guilty on the other two, \"where all crimes arose from [the] same set of facts, and shared an essential element that was found to exist and not to exist.\" (Dkt. # 1 at 7.) He appears to argue, then, that the trial court's verdict was internally inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This claim must be dismissed. First, it is unexhausted, and Cox has failed to show cause or prejudice with respect to his procedural default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Generally, a federal court cannot review a habeas petition unless the petitioner \"has exhausted the remedies available\" to him in the state courts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

In his brief, Cox argues for what amounts to an all-or-nothing approach; in other words, that he either did all the acts of which he was accused, or that he did not commit any of them. But the acts alleged were plainly distinct from each other. Each count alleged a different type of forcible sexual act. There is nothing inconsistent about the trial court's verdict acquitting Cox of rape but finding him guilty of the other two counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Conviction of Unindicted Crime\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As stated, it is difficult to decipher the basis for Cox's second ground for relief. His assertion that he and H.B. \"engag[ed] in oral sexual conduct more than once\" suggests that he is arguing that the second count was duplicitous, but in his brief, Cox expressly disavows any such argument. He repeats that his \"claim is a contention that he may have been convicted of an unindicted crime.\" (Dkt. # 9 at 5.) How that might be, is not explained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This claim is dismissed, essentially for the reasons stated with respect to Cox's first ground for relief. It was not raised in the state courts, is not cognizable on federal habeas review, and it patently without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Weight of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Cox's third ground for relief presents a grab-bag of arguments, mostly relating to his assertion that the \"[a]ppellate court's weight of the evidence review was an unreasonable determination of the facts.\" (Dkt. # 1 at 12.) It is fair to characterize this ground as asserting that, to the extent that the appellate division affirmed Cox's conviction, its decision was erroneous in virtually every respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In reviewing state criminal convictions in federal habeas corpus proceedings, a federal court does not sit as a super-state appellate court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estelle v.

Insofar as Cox attempts to assert other bases for relief in his third ground, they likewise present no more than issues of state law, and are duplicative of his assertions in grounds one and two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For all of the reasons stated above, there is no basis to grant the petition for habeas corpus relief. Therefore, the petition\n   for a writ of habeas corpus (Dkt. # 1), is DENIED. The Court also denies issuance of a certificate of appealability because petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of any constitutional right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    It does not appear that the state ever did so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
