Because the immigration court lacked jurisdiction to order his removal, he argues that the removal was void and cannot form the basis for an indictment for illegal reentry as he was never \"removed\" as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

These three requirements are (1) the alien must have exhausted any administrative remedies, (2) the proceedings at which the order was issued must have improperly deprived the\n   alien of the opportunity for judicial review, and (3) the entry of the deportation order must have been fundamentally unfair.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   But Mr. Leon-Gonzalez's challenge is atypical.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, it does so to support its conclusion that cancellation and reopening involve different standards of review and therefore the reopening at issue in\n   <em>\n    Mauricio-Benitez\n   </em>\n   could not be resolved by reference to\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's conclusions in the context of a cancellation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20App.%20LEXIS%2031718\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This again stands in stark contrast to the procedural posture of this case, which involves no deference to or specific standard of review of a Board of Immigration Appeals decision, rather it is a Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The first is the Supreme Court's determination in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 1003.18's requirement that time-and-place information be included only \"where practicable\" was contrary to Congress's intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   1031-33.

The third is that the document defined in the regulations is the same document as that defined in the statute: both refer to the start of removal proceedings, the definitions are almost identical, and both refer to the Notice to Appear's function as a \"charging document.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   1031-33;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/#p2113\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alito, J., dissenting) (noting that a Notice to Appear under \u00a7 1229(a)\"serve[s] primarily as a charging document\" and that this characterization is reinforced by the requirements in \u00a7 1229(a)(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, as noted by\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , there is no reason why the function of a Notice to Appear should affect the information that it must include.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   1031-33;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/#p2113\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2115 n.7.

Finally, unlike the Government's assertion, this is not a question of a \"valid\" or \"invalid\" removal order, but the occurrence of a \"legal nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   1029-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As discussed above, the immigration court did not have jurisdiction to remove Mr. Leon-Gonzalez, so when the immigration court in El Paso ordered Mr. Leon-Gonzalez removed a legal nullity resulted. Without an order of removal or deportation from an immigration judge, the Government cannot now prosecute its charge of illegal reentry because the second element of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) cannot be proven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   After due consideration, the Court finds that Defendant's Motion should be granted. The immigration court lacked subject matter jurisdiction when it failed to comply with the statutory guidelines by proceeding with removal when the Notice to Appear, the charging document that vests jurisdiction in the court, lacked a date and time. Therefore, the Government cannot satisfy the plain language of \u00a7 1326 because Mr. Leon-Gonzalez was not removed as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Juan Miguel Leon-Gonzalez's \"Motion to Dismiss Indictment\" is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Mr. Leon-Gonzalez argues that he meets the \u00a7 1326(d) three-part test and that he was deprived of due process, however further discussion of these issues it not necessary to the outcome of this opinion given the immigration court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction. But this Court agrees and adopts the analysis of Judge Pitman in his recent opinion regarding the satisfaction of the \u00a7 1326(d) three-part test in an almost identical context.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
