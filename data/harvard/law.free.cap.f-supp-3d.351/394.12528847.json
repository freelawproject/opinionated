Factual background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants William and Molly Ford Koessler own and operate several restaurants and banquet facilities in Buffalo, New York, each of which is also a Defendant in this case. As part of their business, the Defendants \"routinely host weddings, bridal showers, anniversary parties, and other special events.\" Amend. Compl. \u00b6 67. The named Plaintiffs were, at different times, employees of the Defendants: Plaintiff Davis worked as an hourly banquet server and as a \"banquet captain,\" and Plaintiff Blaszak worked as an hourly banquet server.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The amended complaint contains six claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and New York Labor Law. The only claim relevant to the pending objections, however, is the Plaintiffs' first claim, which alleges that the Defendants illegally retained gratuities, in violation of New York Labor Law \u00a7 196-d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   New York Labor Law \u00a7 196-d states, in relevant part, that \"[n]o employer ... shall demand or accept, directly or indirectly, any part of the gratuities, received by an employee, or retain any part of a gratuity\n   <em>\n    or of any charge purported to be a gratuity for an employee\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) In 2008, the New York Court of Appeals considered whether mandatory \"service charges\"-for example, a 20% charge automatically added to a banquet customer's bill-fall within the scope of Labor Law \u00a7 196-d. The Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 196-d\"can include mandatory charges when it is shown that employers represented or allowed their customers to believe that the charges were in fact gratuities for their employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Samiento v. World Yacht Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779454\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/70/\">\n    10 N.Y.3d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779454\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/70/\">\n    854 N.Y.S.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779454\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/70/\">\n    883 N.E.2d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 996 (2008). Following that decision, the New York Department of Labor promulgated a regulation, 12 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 146-2.18, to implement Labor Law \u00a7 196-d as interpreted by the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The regulation creates \"a rebuttal presumption that any charge in addition to charges for food, beverage, lodging, and other specified materials or services, including but not limited to any charge for 'service' or 'food service,' is a charge purported to be a gratuity,\" 12 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 146-2.18(b), which must be distributed to a restaurant's employees.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Labor%20Law%20%C2%A7%20196\">\n    N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -d. The regulation allows a restaurant or banquet facility to retain a mandatory service charge for itself, but it may do so only if it makes a disclosure, in a form prescribed by regulation, that \"the administrative charge is for administration of the banquet ... is not purported to be a gratuity, and will not be distributed as gratuities to the employees who provided service to the guests.\" 12 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 146-2.19(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Plaintiffs allege that, during the time period at issue in the amended complaint, the Defendants' \"policy [was] to retain the mandatory charge for service that was added to customer bills at all of Defendants' banquet events,\" rather than to distribute the charges to the Defendants' employees. Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-74. The Plaintiffs further allege that the Defendants \"had a policy that failed to clearly identify that the mandatory service charge was not a gratuity or tip.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Labor%20Law%20%C2%A7%20196\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Labor%20Law%20%C2%A7%20196\">\n    \u00b6 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, the Plaintiffs allege, \"on catering contracts provided to customers the mandatory charge was referred to as 'service charge' \" but \"failed to include the necessary disclaimers indicating that these mandatory charges were in fact retained by Defendants and not distributed to banquet\n   service employees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Labor%20Law%20%C2%A7%20196\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Labor%20Law%20%C2%A7%20196\">\n    \u00b6 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Plaintiffs claim that, by operation of Labor Law \u00a7 196-d and 12 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 146-2.18, these \"service charges\" were gratuities that should have been distributed to the Plaintiffs and other employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Procedural history\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings as to the Plaintiffs' Labor Law \u00a7 196-d claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). The Defendants argue that Labor Law \u00a7 196-d and its implementing regulation, 12 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 146-2.18, are preempted by several provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as well as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Judge Foschio, to whom the Court referred this case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), filed a Report and Recommendation that recommends denying the Defendants' motion. The Defendants then filed objections to the Report and Recommendation, as well as a motion asking Judge Foschio to reconsider his Report and Recommendation. In support of their motion for reconsideration, the Defendants submitted an affidavit from a certified public accountant (CPA), which the Defendants claim was intended to \"elucidate the error of law and thereby demonstrate for [Judge Foschio] the very serious and, indeed, dramatic injustice resulting from the error of law made by the legal ruling in [his] Report and Recommendation.\" Docket No. 58 at 3. This Court stayed briefing on the Defendants' objections until Judge Foschio decided the motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Judge Foschio denied the Defendants' motion for reconsideration and granted the Plaintiffs' motion to strike the CPA's affidavit. The Defendants then renewed their objections to Judge Foschio's Report and Recommendation, and the Defendants also sought review of Judge Foschio's Decision and Order denying their motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court reviews Judge Foschio's Report and Recommendation\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

The collection and disbursement of service charges under the IRC and Labor Law \u00a7 196-d\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Understanding the Defendants' preemption arguments requires an understanding of the statutory and regulatory framework governing the collection and disbursement of \"service charges\" under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and New York State Labor Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The alleged conflict between federal law and state law in this case arises from the manner in which the IRC, together with its implementing regulations and guidance, treat service charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since 1959, the IRS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   has held that, to constitute a \"tip,\" a payment must, among other things, be \"presented by the customer free from compulsion,\" and it must be an amount that the customer alone decides-that is, the amount \"should not be subject of negotiation or dictated by employer policy.\" Rev. Rev. 59-252.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Rev. Rul. 2012-18 (reaffirming that the \"criteria of Rev. Rul. 59-252 ... should be applied to determine whether a payment made in the course of employment is a tip or non-tip wages under section 3121 of the Code\"). There is no dispute in this case that, when the facts in the amended complaint are viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the service charges at issue are not \"tips\" for purposes of the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rather, the IRS has held-again, since 1959-that charges such as the ones at issue in this case, if ultimately paid to an employer's employees, \"are considered as a service charge which constitute wages for Federal employment tax purposes and for the withholding of federal income tax at source.\" Rev. Rul. 59-252. Specifically, Revenue Ruling 59-252 addressed a situation in which a hotel operated banquet facilities and charged users of such facilities, \"in addition to the regular hotel charges, a certain amount (usually a percentage of the regular charges) which [was] added to the hotel bill and collected by the hotel for distribution to the banquet waiters and other employees who rendered service at the affair.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even if these charges would ultimately be paid to the banquet facility's staff, Revenue Ruling 59-252 held that the charges were not \"tips\" but were, instead, \"service charges\" \"which constitute wages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, the Plaintiffs do not dispute that, if the service charges in this case are distributed to the Defendants' employees-whether under compulsion of New York Labor Law \u00a7 196-d or for some other reason-they are \"wages,\" rather than \"tips,\" for purposes of the IRC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2031.3306\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)-1(b) (\"The term 'wages' means all remuneration for employment unless specifically excepted under section 3306(b) ... or paragraph (j) of [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2031.3306\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)-1(b) ].\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2031.3306\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31.3306(b)-1(j)(3) (\"[T]he following types of payments are excluded from wages: Tips or gratuities paid directly to an employee by a customer of any employer, and not accounted for by the employee to the employer.\")\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   I.R.S. Manual 4.23.7.6.2(5) (\"A contractually fixed gratuity for catering, banquets, weddings ... and other events or items is generally considered to be service charges if the amount is distributed or paid to the service staff.... If these amounts are distributed or paid to the employees, then the amounts are non-tip wages subject to withholding.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The IRC's treatment of service charges as \"wages,\" rather than \"tips,\" is important in this case because of the manner in which the IRC requires that taxes be collected on wages. If a customer pays a service charge that is to be distributed to the employee, the charge is part of the employee's \"wages ... which are under the control of the employer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2031.3402\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)-1(a)(1). The IRC states that \"every employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold\n   <em>\n    upon such wages\n   </em>\n   \" an appropriate \"tax.\" IRC 3402(a)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, taxes withheld on the service charge-wages must come from the service charge-not from the employee's other wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to the Defendants, then, the alleged conflict between the IRC and Labor Law \u00a7 196-d, as interpreted by 12 N.Y.C.R.R 146-2.18, is straightforward: If the service charges are distributed to the Defendants' employees, the service charges are, for purposes of the IRC, non-tip wages. Federal law therefore requires the Defendants to \"deduct and withhold upon such wages\" an appropriate \"tax.\" IRC \u00a7 3402(a)(1). According to the Defendants, however, Labor Law \u00a7 196-d expressly prohibits what IRC \u00a7 3402(a)(1) requires: Labor Law \u00a7 196-d prohibits the employer from, among other things, \"retain[ing] any part\" of the service charge. But, the Defendants argue, to comply with the IRC, the employer must \"retain\" at least part of the service charge as part of the employer's withholding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In light of this, the Defendants offer no reason to think that the New York Department of Labor would interpret Labor Law \u00a7 196-d to prohibit the Defendants from complying with federal law by withholding taxes on service charges that are distributed to the Defendants' employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, the Defendants' preemption argument fails to consider the language of Labor Law \u00a7 196-d. Section 196-d prohibits an employer from \"\n   <em>\n    retain[ing]\n   </em>\n   any part of a gratuity or of any charge purported to\n   be a gratuity for an employee.\" (emphasis added). The Defendants offer no reason to think that, by withholding applicable taxes from an employee's share of the service charge for remittance to the appropriate state and federal authorities, an employer has \"retained\" those taxes in violation of \u00a7 196-d. After all, the word \"retain\" typically denotes having\n   <em>\n    continual\n   </em>\n   custody of an object.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1938 (1986) (\"[T]o hold or\n   <em>\n    continue\n   </em>\n   to hold in possession or use:\n   <em>\n    continue\n   </em>\n   to have, use, recognize, or accept:\n   <em>\n    maintain\n   </em>\n   in one's keeping.\") (emphases added); OED Online, \"retain, v.,\" (def. 2a), Oxford Univ. Press (July 2018) (accessed November 29, 2018) (\"To keep in one's own hands or under one's own control; to keep back; to keep hold or possession of; to continue to have.\"). By contrast, having temporary custody of an object for the sole purpose of turning it over to a taxing authority does not clearly suggest that the custodian has \"retained\" the object. Thus, while Labor Law \u00a7 196-d\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be amenable to the Defendants' proposed interpretation-that is, as a prohibition on the Defendants merely withholding their employees' taxes-that interpretation is not plain from the statute's text; indeed, a credible argument can be made that the statute does not prohibit what the Defendants say it prohibits. In these circumstances, the Court cannot find that federal law preempts state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p406\">\n    567 U.S. at 414-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p406\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to find that federal law preempts state law where state law could plausibly be read to avoid preemption concerns and where \"[t]here is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For these reasons, the Defendants have failed to meet their demanding burden of showing that it is impossible to comply with both federal law and state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

This fact further undermines the Defendants' ability to meet their burden of showing preemption.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p565\">\n     555 U.S. at 571\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p565\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[A]bsent clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to [a drug's] label, we will not conclude that it was impossible for [the drug manufacturer] to comply with both federal and state requirements.\")\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Second Circuit has suggested that impossibility preemption may be found where \"a state law imposes such enormous costs on a party that compliance with a related federal mandate is effectively impossible.\"\n    <em>\n     In re MTBE Litig.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071206\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/65/#p96\">\n     725 F.3d at 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071206\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/65/#p96\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (describing \"economic and logistical hurdles\" that might \"render[ ] compliance\" with both federal and state law impossible). The Defendants make a conclusory argument that \"the scheme proposed by Plaintiffs is horribly complex and creates, under the facts at bar, wage liability above the amount of the mandatory charge collected from the customer.\" Docket No. 33-1 at 22. The Defendants, however, do not develop this argument in any meaningful way, and they certainly do not provide the detail needed to meet their demanding burden of showing that federal law preempts state law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
