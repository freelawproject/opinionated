A jury found in her favor on her discrimination claims, and the Court now considers her requests for equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, a Hispanic woman, began working for CPD in 1990 and was promoted to park supervisor in 2004. CPD operates a telephone hotline that citizens and employees can call to make anonymous reports of wrongdoing by CPD employees, and in September 2011, a CPD employee called the hotline to accuse plaintiff of time-sheet falsification. CPD commenced an investigation. After the investigators filed their report in March 2012, plaintiff had a Corrective Action Meeting (\"CAM\") with CPD in July. In September 2012, plaintiff received a disposition notice terminating her employment for time-sheet falsification. Plaintiff appealed her termination to the Personnel Board, and her termination was affirmed. This lawsuit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The case went to trial on four of the seven claims that survived summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    Vega v. Chi.

REINSTATEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff seeks reinstatement to her former position as park supervisor, at a park comparable to the one for which she was previously responsible as it existed at the time of her employment. The Seventh Circuit has explained that, in determining whether to award the equitable remedy of reinstatement, a district court must \"strike a delicate balance\" by carefully weighing the key factors, which may include competing interests:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On the one hand, reinstatement is the preferred remedy for victims of discrimination, and the court should award it when doing so is feasible. On the other hand, a court is not required to reinstate a successful plaintiff where the result would be a working relationship fraught with hostility and friction. Reinstatement in such situations could potentially cause the court to become embroiled in each and every employment dispute that arose between the plaintiff and the employer following the plaintiff's reinstatement. A court must be careful, however, not to allow an employer to use its anger or hostility toward the plaintiff for having filed a lawsuit as an excuse to avoid the plaintiff's reinstatement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The court's task of identifying the source of the friction between the employer and the plaintiff following the litigation may be straightforward when there is absolutely no evidence that there was friction in the relationship before the plaintiff filed suit. However, reinstatement may become particularly infeasible if the plaintiff would no longer enjoy the confidence and respect of his superiors once reinstated. Reinstatement may also be more problematic when the plaintiff holds a management position, or would be supervised by the same individuals who discriminated against him in the first place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Bruso v.

Defendant explains that, due to this lawsuit and the underlying investigation, there is such hostility between plaintiff and defendant that defendant \"wouldn't be able to trust\" plaintiff in a park supervisor position again, and reinstating her to that position would only invite conflict that would likely require \"continuous judicial intervention in the employment relation[ship].\"\n   <em>\n    Price v. Marshall Erdman &amp; Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520963\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/320/#p325\">\n    966 F.2d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325 (7th Cir. 1992). Further, defendant argues that (1) plaintiff's career path has diverged from parks and recreation since her termination (she now works in medical billing for a hospital), (2) she has placed conditions on her reinstatement, and (3) she has testified that working at the CPD caused her such stress that her mental and physical health suffered-all of which, according to defendant, make it unclear whether plaintiff genuinely wants reinstatement to her old position or could ably fill it. Additionally, according to defendant, there is no available park supervisor position in which to place plaintiff, and defendant argues that it would be unfair to \"bump\" an incumbent park supervisor to make room for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant's arguments do not persuade the Court to withhold the \"preferred\" remedy of reinstatement in this case. Critically, the fact that defendant and some of its employees resent that plaintiff prevailed in her lawsuit is not an appropriate basis for denying reinstatement, as it would essentially punish plaintiff for succeeding in standing up for her own rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bruso\n   </em>\n   , 239 F.3d at at 862 ;\n   <em>\n    McKnight I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532613\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/908/104/#p117\">\n    908 F.2d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Mere hostility by the employer or its supervisory employees is of course no ground for denying reinstatement.\");\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

Further, it does not appear that plaintiff and Mr. Simpkins would have to interact on a regular basis to perform their job duties, nor does the record reveal other hostile or resentful employees with whom plaintiff would have to interact regularly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stephenson v.

July 13, 2017) (reinstatement not appropriate because of \"extensive acrimony\" between the parties that would require \"indefinite mediation of the parties' inevitable employment disputes\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this case, CPD received a tip concerning improprieties with plaintiff's timesheets, and its human resources department conducted what the jury found to be a discriminatory investigation that resulted in a discriminatory discharge. Plaintiff's dispute was not with her fellow employees or any operational supervisors she would need to interact with to perform her job duties; it was with the special investigators and the human resources department. The dispute did not even directly concern plaintiff's performance of her job duties, which she did to CPD's satisfaction, with an unblemished disciplinary record, prior to the timesheet investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As for whether plaintiff genuinely wants reinstatement, the Court fails to see why it should doubt it. Plaintiff had a strong performance record, apart from the timesheet issue that led to her termination, and the jury found her termination to have been the result of discrimination, so the timesheet issue is hardly a reliable indicator of her enthusiasm or aptitude for her job. Unlike in some of the case law defendant has cited, plaintiff apparently has little to gain by asking for reinstatement to a park supervisor position if she does not actually want it; after all, she could request front pay\n   <em>\n    instead\n   </em>\n   of reinstatement, rather than as an alternative to it, as she does here.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKnight II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519274\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/973/1366/#p1370\">\n    973 F.2d at 1371-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court declined to reinstate plaintiff to former position in part based on suspicion that plaintiff, who had already changed career tracks, was merely hoping for a buyout from the employer). Plaintiff has found substitute employment, but it does not pay as well as plaintiff's park supervisor job did, nor is it as stable. Even if plaintiff, during the course of this lawsuit, stated that she found her job stressful and difficult, so do most people, and the Court places little weight on this fact because\n   plaintiff's record shows that she was generally able to perform satisfactorily. If the relief she seeks in prevailing in this lawsuit is to take on that stress again, the Court is not inclined to stand in her way.\n   <em>\n    Stephenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7785136\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/915/39/#p56\">\n    915 F.Supp. at 56-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reinstatement appropriate in part because \"[p]laintiff has never expressed any ambivalence regarding her desire for reinstatement; to her reinstatement is the point of this litigation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff seeks reinstatement under the condition that she be placed in a park that is in approximately the condition that Bessemer Park was in at the time of her termination-not its current, deteriorated condition. Some courts have found asking for reinstatement only on specified conditions to indicate that the plaintiff does not genuinely want reinstatement, and therefore not awarded it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKnight II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519274\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/973/1366/#p1370\">\n    973 F.2d at 1370-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reinstatement not appropriate where plaintiff asked to be reinstated in an entirely \"different job [in finance rather than manufacturing] and to be relocated to a new city\"). The Court does not agree with defendant that plaintiff's request is so unreasonable as to indicate that plaintiff does not genuinely want reinstatement; plaintiff is merely seeking to be placed as nearly as possible in the position she would have been in absent the discriminatory treatment that led to her termination, which is a reasonable basis for the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   However, in part because the Court agrees with defendant that it must fashion its remedy with due regard for any consequences the remedy might have for innocent third parties, the Court will not require CPD to abide by this condition. That is, defendant will not be required to assign plaintiff to a park in substantially the same condition as Bessemer Park at the time of plaintiff's termination. Imposing this condition not only risks forcing defendant to displace innocent employees but also threatens to require \"continuous judicial intervention in the employment relation[ship],\"\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520963\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/320/#p325\">\n    966 F.2d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Determining what condition a park was in several years ago is likely to depend on memories that will differ from person to person; adding this requirement to the remedy would make the remedy too difficult to administer. The Court is mindful that it should seek to place plaintiff in as nearly the same position as she would have been in absent the discrimination, but plaintiff has not demonstrated that the precise condition of plaintiff's park is a matter of essential terms and conditions of employment that this Court should concern itself with in making plaintiff whole under Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court does not agree with defendant that the fact that plaintiff has not shown that there is a vacant park supervisor position for plaintiff to fill at the moment makes reinstatement inappropriate. The evidence shows that defendant employs a large number of park supervisors, perhaps dozens at a given time, and over the last several years vacancies have arisen on a regular basis. The Court can defer entering judgment for a reasonable period to give defendant time to place plaintiff in a park supervisor position, or simply order plaintiff to pay plaintiff back pay or front pay until a position becomes available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that the Court must\n   consider the consequences of its decision for innocent third parties and that it would be unfair to order defendant to reinstate plaintiff if it would mean displacing another employee, but it is not clear that reinstating plaintiff necessarily means displacing an innocent employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court orders defendant to reinstate plaintiff and place her in the next park supervisor position that becomes available, under the conditions described at the conclusion of this opinion and order. Because the Court orders defendant to reinstate plaintiff, it need not reach the parties' arguments concerning the proper calculation of front pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. INJUNCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff seeks an injunction barring defendant from committing \"like discrimination in the future,\" as well as retaliation. (Pl.'s Br. at 6, ECF No. 269.)

The Court's decision to reinstate plaintiff, coupled with Simpkins's testimony describing feelings of resentment against plaintiff for bringing this lawsuit, are sufficient to justify such an injunction. The Court enjoins defendant from discriminating against plaintiff based on her national origin by disciplining or terminating her in a manner disproportionate to the manner in which employees of other national origins who have engaged in similar conduct are treated, or for conduct tolerated in employees of other national origins, or retaliating against her for bringing this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Defendant does not address this issue in its brief, so the Court deems it to have waived any objection.

Ill. Oct. 11, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   According to plaintiff, following her termination in September 2012, plaintiff applied for numerous jobs, including jobs in her field of recreation as well as jobs in other fields. She kept a list of 134 jobs for which she applied between September 2012 and November 2013. (Def.'s Resp. Br., Ex. C, DX 42, ECF No. 278-1 at 62-72.) At trial, plaintiff testified that she submitted applications for some additional jobs and searched for still others for which she did not apply, whether because they required a bachelor's degree or for some other reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After she was initially unsuccessful in obtaining any position, she accepted a grant-funded, one-year position in medical billing under the Affordable Care Act at Norwegian American Hospital in November 2013, earning approximately thirty percent less than she had as a CPD employee. Thanks to renewed funding, plaintiff was able to remain in that position until May 2016. Then, based on connections she made at the hospital, plaintiff obtained a position working for a pair of home health agencies, NE Healthcare and ASI Services. However, this position was dependent on state funding, and in February 2017, with the Illinois General Assembly in the midst of a lengthy budget standoff, the funding ran out, and plaintiff was laid off. She did odd jobs for a time, including painting and moving work, but later in\n   2017, Norwegian American Hospital found renewed funding for plaintiff's medical billing position and rehired her. She still worked there as of the date of her testimony in the remedies phase of this case, in January 2018. (ECF No. 269-8, Jan. 16, 2018 Tr. at 123-126.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   According to defendant, plaintiff's uncorroborated, purely self-reported account of her job-search activity is insufficient to substantiate her job-search efforts. Further, defendant argues that even if plaintiff has provided sufficient proof of her job-search efforts, she has admitted that she applied in large part to jobs outside her field, recreation. Defendant also argues that plaintiff's job search ceased altogether in November 2013 when she became employed by Norwegian American Hospital, despite the fact that she was making less than she had in her prior position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency of Uncorroborated Self-Reported List of Job Applications\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Neither side disputes that defendant has the burden of proving that plaintiff failed to mitigate her damages. Defendant attempts to carry its burden by pointing to plaintiff's self-created list of job applications and arguing that it is not credible that plaintiff actually sought to obtain these jobs in good faith. But defendant has not explained, and the Court fails to see, any reason to doubt that plaintiff applied for these jobs, as she says she did. This case is unlike the case on which defendant principally relies in this respect,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205912886\">\n    2016 WL 5912886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15-17, in which the Court found that the plaintiff's testimony about his job-search efforts during a thirteen-month period between August 2012 and September 2013 was not credible because the plaintiff testified that he spent \"five hours per day reviewing ads in local newspapers and applying for jobs online,\" but he was \"unable to produce any records showing that he applied for even a single job,\" not even so much as \"personal notes tracking applications,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *15. In this case, plaintiff has produced \"personal notes tracking applications\"; the list of 134 job applications that she provided to defendant is exactly that.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, defendant ignores the fact that, in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the court found the plaintiff's testimony describing dozens of job applications he submitted during an earlier period between 2008 and 2011 to be sufficient to demonstrate reasonable job-search efforts during that time period. Although the court found that the \"lack of corroborating evidence [was] troubling,\" not to mention that plaintiff had \"hyperbolized his job-search efforts,\" the court nevertheless concluded that the defendants had \"not met their burden in showing that Plaintiff did not exercise reasonable diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant has not persuaded the Court why it should not believe that plaintiff made the job-search efforts that she described in her testimony and documented by creating the list of 134 job applications that she submitted to defendant in discovery. Defendant fails to meet its burden on this point, and its argument therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Failure to Seek Comparable Employment in Recreation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant argues that, even if plaintiff genuinely applied for the 134 positions she has listed, this job-application activity fell short of the standard of reasonableness because these jobs were generally unrelated to her field of work (recreation or physical education), and she was not qualified by experience or training for many of them. According to defendant, the only job plaintiff applied for that was in her field of work was a position as recreation supervisor in the Cook County Forest Preserve, and she did not even submit her application for this job until August 2013, when she had been unemployed almost a year. To the extent plaintiff testified at trial to applying for other positions in her field not shown on the list she provided defendant in discovery, defendant argues that her testimony is not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, the Court disagrees with defendant that the Cook County Forest Preserve position was the only position plaintiff listed that was in her field. Defendant is only correct in this regard if the Court accepts defendant's narrow definition of plaintiff's field: recreation in municipal parks. But plaintiff applied for numerous other positions that involved working with children or youths or otherwise engaging with the community, including positions at schools and hospitals and other community or civic organizations. It seems likely that there would have been significant overlap between plaintiff's job with CPD and these other positions, and the Court is unwilling to disregard these job applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   True, plaintiff applied for numerous jobs that were genuinely outside her field. For example, early in her unemployment, she applied to work at auto parts stores such as Auto Zone or Advance Auto Parts (she testified that she had previous part-time experience working in such stores). She also applied for positions at Federal Express, manager positions at McDonalds, and a number of insurance agent positions. Defendant would have the Court discount these job applications as insufficient efforts to mitigate damages, but the Court is unwilling to do so. Viewed in its totality, the record shows that plaintiff searched for jobs in her field and, recognizing that there were few such jobs for which she was qualified, plaintiff also applied for jobs outside her field in an attempt to find any paying job she could get. Generally, a Title VII plaintiff who cannot immediately find comparable work in her field will be unable to \"afford to stand aside while the wheels of justice grind slowly toward the ultimate resolution of the lawsuit\"; she \"needs work that will feed a family and restore self-respect,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a \"job is needed-now.\"\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278062\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/1072/#p1078\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636702\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/219/#p230\">\n    458 U.S. at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636702\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/219/#p230\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Plaintiff made diligent efforts to find substitute employment quickly, which is what the law requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Even putting aside whether plaintiff showed reasonable diligence, defendant must also prove that there was a reasonable likelihood that plaintiff might have found comparable work, and defendant has\n   not shown that she could have found such work, as defendant defines it. Importantly, plaintiff testified that she did not apply to a greater number of positions that were more similar to her CPD park supervisor job because such positions now typically require applicants to hold a bachelor's degree. In fact, at some point after plaintiff was initially hired at CPD but before she was terminated, even CPD began to require applicants to hold a bachelor's degree. Although plaintiff did not hold a bachelor's degree, she was allowed to continue to work at CPD under a grandfather rule. (Pl.'s Post-Trial Br. Ex. B, Jan. 16, 2018 Tr. at 176:17-177:24, ECF No. 269-8 at 177-78.) After her termination, plaintiff recognized that a bachelor's degree would improve her employment prospects, so she returned to school and, at the time of her testimony in January 2018, was on track to graduate with her bachelor's degree the following semester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant has not established that positions that were comparable to plaintiff's CPD position and did not require applicants to hold a bachelor's degree were available at the time plaintiff was searching for positions. In its brief, defendant cites Mr. Simpkins's testimony that CPD reviews job postings in suburban park districts that compete with CPD for employees, and these suburban park districts often advertise for positions similar to plaintiff's park supervisor position, but this testimony did not go far enough to meet defendant's burden. Mr. Simpkins testified only in vague, broad, and general terms that suburban park districts often advertise for positions that appear to be comparable to plaintiff's park supervisor position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78:21-81:17.) It was not clear whether he had any specific positions in mind; certainly he did not offer any examples of particular positions with details such as job responsibilities or requisite qualifications.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205912886\">\n    2016 WL 5912886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *20. This is nowhere near sufficient to meet defendant's burden to establish that comparable positions were available and plaintiff did not exercise reasonable diligence to obtain them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Based on all this evidence, the Court concludes that defendant has not met its burden of establishing that plaintiff did not exercise reasonable diligence in searching for a comparable position, or that one was available if she had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Failure to Mitigate After November 2013\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant argues that plaintiff stopped searching for jobs after she began working at Norwegian American Hospital in November 2013. Although she had found work, she was making less than she made at CPD, so back pay was still accruing, but according to defendant, she was making no effort to mitigate her damages. Plaintiff replies that in fact she did continue seeking employment in the field of recreation or physical education even after November 2013, although apparently she did not keep records of those job-search efforts and she does not provide any examples of jobs that she applied for during this time frame.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court is not convinced by plaintiff's argument, which is perfunctory at best-but neither is the Court convinced that plaintiff was required to do more than work in substitute employment and work toward her bachelor's degree. Defendant contends that plaintiff's decision to take a lesser-paying job at a hospital and cease making serious efforts to find work in her field was a \"choice made by Vega herself, and was not a circumstance imposed on her by the unavailability of comparable jobs in her area\" (Def.'s Resp. Br. at 9, ECF No. 278 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hutton v. Sally Beauty Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:02-CV-190,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202397606\">\n    2004 WL 2397606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D. Ind. Oct. 22, 2004) ) ), but the\n   facts show otherwise. In the thirteen months after her termination, plaintiff applied for over a hundred jobs, some in her field and some outside of it, and she believed she was struggling to find comparable work because she did not have a bachelor's degree, which employers had begun to require for comparable positions during the twenty-two years since plaintiff had last searched for a job. After more than a year of fruitless job-searching, she took a temporary job that paid a substantial salary, although approximately 30% less than she made at CPD, and returned to school to get a bachelor's degree to improve her employment prospects. Plaintiff worked full-time for most of the following four years, up to the date of her testimony at trial, apart from a period of a few months in 2017 in which her employer lost the funding for her position and she did odd jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Contrary to defendant's position, plaintiff's decision to accept a job making less than she had made in her former position was not \"a choice made by Plaintiff herself,\" freely and based on her own desires; it was, to a large extent, \"a circumstance imposed on her by the unavailability of comparable jobs in that market area.\"\n   <em>\n    Hutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202397606\">\n    2004 WL 2397606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Plaintiff did not make a \"willful choice\" to be underemployed or a \"personal choice\" to start an \"alternative career\"; rather, she took the best job she could get, which paid a substantial salary, while she completed her bachelor's degree so that she could someday resume her former career.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278062\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/1072/#p1078\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The law did not require plaintiff to continue to apply for jobs in her former field of work at her former rate of pay and refuse to accept anything less; once she realized her efforts were futile as long as she did not have a bachelor's degree, it was reasonable to take work outside her field to support herself while she worked toward a bachelor's degree.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278062\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/1072/#p1078\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (employment discrimination plaintiff does not sacrifice back pay by \"starting an alternative career ... if after a diligent search, he could not find comparable work\") (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

First, the Court has already rejected the premise of this argument; as the Court has explained above, plaintiff did make a reasonably diligent effort to find comparable work. Additionally, while it is within this Court's discretion to deduct unemployment compensation from plaintiff's back pay award,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Defendant argues that any lost pay she recovers should be offset by the amount of business expenses she would have, but did not, incur after she lost her job with defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the most part, the Court disagrees with defendant because these amounts represent expenditures that plaintiff likely incurred anyway, if not for a business purpose. Even though she was not employed by defendant, she still likely had to pay for such things as shoes, a cell phone, and automobile expenses in the years after her termination, and defendant introduces no evidence to suggest that plaintiff spent less on those things after her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The union dues are an exception. The Court agrees with defendant that if plaintiff were to recover lost pay without an offset for the amount she would have spent on union dues, she would receive a windfall. But defendant does not prove how much plaintiff would have spent on union dues in the years after her termination. Defendant points to amounts plaintiff claimed for union dues on her 2012, 2011, and 2010 tax returns, but these amounts varied significantly, and the Court cannot determine with any confidence how much she would have spent in subsequent years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   By not reducing plaintiff's lost pay award by the amount of her saved union dues, the Court may confer a windfall on plaintiff, but defendant has not proved the amount of the offset it should receive, and as the Court has already explained, \"as between conferring a windfall on claimants or defendants, claimants are the logical choice.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Grady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527787\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/857/383/#p391\">\n    857 F.2d at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is evidence of the premium amount-plaintiff clearly testified at trial that the amount of the premium was $607 per month. Defendant provides no reason for skepticism of the amount plaintiff recited in open court, and the Court credits that testimony. Thus, as plaintiff explains, plaintiff's $607 per month for eighteen months, less the $1,670.58 she would have spent on health insurance if she had remained a CPD employee (defendant does not dispute plaintiff's calculation of this amount), comes to $9,255.42.

Stated differently, plaintiff does not establish that the pension benefits she will receive when she retires are directly tied to amounts CPD contributed to the pension fund on her behalf. The relationship between (1) the number of years in which defendant made a contribution to the pension fund that was calculated in part based on its employment of plaintiff, as opposed to the years of service with which plaintiff is credited, and (2) benefits that will be subsequently paid from the fund to plaintiff upon retirement, is opaque.
