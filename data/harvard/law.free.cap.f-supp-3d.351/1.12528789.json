McFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiff in this case seeks to overturn his court-martial conviction of rape based on misfeasance by the DNA analyst in unrelated cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Daryl Scott was a hospital corpsman at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Okinawa, Japan. One night after work in 2001, he met up with a few of his friends to go out drinking. He returned to the naval barracks later that evening with three servicemembers,\n   including a woman who was so intoxicated that she could not walk unassisted. The group helped her to her room before disbanding. Mr. Scott remained behind and saw the woman lay down on her bed. He noticed that she was incoherent and passing in and out of consciousness. So he got in the bed and began kissing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Scott claims that he does not remember what happened next. When the woman woke up in the morning, she was covered in blood. She was wearing a pair of white boxers that were not hers. The tampon she had been using the night before was lying on the floor. The sheets on her bed were missing. Feeling scared and confused, she reported the incident to her chain of command. An investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (\"NCIS\") found a stain on the woman's mattress that contained a mixture of her and Mr. Scott's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on these facts, Mr. Scott pled guilty to raping the woman. He told a military judge he had no reason to believe that the victim and witnesses were mistaken about his actions, and that he was convinced of his guilt. After inquiring into its factual basis, the military judge accepted Mr. Scott's plea. He was discharged from the Navy and sentenced to seven years' incarceration. Under a pretrial agreement, the confinement was reduced to four years. He served this sentence and currently lives in Pine Ridge, South Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Scott now collaterally attacks his court-martial conviction. He contends that an NCIS analyst fabricated the DNA evidence brought against him. He also believes that the military courts violated the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") by refusing to adequately re-consider his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court disagrees. It finds that Mr. Scott has not adduced facts sufficient to support his claim of falsified evidence. Even if he could present such facts, his guilty plea was based on much more than just the results of DNA testing. His allegations were fully and fairly considered by the military tribunals. And the statutory scheme created by Congress precludes an APA review of Mr. Scott's case. The Court will thus grant the Government summary judgment on Mr. Scott's constitutional claims and will dismiss his APA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before accepting a guilty plea, \"a military judge must conduct a thorough inquiry to insure the accused understands the meaning and effect of the plea, that he enters it voluntarily, and that he in fact is guilty of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3625599\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mj/43/93/#p98\">\n    43 M.J. 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 98 (C.A.A.F. 1995) (discussing Art. 45(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice). The purpose of this \"providence inquiry\" is to establish a sufficient basis in law and fact for accepting an accused party's guilt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A.R. 9-25. During the inquiry, Mr. Scott conveyed that he had read, understood, and agreed with a stipulation of facts concerning his conduct. A.R. 13. The stipulation stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 \"At no time that evening did [the woman] give [Mr. Scott] any indication that she was interested in [him] sexually or romantically;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 The woman \"was highly intoxicated as a result of drinking alcoholic beverages that evening and could not walk by herself to her barracks room;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Scott \"knew that [the woman] was intoxicated ... because [he] had seen her consume many beers throughout the late evening and early morning;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Scott saw that the woman \"was not coherent and passed in and out of consciousness;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Scott \"remember[s] lying side by side with her and kissing her;\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 The next morning, Mr. Scott \"returned to [the woman's] room and realized that [he] had committed a sexual act with someone who was unable to give her consent because she was too intoxicated. [He] was scared that someone might see [him] leaving the room, so [he] locked [her] door from the inside and left through her window.\" A.R. 34-35.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The military judge also asked Mr. Scott to describe, in his own words, what happened that night. A.R. 21. He did so. He also confirmed his belief that he \"completed this act of sexual intercourse and without the consent of\" the woman. A.R. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Though Mr. Scott claimed not to remember the details of the assault, he believed the NCIS investigation was \"accurate and reliable.\" A.R. 20. He said he had no reason to doubt the accounts of the victim and witnesses. A.R. 20-21. And he confirmed that \"despite the fact that [he] cannot remember what happened ... [he is] still guilty of raping\" the woman. A.R. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Contrary to the normal procedure in federal court guilty pleas, the judge also heard testimony from the victim. She described waking up covered in blood, wearing boxer shorts that did not belong to her, and seeing her tampon lying on the floor. A.R. 29. Her bed sheets were missing, and her curtain was pulled aside. This was something she never did \"because [she] live[d] on the first deck.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After considering her testimony, the NCIS investigative report, and Mr. Scott's admissions, the military judge found him guilty of rape. A.R. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Roughly two years later, Mr. Scott filed the first of several appeals contesting his conviction. A.R. 38-46. He argued that he had \"pled guilty to a rape that was alleged by nobody and that may have never occurred,\" as neither he nor the woman \"remember[ed] whether he had intercourse with her.\" A.R. 39. He attacked the DNA evidence against him, suggesting that the mixture of his semen and her blood found by NCIS \"could have just have [sic] easily occurred outside the vagina.\" A.R. 42. Thus, he insisted, the military judge's providence inquiry was deficient, as he \"failed in his duty to ask the difficult questions, the ones that would have caused him to reject the [guilty] plea.\" A.R. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (\"Navy Appeals Court\") rejected these arguments. It found that he \"indicated an understanding of the elements of the offense ... and stated that the elements correctly described the offense he committed.\" A.R. 60. Mr. Scott also \"clearly stated, in his own words, the circumstances surrounding the rape.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Navy Appeals Court concluded that \"[a]lthough the appellant was unable to remember having engaged in intercourse with the victim, his inability to remember does not invalidate the plea where the appellant was convinced of his guilt based on the strength of the evidence against him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Three years after this denial, Mr. Scott tried again. He filed a writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   with the Navy Appeals Court. This\n   time, he asked for an evidentiary hearing \"in light of newly disclosed evidence of the general mishandling of [DNA] evidence\" at an NCIS criminal investigation laboratory. A.R. 62. Mr. Scott argued that the DNA results in his case were \"the only reason Appellant believed he had raped\" the woman, and that if these \"results were in fact fabricated, the 'strength' of the evidence against Appellant would evaporate.\" A.R. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   His challenge arose out of a memorandum issued by the laboratory. It noted that an analyst falsified an entry on one of the DNA tests he had conducted, and that the same analyst had once been suspended after \"permitting contamination in his testing processes.\" A.R. 76. Upon discovering this issue, the laboratory began \"reviewing the hundreds of cases worked on by this examiner,\" and stated that \"[a]s of this writing, no false reports are believed to have left the laboratory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Scott characterized this as \"newly discovered evidence\" that \"sheds new light on the reliability of Appellant's conviction.\" A.R. 65. He urged the court to order more DNA testing through a \"\n   <em>\n    DuBay\n   </em>\n   hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. DuBay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6634263\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cma/17/147/\">\n    37 C.M.R. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.M.A. 1967).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court declined to do so. The basis for Mr. Scott's request, it noted, \"is the misconduct in other cases of the laboratory technician who conducted the DNA test in the appellant's case.\" A.R. 102. It found that Mr. Scott \"offers no evidence that the DNA results in his case were tainted or false\" and that he \"did not seek independent testing of the evidence at the time of his court-martial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6634263\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cma/17/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also found that \"during the providence inquiry, [he] cited a variety of factors in support of his believe that he was guilty of the offense and not just the results of a DNA test.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6634263\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cma/17/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Undeterred, Mr. Scott filed a third challenge eight years later. He again asserted that his conviction \"was based solely on DNA evidence\" tested by Phillip Mills, the examiner whose misconduct was the subject of the laboratory's memorandum. A.R. 104. He claimed to have \"recently discovered that Dr. Mills destroyed the DNA samples in this case in violation of standard operating procedures, preventing them from being re-tested.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6634263\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cma/17/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on this purported discovery, he again sought a\n   <em>\n    DuBay\n   </em>\n   hearing. He also pointed to an email that a special agent investigating his case once sent to someone in the NCIS laboratory. This email suggested that Mr. Scott \"would never have been charged had it not been for the work you all put into it at the lab. We had nothing else.\" A.R. 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Navy Appeals Court denied this petition too. It began by reiterating that Mr. Scott pled guilty to rape \"[r]elying\n   <em>\n    in part\n   </em>\n   upon DNA evidence.\" A.R. 199 (emphasis added). The court found that the petition was \"merely an attempt to reevaluate previously considered evidence or legal issues,\" and that it \"decline[d] to do either.\" A.R. 201. Mr. Scott's argument \"that because Mills falsified test results in other cases means that he did so in [this] case,\" it explained, \"was rejected by this court in 2007.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6634263\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cma/17/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court then assessed a declaration from a laboratory employee, made under the penalty of perjury, which refuted the contention that Mr. Mills destroyed Mr. Scott's DNA samples.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6634263\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cma/17/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The employee explained that the laboratory \"has neither the mission nor the capacity for a long-term evidence storage facility ... Mr. Mills was not accused of destroying evidence\n   and there was not an intention to suggest such.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6634263\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cma/17/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found that this declaration was \"supported by documents submitted by [Mr. Scott] which indicate the evidence was destroyed by NCIS, not by Mr. Mills.\" A.R. 202. It thus concluded that a\n   <em>\n    DuBay\n   </em>\n   hearing was unnecessary \"as the record as a whole 'compellingly demonstrates' the improbability of the petitioner's assertion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6634263\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cma/17/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It rejected the notion that the DNA test results were the only evidence available to the prosecutors. A.R. 202. It noted, for instance, that \"other witnesses put [Mr. Scott] in the room alone with the unconscious victim,\" that the victim testified in detail about what she observed when she woke up, and that Mr. Scott \"was seen outside of the victim's room, using the female [bathroom] because he 'didn't feel like going upstairs' to the male [bathroom] early the next morning.\" A.R. 202-203. The court was \"simply not persuaded that the email the petitioner has produced supports the drastic remedy he now requests.\" A.R. 203. It therefore denied his petition. Mr. Scott then filed a motion for reconsideration with the Navy Appeals Court and a request for review to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Both were denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 202-206; A.R. 207-312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Scott now challenges what he calls the Navy's \"continued failure to re-examine the case.\" Compl. 11. The decisions not to order a\n   <em>\n    DuBay\n   </em>\n   hearing or a new trial, he argues, were \"a far cry from the standards laid out by the Supreme Court and this Court for rectifying unfair trials based on fabricated testimony and newly discovered evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. He also contends that the \"decision of the Judge Advocate General of Navy not to set aside or re-examine the case ... was grossly irresponsible, arbitrary[,] and capricious\" in violation of \u00a7 706(2) of the APA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Government moved to dismiss Mr. Scott's complaint or, in the alternative, sought summary judgment based on the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 9 (\"Def.'s Mot.\").

Thus, to the extent that Mr. Scott seeks APA review of the decisions made by the military tribunals, the Court lacks jurisdiction to engage in this review, and dismissal is warranted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Indeed, he appears to concede this in his briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 13 (noting that the APA \"specifically excludes courts-martial from it [sic] purview).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   But he argues that the APA does not \"exclude all administrative actions taken by NCIS agents and military justice officials before and after a court-martial. Pl.'s Mot. at 13. True, it \"does not expressly preclude review of Judge Advocate General decisions reviewing courts martial pursuant to [Article 69].\"\n   <em>\n    McKinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432656,3698304\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/851/\">\n    291 F.3d at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the D.C. Circuit has found that \"Congress' establishment ... of a separate judicial system for courts martial review is ... convincing evidence that Congress could not have intended Judge Advocate General review of courts martial to fall within APA review of agency decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432656,3698304\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/851/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, \"Congress' preclusion of APA review of courts martial reaches the Judge Advocate's decision\" where it\n   directly concerns a court martial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432656,3698304\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/851/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432656,3698304\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/851/\">\n    at 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The decisions in question here do so. Article 69 of the Uniform Court of Military Justice permits the Judge Advocate General to set aside the findings or sentence in a court-martial case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20869\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Compl. 18. This is precisely the type of review barred by the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Scott attacks what he calls the \"failure of the [Judge Advocate General] to ... provide information and discovery to the detailed appellate defense counsel.\" Pl.'s Mot. at 13. In his Complaint, Mr. Scott details several requests he made to the Office of the Judge Advocate General for information about his case and appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 9-10. But the Complaint itself demonstrates that the Office responded to each of these requests or identified for Mr. Scott the appropriate procedural mechanisms to obtain the information he sought.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20869\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Mr. Scott has not sufficiently alleged any decision by the Judge Advocate General that this Court may review under the APA, and his claims will be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v.
