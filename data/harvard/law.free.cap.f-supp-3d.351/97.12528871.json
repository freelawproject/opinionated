INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Robert Taylor is a model aircraft enthusiast who owns multiple model planes and flies them as a hobby and for recreational purposes. He brings this action on behalf of himself and a putative class of all model aircraft owners who paid $5 to register their aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under a rule later struck down by the D.C. Circuit. Plaintiff claims that the registration requirement violated the Privacy Act and the Little Tucker Act. He also advances against the FAA a violation of his constitutional right of privacy, as well as the common law tort of unjust enrichment. Plaintiff demands that the agency return the more than $4 million it collected in registration fees and pay over $836 million in statutory penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant FAA now moves to dismiss, arguing that (1) Plaintiff lacks standing to sue, (2) the D.C. Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over this matter, and (3) the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons stated herein, the court holds that, as presently pleaded, Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this action. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is therefore granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Invoking this authority, on December 16, 2015, the FAA issued an interim final rule (the \"Registration Rule\"), requiring owners of small unmanned aircraft, including model aircraft, to register their aircraft with the FAA \"to facilitate compliance with the statutory requirement that all aircraft register prior to operation.\" 80 Fed.

The Circuit succinctly explained why the Registration Rule as applied to model aircraft could not stand:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In short, the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act provides that the FAA \"may not promulgate any rule or regulation regarding a model aircraft,\" yet the FAA's 2015 Registration Rule is a \"rule or regulation regarding a model aircraft.\" Statutory interpretation does not get much simpler. The Registration Rule is unlawful as applied to model aircraft.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276957\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/1089/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276957\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/1089/\">\n    at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Circuit's decision, the FAA ceased enforcing the Registration Rule and took steps to enable model aircraft owners to undo their registrations. Compl. \u00b6 16; Def.'s Mot. at 5-6. The FAA made available on its website a form, titled \"Section 336 Aircraft Owner Request to Delete Registration/Receive Refund,\" which allowed registrants to seek a refund and ask that their personal information be deleted. Compl. \u00b6 16; Def.'s Mot. at 5-6; Def.'s Mot., Ex. 1, ECF No. 23-2, Section 336 Aircraft Owner Request to Delete Registration/Receive Refund [hereinafter \"Refund Form\"]. The Refund Form required owners to certify that they operated their model aircraft in compliance with various statutory requirements and, if they sought a refund, to supply bank account information. Compl. \u00b6 16. Plaintiff did not submit a Refund Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The relief afforded model aircraft owners under\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   was short lived. On December 12, 2017, the President signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, (\"NDAA\"), which revived the Registration Rule. Section 1092(d) of the NDAA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The rules adopted by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the matter of registration and marking requirements for small unmanned aircraft (FAA-2015-7396; published on December 16, 2015) that were vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Taylor v. Huerta (No. 15-1495; decided on May 19, 2017) shall be restored to effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pub. L.

Thus, the NDAA granted the FAA the statutory authority to require registration\n   of model aircraft that the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   held the FAA did not possess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With the Registration Rule reinstated, the FAA provided guidance to model aircraft owners. As to owners who had registered their aircraft prior to\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the FAA did not require them to re-register, unless the owner had completed the refund/deletion process offered by the agency. Def.'s Mot. at 6-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the FAA made all pre-\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   registrations effective until December 12, 2020, thus treating those registrations as if having occurred on the date of the NDAA's enactment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff brought the instant suit as a class action on January 5, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The crux of his Complaint is that the FAA lacked the statutory power to demand and retain his personal information and the $5 registration fee until Congress passed the NDAA on December 12, 2017. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18, 19. This unlawful exercise of authority, Plaintiff maintains, violated the Privacy Act (Count I), the Little Tucker Act (Count II), and his \"Constitutional and privacy rights\" (Count III). He also alleges that the agency was unjustly enriched by the unauthorized fees collection (Count IV). Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, a refund of the registration fees collected before December 12, 2017 (totaling $4,183,980), and over $836,796,000 in statutory penalties for each violation of the Privacy Act (the equivalent to $1,000 for every putative class member).\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16 \u00b6\u00b6 C - L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant then moved to dismiss, arguing (1) Plaintiff does not have standing to assert his claims, (2) the D.C.

And, as here, in the class-action context, named plaintiffs \"must allege and show that they\n   <em>\n    personally\n   </em>\n   have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.\"\n   <em>\n    Warth v.

He asserts two forms of injury. First, \"he lost the use of funds during the period in which the FAA lacked statutory authority to collect such registration fees\" and \"had not been compensated for the lost use of funds at the time he filed suit.\" Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 24 [hereinafter Pl.'s Opp'n], at 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 37 (alleging that he was \"deprived ... of the use of those funds\"). Second, he suffered the \"intangible harm of Defendants' unlawful maintenance of his personal information.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 9. The court considers each of these claimed injuries in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    1. Interest and the Time Value of Money\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The \"time value of money\" is the notion that money available today is worth more than the same amount of money in the future.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stephens v. U.S. Airways Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649818,3557267\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/437/\">\n    644 F.3d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). That principle is premised on the idea that money can earn interest over time or be put to some other income-generating use, if invested.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649818,3557267\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/437/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Neither the Supreme Court nor the D.C. Circuit has determined whether the lost time value of money is a harm concrete enough to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement. Indeed, only one circuit court appears to have even come close to embracing such a theory, and there the alleged lost use was for a sum of money ($10,000) far greater than at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Habitat Educ. Ctr. v. U.S. Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683683\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/453/#p457\">\n    607 F.3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (7th Cir. 2010) (stating that \"[e]very day that a sum of money is wrongfully withheld, its rightful owner loses the time value of the money,\" creating a harm sufficient for standing). The only other circuit to have faced the question declined to reach it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kawa Orthodontics, LLP v. Sec., U.S. Dep't. of Treasury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316496\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/243/#p246\">\n    773 F.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 246 (11th Cir. 2014). And some district courts have rejected the notion that lost time value of money is constitutionally sufficient to satisfy standing when the amount wrongfully taken or withheld was discharged before filing suit-a circumstance comparable to this case, as Plaintiff now must pay the $5 fee to register his model aircraft.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amirhamzeh v. Chase Bank USA, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 13-00527 BRO FFMX,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%207219270\">\n    2013 WL 7219270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (C.D.

Oct. 3, 2007). Thus, accepting the lost time value of money as a cognizable constitutional injury is far from well established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court need not, however, venture down this rabbit hole. For even if the lost time value of money could suffice to make out an Article III injury, the \"bare allegation that [a plaintiff] has lost the value of the time and resources ... sets out an injury that is too abstract and indefinite to confer Article III standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Kawa Orthodontics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316496\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/243/#p246\">\n    773 F.3d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). Here, Plaintiff does not allege\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   facts to suggest that if he had not paid the $5 registration fee he would have invested the $5 in some way to increase its value.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. At most, he offers only generalizations that he was \"deprived ... of [the] use of those funds\" and is entitled \"to be compensated for his lost use of funds.\" Compl. \u00b6 37; Pl.'s Opp'n. at 9.
