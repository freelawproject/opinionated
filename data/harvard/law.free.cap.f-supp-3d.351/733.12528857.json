Epic has asserted five of the twenty-five claims against Backblaze. The asserted claims are claims 1-4 and 19. The first four claims are method claims; the last is an apparatus claim to an \"information server\" that enables the formation of a chat session unaffiliated with a pre-established chat room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Claim 1 of the '599 patent provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. An on-line chatting method comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   facilitating visit [sic: a visit] by a first on-line user to an information page of an information site;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   facilitating dynamic formation of a chat session unaffiliated with any pre-established chat room for said first on-line user and a second on-line user to chat with each other; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   facilitating said chat session through which said first and second on-line users chat with each other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Claim 2 depends from claim 1 and adds that \"said facilitating of dynamic formation of a chat session unaffiliated with any pre-established chat room comprises providing a mechanism to said first on-line user to initiate formation of said unaffiliated chat session.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Claim 3 depends from claim 2 and adds that \"said provision of a mechanism to said first on-line user to initiate formation of said unaffiliated chat session comprises providing a selectable icon for said first on-line user to indicate the first on-line user's desire to chat with another non-particularized on-line user.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Claim 4 depends from claim 3 and adds that \"said provision of a mechanism to said first on-line user to initiate formation of said unaffiliated chat session further comprises providing one or more dialog panels for said first on-line user to specific [sic: specify] one or more descriptive characteristics of said first on-line user.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Claim 19 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   19. An information server comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   a plurality of information pages to be selectively provided to a client computer responsive to the client computer's request; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   a first script/applet to be included with a responsive information page to\n   enable the client computer to initiate dynamic formation of a chat session unaffiliated with any pre-established chat room for a user of the client computer to chat with a second user of interest, also visiting the information server.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 24, 2018, Epic filed separate actions against three defendants: AutoNation, Inc. (Case No. 1:18-cv-139), Blue Jeans Network, Inc. (Case No. 1:18-cv-140), and Backblaze, Inc. (Case No. 1:18-cv-141). The actions against Blue Jeans Network and AutoNation, Inc., were subsequently dismissed following settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Backblaze has now sought dismissal of the action against it under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the ground that the asserted claims of the '599 patent are directed to abstract ideas and are not eligible for patenting in light of section 101 of the Patent Act. For the reasons set forth in detail below, the Court agrees with Backblaze that the asserted claims of the '599 patent are drawn to abstract ideas and are not patent-eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The framework for analyzing the issue of patentable subject matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is well settled.

First, the court must determine \"whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept,\" such as an abstract idea.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, if the claims are directed to an abstract idea, the court must decide whether there is an \"inventive concept\" in the claims at issue. The Supreme Court characterized an \"inventive concept\" as \"an element or combination of elements that is 'sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself' \"; the presence of an \"inventive concept,\" the Court explained, is enough to \" 'transform the nature of the claim' into a patent-eligible application.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mayo Collaborative Servs. v.

The second step, if reached, requires the court to \"look[ ] more precisely at what the claim elements add-specifically, whether, in the Supreme Court's terms, they identify an \" 'inventive concept' \" in the application of the ineligible matter to which (by assumption at step two) the claim is directed.\"\n   <em>\n    Elec.

Rather, both this court and the Supreme Court have found it sufficient to compare claims at issue to those claims already found to be directed to an abstract idea in previous cases.\"). Rather than a unitary test, what has emerged from the section 101 cases is a group of related principles that can be applied in gauging whether or not a patent claim is directed to an abstract idea. They include the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, the courts have characterized \"method[s] of organizing human activity\" as abstract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2356 ;\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech LLC v.

The Federal Circuit has focused on the problem of functional claiming in a number of recent section 101 decisions. In those cases, the Federal Circuit, treating the term \"abstract\" as an antonym of \"concrete\" or \"specific,\" has analyzed whether the claims before it are sufficiently concrete or specific to be directed to a patent-eligible process rather than a patent-ineligible result. For example, in\n   <em>\n    SAP America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517925\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/1161/#p1167\">\n    898 F.3d at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court asked whether the claim had \"the specificity required to transform [it] from one claiming only a result to one claiming a way of achieving it.\" To answer that question, the Federal Circuit has directed courts to \"look to whether the claims focus on a specific means or method, or are instead directed to a result or effect that itself is the abstract idea and merely invokes generic processes and machinery.\"\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media Ltd. v.

Applying Those Principles to This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Each of the above-listed principles that guide the courts' abstract idea inquiries points to the conclusion that the asserted claims of the '599 patent are directed to abstract ideas. First, the claims are directed to a method of organizing human activity. Second, the claims do not recite an improvement in computer technology. Third, the claims are functional in nature; they recite what the objective of the invention is, but not how that objective is to be accomplished. These points are addressed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Asserted claims 1-4 and 19 of the '599 patent are directed to the idea of a \"chat session\" for users of the Internet. More particularly, the idea underlying the claims is to provide an Internet user the ability to visit a website and then form a group from among those visiting the website to conduct a \"chat\" independent of the website. That idea can be expressed at several different levels of generality: (1) as the idea of individuals getting together to communicate; (2) as the idea of individuals getting together to communicate over the Internet; or (3) as the idea of individuals getting together to communicate over the Internet by forming a sub-group from the group of individuals visiting a website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The idea of individuals getting together to communicate is plainly abstract in the sense in which that term has been used in cases addressing the issue of patent eligibility: it is a commonplace occurrence with long historical (indeed, pre-historical) roots. The idea of a sub-group of persons with particular shared interests forming a sub-group for communication is also commonplace in everyday life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Epic argues that the invention is not drawn to an abstract idea because the activity takes place over the Internet. However, limiting the interpersonal contacts to communications over the Internet does not make the idea any less abstract; the Federal Circuit has made clear that conducting a commonplace activity over the Internet does not avoid the problem of abstractness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ultramercial\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p717\">\n    772 F.3d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The claims' invocation of the Internet ... adds no inventive concept.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BASCOM Glob.

Cir. 2014) (holding that a claim directed to guaranteeing a party's performance in an Internet transaction was directed to an abstract idea).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Epic further argues that the claims are not drawn to an abstract idea because the invention entails more than simply setting up a chat room on the Internet. The novelty, according to Epic, is that the invention provides for individuals who are visiting the same website to initiate private chats with one another, separate from the website that the individuals initially visited. The problem, however, is that the idea of a chat session separate from the original website is not an invention; it is a disembodied concept. The asserted claims of the '599 patent recite the concept, but not the way to implement it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Claim 1 is the worst offender. It is wholly devoid of concreteness. It recites an \"on-line chatting method\" comprising three steps: \"facilitating visit [sic] by an on-line user to an information site\"; \"facilitating the dynamic formation of a chat session, unaffiliated with any pre-established chat room,\" between the first on-line user and a second on-line user to chat with each other; and \"facilitating said chat session through which said first and second on-line users chat with each other.\" Those steps are just the barebones descriptions of a result. The claim contains no description of any mechanism by which that result is obtained. To use the words of the Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    RecogniCorp\n   </em>\n   , claim 1 of the '599 patent is not directed to \"a specific means or method for improving technology,\" but is \"simply directed to an abstract end-result.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277199\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/1322/#p1326\">\n    855 F.3d at 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citation omitted). The claim is thus clearly directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Independent claim 19 contains nothing of substance beyond what is contained in claim 1, and thus there is no difference between them for section 101 purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he system claims are no different from the method claims in substance. The method claims recite the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer; the system claims recite a handful of generic computer components configured to implement the same idea.\"). Claim 19 recites an \"information server\" comprising information pages that can be accessed by a client computer, with a \"script/applet\" included with each information page. The provision of a generic \"information page\" to a user is a necessary first step in forming any chat session, and the generic \"script/applet\" that is included in that page is simply a means of enabling the user to initiate formation of the chat session. The specification describes that process as \"conventional.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '599 patent, col. 5, ll. 38-41 (\"Information server\n   <strong>\n    404\n   </strong>\n   performs is [sic: its] conventional function of responding to visiting users, and providing the visiting users with requested ones of information pages\n   <strong>\n    118\n   </strong>\n   (including applicable ones of associated scripts/applets\n   <strong>\n    406)\n   </strong>\n   .\"). The specification makes clear that the term \"script/applet\" is not a reference to a specific device unique to this patent, but is simply a generic term for any mechanism by which the user can communicate with the server, such as to initiate a chat session or provide a description of \"interest characteristics\" of the user.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '599 patent, col. 5, ll. 27-30, 45-50, 56-63;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 5, line 63, through col. 6, line 22;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6, line 46, through col. 7, line 45.

That claim, too, adds no\n   specificity to the putative invention of claim 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Claim 4, which depends from claim 3, adds a mechanism, referred to as \"one or more dialog panels\" for the first on-line user \"to specific [sic: specify] one or more descriptive characteristics of said first on-line user.\" The specification makes clear that the \"dialog panel\" is merely a generic means for the user to identify characteristics that may be pertinent to the nature of the chat session in which he elects to engage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '599 patent, col. 6, line 66, through col. 7, line 16. That feature, like the additional features recited in claims 2 and 3, does not add specificity to the claimed invention. Formation of a separate chat session among persons sharing an interest in chatting necessarily requires a means for them to indicate their interest in doing so and naturally requires a means for them to communicate information that would induce others to join such a chat session. Thus, none of the dependent claims overcomes the abstractness of claim 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, under governing Federal Circuit precedent, claims 1 and 19 are so general in nature that they are clearly directed to abstract ideas. Dependent claims 2 and 3 add nothing more concrete, as they simply provide an unspecified mechanism by which the user can communicate with the information server. And dependent claim 4 merely provides a means for the user to communicate characteristics that form the basis for generating a chat session with other on-line users. Each of those additional features simply refers to the mechanism by which the user communicates his desires to the system-mechanisms that are implicit in claims 1 and 19 and add no more specificity to the patent claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

That problem was solved, according to Epic, \"through allowing the dynamic formation of a chat session unaffiliated with any pre-established chat sessions using scripts/applets included in information pages so that a user of the information website can chat with other users.\" Dkt. No. 27, at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   That characterization of the problem and its solution is simply saying that the problem was that chat sessions were restricted to pre-established chat rooms, rather than being initiated by individuals interested in chatting about a particular subject, while the solution to the problem was to allow individuals to initiate chat sessions without the constraints of a pre-existing chatroom. But that is not a description of the solution to the problem; it is just a description of the problem and an announcement that it has been solved. Nothing in the claims explains\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the solution is effectuated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In the case of claim 1, the proposed \"solution\" is simply to \"facilitate\" the establishment of independent chat sessions, which is no solution at all. In the case of dependent claims 2 and 3, the purported solution is the same, with the inclusion of necessarily inherent features of a generic device to initiate the formation of such a session and to indicate a desire to chat with another participant. In the case of claim 4, the additional step is simply a generic device by which the user can specify\n   one or more descriptive characteristics to facilitate the formation of a chat session among persons sharing an interest in chatting. In substance, claim 19 merely incorporates the limitations of the first two claims in apparatus form, referring to the mechanism on an information website for initiating the formation of a chat session by use of the generic term \"script/applets.\" Nothing in independent claims 1 and 19, or in dependent claims 2 through 4, offers a specific \"solution\" to the problem that Epic describes, as opposed to simply announcing that the solution to the problem of not having a way for on-line users to initiate their own chatroom sessions is to enable on-line users to initiate their own chatrooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   Epic next contends that the asserted claims of the '599 patent\"are directed to improved computer functionality\" and are \"rooted in a particular computer technology.\" Dkt. No. 27, at 11-12. That argument, however, misses the point of the cases that find improvements in computer technology to be non-abstract. That line of cases addresses technological improvements in the way the computer systems operate, not innovations that happen to employ computers. The cases on which Epic relies illustrate this distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Epic places particularly heavy reliance on\n   <em>\n    Finjan, Inc. v. Blue Coat Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267136\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1299/\">\n    879 F.3d 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2018). Contrary to Epic's contention, that case demonstrates why Epic's position with respect to the \"computer technology\" argument is flawed. Representative claim 1 in\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   was directed to a novel type of virus scan for computers. As construed, the claim recited a virus screening program that would identify suspicious code in an executable application program and would attach a security profile to the application program so that the recipient of the program could decide whether to access the program. Importantly, the claimed invention employed a novel \"behavior-based\" approach to virus scanning, rather than the conventional \"code-matching\" approach. The behavior-based approach involved determining whether an application was potentially dangerous by examining whether the application performed potentially dangerous or unwanted operations, unlike the code-matching approach, which merely determined whether the application's code matched previously known viruses. Based on that analysis, the court concluded that the claimed method \"employs a new kind of file that enables a computer security system to do things it could not do before.... The asserted claims are therefore directed to a non-abstract improvement in computer functionality, rather than the abstract idea of computer security writ large.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267136\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267136\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1299/\">\n    at 1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The facts of\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   make it clear how different that case is from this one. The invention in\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   solved a technological problem in a technological manner, by fashioning a new way of conducting virus scans. The claims in this case, by contrast, involve no improvements to the operation of computers themselves, but only an arguably new use to which conventional computer components can be put. The specification of the '599 patent repeatedly emphasizes that the invention involves only conventional computer and communications components. The only thing that is novel is the use to which those components are put.

As in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the asserted claims do not require any non-conventional computer or network, or even a non-conventional and non-generic arrangement\n   of known, conventional pieces. Rather, the claims merely call for the initiation of a chat session that is separate from any previously established chat room, by use of a set of generic computer components and display devices. Thus, like the claims in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the asserted claims in this case do not recite an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To support its contention that the claims satisfy the \"inventive concept\" requirement, Epic points to the invention generally. Epic contends that the inventive concept is that the '599 claims \"are directed to chat sessions that are dynamically formed by the user through an information page and are not affiliated with pre-established chat rooms.\" Dkt. No. 27, at 19. According to Epic, this is a significant improvement over prior art chat sessions because the prior art chat rooms \"were required to be pre-established and often required pre-registration and chatting only at specified times.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Epic's argument amounts to saying that the inventive concept resides in the invention itself, as a whole. But the Federal Circuit has explicitly rejected that approach to the \"inventive concept\" element of section 101 analysis. In\n   <em>\n    BSG\n   </em>\n   , the court explained that an inventive concept must \"ensure[ ] the patent amounts to 'significantly more' than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.\"\n   <em>\n    BSG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1285\">\n    899 F.3d at 1289-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2355 ). The court added that \"[i]t has been clear since\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   that a claimed invention's use of the ineligible concept to which it is directed cannot supply the inventive concept that renders the invention 'significantly more' than that ineligible concept.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1290 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erie Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   , 850 F.3d at 1328 (\"In applying step two of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   analysis, we must 'determine whether the claims do significantly more than simply describe [the] abstract method' and thus transform the abstract idea into patentable subject matter.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ultramercial\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p717\">\n    772 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   715 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As for Epic's argument that, prior to the invention, individuals could not join chat sessions that were unaffiliated with an pre-existing chat room, that argument amounts to saying that the invention, even if directed to an abstract idea, is nonetheless novel and therefore should be patent-eligible. But novelty and patent eligibility are different things.

Setting aside Epic's waiver argument, we agree with Backblaze that dependent claims 2-4 and independent claim 19 fail to recite any inventive concept, for the same reasons that apply to claim 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As for the dependent claims, the courts have made clear that adding a degree of particularity through additional limitations does not render dependent claims patent-eligible if the additional limitations merely add further insignificant details and do not convert otherwise patent-ineligible subject matter into a patent-eligible invention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Affinity Labs\n   </em>\n   , 838 F.3d at 1264 (dependent claims all recited functions that were not inventive but simply constituted \"particular choices from within the range of existing content or hardware\");\n   <em>\n    Internet Patents\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274492\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/1343/#p1346\">\n    790 F.3d at 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (additional limitations of the dependent claims held not to add an inventive concept, for \"they represent merely generic data collection steps or siting the ineligible concept in a particular technological environment\");\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/\">\n    776 F.3d at 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dependent claims did not add any inventive concepts, but merely recited routine and conventional functions of scanners and computers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   While dependent claims can be patent-eligible even when their corresponding independent claims are patent-ineligible,\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer v.

Cir. 2018), that is not the case here. As noted above, dependent claims 2 and 3 of the '599 patent contribute nothing of substance that is not implicit in claim 1, and dependent claim 4 merely adds a \"dialog panel\" by which the user can describe himself. None of those dependent claims can fairly be said to contain an inventive concept that contains \"significantly more\" than the ineligible concept itself.\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Claim 19 likewise contains nothing of substance beyond what is contained in claim 1, as noted above. The \"information page\" on which the option to form a chat session is presented to the user and the generic \"script/applet\" that enables the user to initiate formation of the chat session, are described in the specification as \"conventional.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '599 patent, col. 5, ll. 38-41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6, ll. 16-18 (scripts/applets described as \"implemented using any one of a number of programming languages known in the art\"). Given that the components set forth in the dependent claims as well as in claims 1 and 19 are identified in the specification as conventional, and the operations recited in the claims are the kinds of operations that are routinely performed by computers in a network system, the Court concludes that none of the asserted claims recite any computer function that is not \"well-understood, routine, and conventional.\" Thus, nothing in the five asserted claims qualifies as an \"inventive concept\" that would rescue the claim from ineligibility as an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Appropriateness of Resolving This Case on a Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Prior to the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the Court asked the parties to address what factual issues might be presented by the issues raised in the motion that would preclude addressing the patent-eligibility issue on a motion to dismiss. The Court raised that question in light of the recent Federal Circuit decisions in\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer v. HP Inc., supra\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/\">\n    882 F.3d 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2018), which held that the question whether a claim is directed to subject matter that is \"well-understood, routine, and conventional\" for purposes of the \"inventive concept\" inquiry can sometimes raise issues of fact that would preclude dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). The Court also asked the parties to address the question whether there were any potential claim construction issues that could make disposition of the case on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The parties addressed both of those issues at the hearing. Having heard the parties out on those issues, the Court has concluded that there are no factual issues that would preclude entry of judgment under Rule 12(b)(6) and no claim construction issues that would require the Court to await claim construction before determining whether the plaintiff's claims are patent-eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   With regard to factual issues, the\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   cases do not stand for the proposition that a plaintiff can avoid dismissal simply by reciting in the complaint that the invention at issue is novel. As discussed above, section 101 does not turn on novelty, and thus the fact that Epic's apparatus may have been unconventional in providing for chat sessions unaffiliated with a pre-established chat room does not mean that the claims necessarily incorporate an \"inventive concept.\" Moreover, as Judge Moore explained in her opinion concurring in the orders denying rehearing en banc in the\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   cases,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516929\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/1354/#p1359\">\n    890 F.3d 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1359 (Fed.

That is, the assertedly \"inventive concept\" is the abstract idea itself. As noted, however, the \"inventive concept\" element of the section 101 analysis requires \"significantly more\" than the abstract idea itself. At the hearing, Epic asserted that the fact issues with respect to claims 1-4 of the '599 patent are whether the limitations of each of those claims would be well-understood, routine, or conventional to a skilled artisan. But that is merely asking whether the claim as a whole is the inventive concept. With respect to claim 19, Epic asserted that the fact issue is whether the components of the second limitation of that claim would be well-understood, routine, or conventional\n   to a skilled artisan. That, again, is just another way of asking whether the claimed invention as a whole would be well-understood, routine, or conventional. Asking about the second limitation amounts to asking about the whole invention because the first limitation of claim 19 (the only other limitation of the claim) recites a server providing information pages to a client computer in response to the client computer's request. That limitation describes the most fundamental service provided by a website and merely sets the background for the second limitation in claim 19. Because Epic has not suggested that there is a factual issue as to whether the asserted claims are directed to something significantly more than the abstract idea itself, Epic has failed to point to a discrete factual issue on which the presence of an \"inventive concept\" in claim 19 would turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As to claim construction, the Federal Circuit has addressed the question whether a motion to dismiss under section 101 can be decided before claim construction. The court has held that a district court may do so if the nature of the claims is clear and it is apparent that claim construction would not affect the patent-eligibility of the claims at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Genetic Techs.

Cir. 2014) (\"There is no requirement that the district court engage in claim construction before deciding \u00a7 101 eligibility.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Epic has not pointed to any claim construction issue that would alter the Court's judgment as to the disposition of the section 101 motion. The claims are straightforward and not technical in nature, and plaintiff's counsel has not pointed to any terms from the asserted claims that would likely give rise to a material dispute over claim construction. At the hearing, counsel contended that the phrase \"facilitating dynamic formation of a chat session\" in claim 1 should be construed to mean \"providing a script/applet that is included with an information page to initiate the dynamic formation of the unaffiliated chat session through a chat session manager.\" The Court finds Epic's proposed construction to be questionable, as it imports subject matter from an embodiment in the specification and disregards the breadth of the term \"facilitating\" in claim 1. Nonetheless, even if claim 1 were construed as Epic suggests, the result of the section 101 analysis would be the same, since the effect of that claim construction would simply be to make the method of claim 1 congruent with the apparatus of claim 19, which the Court has also found to be patent-ineligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Accordingly, the Court believes it is both feasible and appropriate to decide the section 101 issue now and spare the parties the burdens that would be incurred in delaying disposition of the section 101 issue until after claim construction and summary judgment proceedings, or beyond. Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court holds that claims 1-4 and 19 of the '599 patent are not patent-eligible and therefore grants the defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Epic argues (Dkt. No. 27, at 8) that during prosecution of the '599 patent, the examiner initially rejected the claims based on a prior art reference to Tang, which disclosed initiating a chat session with another user associated with an information page. The examiner, however, withdrew the rejection when the applicants amended the claims to clarify that the term \"chat session\" in the application referred to chat sessions that were unaffiliated with any pre-established chat rooms. While that course of events may indicate that the examiner ultimately agreed that the application was not anticipated by the prior art reference, it does not speak to the question of patent eligibility which, as noted above, is a separate issue from anticipation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
