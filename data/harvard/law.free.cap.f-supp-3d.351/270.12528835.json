Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on December 31, 2017. (Dkt. 8-2 at 42). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since December 1, 2013, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of left hip pain, hypothyroidism, lymphedema, persistent depressive disorder, panic disorder without agoraphobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of gastro esophageal reflux disease, acne, and sleep apnea were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.02, 12.04, and 12.06 in reaching his conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of sedentary work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 416.967(a), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   is able to occasionally lift and/or carry 10 pounds; frequently lift and/or carry less than 10 pounds; stand and/or walk up to two hours in an eight hour day; sit about six hours in an eight hour day; occasionally push and/or pull 10 pounds; occasionally climb ramps and/or stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; never climb ladders[,] ropes[,] [or] scaffolds.

(Dkt. 11-1 at 19). Plaintiff also contends more generally that the ALJ failed to consider her \"chronic and progressive conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

(Dkt. 8-2 at 42). He also found that her chronic conditions of left hip pain, hypothyroidism, and lymphedema were severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At step three, the ALJ considered the severity of Plaintiff's physical impairments in the context of Listing 1.02 (requiring evidence of anatomical deformity and chronic joint pain and stiffness), and considered her mental impairments in the context of Listings 12.04 and 12.06, under both the \"paragraph B\" and \"paragraph C\" criteria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43). In assessing whether Plaintiff's impairments satisfied the paragraph B and C criteria, the ALJ discussed the assessment of Kavitha Finnity, Ph.D., who opined that Plaintiff was moderately limited in her ability to relate to others and deal with stress, as well as the state consultant's opinion that Plaintiff was moderately limited in working with others and responding to changes in the work setting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44). The ALJ further considered the opinions of Dr. Finnity and the state consultant in determining that Plaintiff has moderate difficulties in concentration, persistence, or pace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44). Specifically, while both medical sources found that Plaintiff could understand, remember, and carry out simple instructions, Plaintiff had some limitations in maintaining a regular schedule, maintaining attention and concentration for long periods, sustaining an ordinary routine, and performing at a consistent pace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although Plaintiff's anxiety and personality disorders are not explicitly discussed at step three, the record indicates that the ALJ considered evidence of these impairments. Specifically, the ALJ discussed Plaintiff's limitations in relating to others, dealing with stress, and responding to changes in the work setting - all of which are manifestations of Plaintiff's anxiety and personality disorder. \"There is no requirement that the language used by the ALJ ... mirror the terminology used by Plaintiff's physicians, so long as the ALJ properly analyzes Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments.\"\n   <em>\n    Guerra v.

Mar. 20, 2015) (quotation and alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court finds that the ALJ properly weighed the opinion evidence and assessed an RFC that is supported by the record. The written determination contains an explanation of the opinion evidence in the record, including opinions offered by: Dr. Eurenius, an internal medical consultant; Dr. Seok, the state medical consultant; Lara Evans, M.D., Plaintiff's treating physician; Ms. Bergen, Plaintiff's physician assistant; Ms. Weingart, Plaintiff's treating therapist; Dr. Finnity, a consultative psychologist; and the state psychological consultant. (Dkt. 8-2 at 46-49). Of these many opinions, only the opinion of Dr. Evans, Plaintiff's treating physician, is entitled to special deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff began treating with Dr. Evans in February 2002. (Dkt. 8-7 at 422). In June 2014, Dr. Evans completed a Monroe County Department of Human Services Assessment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Evans noted that Plaintiff was able to use public transportation, her general appearance and gait were normal, and she was able to participate in activities, including work, education, and training, for up to 40 hours per week, with reasonable accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 422-24). Dr. Evans recommended that Plaintiff work in a job with a flexible schedule, so that she could attend doctor's appointments, and opined that Plaintiff should avoid working conditions that involve \"prolonged standing,\" and should be able to sit, when needed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 424). An examination revealed normal findings, other than some hearing loss and lymphedema. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 425). Dr. Evans opined that Plaintiff had no evidence of limitations for sitting, seeing, hearing, and speaking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). With regard to walking, standing, pushing, pulling, bending, lifting, and carrying, Plaintiff was moderately limited (between two to four hours in an eight-hour workday). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The ALJ assigned \"significant weight\" to the opinion of Dr. Evans, based on her treatment relationship with Plaintiff, her regular contact with Plaintiff, and also the consistency of the opinion with her examinations of Plaintiff. (Dkt. 8-2 at 49). Importantly, while the ALJ did not expressly state that he was affording Dr. Evans' opinion controlling weight, the assessed RFC is entirely consistent Dr. Evans' opinion. The ALJ's finding that Plaintiff is capable of occasionally lifting and carrying ten pounds, standing and/or walking for up to two hours in an eight-hour day, and occasionally pushing and/or pulling ten pounds, is consistent with Dr. Evans' assessment that Plaintiff was moderately limited in walking, standing, pushing, pulling, bending, lifting, and carrying. Similarly, the ALJ's finding that Plaintiff is capable of sitting about six hours in an eight-hour day is consistent with Dr. Evans' assessment that Plaintiff has no limitations for sitting. The assessed limitations for walking and standing also are consistent with Dr. Evans' opinion that Plaintiff avoid prolonged standing, and be able to sit, when needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the Court finds no error or violation of the treating physician\n   rule in the ALJ's consideration of Dr. Evans' opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff has not identified specifically which portions of the remaining opinion evidence in the record she contends were improperly weighed by the ALJ. Rather, she argues only generally that \"[t]he ALJ failed to properly evaluate medical and other opinions, and selectively used his own lay opinion in RFC findings.\" (Dkt. 11-1 at 22). Despite Plaintiff's failure to particularize her arguments, the Court has reviewed the opinion evidence in the record and concludes that it was properly assessed by the ALJ. For example, the ALJ explained why he failed to adopt the opinions of certain sources, including opinions offered by Ms. Bergen and Ms. Weingart. Ms. Bergen opined in November 2014 that Plaintiff was unable to work for six to twelve months, and found that Plaintiff was \"very limited\" (meaning she could perform these tasks for only one to two hours) in her ability to sit, stand, walk, push, pull, bend, lift, and carry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-7 at 434-37). The ALJ noted that these limitations conflicted with the opinion of Dr. Evans (Dkt. 8-2 at 46) and assigned the opinion \"some weight\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48). The ALJ then elaborated on his reasoning for not adopting Ms. Bergan's opinion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49 (Ms. Bergan's \"assessment indicates significantly more limitation than the assessment completed by treating physician, Dr. Evans.

(Dkt. 8-2 at 48;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-7 at 393-96). The ALJ noted that these opinions conflicted with Ms. Weingart's treatment notes, which showed benign and unremarkable mental status examinations, as well as general improvement in Plaintiff's symptoms. (Dkt. 8-2 at 48). The ALJ pointed to several specific exhibits in the record where Ms. Weingart's treatment notes conflicted with her June 2014 opinion regarding Plaintiff's mental functioning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The ALJ also discussed Ms. Weingart's November 2014 assessment, which showed\n   improvement in Plaintiff's condition, including: a GAF of 55; normal ability to follow, understand, and remember simple instructions, regularly attend to a routine and maintain a schedule, and perform low stress and simple tasks; and moderate limitations in her ability to perform simple and complex tasks independently, and maintain attention and concentration for rote tasks. Despite these improvements in Plaintiff's mental functioning, Ms. Weingart again found that Plaintiff was unable to participate in any activities, other than treatment, for six months. (Dkt. 8-2 at 48;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-7 at 430-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The ALJ assigned the opinions offered by Ms. Weingart \"some weight,\" based on her treatment relationship with Plaintiff, but also noted that her opinion was inconsistent with her benign findings on most of her mental status examinations, including more recent examinations from July 2014. (Dkt. 8-2 at 49;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 8-8 at 12-13, 15, 18-19). The Court has reviewed the opinion evidence offered by Ms. Weingart, and finds that the ALJ's weighing of her opinion was proper, particularly in light of Ms. Weingart's normal mental status examinations, and because her opinion was not entitled to controlling weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

The records from Ms. Hall make up seven pages in the over 1300-page record before the Court. The Court has reviewed the records from Ms. Hall (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-6 at 47-53) and finds that they do not contain any information inconsistent with the assessed RFC. While Ms. Hall found that Plaintiff met \"significantly disabled criteria\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51), she also noted that Plaintiff was currently working in the same position since 2011 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48). The only functional limitations assessed in the records include that Plaintiff: is unable to work beyond scheduled hours; cannot tolerate high stress environments and situations; has high anxiety, which triggers paranoia, anger, emotional meltdown, and loss of focus; her concentration is impacted by her depression; needs to avoid negative supervision; and works well in an independent environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53). These limitations are consistent with the assessed RFC, including the limitations for concentration, working in a low-stress environment, and limited interaction with others. In other words, the functional limitations assessed by Ms. Hall were not significantly more favorable to Plaintiff than the other opinion evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zabala v.

As explained above, Dr. Evans' assessment directly supports the ALJ's assessment of Plaintiff's physical limitations. Further, the mental limitations included in the RFC finding, including that Plaintiff can understand, remember, and carry out simple instructions, can occasionally interact with co-workers and supervisors, can have little to no contact with the general public, can work in a low stress environment, and can maintain concentration and focus for up to two hours at a time, are supported by the opinion of Dr. Finnity (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-2 at 47 (discussing Dr. Finnity's observation that Plaintiff had intact concentration, her opinion that Plaintiff had no limitations in her ability to follow and understand simple directions, perform simple tasks, maintain attention and concentration, learn new tasks, perform complex tasks, or make appropriate decisions, and her opinion that Plaintiff was mildly limited in her ability to maintain a regular schedule and moderately limited in her ability to relate with others and deal with stress) ), as well as the opinion of the state psychological consultant (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48 (discussing opinion of state psychological consultant that Plaintiff was not significantly limited in her ability to understand, remember and carry out short and simple instructions, and make simple work-related decisions, was moderately limited in her ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods, perform activities within a schedule, sustain an ordinary routine without special supervision, work in coordination with or proximity to others, perform at a consistent pace, interact appropriately with supervisors, co-workers, and the public, and respond appropriately to changes in the work setting, and that Plaintiff was able to perform unskilled, repetitive tasks) ). The mental RFC also is supported by the November 2014 opinion of Ms. Weingart, who found that Plaintiff had normal ability to follow, understand, and remember simple instructions, regularly attend to a routine and maintain a schedule, and perform low stress and simple tasks, and was only moderately limited in her ability to perform simple and complex tasks independently and maintain attention and concentration for rote tasks.

The Appeals Council addressed this evidence and determined that these records \"did not show a reasonable probability that it would change the outcome of the decision.\" (Dkt. 8-2 at 3).

However, evidence that does not provide additional information about the claimant's functioning during the relevant time period, but instead relates to his or her functioning at some later point in time, need not be considered by the Appeals Council.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vitale v.

Rather, those records, like the records reviewed by the ALJ prior to issuing the written determination, reveal normal mental impressions, as well as improvement in Plaintiff's conditions. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 8-2 at 116 (in January 2016, \"[Plaintiff] was pleasant and easily engaged during the interview,\" and Plaintiff, who used to have frequent panic attacks, now has them \"very infrequently ... she could not remember when she last experienced one\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 134-35 (in January 2016, mental status exam revealed that Plaintiff was more anxious than she had been in previous sessions, but she was cooperative, her thought processes were tangential, perception was normal, she was alert and oriented, her remote and recent memory was intact, her cognitive function was average, judgment was intact, and insight was good);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 158 (in February 2016, noting that Plaintiff \"is very articulate, insightful, able to express her needs, and invested in treatment.

In general she is doing well and is working to improve her health\") ). While some of these records reflect that Plaintiff continued to experience hypervigilance, paranoid thinking, and phobic feelings, a claimant's subjective complaints, without objective medical evidence, do not compel a finding of disability. Rather, \"there must be medical signs or other findings which show the existence of a medical condition that reasonably could be expected to produce\n   the symptomatology alleged and that, considered with all the evidence, demonstrates that plaintiff is disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    Richard H. v.

Despite these complaints from Plaintiff, her treatment plan mostly remained the same during this time (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 135, 145, 157, 185, 194, 204, 213, 229, 252, 261, 290, 299, 331, 352, 361, 371), and her mental status exams were relatively normal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Similarly, the further opinion evidence submitted by Ms. Weingart from November 13, 2015, is less favorable to Plaintiff than previous opinions offered by Ms. Weingart. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-2 at 387-89 (Plaintiff had normal \"functioning\" with \"no evidence of limitation\" in all areas of mental functioning; could work 30 hours per week; and would need a fixed schedule, frequent breaks, limited contact with the public, and performance of low stress tasks) ). Accordingly, the ALJ's consideration of the opinion evidence dated November 13, 2015, would not change the outcome of the disability determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The medical source statement from Ms. Healy, on the other hand, does assess Plaintiff as having more severe limitations than those found by the ALJ. Ms. Healy examined Plaintiff on April 5, 2016. (Dkt. 8-2 at 34). The statement indicates that Ms. Healy has treated Plaintiff for two years, as part of weekly group therapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). Ms. Healy found that Plaintiff was oriented to time and place, but explained that her mental impairments caused memory deficits, made her hyperreactive to daily stressors, gave her paranoid thoughts and panic attacks, and made her cognitively irrational. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Healy opined that Plaintiff could not engage in full-time competitive employment, because of the severity of her recurrent and major depression and PTSD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Healy further opined that Plaintiff had difficulty understanding, carrying out, and remembering simple instructions; difficulty interacting with others; and difficulty handling or responding to issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33). Ms. Healy opined that Plaintiff would be off task for more than thirty percent of the workday, and that she would be absent on average more than four days per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant contends that the Appeals Council correctly concluded that the records submitted by Ms. Healy are outside of the relevant period and do not remark on Plaintiff's condition during the relevant period of disability. (Dkt. 14-1 at 20). The ALJ's written determination is dated February 22, 2016; therefore, the April 5, 2016 examination by Ms. Healy took place about six weeks outside of the relevant period, and close to four months after the administrative hearing. Plaintiff does not make any argument as to why this opinion specifically should have been considered by the Appeals Council and would result in a finding of disability, nor does the Court's review support such a conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   While the medical source statement indicates that Ms. Healy has known Plaintiff for two years, the record does not appear to contain any treatment records from her. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-1). Neither Plaintiff's nor Defendant's medical summary includes a discussion of Plaintiffs treatment with Ms. Healy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11, 14, 16). Moreover, Ms. Healy's medical source statement does not indicate that it is meant to provide a retrospective assessment of Plaintiff's functioning. Bearing this information in mind, the Court finds that the April statement is not relevant to the period of disability. Rather, the report is a snap shot of Plaintiff's condition in April 2016, and does not clearly\n   refer to the relevant period of disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.
