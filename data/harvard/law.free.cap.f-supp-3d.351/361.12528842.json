If so, the claimant is not disabled.

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on December 31, 2013. (Dkt. 7 at 25). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity during the period from her alleged onset date of August 27, 2010, through her date last insured of December 31, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of: obesity, foot problems (callouses and plantar fasciitis ), depression, and anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). With respect to Plaintiff's representations that she suffered from numbness and tingling in her right hand, as well as left knee pain, the ALJ concluded that these were not medically determinable impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically\n   equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.02, 12.04, and 12.06, in reaching her conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff, through the date last insured, retained the RFC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   to lift and carry up to 10 pounds occasionally, and less than 10 pounds frequently; sit 6 hours in an eight-hour workday, stand or walk a total of 2 hours in an eight-hour workday. In addition[,] she requires routine daily tasks which do not significantly change in pace or location on a daily basis. She also requires an occupation which does not require her to talk to the public on the telephone or in person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28). At step four, the ALJ found that through the date last insured, Plaintiff was unable to perform any past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of document preparer, addresser, and stem mounter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act at any time from August 27, 2010, the alleged onset date, through December 31, 2013, Plaintiff's date last insured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Remand of this Matter for Further Proceedings is Necessary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to reverse or, in the alternative, remand the Commissioner's decision, arguing that: (1) the ALJ improperly evaluated and rejected opinion evidence in the record, resulting in an RFC finding that is not supported by substantial evidence; (2) the ALJ failed to develop the record by obtaining evidence relating to Plaintiff's impairments and limitations existing prior to her date last insured; and (3) the ALJ failed to properly evaluate Plaintiff's credibility. (Dkt. 11-1 at 18-30). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ erred in failing to obtain any opinion evidence from an acceptable medical source relevant to the period of disability at issue, and assessed Plaintiff's RFC based on her own lay interpretation of the medical record. This error necessitates remand for further administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The RFC Finding is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the ALJ improperly substituted her own opinion over medical opinions in the record from Dr. Prakash Reddy, Dr. Elizabeth Naumburg,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and social worker Beverly J. Dodd, and then failed to further develop the record by obtaining opinion evidence relating to Plaintiff's functional limitations from the period of disability at issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-27). Defendant argues in response that the ALJ reasonably assessed the medical records and opinions in the record. (Dkt. 14-1 at 13). Defendant further contends that Plaintiff's argument that the ALJ did not develop the record \"attempts to shift the burden to the agency to show that she is not disabled,\" and \"a lack of evidence showing the existence of a functional limitation constitutes substantial evidence that\n   such a limitation does not exist.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In deciding a disability claim, an ALJ is tasked with \"weigh[ing] all of the evidence available to make an RFC finding that [is] consistent with the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Matta v.

In the letter, Ms. Dodd explained that Plaintiff had been a client since January 2013, and was treated for symptoms of general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and depressive disorder.

Dr. Ransom opined that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   will have mild difficulty following and understanding simple directions and instructions, perform simple tasks independently, maintain attention and concentration for simple tasks, maintain a simple regular schedule and learn simple new tasks, performing complex tasks, relating adequately with others and appropriately dealing with stress. The results of the evaluation appear to be consistent with mild psychiatric conditions, which will not significantly interfere with the claimant's ability to function on a daily basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 556). Dr. Harding, one of the Administration's medical review psychologists, found that there was insufficient evidence to adjudicate Plaintiff's claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 65 (Plaintiff's \"[a]llegations are partially credible but there exists not enough medical data to substantiate a determination as to severity, frequency or intensity\") ). The ALJ noted that other medical evidence received after the date of Dr. Harding's review of the evidence was sufficient to determine that Plaintiff had severe mental impairments prior to her date last insured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The ALJ weighed the opinions of Ms. Dodd and Dr. Ransom in assessing Plaintiff's claim. Regarding Ms. Dodd's opinion that Plaintiff was disabled, the ALJ assigned it no evidentiary weight \"because that fact is one for determination by the Commissioner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). The ALJ considered Ms. Dodd's opinion relating to Plaintiff's limitations for concentration and dealing with stressors only at step two of the disability analysis (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to assess that Plaintiff's mental impairments were severe), because Ms. Dodd allegedly did not indicate that Plaintiff's limitations were present prior to January 1, 2014, during the relevant period of disability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (\"Also, while the symptoms were said to cause problems with concentration and dealing with stressors, Ms. Dodd did not indicate if that limited effect was present prior to January 1, 2014\") ). Similarly, in weighing the opinion of Dr. Ransom, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff described her symptoms to Dr. Ransom \"as they affected her in 2016, at the time of the interview.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32). Because Dr. Ransom indicated that Plaintiff's limitations were present as of March 8, 2016 (the date of the examination), the ALJ assigned her opinion no evidentiary weight, because it did not relate to the period before December 31, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The ALJ's statement that Ms. Dodd did not indicate that Plaintiff's limitations were present prior to January 1, 2014, is inaccurate. As noted above, on May 11, 2016, two days before the hearing and almost three months prior to the issuance of the written determination, Ms. Dodd reaffirmed her opinion that Plaintiff was precluded from work and clarified that Plaintiff's \"limitations and [Plaintiff's] inability to function in the workplace existed prior to December 31, 2013.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 661). The ALJ failed to address Ms. Dodd's opinion that Plaintiff's disabling limitations existed prior to her date last insured, despite the fact that this opinion was submitted well in advance of the written determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is cognizant\n   that a therapist is not an acceptable medical source, and therefore their opinions are not entitled to controlling weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

LEXIS 170267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Given the lack of opinion evidence in the record relating to Plaintiff's functional limitations during the relevant period of disability, the ALJ should have considered Ms. Dodd's opinion that Plaintiff's impairments in concentrating and dealing with stress existed prior to December 31, 2013. The fact that Plaintiff possessed these limitations is underscored by the opinion of Dr. Ransom, who also found that Plaintiff had mild limitations in maintaining attention and concentration for simple tasks and appropriately dealing with stress (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 556), as well as other medical evidence in the record, showing that Plaintiff began struggling with mental health issues beginning in 2010 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28), and received treatment for these issues beginning in 2011 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On remand, the ALJ should consider Ms. Dodd's opinion that Plaintiff's limitations existed prior to December 31, 2013, or explain her reasoning as to why Ms. Dodd's May 2016 opinion is not consistent with other medical evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     RFC Assessment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In assessing Plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ acknowledged in the written determination that \"[t]he record does not contain any statement of the claimant's physical and mental function-by-function limitation from any treating source issued prior to January 1[,] 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). She then explained how she assessed Plaintiff's RFC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   I have limited the claimant to performing low stress and simple work requiring no more than sedentary exertion. In doing so, I have given evidentiary weight to the claimant's statement regarding what she has remained able to do and have recognized that her obesity has most likely limited her to sedentary work. The limitation concentrating noted by the therapist in 2016, likely was present (although undocumented) during the period prior to the date last insured. I have given the claimant the benefit of the doubt in limiting the claimant in the mental work tasks identified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33). This explanation is insufficient to explain the basis for the ALJ's RFC finding. As acknowledged by the ALJ, the record is devoid of opinion evidence as to Plaintiff's functional limitations, and it is not clear what evidence in the record informed the RFC assessment, other than the ALJ's general statement that she relied on \"what [Plaintiff] has been able to do,\" and \"likely\" limitations\n   due to her obesity. Although the written determination contains a description of Plaintiff's daily activities, the ALJ is not a medical expert, and is not permitted to translate these activities into functional limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judd v.

The Court is cognizant that the record appears to lack evidence of Plaintiff's functional limitations relevant to the period of disability. However, the ALJ's resolving that issue by fashioning an RFC without any evidence relating to Plaintiff's functional limitations was error.

However, there are no records in this case from any Dr. Baumburg. Instead, it appears that Plaintiff is referring to findings by her primary care physician, Dr. Naumburg.

I have given the claimant the benefit of the doubt in limiting the claimant in the mental work tasks identified.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 14-1 at 15). This one-sentence statement is insufficient, as it does not contain a discussion of Ms. Dodd's opinion, including her opinion relating to Plaintiff's difficulty dealing with stressors or her opinion that Plaintiff is unable to work.
