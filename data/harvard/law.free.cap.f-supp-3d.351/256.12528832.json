Bean's \"satisfaction guarantee\" policy. Compl. (ECF No. 1). On behalf of a nationwide class, consisting of herself and all other \"persons in the United States and its territories who purchased, other than for resale, products from L.L.

Separately, she asserts claims on behalf of a New York subclass, consisting of all persons in the State of New York who purchased, other than for resale, products from L.L. Bean prior to February 9, 2018. On behalf of the New York subclass, she alleges (1) violation of New York General Business Law \u00a7 349 and (2) violation of New York General Business Law \u00a7 350. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-60. L.L. Bean has moved (1) to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, and (2) to strike the class allegations. For reasons that will be discussed below, L.L. Bean's motion to dismiss is granted because this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Lacking jurisdiction, the Court cannot and does not reach the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or the motion to strike.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For much of its history, L.L.

Although plaintiff alleges that certain provisions of the guarantee were changed retroactively, she does not dispute that the guarantee applicable to her purchases remains of lifetime duration.

Emphatically, the warranty on her jacket was not shortened to only one year. Berger's only arguable injury is that, if, in the future, she attempts to return her jacket, she will, first, have to produce proof of purchase, and, second, worry that the return will not be accepted because L.L. Bean determines that the jacket was damaged due to misuse or excessive wear and tear. But these concerns are, at best, distant since Berger has not attempted to return an L.L. Bean product and been refused a refund. She has not even alleged that she is dissatisfied with her jacket or intends to return it in the future. Nor has she claimed to lack proof of purchase.

It is clear that the rejection of her return is not certainly impending because the complaint does not even remotely suggest that Berger will ever seek a return.

There is unquestionably a difference in value between a valid insurance policy, which is presumptively worth the premium, and a void insurance policy, which is presumptively worth nothing. That, however, is not the case here. The value of Berger's coat is unchanged, regardless of the guarantee policy. As shown below, moreover, L.L. Bean was always entitled to demand proof of purchase (the purchaser was the party to whom it had made its guarantee) and to reject returns of damaged items, given the requirement of good faith in commercial transactions. There is, in short, no difference in value between a satisfaction guarantee with implicit requirements of proof of purchase and good faith and one with identical requirements that have been stated explicitly. Therefore,\n    <em>\n     Dubuisson\n    </em>\n    is inapposite, and Berger has not established injury-in-fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Refining focus, L.L. Bean was always entitled to demand proof of purchase from customers. Both the original policy and the revised policy offered a guarantee only to L.L. Bean customers and not to their assigns.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Old Policy. As a result, L.L. Bean has always been permitted to refuse a return from an assign. Should a dispute have arisen over whether a prospective returner was a customer or an assign of a customer, resolution of such a dispute would have required the claimant to produce proof of purchase. Indeed, L.L. Bean's original return policy requested that customers \"include [the original receipt] with the items [they] wish to return or exchange.\" Old Policy. The original policy also provided that the company \"may either require a receipt or decline a return or exchange in certain situations,\" which included cases where \"an item ... has been defaced ... soiled or contaminated ... [or] damaged due to fire, flood or\n    natural disaster.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276110\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/76/#p79\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Off base, then, is Berger's claim that L.L. Bean's earlier promise to take back a purchase that is not \"lasting as long as [the customer] think[s] it should,\" Old Policy, was an unconditional promise to take back any item at the customer's sole discretion.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Quite to the contrary, even the original policy contained a discretionary proof of purchase requirement with conditions pertaining to damage to the item.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    To press the point further, Berger was never entitled to return a product that had been misused or subject to excessive wear and tear. As noted above, that understanding is in complete harmony with L.L. Bean's old return policy. Moreover, the statutes that plaintiff invokes here impose duties of good faith and requirements of reasonableness that governed the original warranty. For example, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act provides that the duties it imposes on warrantors are abrogated if the warrantor \"can show that the defect, malfunction, or failure of any warranted consumer product to conform with a written warranty, was caused by damage (not resulting from defect or malfunction) while in the possession of the consumer, or unreasonable use (including failure to provide reasonable and necessary maintenance).\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202304\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c). Therefore, even under the original policy, L.L. Bean was excused from accepting a return that fell under the newly imposed special conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    To the extent Berger brings claims under contract law, its contract with L.L. Bean similarly excused the retailer from accepting returns covered by the new conditions. The Court cannot, giving the pleading of a putative nationwide class, expend its resources to recite the contract law of every U.S. jurisdiction, but it can take as a model the Uniform Commercial Code, under which \"[e]very contract or duty ... imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement,\" U.C.C. \u00a7 1-304. The Code, in turn, defines \"good faith\" as \"honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202304\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1-201(b)(20).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Clearly, an attempt to return a product that has been misused, abused, neglected, damaged by a pet, or improperly cared for would be dishonest and, thus, not in good faith. Indeed, it would be a patent lie to claim that a product was \"not working or fitting or standing up to its task or lasting as long as you think it should,\" Old Policy, when the product had been \" 'damaged by misuse, abuse, improper care or negligence, or accidents (including pet damage)' or suffer[ed] from 'excessive wear and tear,' \" Opp'n at 3 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 19).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    In any event, to the extent that plaintiff construes the old guarantee as triggering L.L. Bean's duties under the guarantee on a customer's actual satisfaction (emphasizing\n    the language \"as long as\n    <em>\n     you\n    </em>\n    think it should\"), general contract principles caveat that courts should ask \"whether a\n    <em>\n     reasonable person\n    </em>\n    ... would be satisfied,\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 228 (emphasis added). When such an inquiry is impossible, the Restatement nonetheless mandates that \"the exercise of judgment must be in accordance with the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202304\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    cmt.a. Therefore, contract law never allowed plaintiff an unqualified lifetime right under the old guarantee to return, at her sole discretion, damaged or misused items. The revised policy, as a result, merely makes explicit what had already been implied by law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    In sum, because the new conditions are no more restrictive than the implicit conditions of the original policy, Berger has not shown that her jacket decreased in value. On the other approach to standing, given that she has not attempted to return the jacket, she has not shown that L.L. Bean will not accept her return. Having made neither of these showings, Berger has not established injury-in-fact and does not have Article III standing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Unnamed Class Members\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    On a final note, the fact that some unnamed class members may have suffered injuries-in-fact does not create subject matter jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Spokeo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n     136 S.Ct. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1547 n.6 (\"[E]ven named plaintiffs who represent a class 'must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong.' \" (quoting\n    <em>\n     Simon v.

Substantial uncertainty exists as to whether L.L. Bean would accept a return of plaintiff's coat, but that uncertainty is due entirely to plaintiff's failure to attempt to return her coat. On a litigation bridge to nowhere, the parties ask the Court to complete the journey by engaging in a game of \"what if\" and by reviewing, under seal, numerous internal corporate documents regarding implementation scenarios for the new policy. They advance divergent interpretations of how these documents might shape a response to an attempt by Berger to return\n    her jacket. That the Court is invited to wade into the roiling waters of how a hypothetical L.L. Bean sales representative might apply corporate policy to a speculative future return of the jacket in some undefined condition resulting from unspecified circumstances proves convincingly that any such contingency is not now fit for judicial decision. Accordingly, the Court must find the claim stated by Berger to be unripe, precluding judicial resolution and declaratory judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Underscoring this conclusion, there is no hardship to plaintiff of withholding judicial consideration at this time.
