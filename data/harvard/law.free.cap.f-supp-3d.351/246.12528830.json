VITALIANO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 20, 2017, plaintiff Minghui Pan commenced this action, seeking review of the determination by United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\") denying his application for adjustment of his immigration status, as well as his subsequent motion to reopen and reconsider that application. (Compl., ECF No. 1). Defendants have moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (Mot. to Dismiss at 1, ECF No. 18). Plaintiff has not filed a brief in opposition. For the reasons set forth below, this action is dismissed without prejudice for want of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 18, 1992, Pan entered the United States via an aircraft that landed at Honolulu International Airport in Hawaii. (Certified Administrative Record at 112, ECF No. 20-1 (\"R.\") ). During an airport inspection with an official from the then Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"), he presented a Singaporean passport bearing his photograph and identifying him as Guan Guan Ong. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145). The passport contained a United States nonimmigrant visa. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). When INS conducted a secondary inspection, Pan admitted that he was not Guan Guan Ong. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113). INS paroled him into the United States and began exclusion proceedings,\n   a predecessor to contemporary removal proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 123-25). Pan was charged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , with inadmissibility under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(C)(i) for having procured or sought to procure a visa, other documentation, admission into the United States, or other immigration benefit through fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He admitted that he had violated the statute in the underlying exclusion proceedings, where he was represented by counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 22, 1994, an immigration judge (\"IJ\") ordered Pan excluded and deported. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111). Plaintiff appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). On May 16, 1995, BIA affirmed the IJ's order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Nonetheless, to this day, Pan has failed to depart the United States as required. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 16, 2016, plaintiff filed an I-485 adjustment-of-status application with USCIS, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-43), and, on May 31, 2016 and February 6, 2017, he appeared before USCIS for interviews regarding his application, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). On March 17, 2017, however, USCIS denied the adjustment application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-10). The agency noted that, when Pan filed his application, he was \"present in the United States contrary to law because [he had been] ordered excluded by the IJ on November 22, 1994.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). USCIS determined that plaintiff was inadmissible \"for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact\" because he \"attempted to gain admission into the United States by presenting a fraudulent photo substituted Singapore passport when [he] arrived.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The decision advised Pan that he was \"not authorized to remain in the United States\" and directed him to \"make arrangements to depart as soon as possible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 21, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion to reopen and reconsider his adjustment application, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25), but, on August 17, 2017, USCIS denied the motion and affirmed its March 17, 2017 decision on the adjustment application, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3). The agency invoked statutory and discretionary grounds for its decision. It determined that Pan was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(C)(i), for \"willfully misrepresenting a material fact\" when he \"presented a Singaporean passport with [his] photograph issued to Guan Guan Ong.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). It also denied his application \"as a matter of discretion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The decision noted that an applicant may offset adverse factors in his application \"by showing unusual or even outstanding equities,\" with examples being \"family ties, hardship, and length of residence in the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, USCIS found that Pan's fraudulent entry, combined with his remaining in the United States and his engaging in unauthorized employment, \"outweigh[ed] the scarce positive equity that [he] presented before USCIS such as [his] family ties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pan filed the complaint in this action on September 19, 2017. (Compl., ECF No. 1). Defendants served their motion on plaintiff's counsel on August 21, 2018. (Letter at 1, ECF No. 21). One month later, plaintiff moved for an extension of time to serve his opposition, (Mot. for Extension of Time, ECF No. 14), which the Court granted, setting an extended due date of October 11, 2018. Notwithstanding, despite several efforts by defense counsel, plaintiff never submitted opposition papers. (Letter at 1, ECF No. 21). Thus, the Court considers the motion without the benefit of responsive briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The burden of establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction rests on the shoulders of the party invoking jurisdiction, not the party challenging it, and proof of jurisdiction\n   must be by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Augienello v.

The Court, for example, lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Congress has precluded judicial review of discretionary immigration decisions, including decisions on I-485 adjustment applications, the authority for which derives from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, USCIS's decision on Pan's I-485 application is unreviewable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There is, though, a need to pause before resolving plaintiff's application for relief since USCIS invoked both statutory and discretionary grounds for its decision. Congress has carved out an exception permitting judicial review of \"nondiscretionary decisions regarding [an] alien's eligibility [for status adjustment].\"\n   <em>\n    Sandhu v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4302936\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/329/#p333\">\n    916 F.Supp.2d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). However, where an immigration judge denies an application for adjustment of status \"based both on his determination that [an alien] was statutorily ineligible for such relief and his determination that [the alien] did not merit a favorable exercise of discretion,\" the Second Circuit has held that courts \"lack[ ] jurisdiction to review such a discretionary denial.\"\n   <em>\n    Ling Yang v. Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3619119\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/278/#p279\">\n    514 F.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam). The jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) stems from Congress's determination that Article III courts should not revisit an immigration judge's weighing of evidence,\n   <em>\n    Guyadin v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5410386\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/465/#p468\">\n    449 F.3d 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468 (2d Cir. 2006), and such balancing is implicated even when an immigration judge relies only in part on discretionary factors. Because the immigration judge here invoked Pan's statutory violation as well as determined that the \"positive equity is not sufficiently meritorious to\n   <em>\n    outweigh\n   </em>\n   the negative equities,\" (R. at 3 (emphasis added) ), his decision was certainly at least partially discretionary, and judicial review is barred by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).
