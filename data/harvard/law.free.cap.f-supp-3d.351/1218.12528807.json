Latimer (\"Latimer\") seeks a Writ of Habeas Corpus vacating his conviction and sentence for attempted murder in the first degree and attempted murder in the second degree. Latimer raises 13 grounds which he argues support his right to habeas relief. Most of the arguments Latimer raises are procedurally defaulted or fail to invoke the Court's jurisdiction, and his remaining claim fails on the merits. For the reasons outlined below, the Court recommends that Latimer's petition be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While incarcerated at the Rush City, Minnesota Correctional Facility (\"Rush City\") in June 2012, Latimer assaulted a fellow inmate (\"J.V.\") with a wooden board.\n   <em>\n    Minnesota v.

He first argues that the terms of the plea agreement for his prior conviction were altered after his plea was entered, extending the length of his conditional release from five years to ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet., Docket No. 3 at 1 (\"ground five\"); Pet'r's Mem. 14, Docket No. 3 at 22.

Federal courts may only grant habeas relief to individuals \"in custody\" for the conviction or sentence which they are challenging,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which is a jurisdictional limitation.\n   <em>\n    Maleng v.

Read in the most generous light, Latimer's arguments in grounds five and six of his petition are challenging his current conviction as a collateral consequence of the prior, allegedly unconstitutional incarceration: he would not have assaulted J.V. had he not still been in prison. However, the collateral consequences of a prior conviction \"are not themselves sufficient to render an individual 'in custody' for the purposes of a habeas attack upon it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"606062\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/488/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"606062\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/488/#p490\">\n    at 492-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"606062\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/488/#p490\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lackawanna County District Attorney v.

Latimer has defaulted on his chance to directly exhaust his constitutional claims in state court. In his petition, Latimer reiterates ten arguments he submitted to the Minnesota Court of Appeals as part of his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief, each of which alleges-often vaguely-a due process or Eighth Amendment violation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pet., Docket No. 1, Docket No. 3 at 1; Gov't Add. 47-79 (Appellant's Pro Se Suppl.
