By contrast, the peregrine falcon can reach speeds of up to 240 miles per hour when stooping for prey. But even the timberdoodle seems falconesque compared with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It announced its intent to extend the protections of the Animal Welfare Act (\"AWA\" or the \"Act\") to birds in 2004, but fourteen years later it has yet to land on avian-specific standards. It has also declined to apply the Act's existing general regulations to birds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Seeking to compel action, the American Anti-Vivisection Society and the Avian Welfare Coalition (the \"Plaintiffs\") sued the Department of Agriculture its Secretary, Dr. Sonny Perdue (collectively, the \"Department\").

The Department moved to dismiss, arguing that PETA lacked standing and that the Act did not require regulatory action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207724\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/7/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207724\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/7/1/\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Boasberg concluded that PETA had standing to sue, but it had failed to state an APA claim upon which relief can be granted for three reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207724\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/7/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207724\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/7/1/\">\n    at 9-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the court found that individual Department decisions not to apply the general animal welfare standards to birds were committed to agency discretion by law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207724\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/7/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207724\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/7/1/\">\n    at 11-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The D.C.

The circuit court also agreed with the district court that PETA had failed to state a claim, but for slightly different reasons. It found that \"nothing in the AWA requires the [Department] to apply the general animal welfare standards to birds ... before it has promulgated more appropriate bird-specific regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n    at 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also determined that the Department had not failed to take any action that it was required by law to take.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n    at 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the D.C. Circuit concluded that \"PETA failed to plausibly allege that the [Department's] decade-long inaction constitutes agency action unlawfully withheld\" as required to establish an APA \u00a7 706(1) claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n    at 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Here, the Plaintiffs are animal welfare organizations that provide education and training on the humane treatment of animals, support animal sanctuaries, and create reports on the conditions of animals in regulated facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-12. They contend that the Department's failure to promulgate bird-specific regulations is unreasonable, unlawful, and arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Thus, they seek court-ordered deadlines by which the Department must propose and finalize such rules.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As in the PETA litigation, the Department has moved to dismiss the Plaintiffs' claims. It argues that the Plaintiffs lack standing to sue, that it is not required by law to promulgate the regulations sought, and that it has not taken a final action reviewable by the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 16-1 (\"Defs.' Mem.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In short, the Plaintiffs believe that they are like PETA in that they have standing but unlike the organization in that their claims should survive a motion to dismiss. The Department, on the other hand, contends\n   that this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    PETA II\n   </em>\n   on standing grounds, but that the prior holdings foreclose the Plaintiffs' substantive claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Whether the Plaintiffs have standing to sue is a \"threshold jurisdictional question.\"\n   <em>\n    Steel Co. v.
