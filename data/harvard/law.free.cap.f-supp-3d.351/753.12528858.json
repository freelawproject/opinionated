For the following reasons, I find that the claims of the '336 patent are directed to the abstract idea of \"coordinating and monitoring baggage delivery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Claim 7 of the '336 patent is the independent method claim of the patent. The method embodies the basic concept of coordinating and monitoring baggage delivery. Coordinating and monitoring baggage\n   delivery is a well-known method of organizing human activity. The steps of the method can be summarized as follows: (1) receiving baggage information ( '336 patent col 7:29-36), (2) assigning the baggage to a delivery person (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   col. 7:37-43), (3) informing the passenger that the baggage is on its way and who is delivering it (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   col. 7:44-47), (4) receiving a request to delay delivery (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   col. 7:48-60), (5) informing the delivery person of the change (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   col. 7:62-64), and (6) reordering the delivery person's delivery schedule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col. 7:65-67). These are basic steps of coordinating and monitoring delivery, a well-known method of organizing human activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff argues the '336 patent claims are \"directed to a 'new and useful technique' for performing a particular task\" and therefore cannot be directed to an abstract idea. (D.I. 46 at 7). To support this assertion, Plaintiff points to several cases where the court held the patent claims \"improved an existing technological process\" and were therefore non-abstract.\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2354\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the claims in\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    Diamond v.

In\n   <em>\n    Genedics\n   </em>\n   , the court declined to determine whether claims reciting a method of manipulating an image through a three-dimensional user interface were directed to the abstract idea of \"human manipulation of three-dimensional objects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The court there, however, found that the claims \"do seem to make a point to refer to what looks, on its face, to be a\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   way of using sensors to determine a user's touch point and/or sense interaction with 3-D objects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.

App'x 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2016) (per curiam). There, the court found that \"the shipping of goods is a conventional business practice 'long prevalent in our system of commerce.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2354\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2350 ). The patent claims also \"describe[d] user and carrier computers connected to a 'common carrier system,' itself comprised of servers and databases\" with non-specific hardware.\n   <em>\n    GT Nexus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206747142\">\n    2015 WL 6747142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5. Here, the specification recognizes that coordinating and monitoring baggage delivery is a conventional business practice. ( '336 patent col 1:10-30). The specification states that the invention relates to \"improved systems and methods for coordinating and monitoring baggage\n   delivery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col. 1:30-32). The method disclosed in the patent claims, however, merely takes the traditional method of baggage delivery and executes it using generic and non-specific hardware and software. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col. 3:6-19, 3:24-42, 3:50-64, 4:6-16, 5:41-51). Moreover, the use of generic and non-specific hardware to communicate information between different computing devices to coordinate a task, like in\n   <em>\n    GT Nexus\n   </em>\n   , is not sufficient to make the patent claims directed to a non-abstract idea. The patent claims merely replace the phone calls used to track down baggage, arrange for delivery, and have it delivered to the passenger's destination. (D.I. 109 at 18:9-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At oral argument, Plaintiff also asserted that the claims were specific and limited enough to avoid\n   <em>\n    Alice's\n   </em>\n   concern of preemption. Plaintiff specifically pointed to the inclusion of the \"selection to hold delivery\" claim limitation as avoiding preemption and directed to a non-abstract idea as an improvement upon the prior art. Plaintiff and Defendant dispute the construction of the term \"selection to hold delivery\" as used in the claims. (D.I. 66-1 at 2). For the purposes of this motion, I will adopt Plaintiff's proposed construction: \"sending a communication to the deliverer via the server to change the delivery time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Even using this construction, however, this term merely implements the abstract idea of contacting a delivery person to change the delivery time using the generic server. This claim limitation neither narrows the invention to avoid preemption nor makes it directed to a non-abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Therefore, the Court determines that the claims of the '336 patent are directed to the abstract idea of \"coordinating and monitoring baggage delivery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Inventive Concept\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The determination that a patent is directed to an abstract idea \"does not render the subject matter ineligible.\"\n   <em>\n    Internet Patents Corp. v.

Cir. 2015). Having decided that the '336 patent claims are directed to an abstract idea, the Court must next \"determine whether the claims do significantly more than simply describe the abstract method.\"\n   <em>\n    Ultramercial\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p716\">\n    772 F.3d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since \"a known idea, or one that is routine and conventional, is not inventive in patent terms,\" this analysis \"favors inquiries analogous to those undertaken for determination of patentable invention.\"\n   <em>\n    Internet Patents\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274492\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/1343/#p1346\">\n    790 F.3d at 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Federal Circuit has noted that the two stages of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   two-step inquiry \"are plainly related\" and \"involve overlapping scrutiny of the content of the claims ....\"\n   <em>\n    Elec.

Cir. 2015). Furthermore, neither \"[a] simple instruction to apply an abstract idea on a computer,\" nor \"claiming the improved speed or efficiency inherent with applying the abstract idea on a computer\" satisfies the requirement of an \"inventive concept.\"\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.

Cir. 2012) (\"[T]he fact that the required calculations could be performed more efficiently via a computer does not materially alter the patent eligibility of the claimed subject matter.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the '336 contains several inventive concepts which make the claims patent-eligible. (D.I. 46 at 9). Defendant asserts that there is no inventive concept that saves the patent because the claims solely recite the use of conventional and generic computer elements to implement the claims. (D.I. 39 at 17-18). For the following reasons, I find\n   that the '336 patent does not contain an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    First,\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff points to the specification's statement that an advantage of the invention is that delivery of the baggage is guaranteed as an inventive concept. (D.I. 46 at 5, 9). Defendants note that delivery of baggage is not a requirement of the claims. (D.I. 107 at 10). Defendants are correct. The claims at no point require delivery of the baggage to occur, much less that the delivery is guaranteed by the claimed method. ( '336 patent cl. 1, 7, 13). While the specification does discuss this improvement, the focus of the \u00a7 101 inquiry is the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1369\">\n    881 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The improvements in the specification, to the\n   <em>\n    extent they are captured in the claims\n   </em>\n   , create a factual dispute regarding whether the invention described well-understood, routine, and conventional activities.\"). As this alleged inventive concept is not captured in the claims, it cannot make the claims patent-eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Second,\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff argues that the configuration of the computing devices \"in a certain way such that baggage information is communicated 'amongst each other to increase the efficiency of missing baggage delivery, enhance passenger experience, and provide a record of baggage delivery' \" satisfies the inventive concept requirement. (D.I. 46 at 9 (quoting '336 patent col. 6:21-23) ). This is contrary to law. As the Federal Circuit has recognized repeatedly, \"[i]nstructing one to 'apply' an abstract idea and reciting no more than generic computer elements performing generic computer tasks does not make an abstract idea patent-eligible.\"\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055438\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1363/#p1367\">\n    792 F.3d at 1368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed.

Like in\n   <em>\n    GT Nexus\n   </em>\n   , Claim 7 \"recites generic computer components, i.e., 'servers' and [transceivers,] which are configured to perform 'purely conventional' computer functions, i.e., to 'receive,' [ ] and 'transmit' information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206747142\">\n    2015 WL 6747142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Reciting generic computer functions and the use of generic computer elements to achieve a more efficient way of \"coordinating and monitoring baggage delivery\" therefore does not make the claims patent-eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Finally,\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff points to the final three claim limitations requiring receipt of a \"selection to hold delivery,\" communicating that request to the deliverer computing device, and reordering the scheduled deliveries as providing an inventive concept. (D.I. 46 at 6). However, \"[a]dding routine additional steps ... does not transform an otherwise abstract idea into patent-eligible subject matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Ultramercial\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p716\">\n    772 F.3d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff argues that the prosecution history indicates that there is a dispute as to whether the \"selection to hold\" claim limitation was well-known, routine or conventional. (D.I. 46 at 6). The prosecution history distinguished this limitation because the prior art did not \"teach or suggest a\n   <em>\n    passenger interface\n   </em>\n   that allows a selection to provide 'a selection to hold delivery' or a server to \"relay ... a delivery change related to the selection.\" (D.I. 46, Ex. A at 4/16/15 Office Action Response at 13). Even taking this in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as I am required to do, this does not indicate that the \"selection to hold\" claim limitation was unconventional. \"Sending a communication to the deliverer via the server to change the delivery time\" merely recites the well-known method of \"sending a request to hold delivery for a later time\" but on a generic computer device: the server. Nor is there anything in the patent to support an inference that these limitations are more than the well-understood, routine, or conventional idea of requesting an alternate delivery time using generic computer\n   technology. Moreover, as discussed above, these additional claim limitations are themselves abstract, and \"[a] simple instruction to apply an abstract idea on a computer,\" cannot satisfy the requirement of an \"inventive concept.\"\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055438\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1363/#p1367\">\n    792 F.3d at 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, viewed separately or as an ordered combination, the claim elements do not recite an inventive concept, and cannot transform the abstract idea into a patent-eligible application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
