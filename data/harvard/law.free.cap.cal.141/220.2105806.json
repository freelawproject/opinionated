If, as contended, the superior court is without jurisdiction, there is of course a remedy by appeal for any adverse judgment affecting petitioner, and it is not sufficient ground for interfering by prohibition that the trial will be expensive and troublesome.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The establishment of a rule allowing a resort to the writ of prohibition on that ground would involve too serious and too frequent interruption to the business of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">Writ denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
