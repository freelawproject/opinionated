S. 121; <em>Belle </em>v. <em>Meagher, </em>104 U. S. 279; <em>Gwillim </em>v. <em>Donnellan, </em>115 U. S. 45; <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Mantle, </em>127 U.

Lands in which there are known mines are not subject to pre-emption or homestead entry. (U. S. Rev. Stats., secs. 2258, 2289; <em>Deffeback </em>v. <em>Hawke, </em>115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>U. S. 404; <em>Burfenning </em>v. <em>Chicago Ry. Co., </em>163 U. S. 321-323.) The government having no title to the land included within the Gem Mine at the time of the issuance of the agricultural patent, including that mine, the patent was void to that extent, and may be collaterally attacked. <em>(Durfee </em>v. <em>Plaisted, </em>38 Cal. 80; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>True, </em>48 Cal. 601; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Rolley, </em>96 Cal. 408;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Klauber </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>117 Cal. 451-464; <em>Cucamonga Fruit and Land Co. v.

The patent was a conclusive adjudication as to the character of the land patented, which is not open to contestation in any collateral proceeding. <em>(Doll </em>v. <em>Meader, </em>16 Cal. 297; <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Best, </em>78 Cal. 235;<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Irvine </em>v. <em>Tarbat, </em>105 Cal. 237; <em>Dreyfus </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>108 Cal. 58; 1 Lindley on Mines, sec. 208, p. 253; <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>La Purissima Gold Min.

Judgment was for defendants, and plaintiffs appeal from the judgment and from an order denying their motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The contest is only about that part of the alleged Gem ' Mine which lies in the west half of the southwest quarter of section 3, township 2 north, range 14 east, M. D. M. On November 2, 1881, respondents\u2019 predecessor in interest, John McNamee, made homestead entry as agricultural land at the United States land office at Stockton, California, of land which includes the west half of the southwest quarter above mentioned. On February 5, 1889, he commuted the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>homestead entry to cash entry No. 9753, and paid the United States government therefor; and on November 24, 1890, the government issued to him a patent for said land. After the said homestead entry, and after the land had been returned by the United States surveyor-general as agricultural land, J. N. Paterson, appellants\u2019 predecessor in interest, located what is called the Gem Mine. At the time when McNamee made his final proofs no protest or adverse claim was made by Paterson, or any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">It is well settled that issuance of a United States patent for land as agricultural in character is a judgment by a tribunal having jurisdiction that such is the character of the land, which cannot afterwards be collaterally attacked. <em>(Gale </em>v. <em>Best, </em>78 Cal. 235,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>La Purissima Gold Mining Co., </em>125 Cal. 159, and the authorities cited in those two cases; also, <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Wolfling, </em>98 Cal. 195, and <em>Wight </em>v. <em>Dubois, </em>21 Fed. 695.) The patent, therefore, conveyed the land to McNamee, and was an adverse adjudication of any asserted right of appellants\u2019 grantor to the land as a mining claim. In the case at bar the patent to McNamee contained the following clause: \u201cSubject to the right of a proprietor of a vein or lode to abstract and remove his ore therefrom, should the same be found to penetrate or intersect the premises hereby granted as provided by law.\u201d We have not been referred to any law authorizing the insertion of this clause; and it was held in <em>Cowell </em>v. <em>Lammers </em>(10 Saw. 246), 21 Fed. 200, that a reservation of mineral land in an agricultural patent is void. But waiving that question, the court below in the case at bar correctly construed the clause as only subjecting the patented land \u201cto the right of the proprietor of a vein or lode, the top or apex of which lies outside of the west half of the southwest quarter of section 3 aforesaid, but which penetrates into the land on its dip or downward course, to abstract and remove his ore thereform as provided by law.\u201d It does not give any right to enter and mine upon the surface within the patented lands. These views make it unnecessary to consider the express finding that at the time of the patent no part of the lands was \u201cknown valuable mineral land, but on the contrary all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>lands embraced within the west half of the southwest quarter of said section 3 were at that time, and now are, agricultural lands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In answer to the claim by appellants of title under the statute of limitations by adverse possession since the date of the patent, the court finds expressly that there was no such adverse possession; and the evidence is clearly sufficient to support that finding, irrespective of the further finding that appellants had not paid any of the taxes levied on any part of said land. The above views dispose of the controlling questions in the case adversely to appellants\u2019 contention; and there are no other points necessary to be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Lorigan, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\"> 12 <em>Am. </em>St. Rep. <em>44.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
