R. Apr. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. R. 34(3). The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b38-20\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the District Court\u2019s order be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-21\">Plaintiff David Mann, a black male, was a police lieutenant employed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). One evening he responded to a report that a disorderly man was throwing rocks at a WMATA police booth. He soon learned that the wrongdoer, John Dowtin, had also started a fight with a WMATA bus driver. On Mann\u2019s arrival, Dowtin was on the ground, surrounded by WMATA employees. Dowtin cursed, threw his shoes ip the street and otherwise behaved erratically. Mann would later say he thought Dowtin was \u201con something\u201d like \u201cPCP.\u201d Supplemental Appendix (SA) 201. Mann decided to arrest and handcuff Dow-tin and thus ordered him to \u201cgive me your hands.\u201d SA 70-71, 203. Dowtin \u201cpassive[ly] resisted],\u201d tucking his hands between his body and the ground. SA 203. Mann punched Dowtin in the upper body about 20 times; twisted his arm; bent his hand back until he heard bones cracking; pepper sprayed him; and repeatedly lifted him off the ground and \u201cslam[med] him face first into the ground.\u201d SA 51. A bystander caught some of the incident on video with a mobile phone. In the footage, Dowtin can be heard screaming in pain. He was hospitalized with a broken back, three facial fractures and six broken ribs.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>After an investigation, and acting on the unanimous recommendation of six deputy chiefs, WMATA police chief Michael Ta-bora\u2014who, like Mann, is a black male\u2014 fired Mann for using excessive force. Mann sued WMATA under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>alleging that his termination was the result of race discrimination. In a thorough opinion and order, the district court granted summary judgment to WMATA. <em>Mann v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), </em>168 F.Supp.3d 71 (D.D.C. 2016). Mann challenges four aspects of the court\u2019s decision. We reject each of his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><em>First, </em>Mann argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard. He is mistaken. Under the governing cases, the \u201cone central question\u201d is whether Mann \u201cproduced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that [WMATA\u2019s] asserted non-discriminatory reason\u201d\u2014 Mann\u2019s excessive force\u2014\u201cwas not the actual reason\u201d for the firing and that race discrimination was. <em>Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, </em>520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 507-08, 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993); <em>Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 714-16, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983)). That is the inquiry the district court undertook. 168 F.Supp.3d at 81. Mann faults the court for failing to consider whether Tabora \u201creasonably\u201d concluded that Mann used excessive force. Appellant\u2019s Br. 20-21. The court in fact considered \u201cthe reasonableness of [Taborn\u2019s] conclusion,\u201d including his reliance on the unanimous opinion of his deputies. 168 F.Supp.3d at 81 (capitalization altered); <em>see id. </em>at 81-82. And whatever the reasonableness of Taborn\u2019s belief, Mann has not even begun to show that Taborn\u2019s finding of excessive force was a <em>pretext </em>meant to mask racial animus. <em>See Brady, </em>520 F.3d at 495-96 &amp; n.4 (plaintiff must demonstrate \u201cthat the employer\u2019s stated reason was not the actual reason\u201d and \u201cthat the actual reason was a racially discriminatory reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\"><em>Second, </em>Mann contends that Taborn\u2019s conclusion was indeed unreasonable. As noted, that is largely beside the point absent evidence of pretext. In any event, the contention fails on its own terms. Based on the bystander\u2019s video\u2014itself a strong basis for Taborn\u2019s decision\u2014a trainer at WMA-TA\u2019s police academy opined that Mann\u2019s conduct was \u201cnot in compliance with the defensive tactics taught\u201d to WMATA police and was not justified by Dowtin\u2019s minimal resistance. SA 77. Also, to repeat, Taborn\u2019s deputies all agreed that Mann used excessive force. Mann says that WMATA\u2019s investigation and resulting report were insufficient and misleading\u2014so much so that Tabora mistakenly thought Dowtin was unconscious when Mann first encountered him. But the record belies any notion that WMATA\u2019s investigation was \u201cso unsystematic and incomplete that a factfinder could conclude that [WMATA] sought, not to discover the truth, but to cover up its own discrimination.\u201d <em>Burley v. Nat\u2019l Passenger Rail Corp., </em>801 F.3d 290, 296 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Also, Mann misconstrues Taborn\u2019s mistake. Tabora incorrectly recalled, two and a half years after he fired Mann, that Dowtin was unconscious. No evidence suggests he harbored such a misunderstanding at the time of the firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\"><em>Third, </em>Mann contests the district court\u2019s analysis of alleged \u201ccomparator\u201d WMATA officers who, in his telling, were punished less severely for equivalent violations because those officers are not black. Only one of the alleged comparators, Y.C., engaged in conduct remotely similar to Mann\u2019s: he twice kicked an arrestee in the head and was suspended for three days. But Y.C.\u2019s case is not \u201cnearly identical\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Mann\u2019s in \u201call of the relevant aspects.\u201d <em>Neuren v. Adduci, Mastriani, Meeks &amp; Schill, </em>43 F.3d 1507, 1514 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (internal quotation omitted). Unlike Dow-tin, who offered only passive resistance, the victim in Y.C.\u2019s case pushed Y.C., fled and wrestled with officers before Y.C. kicked him. Additionally, the victim suffered only a small abrasion to his face, a far cry from the injuries Dowtin suffered when Mann repeatedly punched him and \u201cslam[med] him face first into the ground.\u201d SA 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><em>Fourth, </em>Mann claims the district court improperly denied his motion to designate an expert. We review this claim for an abuse of discretion, <em>Burke v. Air Serv Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>685 F.3d 1102, 1109 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 2012), and discern none. Mann attempted to designate the expert after the discovery deadline, which was reason enough to deny his motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(D) (\u201cA party must make [expert] disclosures at the times and in the sequence that the court orders.\u201d). Also, the court had latitude to\u2014and did\u2014exclude the expert on the ground that his testimony was insufficiently probative of race discrimination and would sow confusion. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid, 401, 403. The expert proposed to testify that WMATA should have had, but lacked, a policy of \u201cdeferring] administrative action pending the outcome of a criminal investigation.\u201d Mann App. 41-42. Mann connects that excluded opinion to the fact that, after he was fired, a Maryland judge acquitted him of assault. But this is a discrimination case, not a grievance proceeding, and the expert opinion and acquittal have only a remote, if any, bearing on whether Taborn fired Mann because he is black.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
