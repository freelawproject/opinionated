Holmes, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">Nathan Don Jack, a pro se federal prisoner, seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his postconviction filing as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>unauthorized second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion (Appeal No. 16-2256). He also appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of filing restrictions (Appeal No. 16-2275). We deny a COA and affirm the restrictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In 2011, Jack was convicted of second-degree murder for killing Jessica Shorty while on release from custody in another case. Two sentencing consequences arose from committing this offense while on release. First, the guidelines directed a three-level enhancement of the offense level. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3C1.3 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2010). Second, the release statute required \u201ca term of imprisonment of not more than ten years if the offense is a felony,\u201d which is \u201cin addition to the sentence prescribed for the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147(1); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.3 cmt. n.l (\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147, a sentence of imprisonment must be imposed in addition to the sentence for the underlying offense, and the sentence of imprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147 must run consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Accordingly, Jack\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSR) identified the adjusted offense level as 41, reflecting the addition of the 3-level release enhancement, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.3, to the base offense level of 38, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2A1.2(a). Because Jack had a category II criminal history, the resulting guidelines sentence was 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court sentenced Jack to life. In doing so, the court declined to impose the consecutive term indicated by \u00a7 3147(1), reasoning that it \u201cwould constitute an upward variance\u201d from the guidelines range. R. at 632.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">On direct appeal, Jack did not raise a sentencing issue. Instead, he focused on the omission of a jury instruction requiring the government \u201cto prove the absence of heat of passion.\u201d <em>United States v. Jack, </em>483 Fed.Appx. 427, 427 (10th Cir. 2012). This court affirmed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">Later, in a \u00a7 2255 motion, Jack complained that he received ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel because his sentence lacked a \u00a7 3147 consecutive component. He vaguely argued that his sentence was invalid and that on remand \u201c[t]he only consideration would be to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147\u2019s statutory maximum of 10 years.\u201d R. at 74. The district court rejected Jack\u2019s argument, pointing out that counsel\u2019s alleged error would not somehow invalidate his life sentence, and that the omission of an additional term of imprisonment could not be prejudicial. Thus, the district court denied Jack\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">When Jack moved for reconsideration, the district court construed it as a request for second or successive habeas relief because the motion sought to revisit the merits of Jack\u2019s habeas claims. Because Jack had not obtained prior authorization from this court to file such a motion, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h), the district court proceeded to consider whether it was appropriate to transfer the motion to this court. <em>See In re Cline, </em>531 F.3d 1249, 1252 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u2018When a second or successive \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2255 claim is filed in the district court without the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>quired authorization from this court, the district court may transfer the matter to this court if it determines it is in the interest of justice to do so under [28 U.S.C] \u00a7 1631, or it may dismiss the motion or petition for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d). The district court found that a transfer would not serve the interests of justice because Jack clearly needed circuit-court authorization to file the motion, and the motion did not assert newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). The district court dismissed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Jack appealed from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion and the dismissal of his reconsideration motion. This court dismissed the entire appeal because Jack failed to (1) timely appeal the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief; and (2) show that reasonable jurists could debate whether the reconsideration motion qualified as a second or successive habeas motion. <em>See United States v. Jack, </em>630 Fed.Appx. 858, 861 (10th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Jack then returned to the district court, seeking the correction of a clerical error concerning the date of a postmark he thought was responsible for his appeal being late. The district court denied relief. This court affirmed, stating that \u201cthe record did not need to be corrected because our prior opinion did not turn on the date of the postmark.\u201d <em>United States v. Jack, </em>667 Fed.Appx. 689, 689 (10th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Finally, in October 2016, Jack filed in the district court a \u201cPetition For Relief From Judgment Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4), (6), Or (3),\u201d complaining that his sentence lacked a \u00a7 3147 consecutive term, which \u201cresulted in [a] Fifth Amendment violation.\u201d R. at 581, 596. He asserted that his sentence is void because \u00a7 3147\u2019s language is mandatory. The district court construed the filing as another unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, declined to transfer it to this court because Jack was \u201ccontinu[ing] to reargue meritless grounds,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 647-48, and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Additionally, given Jack\u2019s \u201cdocumented history of filing second and successive \u00a7 2255 motions without the mandatory authorization,\u201d the district court ordered Jack to show cause \u201cwhy he should not be prohibited from making new filings challenging his criminal conviction ... without the representation of a licensed attorney .., unless he obtains the permission of the court to proceed <em>pro se.\u201d </em>R. at 649, 650-51. In response, Jack again argued that his life sentence was void. The district court imposed the threatened restrictions, stating that Jack had \u201cpersist[ed] in filing unauthorized motions and attempting to circumvent the Court\u2019s directions that he comply with the applicable statutes and rules.\u201d R. at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">I. COA (Appeal No. 16-2256)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review of the district court\u2019s decision dismissing Jack\u2019s October 2016 petition as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Because the district court dismissed Jack\u2019s petition on procedural grounds, we will grant a COA only if he \u201cshows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Because Jack is proceeding pro se, we liberally construe his filings. <em>See Hall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>v. Scott, </em>292 F.3d 1264, 1266 (10th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The district court determined that Jack\u2019s petition needed circuit-court authorization because Jack presented a merits-based second or successive claim. Jack argues that we should issue a COA as to that determination because the district court\u2019s \u201cdisregard[ ]\u201d of a \u00a7 3147 mandatory consecutive sentence \u201chas violated [his] Fifth Amendment rights of due process\u201d and \u201cmarred the integrity [of] the court.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Jack appears to be arguing that his petition was a \u201ctrue 60(b) motion,\u201d rather than a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Spitznas v. Boone, </em>464 F.3d 1213, 1215-16 (10th Cir. 2006) (indicating that a true 60(b) motion challenges either \u201ca procedural ruling of the habeas court which precluded a merits determination\u201d or \u201ca defect in the integrity of the federal habe-as proceeding\u201d). We are not persuaded. No reasonable jurist could debate that Jack\u2019s petition did anything other than \u201cassert a basis for relief from [his] underlying [sentence],\u201d <em>In re Pickard, </em>681 F.3d 1201, 1205 (10th Cir. 2012), or \u201cattack the federal court\u2019s previous resolution of [his sentencing] claim on the merits,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1206 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the petition raised no \u201cprocedural error in the disposition of his original habeas motion\u201d that needed to be addressed in further proceedings under Rule 60(b). <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>465 F.3d 1145, 1148-49 (10th Cir. 2006). And although a challenge to a defect in the integrity of a federal habeas proceeding does not require prior circuit-court authorization, <em>see Spitznas, </em>464 F.3d at 1215-16, Jack\u2019s claim of sentencing error is \u201cinextricably [tied] to a merits-based attack on the disposition of his prior habeas petition,\u201d <em>In re Lindsey, </em>582 F.3d 1173, 1175-76 (10th Cir. 2009) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the claim required authorization. <em>See In re Lindsey, </em>582 F.3d at 1176. Further, the district court acted within its discretion by dismissing the petition, rather than transferring it to this court. <em>See In re Cline, </em>531 F.3d at 1251 (indicating that a transfer may not be in the interest of justice if, among other things, the claim lacks merit or was brought in bad faith).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Accordingly, we deny a COA and dismiss Appeal No. 16-2256.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">II. Filing Restrictions (Appeal No. 16-2275)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Jack contends that filing restrictions are inappropriate because his sentencing argument is meritorious. We review the district court\u2019s imposition of filing restrictions for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Tripati v. Beaman, </em>878 F.2d 351, 354 (10th Cir. 1989) (per curiam). \u201cFederal courts have the inherent power to regulate the activities of abusive litigants by imposing carefully tailored restrictions under appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Ysais v. Richardson, </em>603 F.3d 1175, 1180 (10th Cir. 2010). Filing restrictions \u201care appropriate where the litigant\u2019s lengthy and abusive history is set forth; the court provides guidelines as to what the litigant may do to obtain its permission to file an action; and the litigant receives notice and an opportunity to oppose the court\u2019s order before it is implemented.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Heaton, </em>483 F.3d 1070, 1077 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>After carefully reviewing Jack\u2019s filing history, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Jack has repeatedly circumvented the rules for filing second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions. And he has done so to advance an incoherent argument premised on some vague, mutational theory<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that he could not be sentenced to life for murdering Shorty unless he was also given a consecutive \u00a7 3147 sentence for murdering her while on release. The district court has explained several times that Jack\u2019s argument may not be raised in the district court without prior circuit-court authorization. Further, in response to the district court\u2019s order to show cause, Jack used the opportunity not to explain his failure to seek authorization, but to again address his sentencing theory. Finally, the district court has given Jack clear instructions on how to proceed with any new filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s filing restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We deny Jack\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss Appeal No. 16-2256. We affirm the filing restrictions in Appeal No. 16-2275. We grant Jack\u2019s motion to file supplemental authorities. Finally, because Jack has not advanced a \u201creasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal,\u201d <em>see Watkins v. Leyba, </em>543 F.3d 624, 627 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted), we deny his requests to proceed in forma pauperis and we remind Jack of his obligation to pay the filing fees in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">.
