R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. R. 34(j). The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review be GRANTED and that the matter be remanded to the Public Health Department of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">Petitioner Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company is in the midst of constructing a natural gas pipeline that will run from the Gulf of Mexico to the Northeast United States. Part of the project requires Tennessee Gas to build a compressor station in Joelton, Tennessee, a small community on the outskirts of Nashville. In January 2015, the Company filed an application with the Metropolitan Government of Nashville\u2019s Public Health Department seeking various Clean Air Act permits that Tennessee Gas must obtain to build the compressor station. The Act delegates to state and local governments the responsibility to ensure compliance with certain pollution-control requirements, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7661a, and requires them to \u201capprove or disapprove a completed application ..., and ... issue or deny the permit, within 18 months after the date of receipt thereof,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7661b(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">After some two years passed\u2014and having received no final decision on its application\u2014Tennessee Gas filed a petition for review under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717, <em>et seq., </em>which gives this court \u201coriginal and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the review of an alleged failure to act by a ... State administrative agency acting pursuant to Federal law to issue, condition, or deny any permit required under Federal law,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 717r(d)(2). If a local permitting authority fails to comply with a \u201cschedule ... established by Federal law,\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.22, and if such failure inhibits development of interstate natural-gas facilities, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(2), the statute directs this court to \u201cremand the proceeding to the [local permitting authority] to take appropriate action\u201d and to \u201cset a reasonable schedule and deadline for the agency to act on remand,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 717r(d)(3); <em>see Dominion Transmission, Inc. v. Summers, </em>723 F.3d 238, 245 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\u201cBecause the Department\u2019s failure to act to grant, condition, or deny Dominion\u2019s air quality permit was inconsistent with federal law, we grant Dominion\u2019s petition and remand for further action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">Tennessee Gas insists that the relevant deadline for Nashville\u2019s Public Health Department to act is not the 18-month deadline contained in the Clean Air Act but rather a shorter deadline set by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulation, which requires permitting authorities to take action on a permit application \u201cno later than 90 days after [FERC] issues its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>final environmental [review] document.\u201d 18 C.P.R. \u00a7 157.22. But the regulation also provides that this 90-day deadline is displaced where \u201ca schedule is otherwise established by Federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the Clean Air Act\u2019s 18-month deadline is just such a schedule, meaning that it governs in place of the 90-day clock set by FERC\u2019s regulation. <em>See Millennium Pipeline Co. v. Seggos, </em>860 F.3d 696, 702 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (concluding that the Clean Water Act\u2019s one-year deadline is a schedule \u201cotherwise established by Federal law\u201d under 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.22).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Even under the more generous time-frame provided in the Clean Air Act, however, Nashville\u2019s Public Health Department failed to timely act on Tennessee Gas\u2019s permit application. The Company submitted its application in late January 2015, and the Department had until early August 2016 to \u201capprove or disapprove\u201d the application by \u201cissuing] or denying] the permit.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7661b(c). That deadline has come and gone, and Tennessee Gas remains unable to break ground on its compressor station.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The Department argues that the Clean Air Act\u2019s 18-month countdown did not start in January 2015 because Tennessee Gas failed to include in its application an analysis of Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). That omission, the Department contends, tolled the starting of the 18-month clock, which begins to run only upon the filing of a <em>\u201ccompleted </em>application,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added), and the absence of a RACT analysis rendered Tennessee Gas\u2019s application incomplete. This argument fails for two independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">First, Nashville\u2019s pollution-control regulations enumerate the necessary elements of a complete application, and a RACT analysis is not one of them. <em>See </em>Nashville Metro Health Department, Pollution Control Division (PCD) Regulation No. 13-3(b)(1), (e). Although the regulations require some permit applicants to submit a \u201cRACT proposal,\u201d nothing in them specify when such proposal is due or demand its inclusion in an initial application. <em>See </em>PCD Regulation No. 14-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Second, Nashville\u2019s regulations require the Department to deem an application complete if the Director of Public Health fails to timely notify an applicant of any deficiencies in its initial application\u2014something the Department concedes it never did. <em>See </em>PCD Regulation No. 13-3(b)(2) (\u201cThe Director must make a determination within sixty (60) days of receipt of application that an application is complete. Upon failure of the Director to make this determination the said application shall be deemed complete.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>No. 13-5(a)(4) (same). Nashville argues that Tennessee Gas \u201cwaived any reliance upon that provision\u201d because \u201c[i]t did not\u2014and does not\u2014seek to have the Department approve its [January 2015] Application as filed\u201d\u2014 that is, without a RACT proposal. Respondent\u2019s Br. 19-20. But Nashville\u2019s regulations do not require a \u201cdeemed complete\u201d application to be perfect; to the contrary, they provide that \u201c[i]f while processing an application that has been deemed to be complete, it is determined that additional information is necessary to evaluate or take final action, the Director may request such information in writing and set a reasonable deadline for a response.\u201d PCD Regulation No. 13-3(b)(2); <em>see also id. </em>No. 13-3(d)(3) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Because the Department failed to timely act on Tennessee Gas\u2019s permit application, we grant Tennessee Gas\u2019s petition and remand for further action. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">FURTHER ORDERED, on the court\u2019s own motion, that the parties submit within 10 days of the date of this judgment a proposed schedule for action on remand. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The parties are strongly urged to submit a joint proposal. The parties\u2019 submissions may not exceed 10 pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
