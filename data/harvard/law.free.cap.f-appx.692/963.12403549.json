Matheson, Jr., Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b995-18\">Michael Samuel Monroe, II, a federal prisoner appearing pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (requiring a COA to appeal an order denying a \u00a7 2255 motion). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-20\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b995-21\">Mr. Monroe pled guilty to knowingly and intentionally distributing and possessing with the intent to distribute 280 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base, a Schedule II controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii). In his plea agreement, he agreed to the 280 grams, Supp. ROA at 7, \u00b6 23, and he pled guilty to that amount, ROA, Vol. 4 at 31. He also waived his right to appeal. Supp. ROA at 2-3, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. The district court sentenced him to the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months in prison. ROA, Vol. 3 at 36. Mr. Monroe did not bring a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-22\">Mr. Monroe filed a motion under \u00a7 2255 to challenge his sentence. He alleged two ineffective assistance of counsel claims. First, he claimed counsel was ineffective because he failed to argue at sentencing for a drug quantity of 154 grams of cocaine base and failed to object to the 280 grams. The district court rejected this claim because Mr. Monroe had stipulated and pled guilty to the 280 grams in his plea agreement and at his plea hearing. Second, he claimed counsel was ineffective because he did not file a notice of appeal. The district court denied this claim because Mr. Monroe\u2019s plea agreement contained an appeal waiver, and he could not show counsel\u2019s failure to appeal caused prejudice. He now requests a COA from this court so that he may appeal those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-23\">Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b995-24\">Mr. Monroe may not appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2263(c)(1)(B). To obtain a COA, he must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2), which includes showing \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an applicant must show (1) constitutionally deficient performance that (2) resulted in prejudice by demonstrating \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). If the applicant is unable to show either \u201cdeficient performance\u201d or \u201csufficient prejudice,\u201d the ineffective assistance claim \u201cnecessarily fails.\u201d <em>Hooks v. Workman, </em>606 F.3d 715, 724 (10th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">We agree with the district court that defense counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient for failure to object to the district court\u2019s sentencing Mr. Monroe based on 280 grams of cocaine base or for failure to argue for a sentence based on 154 grams. Counsel should not have been expected to do so when his client had accepted and pled guilty to the 280-gram amount in the plea agreement and at his change of plea hearing. In his brief requesting a COA, Mr. Monroe does not challenge his plea agreement or change of plea, nor does he show how reasonable jurists could disagree with the district court\u2019s decision on this issue. We therefore deny a COA on Mr. Monroe\u2019s first ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"ah--dedup-0\">We also agree with the district court that Mr. Monroe\u2019s second ineffective assistance claim must fail. Mr. Monroe waived his right to appeal in his plea agreement. He does not challenge this appellate waiver in his \u00a7 2255 motion or in his brief requesting a COA. Nor does he show how reasonable jurists could disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that he cannot show prejudice under <em>Strickland. </em>We accordingly deny a COA on this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">We deny Mr. Monroe\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b995-19\">This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-25\">. Because Mr. Monroe appears pro se, we construe his filings liberally, <em>see Garza v. Davis, </em>596 F.3d 1198, 1201 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010), but we do not craft arguments or otherwise advocate for him, <em>see Yang v. Archuleta, </em>525 F.3d 925, 927 n.1 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
