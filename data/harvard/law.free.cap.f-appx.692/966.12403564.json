After a number of unsuccessful collateral challenges to his conviction and sentence, he filed the instant motion asking to be sentenced based on a criminal history category of IV and an offense level of 31 (with a further reduction of 3 points for acceptance of responsibility), which he claimed had been the judge\u2019s direction at the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court determined that the motion was in substance a second or successive motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and dismissed it for lack of the circuit authorization required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Because the correctness of that disposition is not debatable by reasonable jurists, we deny a COA and dismiss this appeal. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (stating standard for COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">In his combined opening brief and request for a COA, Mr. Coleman just reasserts the substantive claim advanced in his motion, without addressing the dispositive jurisdictional deficiency explained by the district court. The motion, which sought to remedy an alleged error in his sentence, fell squarely under \u00a7 2255 (providing remedy for claim that \u201csentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States ... or is otherwise subject to collateral attack\u201d). <em>See also Caravalho v. Pugh, 177 </em>F.3d 1177, 1178 (10th Cir. 1999) (unless inadequate or ineffective, a motion for relief under \u00a7 2255 is \u201c[t]he exclusive remedy for testing the validity of a judgment and sentence\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). And, as the district court explained, before a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion may be pursued, the defendant must obtain authorization from the circuit court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255(h) and 2244(b)(3). <em>See In re Cline, </em>531 F.3d 1249, 1250 (10th Cir. 2008). Mr. Coleman\u2019s failure to do this left the district court with only two options, neither of which entailed granting him any relief on the merits: either dismiss the motion for lack of jurisdiction or transfer it to this court to allow Mr. Coleman to seek authorization. <em>See id. </em>at 1252. The district court followed clear circuit precedent in choosing the first option.</p>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>A district court properly exercises its discretion in dismissing rather than transferring an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion \u201c[w]here there is no risk that a meritorious successive claim will be lost,\u201d as when the motion \u201cfails on its face to satisfy any of the authorization standards of \u00a7 2255(h),\u201d <em>In re Cline, </em>531 F.3d at 1252. That is the case here. Mr. Coleman\u2019s sentencing challenge, in contrast to a challenge to a conviction, cannot satisfy the requirement in \u00a7 2255(h)(1) that a prisoner present new evidence to show \u201cthat no reasonable factfinder would have found him <em>guilty </em>of the [underlying] <em>offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added); <em>see also In re Webster, </em>605 F.3d 256, 257 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting plain language of \u00a7 2255(h)(1) compels conclusion that it cannot be satisfied by defendant challenging sentence rather than conviction). Nor does his claim rely on a \u201cnew rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court,\u201d as required to satisfy \u00a7 2255(h)(2). Thus, it would have been patently futile to transfer Mr. Coleman\u2019s claim for consideration of authorization under \u00a7 2255(h)\u2014as the district court made clear in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">We deny a COA and dismiss this appeal. Mr, Coleman\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is denied because he has not advanced a reasoned argument on the law or facts in support of the appeal. <em>DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir. 1991). He is reminded that he remains responsible for paying the full filing fee for this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), (b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-9\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-10\">. Actually, the court's statement of reasons for sentence reflects application of the career-offender guideline (consistent with the pre-sentence report the court expressly adopted) based on prior drug offenses, resulting in use of criminal history category VI and an offense level of 34 (reduced to 31 for acceptance of responsibility). <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guideline Manual \u00a7 4B 1.1 (b)(2). The court\u2019s reference to category IV in the sentencing excerpt cited by Mr. Coleman is not to the contrary; it was simply observing that, with a 24-month downward variance it was giving Mr. Coleman (for other reasons), the result was consistent with a criminal history category IV sentence, though the court expressly disavowed departing downward with respect to criminal history.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
