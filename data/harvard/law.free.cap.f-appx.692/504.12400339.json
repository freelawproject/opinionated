We deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-28\">In 2009, Mr. Arrendondo-Valenzuela pleaded guilty via plea agreement to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(viii), and 846. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>was sentenced to 360 months in prison. On direct appeal, we dismissed the appeal on the government\u2019s motion to enforce a waiver of appeal in Mr. Arrendondo-Valenzuela\u2019s plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Arrendondo-Valenzuela, </em>380 Fed.Appx. 755, 756 (10th Cir. 2010) (unpublished) (per curiam). His first \u00a7 2255 motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Mr. Arrendondo-Valenzuela filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion in 2016, arguing that his sentence under \u00a7 841 was now illegal under <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). The court concluded it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the motion as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion that should first be filed in this court. The district court declined to transfer the motion to this court, noting that the Armed Career Criminal Act at issue in <em>Johnson </em>did not apply to Mr. Arrendondo-Valenzuela\u2019s sentence because no prior crime of violence was considered in calculating his base offense level. Mr, Arren-dondo-Valenzuela filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">To appeal, Mr. Arrendondo-Valenzuela must obtain a COA. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>545 F.3d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir. 2008). Where, as here, a district court has dismissed a filing on procedural grounds, for a COA the movant must show both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We need not consider the merits aspect of the <em>Slack </em>test because Mr. Arrendondo-Valenzuela has not satisfied the procedural aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Even reviewing his application with the liberality due pro se applicants, <em>see Garza v. Davis, </em>596 F.3d 1198, 1201 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010), there is nothing debatable about the district court\u2019s procedural ruling. A second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed in \u201cthe appropriate court of appeals,\u201d which would then consider whether the movant has identified \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d or \u201ca new rule of constitutional law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); see <em>also In re Cline, </em>531 F.3d 1249, 1251 (10th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (\u201cA district court does not have jurisdiction to address the merits of a second or successive \u00a7 2255 ... claim until this court has granted the required authorization.\u201d). In his COA brief, Mr. Ar-rendondo-Valenzuela makes no effort to show why the district court was incorrect in its ruling on his second or successive motion; he merely argues ineffective assistance of counsel and sentencing error, not even mentioning <em>Johnson, </em>the basis of the underlying \u00a7 2255 motion. We therefore discern no error in the district court\u2019s determination. The COA is denied and the matter is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b536-17\">This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R, 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
