Georgaklis on May 10, 2006, alleging negligent supervision of a plumbing subcontractor. Georgaklis denied liability and filed a third-party complaint against two alleged joint venturers, Diane Churchill and Richard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Nieboer; and two subcontractors, an electrician, George Harrison,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a plumber, Charles Rocher. In February, 2008, Georgaklis moved for summary judgment, arguing that he was a member of a joint venture with Churchill, and thus MPIUA, as Churchill\u2019s subrogee, was precluded from recovering against him. After hearing, the judge allowed the motion, and MPIUA appeals. For the reasons stated below, we vacate the grant of summary judgment for Georgaklis, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><em>Background. </em>We recite the background facts in the light most favorable to MPIUA, the nonmoving party. In March, 2003, Churchill purchased property located at 6 Beaver Street in Nantucket (property). She was the sole named grantee in the deed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Churchill obtained homeowners\u2019 insurance on the property from MPIUA, effective March 14, 2003, and she was the sole named insured under that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In May, 2003, a building permit issued for renovations to the property. Churchill\u2019s name is the only name listed on the first page of the application for the building permit, under the section entitled \u201cOWNERS NAME.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The application for the building permit listed Georgaklis as the \u201cContractor,\u201d and he engaged the various subcontractors for the renovation work. Among those subcontractors were Harrison<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Rocher.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">On or about May 12, 2003, the property was damaged by fire. In the fire investigation report issued by the Nantucket fire department, Churchill is the only individual listed under the section entitled \u201cOwner.\u201d Additionally, she is the only signatory to the sworn statement submitted to MPIUA on the claim, and MPIUA paid $489,525.23 directly to Churchill on that claim. Subsequently, MPIUA, as subrogee to Churchill, commenced this action against Georgaklis, alleging that in his capacity as general contractor, he negligently supervised Rocher, the plumbing subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In discovery, MPIUA requested a copy of the joint venture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>agreement which Georgaklis referred to in his answer and in his third-party complaint. The agreement was executed on January 28, 2005, between Georgaklis, Nieboer, and Churchill (collectively, the three). That date was approximately twenty-two months after Churchill\u2019s purchase of the property and twenty months after the fire. The agreement does not refer to any joint venture already in existence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but instead contemplates a future transfer of property from Churchill to Georgaklis and Nieboer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>Under familiar principles, we review a grant of summary judgment to determine \u201cwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). The moving party \u201chas the burden of initially showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the case of the nonmoving party shouldering the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 714 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">If the three were joint venturers at the time of the fire, then they are subject to the same principles of liability as partners. See <em>Doiron </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>401 Mass. 705, 707 n.2 (1988). As between partners, there is no liability for \u201chonest mistakes.\u201d <em>Hurter </em>v. <em>Larrabee, </em>224 Mass. 218, 220 (1916). See <em>Shain Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 4, 12 n.3 (1982).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> MPIUA accepts these principles but argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because there is a genuine dispute of material fact whether a joint venture existed at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>1. <em>Treatment of Georgaklis\u2019s deposition testimony. </em>While MPIUA had the burden to demonstrate Georgaklis\u2019s negligence, Georgaklis had the burden to demonstrate his immunity from liability based on his joint venture claim. See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Sullivan </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>431 Mass. 201, 205 (2000) (defendant bears burden to demonstrate affirmative defenses in negligence actions). \u201cWhen a party has the burden of proof, it can rarely be ruled as matter of law that the burden has been sustained, especially when the burden-carrying party has relied upon oral testimony or inferences from circumstances.\u201d <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>W.E. Aubuchon Co., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 630 (2004).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In attempting to carry his burden, Georgaklis has relied solely on his own self-serving deposition testimony and his particular view of the documentary evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We must recognize the possibility that a fact finder would be free to disregard such testimony in deciding whether a party has met his burden, and thus that testimony typically cannot furnish the decisive evidence required to demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 630-631. See <em>Lysak </em>v. <em>Seiler Corp., </em>415 Mass. 625, 627 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">2. <em>Application of joint venture principles. </em>\u201cThe key requirement in finding [the] existence [of a joint venture] is an intent to associate.\u201d <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 615, 623 (1990). \u201c[F]actors indicating such an intent include an agreement among the participants for joint profits and a sharing of losses; a contribution of money, assets, talents, etc., to a common undertaking; a joint property interest in the subject matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the venture; and a right to participate in the control of the venture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623-624. See <em>Shain Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, supra </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">We first note that while joint venture agreements need not be in writing, see <em>Gurry, supra </em>at 624, the written agreement in this case suggests <em>&amp; future </em>intent to create a joint venture. That document provides that \u201cGeorgaklis and Nieboer <em>will be deeded property </em>in Nantucket; Massachusetts . . . , which property <em>is currently owned </em>by Dianne Churchill\u201d (emphasis supplied). This suggests that no joint venture existed between the three at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Additionally, considered in the light most favorable to MPIUA, the evidence leaves unresolved the intent to share in profits. In his deposition testimony, Nieboer stated, \u201cNo,\u201d in response to the question, \u201cAt any point, was the purpose of the joint venture to generate income for the three of you?\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Gurry, supra </em>at 623-624 (intent to share profits and losses is important component of joint venture).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Finally, \u201c[wjhen the issue of a party\u2019s intent constitutes the essential element of a cause of action or defense, the granting of summary judgment is disfavored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624. This is not a case where the \u201cnonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Peabody &amp; Arnold, LLP, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 46, 56 (2008), quoting from <em>Medina-Munoz </em>v. <em>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990). Instead, MPIUA has relied on documentary evidence, language from the written joint venture agreement, and Harrison\u2019s and Nieboer\u2019s deposition testimony to support its claim that no joint venture existed at the time of the fire. We conclude that summary judgment was improperly granted in Georgaklis\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing summary judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Harrison filed cross claims against Rocher, Nieboer, and Churchill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Although the name of the potential buyer on the offer to purchase is illegible, the potential buyer\u2019s address matches Georgaklis\u2019s business address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\">On the last page of the application for the building permit, a section entitled \u201cOwner or Lessee\u201d lists Churchill and Nieboer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Harrison stated in his deposition that Churchill was the owner of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In his deposition testimony, Georgaklis stated that this agreement memorialized an earlier verbal agreement that the three had made in 2003. He also stated that in order to facilitate financing, the three agreed that the transaction would be made solely in Churchill\u2019s name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The agreement provides, in part, that \u201cGeorgaklis and Nieboer will be deeded property in Nantucket; Massachusetts . . . , which property is currently owned by Dianne Churchill,\u201d and that \u201cGeorgaklis and Nieboer have each contributed fifty (50%) percent of the down payment in order to purchase the Property, and intend to set forth their understanding regarding maintenance, upkeep, expenses and profits from the said Property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">As the subrogee of Churchill, MPIUA is limited to the same rights of action as Churchill. See <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Baker, 299 </em>Mass. 158, 162 (1937). The parties agree that one joint venturer may not maintain an action against another joint venturer with respect to that joint venture. In addition, the complaint is one for negligent supervision, and there is no allegation of intentional misbehavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">While <em>Brunelle </em>was decided in the context of a motion for directed verdict, we note that for most purposes, that standard \u201cis identical to that applied to a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Farrakhan, </em>436 Mass. 94, 96 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\">We note that while the documentary evidence is consistent with Georgaklis\u2019s claim that the three agreed that the transaction would be solely in Churchill\u2019s name in order to facilitate financing, it is also consistent with MPIUA\u2019s claim that Churchill was the true owner of the property. In this procedural posture, we must view the evidence in MPIUA\u2019s favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">This case does not fall into the rare exception to that rule. See <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>W.E. Aubuchon Co., supra </em>at 630-631 (\u201cthe burden-carrying party may obtain a directed verdict\u201d only \u201cwhere the parties agree on all material facts and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom and disagree only as to the legal effect of the controlling principles, or where the defendant\u2019s own binding testimony precludes a verdict in his favor\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Nieboer also agreed that the property would not be \u201cable to generate more income than it puts out in expenses.\u201d He did state that if the property somehow did generate income, it would be used to offset expenses and the surplus split among them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
