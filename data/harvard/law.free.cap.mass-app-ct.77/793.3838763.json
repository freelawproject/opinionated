L. c. 93A claims against the defendant, Intelligroup, Inc. (Intelligroup). Indus and Intelligroup entered into a contractual agreement in 2003 (Agreement) generally calling for Indus to \u201cadvise and consult\u201d with Intelligroup about any potential sale of Intelligroup to any potential buyer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At all relevant times, Indus was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>not registered under the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act, G. L. c. 110A (Act), as a \u201cbroker-dealer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After Intelligroup sold one of its divisions to a buyer in April, 2003, and refused Indus\u2019s demands for certain payments Indus claimed to be due under the Agreement, this litigation ensued. Concluding that the Agreement on its face called for Indus to act as a broker-dealer within the meaning of the Act, the motion judge dismissed Indus\u2019s claims because, pursuant to G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7\u00a7 201(a) and <em>410(f),</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>its failure to register precluded it from \u201c[bjasing any suit on the contract.\u201d On appeal, Indus claims that its conduct and the parties\u2019 understanding compel the opposite conclusion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><em>Analysis. </em>On appeal, Indus contends that its claims were dismissed in error because (a) Indus was not in fact a broker or dealer under the Agreement, and (b) any ambiguity in the terms of the Agreement was not resolved consistent with the parties\u2019 expressed intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our review, we examine \u201cwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Intelligroup, as the moving party, bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating the absence of a triable issue and its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 17 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">A. <em>The Agreement. </em>Under the Act, it is \u201cunlawful for any person to transact business in this commonwealth as a broker-dealer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>or agent unless he is registered under this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 201(a). Failure to register accordingly constitutes a violation of the Act. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, \u201c[n]o person <em>who has made </em>or engaged in the performance of any contract in violation of any provision of [the Act] . . . may base any suit on the contract\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(f). The act of making the contract itself, irrespective of performance, can thus suffice to preclude suit brought on that instrument. <em>Ibid. </em>Hence, we look to the Agreement on which Indus bases its suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">\u201cThe interpretation of a contract presents a question of law for the court.\u201d <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 116 (1989), citing <em>Robert Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 755 (1973). We \u201cmust first examine the language of the contract by itself, independent of extrinsic evidence concerning the drafting history or the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Thermo Elemental, Inc., </em>451 Mass. 638, 648 (2008), citing <em>General Convention of the New Jerusalem in the U.S. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>449 Mass. 832, 835-836, 838 (2007). Extrinsic evidence may be considered \u201cin the construction of ambiguous contract language.\u201d <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., supra </em>at 116. However, \u201cambiguity is not created simply because a controversy exists between parties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to the other\u2019s.\u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lanco Scaffolding Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 729 (1999), quoting from <em>Jefferson Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 475 (1987). Rather, the question is whether \u201cthe phraseology can support [a] reasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and the obligations undertaken.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Fashion House, Inc. </em>v. <em>K Mart Corp., </em>892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The Agreement described in detail the various services that Indus was expected to perform, from \u201c[a]ssist[ing] [Intelligroup] ... in preparation of the appropriate documentation,\u201d to participating \u201cin all phases of the Transaction, including financial analysis, if requested.\u201d Indus was to \u201carrange and participate in the conduct of inspection visits\u201d with potential buyers, and to \u201cmake such introductions and perform such services as may be necessary\u201d to consummate the deal. Indus was also called upon to \u201c[a]dvise and assist in the analysis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>evaluation of potential buyers,\u201d and \u201cto develop a general negotiation strategy for accomplishing the Transaction.\u201d Indus does not contend that any provision of the Agreement is ambiguous, and we discern no such ambiguity. The duties imposed on Indus are both broad and, at the same time, quite specific. Because the unambiguous contract language does not \u201csupport [a] reasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and the obligations undertaken,\u201d we do not look beyond the four comers of the contract. <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lanco Scaffolding Co., supra, </em>quoting from <em>Fashion House, Inc. </em>v. <em>K Mart Corp., supra. </em>Thus, if the duties described in the Agreement constitute broker-dealer services, the Agreement is unenforceable. G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">B. <em>Broker-dealer services. </em>With certain exceptions, the Act defines a \u201cbroker-dealer\u201d as \u201cany person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 401(c), as amended by St. 2002, c. 74, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither the term nor its definition has been construed in an appellate decision in this Commonwealth. The Act itself, however, instructs that it is to be construed in a manner so as \u201cto coordinate the interpretation and administration of this chapter with the related federal regulation.\u201d G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 415, inserted by St. 1972, c. 694, \u00a7 1. The Act\u2019s definition of broker-dealer \u201cessentially repeats the definition [of \u2018broker\u2019] set forth in the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\u201d <em>Silvia </em>v. <em>Securities Div., </em>61 Mass.

The fact that the Agreement\u2019s \u201cproposed activities would result in [Indus] receiving transaction-based compensation\u201d weighs in favor of concluding that broker-dealer registration was required.

Lexis 359, at *2 (March 13, 2000) (broker-dealer registration required where entity \u201cbrings buyers and sellers of securities together for a fee\u201d). The Agreement also called for Indus to assist with \u201cpreparation of the appropriate documentation\u201d for potential purchasers, to \u201c[a]dvise and assist in the analysis and evaluation of potential buyers,\u201d or offers, and \u201cto develop a general negotiation strategy for accomplishing the Transaction.\u201d Further, pursuant to the Agreement, Indus would \u201c[p]articipate in the closing of the Transaction,\u201d and, if the transaction were successful, would be permitted to \u201cplace a \u2018tombstone\u2019 or other such announcement\u201d in various trade periodicals trumpeting its involvement in the deal in hopes of attracting new business. These provisions reflect Indus\u2019s obligation both to \u201cmake[] valuations as to the merits of the investment or give[] advice,\u201d and to become \u201cinvolved in the negotiations\u201d between parties to a potential securities transaction. <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>v. <em>Howard J. Hansen, supra </em>at *26. The fact that Indus would \u201cparticipate in negotiations\u201d which could lead to a sale of securities is further indication that the Agreement called for broker-dealer activities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dominion Resources, Inc., <em>supra </em>at *2. See Davenport Management, Inc., <em>supra </em>at *7 (being \u201cactively involved in securities transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>tions,\u201d such as \u201cby negotiating their terms, providing advice regarding their terms, or providing other assistance,\u201d requires registration); C&amp;W Portfolio Management, Inc., <em>supra </em>at *2 (registration required where entity \u201cacts as an intermediary until both principals to the transaction are in agreement\u201d). Compare Angel Capital Electronic Network, SEC No-Action Letter, 1996 SEC No-Act.

The Agreement\u2019s transaction-based compensation arrangement, coupled with its requirement that Indus be extensively involved in negotiations, would confer broker-dealer status even though the ultimate \u201cexchange of funds or securities [would be] arranged by the principals, and not [Indus].\u201d C&amp;W Portfolio Management Inc., <em>supra </em>at *2. Nor is this a situation where Indus was to \u201ctake an essentially passive role toward the interaction between [Intelligroup] and [a potential buyer], other than routing messages.\u201d BondGlobe, <em>supra </em>at *4 n.3, citing Charles Schwab &amp; Co., SEC No-Action Letter, 1996 SEC No-Act. Lexis 976 (November 27, 1996). In the Schwab letter, the SEC concluded that registration was not required where Internet service providers agreed \u201cto connect their subscribers\u201d to a securities brokerage firm \u201cfor a nominal, flat, per order fee.\u201d Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., <em>supra </em>at *1. As discussed, the Agreement plainly called for Indus to do far more than serve as a passive conduit between brokers and investors. The SEC \u201chas never extended the Schwab letter beyond that narrow context,\u201d and we decline to do so under the Massachusetts Act. Bondglobe, <em>supra </em>at *4 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Given the foregoing, we conclude that the Agreement called for activities that have long required broker-dealer registration under Federal law, from which we take guidance in construing the Act. The motion judge properly concluded that Indus\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>failure to register as a broker-dealer rendered the Agreement unenforceable. G.

Ct. App. 2009). \u201cBoth definitions use the term \u2018effecting\u2019 with respect to the sale of or transaction in a security on behalf of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734. In interpreting that term, the Colorado Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[t]he SEC has identified transaction-based compensation as indicative of whether one is a broker because such compensation is triggered by the \u2018effecting\u2019 of a sale.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>citing Herbruck, Adler &amp; Co., <em>supr; </em>1st Global, Inc., SEC No-Action Letter [2001 Transfer Binder] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) par. 78,119, at 77,799, 2001 SEC No-Act. Lexis 557 (May 7, 2001); Wirthlin, <em>supra. </em>The court also determined that \u201c[e]ffecting transactions in securities is shown by . . . participating in securities transactions \u2018at key points in the chain of distribution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>v. <em>National Executive Planners, Ltd., </em>503 F. Supp. 1066, 1073 (M.D.N.C. 1980). Because, as here, the defendant in <em>Black Diamond </em>received transaction-based compensation and \u201cfacilitated all aspects of the investment other than the formal acceptance of the subscription agreements,\u201d his failure to register constituted a violation of the Colorado Securities Act. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
