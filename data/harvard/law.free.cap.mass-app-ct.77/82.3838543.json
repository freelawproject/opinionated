L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L(a) (statute). Because we conclude that the judge erred as matter of law in construing the requirements of the statute, we reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). On February 20, 2008, Hyannis police Officer Eugene Desruisseaux was dispatched to the defendant\u2019s residence as a result of a report that the defendant was suicidal and was threatening to harm himself and others with a firearm. After speaking with the defendant, who acknowledged that he had made threats to kill himself, Officer Desruisseaux asked him if he had a firearm. The defendant replied affirmatively and told the officer that the gun was in a cooler located outside. Meanwhile, another officer found a \u201clittle Igloo cooler\u201d in the backyard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon opening the cooler, the officer found a locked box in which there was a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The box, which appears to be made for the firearm by the manufacturer, is composed of a plastic-type material and measures approximately ten-by-six inches.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The words \u201cClock \u2018safe action\u2019 pistol\u201d are written in raised letters across the front of the box. The box is designed with a small hole, which lines up with the firearm\u2019s trigger guard. Here, the box was found with a cable lock (\u201ca lock mechanism with a cable\u201d attached) threaded through the hole, thereby securing the firearm in the box as well as locking the box itself. There was no direct testimony as to how the police opened the box. The trial judge, however, found that the box and the lock were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>In order to prove the offense of improper storage of a firearm, the Commonwealth must demonstrate that the defendant failed to keep the firearm \u201csecured in a locked container\u201d or \u201cequipped with a tamper-resistant mechanical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>lock or other safety device.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, we are concerned only with the first method of storing a firearm. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory of culpability was that, even though the handgun was stored in a locked box, the box and the lock were inadequate, and, further, that the gun was not \u201csecureQ\u201d because anyone could walk away with the cooler in which the gun was hidden or with the locked box itself. The judge adopted the Commonwealth\u2019s latter theory, framing the issue as \u201cwhether the gun was maintained in a locked and secured location.\u201d The judge found the defendant guilty on the ground that, \u201calthough ... the gun was locked,\u201d it was not in a \u201csecured location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The defendant contends that he was not in violation of the statute because the statute permits the storage of a firearm in <em>\u201cany </em>place\u201d as long as it is \u201csecured in a locked container\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L(a). We agree. In a prior case concerning the improper storage of firearms, we interpreted the word \u201csecured\u201d as indicating that \u201cthe container must not merely be locked, but securely locked . . . [i.e.,] maintained in [a] locked container[] in a way that will deter all but the most persistent from gaining access.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parzick, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 846, 850 (2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, the judge\u2019s guilty finding was not based on any deficiency in the lock or the box. Rather, as we have noted, the finding was based on a failure to keep the box in a \u201csecured location.\u201d However, the fact that the defendant placed the securely locked box in a cooler is of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>consequence. The judge\u2019s implicit determination that the lock box adequately secured the firearm should have ended her inquiry; no more was required to determine that the defendant had satisfied the requirements of the statute. Although we acknowledge the safety concerns expressed by the Commonwealth, nonetheless, neither the statute nor our case law requires a gun owner who keeps a firearm \u201csecured in a locked container\u201d to also store that container in a secure <em>location. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s interpretation of the statute is simply too expansive. \u201c[W]e do not \u2018read into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, whether the omission came from inadvertence or of set purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Environmental Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999), quoting from <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914). Furthermore, to hold the defendant to a higher standard would violate the well-settled principle that \u201c[a] criminal statute must be \u2018sufficiently clear to give notice of the prohibited conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 58, 59 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>395 Mass. 302, 304 (1985). Applying the familiar rules of statutory construction, as well as our reasoning in <em>Parzick, </em>the statutory language at issue here requires only that a gun owner secure a firearm in a locked container such that \u201call but the most persistent [will be deterred] from gaining access.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parzick, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. at 850.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Should the Legislature choose to consider imposing stricter storage requirements, it is free to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Finding set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>Judgment for defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-14\">The defendant also challenged the statute on constitutional grounds, claiming that under the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>128 S. Ct. 2783 (2008), the statute violated his right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. After oral argument, we stayed the appeal pending the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Runyan, </em>456 Mass. 230 (2010), a case in which the constitutionality of the statute was squarely raised. On March 10, 2010, the Supreme Judicial Court issued its decision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>held that \u201cthe legal obligation safely to secure firearms in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L <em>(a), </em>is not unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237. As the decision in <em>Runyan </em>controls, there is no need for further discussion of the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Some details are taken from Officer Desruisseaux\u2019s police report, which was introduced in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The police also recovered three fully loaded magazines hidden in the hood of a jacket in the closet of the defendant\u2019s bedroom. On a desk in the same room, the police found twenty-five loose forty-caliber rounds of ammunition. The defendant was not charged with any offenses related to the ammunition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The box was introduced as an exhibit at trial, and we asked for it to be forwarded to us. Our description is based on our own observations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Section 131L(a) of G. L. c. 140, inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 47, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful to store or keep any firearm ... in any place unless such weapon is secured in a locked container or equipped with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock or other safety device, properly engaged so as to render such weapon inoperable by any person other than the owner . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b112-11\">In <em>Parzick, </em>the defendant had stored several rifles in his bedroom closet. Although the closet was not equipped with a lock, the defendant locked his bedroom door when he was not at home. The lock to the bedroom door, however, could be easily opened with a bobby pin and \u201cdid not prevent ready access by anyone other than the lawful owner.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parzick, supra </em>at 850. Thus, we concluded that, assuming the bedroom was a container, a trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat the room was not a securely locked container.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850-851.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">We observe as well that our conclusion is consistent with G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 123, inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 19, which requires firearms dealers to post a notice at each purchase counter stating, \u201cIT IS UNLAWFUL TO STORE OR KEEP A FIREARM, RIFLE, SHOTGUN OR MACHINE GUN IN ANY PLACE UNLESS THAT WEAPON IS EQUIPPED WITH A TAMPER-RESISTANT SAFETY DEVICE OR IS STORED OR KEPT IN A SECURELY LOCKED CONTAINER.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parzick, supra </em>at 849.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
