L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(\u00bf&gt;)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After hearing, a judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and seeking disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant. Trial was jury-waived before a different judge, who found the defendant guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">In this consolidated appeal from his conviction and from the trial judge\u2019s denial of his new trial motion, the defendant argues that (1) his motion to suppress evidence obtained by searches of his automobile and apartment was erroneously denied and there was no probable cause for his warrantless arrest; (2) the identity of the informant should have been disclosed; (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel; (4) the judge improperly questioned one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses; and (5) these errors cumulatively require reversal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the relevant facts from the judge\u2019s findings on the motion to suppress, supplementing them where appropriate by uncontroverted testimony from the suppression hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>449 Mass. 476, 477 (2007). We save for later discussion the facts pertinent to the issues arising at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">The defendant was suspected of selling drugs from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>residence at 116 Perkins Street, apartment 3, in Somerville. On September 1, 2005, Trooper Steven Racki secured a warrant to search that apartment, and he and Trooper Scott Holland took positions near the apartment in anticipation of executing the warrant. At approximately 2:30 p.m., the defendant and a female were observed leaving the apartment while carrying several bags. They entered an automobile and drove away. Trooper Fallon, who was in a marked State police cruiser, stopped the defendant\u2019s car about one and one-half blocks later. Trooper Holland positioned his unmarked vehicle behind Trooper Fallon\u2019s cruiser, and as Holland approached the car, the defendant was exiting at Fallon\u2019s direction and Fallon stated that he \u201csmelled weed in the car.\u201d Trooper Holland, an experienced narcotics officer trained in the identification of marijuana by sight and smell, walked to the driver\u2019s window and detected an odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the car\u2019s interior. Opening the door, he observed marijuana \u201croaches\u201d in the ashtray and, in the center console, a clear plastic bag containing marijuana. A further search of the car revealed a leather bag behind the driver\u2019s seat, in which were found clear plastic bags with a \u201cwhite rock powder\u201d that Trooper Holland believed to be cocaine. The defendant was transported to the police station for booking and the troopers returned to the apartment to execute the warrant, discovering narcotics, hypodermic needles, cash, personal papers, and other items.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>\u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, and conduct an independent review of the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>451 Mass. 370, 381 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">a. <em>The search of the defendant\u2019s apartment. </em>The defendant argues that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause. \u201cTo establish probable cause to search, the facts contained in an affidavit, and reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them, must be sufficient for the magistrate to conclude \u2018that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation, and that they reasonably may be expected to be located in the place to be searched at the time the search warrant issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>455 Mass. 147, 164-165 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>451 Mass. 59, 68 (2008). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The sufficiency of a search warrant application to establish probable cause is judged solely within the four comers of the affidavit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 813 (2009). In assessing the contribution of a confidential informant\u2019s tips to the probable cause analysis, we employ the familiar tests of the informant\u2019s veracity and basis of knowledge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 374-375 (1985). We briefly summarize pertinent facts as set forth in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In January, 2005, Trooper Racki spoke with a confidential informant he referred to by the pseudonym \u201cMary.\u201d She had provided information to police in the past that led to an arrest and seizure of drugs; most recently, three months prior to the affidavit. Mary stated that she knew of an individual named \u201cFreddy Velez\u201d who sold cocaine and marijuana. She provided a detailed physical description, offered his address and cellular telephone number, and stated that he sold drugs from his apartment and also made deliveries. Police investigation confirmed the defendant\u2019s name, description, residency at the given address, and use of the given telephone number. During the month preceding the defendant\u2019s arrest, Mary, under police supervision, made three controlled purchases of cocaine at the defendant\u2019s apartment. The third buy occurred within seventy-two hours of the application for the search warrant, which Trooper Racki submitted on the same day as the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We conclude that, in this case, Mary\u2019s veracity was established by the fact that she had previously given information which led to at least one arrest and seizure of contraband. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez-Baez, </em>410 Mass. 43, 46 (1991), and cases cited. Any weakness in her veracity, or in her basis of knowledge \u2014 if the latter was not fully established by her statements that the defendant had drugs in his apartment at a certain address and used a certain telephone number, and sold $50 quantities of cocaine in small glassine bags \u2014 was cured by the corroborative effect of the three controlled buys at that location. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>413 Mass. 823, 828-829 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The controlled buys in this case followed the familiar protocol recited in multiple cases. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desper, </em>419 Mass. 163, 168 (1994), and cases cited. The facts that the defendant\u2019s residence was located within a three-unit dwelling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and that the police did not observe which unit the informant entered, do not render the search warrant invalid. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>418 Mass. 86, 90 (1994) (\u201cpolice [are] not required to risk disclosure of their surveillance by accompanying the informant\u201d to an apartment within a multi-unit dwelling). Additionally, the seventy-two-hour delay between the third controlled buy and the application for the search warrant is not troubling in these circumstances because the other information in the affidavit, including the two other buys, established a continuing pattern of conduct in a fixed location over a comparatively longer time frame. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 590 (1999) (\u201cWhere conduct is shown to be continuing ... the passage of time becomes less important and staleness may be overcome\u201d). The descriptions of the three buys, which all occurred at the residence that was the target of the search warrant, as well as the information provided by Mary, furnished probable cause to issue the search warrant for the defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">b. <em>The stop and arrest of the defendant. </em>The defendant correctly asserts that the search warrant itself did not give the troopers authority to seize him one and one-half blocks from his apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charros, </em>443 Mass. 752, 764 (2005). However, at the time the car was stopped, the troopers were aware of the three controlled buys. Furthermore, they knew that these buys occurred during the month preceding the September 1, 2005, stop of the car, with the most recent within seventy-two hours of the stop. Accordingly, they had probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed a felony as proscribed by G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32E(b), </em>and thus both the initial stop and subsequent warrantless arrest were valid. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charros, </em>443 Mass. at 764-765 (controlled buy made under police supervision within past fifteen days provided a basis for arrest, independent of recently issued search warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">c. <em>The warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s car. </em>Although the troopers did not have a warrant to search the car, under \u201cthe automobile exception to the warrant requirement, the search of the [car] was justified as long as the [troopers] had probable cause to believe that there was contraband in the car.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garden, </em>451 Mass. 43, 47 (2008). At the motion hearing, Trooper Holland testified that he was trained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>identification of marijuana, including its appearance and odor, that he had smelled burnt marijuana in the past, and that when he approached the driver\u2019s window, he detected an odor of burnt marijuana.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This alone furnished probable cause to believe that there was marijuana in the car, and thus its search was justified.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 48 (\u201cthe odor of marijuana is sufficiently distinctive that it alone can supply probable cause to believe that marijuana is nearby\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In sum, the three controlled buys detailed in the affidavit supplied probable cause for the search warrant; the stop and arrest was supported by probable cause to believe the defendant had engaged in cocaine distribution; and the search of the car was proper under the automobile exception. Thus, the motion judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">2. <em>Confidential informant. </em>The defendant argues that the identity of the informant should have been disclosed. Here, Mary did not participate in any of the charged crimes and she was not present during the execution of the search warrant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>seizure of the items from the defendant\u2019s apartment, or the defendant\u2019s arrest. She acted only as a tipster, not as an active participant in the crimes charged, and thus disclosure of her identity was not required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 408 (1989) (government not required to disclose identity of informant who is mere tipster and not active participant in charged offense); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 335, 339 (1991) (disclosure not required when informant did not participate in crime charged, even though he had participated in controlled buy within seven days of application for search warrant); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 509(a) (2010). Additionally, the Commonwealth\u2019s privilege applies even if the defendant knows Mary\u2019s true identity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>449 Mass. 702, 711 (2007). In balancing the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the informant against the defendant\u2019s right to prepare his defense, disclosure was not required in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>406 Mass. 565, 570-572 (1990).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance. </em>The defendant argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based upon the relaxation, intentional or otherwise, of the adversary process. The record reflects that defense counsel in effect pursued a strategy of \u201cjury nullification\u201d (despite that this was a bench trial), conceded liability for some of the crimes charged, and used the trial in an extended effort to seek leniency in sentencing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Although we normally review claims of ineffective assistance under the familiar principles of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), the defendant seeks to bring his claim within dicta from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648 (1984), in which the United States Supreme Court identified three classes of ineffectiveness in which no showing of prejudice is required: a presumption of prejudice arises when there is (1) a \u201ccomplete denial of counsel ... at a critical stage of [the] trial\u201d; (2) \u201cif counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing\u201d; and (3) where, \u201calthough counsel is available to assist the accused during trial, the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 659-660. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977) (acknowledging there are some circumstances where a showing of prejudice is not required).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The Supreme Court has emphasized that the second category, which establishes prejudice per se when defense counsel fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversary testing, applies only when the attorney\u2019s failure to test the government\u2019s case is \u201ccomplete.\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 697 (2002). While Massachusetts has not had the opportunity to apply these principles to circumstances such as those presented here, courts in other jurisdictions have held that unauthorized concessions of guilt can constitute a lack of adversary testing within the meaning of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">We conclude that while some of defense counsel\u2019s remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>were improper, there was not a complete lack of adversary testing. Defense counsel competently argued, and preserved for our review, issues relating to the search of the defendant\u2019s apartment, his stop and arrest, and the search of his car. After the defendant\u2019s unsuccessful motions to suppress, the evidence against him was overwhelming and, against counsel\u2019s advice, he rejected a favorable plea deal. We note that conceding guilt to less serious offenses can be an appropriate litigation strategy, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durakowski, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 92, 93 (2003), and in these circumstances, we do not discern a complete abandonment of the adversary process. Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to a presumption of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Nevertheless, we still assess the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96. Here, the trial judge repeatedly recognized the proper scope of his role as fact finder, and he indicated that the attorney\u2019s behavior did not influence him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if the \u201cbehavior of counsel [fell] measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d the defendant has failed to demonstrate that he was deprived \u201cof an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\"><em>4. The judge\u2019s questioning. </em>During trial, the Commonwealth elicited testimony from Andrew Bogle, a former drug chemist with the State police crime laboratory, regarding the weight and identity of certain substances that were admitted in evidence. During the Commonwealth\u2019s direct examination, the judge questioned the witness. The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s questions, which span approximately four transcript pages, impermissibly aided the Commonwealth in meeting its burden of proof. We disagree. The judge\u2019s questions, which simply clarified the representative sampling procedure the chemist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>employed, were proper and did not alter the Commonwealth\u2019s burden. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>373 Mass. 412, 416 (1977) (\u201c[A] judge may properly question a witness, even where to do so may strengthen the Commonwealth\u2019s case, so long as the examination is not partisan in nature, biased, or a display of belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hassey, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 806, 810 (1996) (\u201c[A] trial judge may question witnesses to clarify the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">5. <em>Cumulative errors. </em>From what we have said above, it follows that we are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that his conviction should be reversed due to cumulative errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-12\">The grand jury also indicted the defendant on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C(a); three counts of possession of a class E drug with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32D(a); and possession of a hypodermic needle, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-13\">Prior to trial, the Commonwealth filed a notice of nolle prosequi on the charge of possession of a hypodermic needle. The judge found the defendant guilty on the marijuana charge, but that conviction was placed on file and is not before us. The judge found the defendant not guilty on the charges alleging possession of a class E drug with intent to distribute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Because a trained officer\u2019s detection of the smell of burnt marijuana permits a search of a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment under the automobile exception, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Garden, 451 Mass. 43, 48 (2008), we need not consider the apparent inconsistency as to when the marijuana roaches were actually discovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\">While the motion judge invoked the automobile exception based upon the probable cause supporting the defendant\u2019s arrest for drug distribution, he noted in dictum his view that police detection of the odor of marijuana also justified the search. In any event we are \u201cfree to affirm a ruling on grounds different from those relied on by the motion judge if the correct or preferred basis for affirmance is supported by the record and the findings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng </em>Joe, 425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997). We also need not consider the applicability of the doctrine of search incident to lawful arrest. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 351 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The defendant argues that the smell of burnt marijuana was a pretext to justify the search of the car. We defer to the motion judge\u2019s assessment of credibility of testimony, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Druce, </em>453 Mass. 686, 699 (2009), and in this case, he explicitly found that Trooper Holland detected an odor of burnt marijuana. The defendant offered nothing that would undermine that finding. Additionally, the lack of a certificate of analysis of the marijuana roaches does not support the defendant\u2019s fabrication argument when the roaches were never introduced in evidence at any proceeding, and the defendant was not charged with possession of the roaches. Production of the roaches is not required when there is credible police testimony concerning the smell of marijuana. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kitchings, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 595-596 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that Mary\u2019s identity was subject to automatic discovery lacks merit. The Commonwealth did not intend to present testimony from Mary at trial (and indeed did not do so) and thus any \u201cpromises, rewards or inducements\u201d made to her did not need to be disclosed. Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(l)(A)(ix), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\">For example, defense counsel informed the court that after the defendant was arrested, \u201che went to work in the financial district earning a tremendous salary, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars legitimately, not on the streets, and that is a tremendous turn around.\u201d Defense counsel further argued that the defendant \u201chas had a remarkable turnaround in his life\u201d and that \u201c[vjery few criminal defendants can come before the Court and say, guess what I turned my life around, yes I made a mistake, yes this is what I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In closing argument, defense counsel continued this strategy. He asked the court, \u201c[wjhy should [the defendant] be held accountable for something that is so widely used,\u201d and suggested that based on the evidence, \u201cthis is just a, \u2018Low level operation.\u2019 \u201d Perhaps most troublesome is his argument that the defendant does not \u201cneed to sit in a cell for five years to be told that what he did in 2005 was wrong; he already knows that, Judge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">This third category can arise, for example, when \u201cdesignation of counsel [is] either so indefinite or so close upon the trial as to amount to a denial of effective and substantial aid in that regard.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 660, quoting from <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 53 (1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swanson, </em>943 F.2d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir. 1991) (defense counsel\u2019s concession in closing that there was no reasonable doubt about disputed factual issues \u201ccompelled] an application of the <em>Cronic </em>exception\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Dodson, </em>331 Ill.
