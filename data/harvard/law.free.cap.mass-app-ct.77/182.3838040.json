L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), included mandatory attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings four times per week. While on probation, Natick police placed him in protective custody after encountering him on the street in a state of intoxication, attempting to push one bicycle while straddling another. The defendant smelled of, and admitted consuming, alcohol. Subsequently, after a hearing, a District Court judge modified the defendant\u2019s conditions of probation, at a probation officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>request, to include \u201cno alcohol\u201d and random alcohol screenings. The defendant appeals, arguing that there was neither a violation of the defendant\u2019s probation, nor any other \u201cmaterial change in circumstances\u201d warranting the modification. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Quincy Div. of Dist. Ct. Dept., </em>395 Mass. 815, 820 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Reasonably understood, the condition of attendance at AA meetings was not, as the defendant in essence argues here, merely a formal requirement to be in a specific place four times per week. This was a condition designed to ensure that the defendant\u2019s alcohol problems were addressed and to maintain his sobriety. Indeed, the conditions of probation <em>must </em>be reasonably related to recognized probationary goals. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 857, 859 (2009). The defendant\u2019s being taken into protective custody by the police for extreme intoxication in public was a material change in circumstances within the meaning of case law sufficient to support the motion judge\u2019s modification of his probation to include the reasonable conditions that he remain alcohol free and submit to random alcohol testing. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Quincy Div. of Dist. Ct. Dept., </em>395 Mass. at 819-820; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 839, 843 (2007). The order entered on April 14, 2009, modifying the conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
