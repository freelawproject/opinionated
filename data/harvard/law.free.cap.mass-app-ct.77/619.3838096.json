On the same date, the Juvenile Court judge issued a temporary order, transferring custody of the children to the department and ordering that a temporary custody hearing be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">On October 11, 2007, a temporary custody, i.e., seventy-two hours, hearing was held, at which the mother testified. The father, who had outstanding warrants, was not present and did not make any subsequent appearances before the Juvenile Court. After the hearing, the judge ordered that custody of the children remain with the department. On April 14, 2008, the goal was changed to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">On October 8, 2008, a trial was held on the department\u2019s petition. The mother was in the courthouse but refused to enter the courtroom to testify. The judge admitted fifteen exhibits in evidence, and then asked if the parties\u2019 attorneys were \u201cinterested at all in proceeding with offers of proof or not.\u201d The parties\u2019 attorneys stated that they did not object to that procedure. At the time of the judge\u2019s question, the department\u2019s social worker and adoption worker were present and could have testified as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The contents of the offers of proof were as follows. The department first recited the testimony that it expected from Vanessa Jacques, a social worker for the department, who was assigned to the case in December of 2007. Jacques\u2019s expected testimony covered ten pages of the transcript. It included details of the mother\u2019s missed visits with the children, her frequent hospitalizations for substance abuse and mental health problems, positive urine screens for barbiturates, and failure to comply with the department\u2019s service plans. The department also offered the expected testimony of Ann Marie Bramo, a department adoption worker assigned to the case. Her expected testimony was relatively short and was mostly in regard to the background and qualifications of the adopted family.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">At the conclusion of the department\u2019s offers of proof, the mother\u2019s attorney told the judge that she had several issues with Jacques\u2019s expected testimony. She stated that cross-examination of Jacques would have shown that it was not several visits with her children that the mother failed to confirm, but only one visit on October 22, 2007. Her cross-examination would have revealed that there were a total of thirty visits that actually took place, that at each and every visit the mother played games with the children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>and that the visits never had to be terminated for any reason. On cross-examination, Jacques would have testified that one of the children asked for his mother constantly. As to the domestic violence issue, the cross-examination would have shown that the mother indeed obtained a restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The mother\u2019s attorney then detailed the mother\u2019s expected direct testimony. The mother would have testified that she loved her children dearly and that she had completed detoxification programs at the various hospitals at which she had been a patient. The bond between her and one child was especially strong. After the mother\u2019s attorney rested, the department\u2019s attorney offered in rebuttal the expected testimony of Jacques, which it claimed would have contradicted some of the mother\u2019s expected testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">After both parties rested, the judge, without hearing arguments of counsel, issued decrees that adjudicated the children in need of care and protection, permanently committed them to the custody of the department, approved the plan of adoption for both children, and terminated the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights. On February 10, 2009, the judge filed a memorandum of decision. It contained 151 findings of fact, of which twenty were specifically based on the offers of proof by the attorneys. In addition, two of the judge\u2019s findings relied on testimony by department witnesses at the temporary custody hearing. The mother filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the mother objects to the judge\u2019s reliance on offers of proof by the attorneys, rather than testimonial evidence, especially where the evidence was disputed. She claims that the decree dispensing with her consent to adoption accordingly should be vacated because the judge\u2019s findings of fact lack a proper evidentiary foundation to warrant the entry of the decree. The mother also objects to the use of the testimony of the department witnesses given at the temporary custody hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The department argues that we should not consider the issue raised by the mother on appeal because it was not raised in the trial court and no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d are present that would allow us to hear the mother\u2019s appeal. <em>Adoption of Gregory, </em>434 Mass. 117, 129 (2001), quoting from <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 712 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>We recognize that there have been cases concerned with petitions to dispense with consent to adoption that included joint stipulations regarding uncontested facts, see <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. at 706, 708 n.4, and on offers of proof as to the proposed cross-examinations of a witness, see <em>Adoption of Sean, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 266 (1994). In those decisions, however, oral evidence was also offered as to disputed facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have not, however, been informed of any proceeding to dispense with the consent of the parents to adoption in which a judge, where facts were disputed, heard the matter entirely on documents and offers of proof from counsel with no oral testimony. Given the uniqueness of the procedure employed by the judge here, coupled with the fact that due process governs these matters (which we discuss later), we hold that exceptional circumstances are present. We are therefore prompted to review the issue raised by the mother on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\u201cParents have a fundamental liberty interest in maintaining custody of their children, which is protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Erin, </em>443 Mass. 567, 570 (2005). \u201cState action terminating a parent-child relationship must comport with due process, including notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and <em>in a meaningful manner\" </em>(emphasis added). <em>Adoption of Zev, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>905, 905 (2009). \u201c[Fundamental fairness, as well as due process concerns, requires that a parent be given the opportunity effectively to rebut adverse allegations concerning his or her child-rearing capabilities.\u201d <em>Brantley </em>v. <em>Hampden Div. of the Probate and Family Ct. Dept., </em>457 Mass. 172, 185 (2010), quoting from <em>Duro </em>v. <em>Duro, </em>392 Mass. 574, 580 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The resolution of disputed facts required the fact finder to determine questions of witness credibility. \u201c[T]estimony in the presence of the [fact finder], \u2018permits the [fact finder] ... to observe the demeanor of the witness in making his statement, thus aiding the [fact finder] in assessing [the witness\u2019s] credibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, </em>402 Mass. 534, 548 (1988), quoting from <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158 (1970). \u201cEvaluating a witness\u2019s credibility is one of the most difficult tasks facing a trier of fact . . . [and] [p]ersonal observation of a witness aids immeasurably this process.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Thus, in light of the disputed facts in this case, considerations of due process and fundamental fairness required that the judge make findings based on her personal assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. The procedure suggested by the judge and agreed to by the lawyers deprived the mother of the opportunity to be heard on the department\u2019s petition in a meaningful manner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There must be a new trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\n<em>Decrees vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The father did not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We are aware of a care and protection proceeding where \u201c[c]ounsel for the parties, by stipulation, submitted the case to the judge on the basis of the investigator\u2019s report, certain medical and clinical records, and other documents. No oral evidence was offered.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 145 (1987). The court in that matter ruled that no exceptional circumstances were present for the court to review for the first time on appeal a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Nevertheless, we are not bound by the result achieved in a care and protection proceeding because in such a proceeding \u201cthe State does not endeavor to terminate all parental rights, and irrevocably dissolve the [biological] family as it does in a proceeding to dispense with consent to adoption.\u201d Ireland, Juvenile Law \u00a7 3.6 (2006). Further, in contrast to this matter, there did not appear to be any disputed facts on the main issue in <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We note that the procedure adopted in this matter \u201cdid not violate the constitutional right to confront witnesses (see art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution) because this is a civil matter.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 141 (1996). See <em>Adoption of Arthur, </em>34 Mass.

The \u201cparties\u201d in this matter were the department and the mother. The department did agree to the procedure, but there is nothing in the record that demonstrates that the mother agreed to the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">We are aware that the mother\u2019s attorney agreed to the procedure. In her appeal, the mother does not explicitly claim that her lawyer was constitutionally ineffective for agreeing to the procedure. We hold, however, that in these circumstances the mother\u2019s lawyer (and the department\u2019s attorney) should not have agreed to the procedure where there were disputed facts. We hasten to add that the lawyers for parties who participated in this appeal were not the trial lawyers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Because we have ordered a new trial, we do not need to discuss the mother\u2019s claim that the judge erred in considering testimony given at the temporary custody hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
