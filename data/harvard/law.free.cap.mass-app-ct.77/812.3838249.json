The guarantors\u2019 appeal seeks review of (1) their liability, generally, as they claim an oral forbearance agreement precluded collection on this debt until the forbearance date had passed, (2) the commercial reasonableness of WFBC\u2019s disposition of the collateral under Article 9 of the Massachusetts Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), G. L. c. 106,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) whether WFBC complied with reasonable notice requirements prior to foreclosure, (4) the amount of the damages, and (5) the dismissal of their counterclaims. So much of the judgment as implicitly determined that the sale of the collateral was commercially reasonable is reversed and that issue is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and in all other respects the judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\"><em>Background. </em>The summary judgment record, which includes an informative memorandum from the motion judge, shows the following. Environamics Corporation (Environamics) was a New Hampshire corporation that manufactured pump and rotary equipment used in the processing industry. Environamics borrowed $3 million dollars from WFBC on May 7, 2004, and executed a credit and security agreement, a revolving note, and various documents granting WFBC a number of security interests in Environamics and its assets as collateral (collectively, loan documents).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The security interests included essentially, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>entirety of the operating assets of Environamics as well as its patents, copyrights, and inventory. As further surety on this loan, personal guaranties (guaranties) were offered on May 7, 2004, by the two principal shareholders and officers, Rockwood and Marchosky.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In July of 2005, Environamics failed to make payments of the loan. In lieu of assessing the default rate and permitting additional events of default from occurring, WFBC agreed, in a number of written agreements, to defer payments on the loan. These agreements spanned from July, 2005, through February, 2006, and imposed a fee for the accommodation and forbearance. According to the agreements, these extensions were permitted to facilitate the guarantors\u2019 attempts to capitalize Environamics with outside investment or find suitable buyers for the assets or company itself. Over this period, the guarantors sought a number of potential buyers, but were unable to finalize a deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In late February of 2007, WFBC hired Gordon Brothers Group to put together a book on Environamics to assist in the sale and marketing of the company as an entity. Gordon Brothers Group created a teaser mailing and distributed it to approximately 130 companies targeted for potential interest. Six companies responded and requested additional information, which was anticipated to be contained in the book. Receipt of the book was predicated upon the execution of nondisclosure agreements. This book presented a bid date in late June of 2007. According to the affidavit of WFBC\u2019s vice president, Vincent R. D\u2019Alessandro, submitted in support of summary judgment, failure of the guarantors to provide requested information in order to complete the book prompted WFBC\u2019s filing of the lawsuit at issue in this appeal. The electronic mail message (email) entered as evidence at the summary judgment hearing contains objections that Rockwood voiced at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>time of the creation of the book. But other emails produced by Rockwood appear to show he was cooperative in response to questions posed by Gordon Brothers Group after a draft of the book was created. A version of the book as of April 9, 2007, was entered as evidence at the summary judgment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Prior to the lawsuit and during the difficulties regarding the book, through counsel, WFBC sent the defendants a demand letter demanding possession of the business premises. On May 2, 2007, in order to collect on the guarantees, WFBC filed the lawsuit. After a Superior Court judge ruled in WFBC\u2019s favor on its motion for a preliminary injunction, granting the right to all of Environamics\u2019 collateral subject to WFBC\u2019s security interests, WFBC proceeded with plans to either sell Environamics or liquidate its assets. In June of 2007, Environamics filed for bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In or about September of 2007, the bankruptcy court awarded WFBC control of Environamics. An order converting Environamics\u2019s bankruptcy case from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code was entered on October 31, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">WFBC proceeded to field offers for the assets individually, without Gordon Brothers Group\u2019s involvement. According to the affidavit submitted by WFBC\u2019s vice president, WFBC took various steps in contacting the six entities that had expressed interest prior to the lawsuit, as well as another company that had heard about the sale from the bankruptcy court. By offering to sell the patents and inventory separately, WFBC was able to negotiate and secure an offer of $479,000 from Dickow Pump Company, which sought to purchase the two assets together. On January 9, 2008, the guarantors were notified by WFBC\u2019s counsel of the pending sale through a letter sent via Federal Express and via email. This letter stated that the sale would take place on January 21, 2008. The terms of the loan documents contain the validity of telefacsimile service, but are silent as to email communication. Also, provisions of the loan documents state that notice, if given ten calendar days before the intended date of disposition, will be deemed commercially reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>The guarantors, in a last moment attempt to prevent the sale, corresponded with WFBC\u2019s vice president concerning their ability to redeem the loan. They reiterated that they had $1.3 million available. This figure of $1.3 million had been discussed by the parties in regards to a previous correspondence, where such a figure would allay the sale of Environamics\u2019s assets. However, this figure would not redeem the loan amount, which had grown to over $3.95 million in October of 2007, and exceeded $4 million in January, 2008. WFBC disregarded these declarations because the guarantors could not provide documentation of the immediate availability of the funds. The sale of the assets ultimately did occur on January 21, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\"><em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). Here, WFBC was the moving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">I. <em>Liability of the defendants. </em>The guarantors argue there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they are in breach of the loan documents. They contend that a genuine issue of material fact exists because WFBC had orally agreed to forbear enforcement of the guaranties at the time when the lawsuit was filed on May 2, 2007. The guarantors argue that the parties entered into oral agreements extending the forbearance to a period after the foreclosure date, or, in the alternative, that the Gordon Brothers Group\u2019s documents set a forbearance date subsequent to the foreclosure, on which the guarantors relied. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">\u201cWhen the words of the guaranty \u2018are clear they alone determine the meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Federal Financial Co. </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>431 Mass. 814, 817 (2000) (citation omitted). See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>254 Mass. 118, 125 (1925) (a \u201cguaranty is to be construed strictly\u201d). The \u201cliability of the guarantor . . . can be terminated only in accordance with the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Federal Financial Co. </em>v. <em>Savage, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Merchants Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>296 Mass. 243, 252 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Here, each guaranty required any modifications be in writing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>In recognition of these provisions, the parties after default executed a number of written loan deferral agreements to modify the terms of the guaranties as to deferring payments. These agreements and all the promises thereunder expired March 3, 2006, more than a year prior to the date of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">As to the oral modification of a contract, \u201ca provision that an agreement may not be amended orally but only by a written instrument does not necessarily bar oral modification of the contract.\u201d <em>Cambridgeport Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Boersner, </em>413 Mass. 432, 439 (1992). But in order to support the existence of an oral modification, the parol evidence must be sufficiently weighted and of competent probity to present a material issue for trial; that is, the parol evidence must be of sufficient strength to present an ambiguity between the actual conduct of the parties and the contract. See <em>Eastern Holding Corp. </em>v. <em>Congress Financial Corp. (New England), </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 737, 742 n.5 (2009) (ambiguity cannot be predicated solely on statements in affidavits). See also <em>Cambridgeport Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Boersner, supra </em>at 439 n.10 (\u201cThe evidence of a subsequent oral modification must be of sufficient force to overcome the presumption that the integrated and complete agreement, which requires written consent to modification, expresses the intent of the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The speculative assertions as to the issue of oral modification made by Rockwood in various affidavits do not provide the specificity necessary to establish a dispute of material fact. See <em>Community Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 554 (1976). The assertions find no reflection in the clear terms of the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>written loan deferral agreements duly executed by the parties and in some cases expressly contradict provisions of these agreements. We note that Rockwood also asserts that additional documents memorialized the 2007 forbearance agreements, but were stored at a facility seized by WFBC and were unavailable to him and Marchosky. Rockwood, however, provides no detail about those asserted forbearance agreements, no information as to who signed them, or the extent of their coverage. We reject the attempt to create an ambiguity by disregarding the affidavit as to the issue of liability. See <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 721 n.12 (1994) (disregarding self-serving affidavit on review of summary judgment); <em>Eastern Holding Corp. </em>v. <em>Congress Financial Corp. (New England), supra </em>at 741-742 (\u201cBecause there is no contract language supporting [the defendant\u2019s] interpretation of the seventh loan, we discern no ambiguity that would permit the introduction of extrinsic evidence as to the parties\u2019 intentions in this regard\u201d). See also <em>Billings </em>v. <em>GTFM, LLC, </em>449 Mass. 281, 294-295 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Next, the guarantors assert that a voicemail left by WFBC\u2019s vice president constitutes evidence of the oral forbearance agreement that was in place. That voicemail is ostensibly from April 13, 2007, and on appeal the guarantors provided this court with a transcription of its contents. The portion emphasized by the guarantors states, \u201cthere\u2019s still many weeks as far as your other avenues.\u201d That statement was made in relation to the guarantors other avenues of disposition. It does not create a genuine issue of material fact because it does not refer to the existence of a forbearance agreement and would not, in any event, be sufficient to contravene the writing requirement of the loan documents. Indeed, the statement more likely refers to the right of the guarantors to redeem the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Finally, the guarantors assert that the Gordon Brothers Group\u2019s sale date and other aspects of the marketing create a genuine issue of material fact as to forbearance under an oral \u201cgoing concern\u201d agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the only evidence supporting the existence of a going concern agreement involving forbear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>anee is Rockwood\u2019s affidavit dated May 22, 2008.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The underlying security agreement and guaranties are clear in their terms and require more than conjecture for modification. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Because the affidavit fails to comprise anything beyond Rockwood\u2019s own belief of the existence of an oral going concern agreement, we disregard it as a basis for ambiguity. See <em>Eastern Holding Corp. </em>v. <em>Congress Financial Corp. (New England), </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 742 n.5. See also <em>The General Convention of the New Jerusalem in the U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>449 Mass. 832, 836 (2007) (\u201cextrinsic evidence cannot be used to contradict or change the written terms, but only to remove or to explain the existing uncertainty or ambiguity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In sum, there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning forbearance on the foreclosure date. No forbearance agreement was in effect on the date of foreclosure and WFBC is entitled to summary judgment as to the guarantors\u2019 liability for the debts of Environamics.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">II. <em>Commercial reasonableness. </em>The guarantors also claim that a material issue of fact was raised concerning whether WFBC\u2019s sale of the collateral was commercially reasonable as required by the UCC. We agree that the judge should have denied WFBC\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">After default, a secured party, such as WFBC, is entitled to dispose of the collateral. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-610(\u00ab).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Sales of collateral not held within a \u201crecognized market\u201d (such as a stock market or other market fixing a value to a commodity) must conform \u201cwith reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-627(6)(l) &amp; (3). See Official Comment 2 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-627, 3 U.L.A. 568 (Master ed. 2002). A debtor\u2019s right to a commercially reasonable disposition cannot be waived. <em>Shawmut Worcester County Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>398 Mass. 273, 279 (1986). It has also been noted that \u201cgenerally, where a creditor is proceeding against a debtor for a deficiency after disposing of collateral, courts place the burden of proving commercial reasonableness on the creditor.\u201d <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 266, 270 (1993), citing Federal cases. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-626(a)(2). Furthermore, Massachusetts case law does \u201cunderscore the lack of precision in the meaning of the term \u2018commercially reasonable\u2019; its determination depends on the particular facts in each case.\u201d <em>Poti Holding Co. </em>v. <em>Piggott, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 275, 277 (1983). Thus, to obtain summary judgment as to that issue, WFBC would have had to provide incontrovertible evidence that the sale was commercially reasonable as an essential element of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">\u201cEvery aspect of a disposition of collateral, including the method, manner, time, place, and other terms, must be commercially reasonable.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-610(A). See <em>Shawmut Worcester County Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 276. See generally 4 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 34-11, 464-466 (6th ed. 2010) (aside from price, several other factors are relevant to the determination of whether a transaction is commercially unreasonable: [1] whether the timing between the sale and notice was too short or too long; [2] whether the seller advertised the sale; [3] whether the sale was in a proper place; [4] whether the seller permitted necessary inspections by prospective bidders; [5] whether the seller performed necessary repairs; and [6] whether the seller held the sale at the same time and location as advertised). In this regard, adjudication of the \u201c \u2018commercially reasonable\u2019 standard . . . produces inquiry into the competence and aggressiveness of the marketing effort.\u201d <em>Pemstein </em>v. <em>Stimpson, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 283, 291 (1994). See <em>Nadler </em>v. <em>BayBank Merrimack Valley, N.A., </em>733 F.2d 182, 184 (1st Cir. 1984) (requiring debtor to \u201cpoint to specific deficiencies in the conduct of the sale that render it commercially unreasonable\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See also Annot., <em>What is \u201cCommercially Reasonable\u201d Disposition of Collateral Required by UCC \u00a7 9-504(3), 1 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>A.L.R.4th 308 \u00a7 14, 387-392 (1981 &amp; Supp. 2010) (discussing cases where \u201cfamiliarity of a secured party selling repossessed collateral, or of one selling such collateral for a secured party, with the type of property involved, or with the market for such property, has been recognized ... as an important factor to be considered, along with other circumstances of the particular case, in determining whether ... all aspects of a disposition of repossessed collateral be commercially reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Here, the evidence raises an issue as to whether WFBC pursued commercially reasonable avenues for marketing and selling Environamics\u2019s assets. WFBC supported its summary judgment motion with a single affidavit that was silent as to the background of its vice president, and affiant, who conducted the sale. The guarantors, however, presented documents created by experts that establish material factual issues regarding the methods of marketing prior to disposition. Specifically, the documents submitted by the guarantors highlighted the deficiencies in the evidence supporting WFBC\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to that issue. Those documents suggest that there were numerous other avenues consistent with industry practice that could have achieved the goal of liquidating the assets to achieve more reasonable value. Furthermore, the guarantors presented an affidavit from an Environamics employee describing how the assets could be sold separately for more money within the pump industry, as opposed to as mere scrap metal. Moreover, the guarantors supported their over-all argument against commercial reasonableness with evidence that described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the pump market generally, established the value of the assets, and estimated costs associated with liquidation. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The totality of the evidence placed the issue of commercial reasonableness squarely into contention. See <em>Shawmut Worcester County Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>398 Mass. at 282 (\u201cBased on [guarantors\u2019] affidavits, a genuine issue of material fact appears to exist\u201d respecting the commercial reasonableness of secured party\u2019s sale of collateral). In short, there is a dispute as to whether WFBC\u2019s methods of sale were commercially reasonable \u201camong dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-627(Z?)(3). See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-627. WFBC\u2019s affidavit, viewed in light of the guarantor\u2019s proffer, failed to meet its burden of proving the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the commercial reasonableness of the disposition, and therefore summary judgment in favor of WFBC as to that issue was not properly granted and that issue needs to be resolved in further proceedings on remand.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>HI. <em>Notice of intended disposition. </em>The guarantors also argue that the disposition was not commercially reasonable because WFBC failed to give reasonable notice of the disposition of the collateral.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They contend that the notice they were provided was not timely, they were not afforded a sufficient time prior to the disposition, and that a bank holiday on the date of disposition diminished duration of the notice and impaired their ability to redeem the collateral. Although raised by the guarantors, the motion judge did not address that issue. We do not need to resolve it either. Even assuming arguendo that there exists a genuine issue of fact as to the timeliness of the notice,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>guarantors fail to point to any evidence in the record that they could pay the redemption amount, regardless of its amount.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-625(Z?) (damages calculated by the \u201camount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this article\u201d). For that reason, summary judgment as to the notice issue was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">IV. <em>Damages. </em>The guarantors, through assertions of Rock-wood in his affidavits, claim that the motion judge neglected to consider the money in accounts seized by WFBC in September of 2007, in its award of damages. However, the record does not support the existence of any accounts, let alone the amounts, that were seized by WFBC. All citations in the guarantors\u2019 brief are to the affidavits of Rockwood or to documents immaterial to the issue. Without additional reference to some source beyond personal opinion, we can only consider these averments as being predicated upon information and belief. Such proof fails at summary judgment. See <em>Shapiro Equip. Corp. </em>v. <em>Morris &amp; Son Constr. Corp., </em>369 Mass. 968, 968 (1976) (\u201cAll affidavits or portions thereof made on information and belief, as opposed to personal knowledge, are to be disregarded in considering a motion for summary judgment\u201d). We discern no issue of material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>fact as to the amount of damages and summary judgment as to this issue was properly granted. Thus, we affirm the judgment as to the amounts owed under the guaranties with the caveat that this figure could be reduced by a finding that the sale was not commercially reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">V. <em>Counterclaims. </em>The guarantors raised a number of counterclaims which were denied at summary judgment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> They contend that these counterclaims arose under the going concern agreement. As we discussed previously, at pages 818-819, <em>supra, </em>the record does not support the guarantors\u2019 assertion that a cognizable \u201cgoing concern\u201d agreement was ever in existence. Under the terms of the guaranties, all counterclaims were waived.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because there was no other cognizable agreement, \u201cwe agree with the judge\u2019s determination that under the terms of their guaranties, the [guarantors] waived their rights to assert these counterclaims.\u201d <em>Cambridgeport Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Boersner, </em>413 Mass. at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>So much of the judgment as implicitly determined that the sale of the collateral was commercially reasonable is reversed, and that issue is remanded to Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\">A revised version of Article 9 of the UCC was adopted by the Legislature, St. 2001, c. 26, \u00a7 39, effective July 1, 2002, and replaces an earlier version of that statute.

Section 8.2 of article VII of the credit and security agreement provides: \u201cNo amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom or any release of a Security Interest shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Lender, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.\u201d Also notable is the fact that the guaranties contain additional prohibitions against the guarantors\u2019 liability being \u201caffected or impaired\u201d in the event of extensions, modifications, and accommodations of the borrower.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">According to the guarantors, \u201c[T]he Going Concern Agreement was a separate oral contract entered into in or around February, 2007. The parties agreed therein to jointly sell Environamics as a going concern, with Gordon Brothers acting as financial advisor. The proceeds from the sale were to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>split, with Wells Fargo receiving 75% and Rockwood and Marchosky receiving 25% after the payment of the first $1.2 million dollars to Wells Fargo. The Going Concern Agreement also included the release of Rockwood and Marchosky from the Guaranties. The parties further agreed that all legal actions and payments would be forborne by Wells Fargo until at least June 30, 2007, which was the due date for submission of offers by potential buyers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b847-14\">This affidavit describes aspects of Gordon Brothers Group\u2019s marketing of Environamics that included a proposed date of June 29, 2007, for all final bids.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b847-15\">General Laws c. 106, \u00a7 9-610(a), states: \u201cAfter default, a secured party may sell... or otherwise dispose of any or all of the collateral in its present condition or following any commercially reasonable preparation or processing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">As a facial matter, obtaining a lower price than what could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>obtained under other circumstances does not make the sale commercially unreasonable. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-627(a). \u201cThe fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A comment to G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-610, cautions that \u201ca low price suggests that a court should scrutinize carefully all aspects of a disposition to ensure that each aspect was commercially reasonable.\u201d Official Comment 10 to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-610, 3 U.L.A. 518 (Master ed. 2002). See 4 White &amp; Summers, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 34-11, 461, 464 (while not dispositive, price is the \u201ceminence grise\u201d in many transactions, and although price is a term of sale, a low price, in combination with noncomplying resale procedures under the UCC, is paradigmatic of a commercially unreasonable sale).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\">If, on remand, it is determined by the fact finder that WFBC disposed of Environamics\u2019s collateral in a commercially unreasonable way, then the guarantors will be entitled to the rebuttable presumption that the fair market value of the collateral was $3 million. A finding of commercial unreasonableness resulting from specific deficiencies in the disposition gives the guarantor the benefit of the rebuttable presumption that \u201cthe fair value of the collateral and the amount of the debt were the same.\u201d <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 271. See 1 Brown, The Law of Debtors and Creditors \u00a7 7:113, 7-169 (June, 2010) (under the rebuttable presumption doctrine, \u201cthe failure of the creditor to follow the restrictions of Pre-revision Part 5 of Article 9, such as the failure to conduct a commercially reasonable resale, creates a rebuttable presumption that the value that should have been received by the disposition of the collateral equaled the balance due on the outstanding debt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Thus, if there is a finding of commercial unreasonableness, in order to prevail, WFBC will have to rebut the presumption by proving that a commercially reasonable sale would have obtained a lower amount than the loan amount. See 4 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 34-14, at 502. We note that WFBC was not under an obligation to retrieve the whole debt from the sale of the collateral, see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 <em>9-627(a), </em>but a determination that the sale was not commercially reasonable may alter the damages to which WFBC is entitled. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-625(c)(l) (\u201ca person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor, or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection (b) for its loss\u201d); G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 <em>9-625(b) </em>(\u201ca person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this article\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b851-5\">A debtor may redeem his collateral before the secured party has disposed of it. G. L. c. 106 \u00a7 9-623(c)(2). To afford the possibility of redemption, \u201ca secured party that disposes of collateral under Section 9-610 shall send to the [debtors] a reasonable authenticated notification of disposition\u201d as a predicate to the actual disposition. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-611(6). A so-called \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision, G. L. c. 106 \u00a7 9-612(6), provides: \u201ca notification of disposition sent after default and 10 days or more before the earliest time of disposition set forth in the notification is sent within a reasonable time before the disposition.\u201d G. L. c. 106 \u00a7 9-612(6). \u201cThe 10-day notice period ... is intended to be a \u2018safe harbor\u2019 and not a minimum requirement.\u201d Official Comment 3 to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-612, 3 U.L.A. 524 (Master ed. 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b851-6\">WFBC provided notice of the sale on January 9, 2008, via email and Federal Express. This notice further described the intended sale as taking place January 21, 2008. This date of notice places the notification within the safe-harbor provision, in terms of its delivery. The earliest date when receipt of the notice was established is Saturday, January 19, 2008, when the guarantors informed WFBC by email on that day that they have $1.3 million and wish to buy back all the assets of Environamics. This response email by the guarantors states that they attempted to contact WFBC\u2019s vice president at his office that day and would try the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The safe harbor rule applies here, irrespective of the guarantors\u2019 objection as to the bank holiday. The guarantors were given twelve days from the moment of electronic notice to the morning of the sale date. The guarantors claim that this ten-day period should not include the bank holiday (January 21, 2008, Martin Luther King Day) because the redemption amount could not be wired on the bank holiday. Even assuming arguendo that they are correct in this regard, the record would appear to demonstrate that WFBC provided notification of at least ten days, which falls within the safe harbor. We note that the guarantors provide no authority that disposition on a bank holiday is precluded. Nothing in the guarantors\u2019 email describes wiring funds, or any other activities requiring the services of a financial institution. The responses of the guarantors to the notice are devoid of references to the bank holiday or requests for additional time. Even at the last moment, WFBC was willing to forestall the sale should the guarantors provide proof of the funds being available. The guarantors did not and WFBC proceeded. We find that notice was</p>\n<p id=\"Akr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>timely provided in the safe harbor period, and that the guarantors were given reasonable notice of the sale and their right to redeem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The guarantors, in response to the notice of disposition, contend that $1.3 million was available to redeem the collateral and that their notice to WFBC of the availability of the funds should have prevented the sale. In order to redeem the collateral, the guarantors would have had to provide funds sufficient to \u201c(1) fulfill[] ... all obligations secured by the collateral; and [pay] (2) the reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees described in Section 9-615(a)(l).\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-623(6). For the invocation of the right of redemption, a party \u201cmust tender fulfillment of all obligations secured, plus certain expenses.\u201d Official Comment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-623, 3 U.L.A. 555 (Master ed. 2002). But more importantly, \u201c[a] tender of fulfillment obviously means more than a new promise to perform an existing promise. It requires payment in full of all monetary obligations then due . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The $1.3 million dollar figure was not the redemption amount, but was a figure previously stated by WFBC in a letter dated October 23, 2007, as a payoff amount. This letter actually describes the total recovery amount on October 27, 2007, as being $3.95 million; by 2008 this number would have increased. As has been noted, when challenged by WFBC, the guarantors were unable to provide proof of ability to tender the $1.3 million, and WFBC disregarded the claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The guarantors\u2019 counterclaims included: breach of contract, unjust enrichment, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of implied covenant of good faith, fraudulent misrepresentation, bad faith, slander and defamation, breach of duty of care, fraud, negligence, and coercion and duress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Paragraph numbered eight in each of the guaranties provides in part that the guarantor \u201cwaives any and all defenses, claims, setoffs and discharges\u201d of Environamics or any other obligor; \u201cwill not assert, plead or enforce against [WFBC] any defense of waiver, release, discharge or disallowance in bankruptcy, . . . fraud, . . . illegality or unenforceability\u201d available to Environamics or any other obligor; and \u201cwill not assert, plead or enforce against [WFBC] any claim, defense, or setoff available to the [guarantor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
